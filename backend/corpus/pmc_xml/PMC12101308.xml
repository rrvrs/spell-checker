Introduction</title><p>Epimorphic appendage regrowth is characterized by the formation of blastemas, regenerative structures made up of proliferating cells that drive the regrowth of replacement tissues [<xref rid="B1-jdb-13-00015" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Epimorphic regeneration is widespread among anamniotes. For example, all known urodele species are capable of fully regenerating both limbs and tails [<xref rid="B2-jdb-13-00015" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In contrast, blastema-based regeneration is rarer and more limited among amniotes [<xref rid="B3-jdb-13-00015" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-jdb-13-00015" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-jdb-13-00015" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Furthermore, amniote blastemas tend to exhibit limited differentiation capacities and fidelities compared to those of anamniotes [<xref rid="B6-jdb-13-00015" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. For example, mouse digit tip blastema differentiation is limited to regenerated bone [<xref rid="B3-jdb-13-00015" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Interestingly, lizards are distinguished as the only amniotes, and closest relatives of mammals, capable of epimorphic regeneration involving tissue types originating from all three germ layers [<xref rid="B7-jdb-13-00015" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Therefore, lizards represent informative model organisms toward bridging gaps in blastema formation and differentiation potentials among amniotes, including humans.</p><p>Structurally, tail blastemas of lizards like the green anole (<italic toggle="yes">Anolis carolinensis</italic>) consist of collagen type III (<italic toggle="yes">col3a1<sup>+</sup></italic>) fibroblastic connective tissue cell (FCTC) populations enclosed in specialized keratin-5 (<italic toggle="yes">krt5<sup>+</sup></italic>) wound epidermis (WE) [<xref rid="B7-jdb-13-00015" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. These structures develop in a coordinated, interdependent manner. For example, disruption of either FCTC proliferation or WE formation prevents blastema development and leads to fibrosis [<xref rid="B8-jdb-13-00015" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Major milestones during <italic toggle="yes">A. carolinensis</italic> blastema development can be grouped into three phases based on specific characteristics exhibited by either FCTC or WE compartments. In original tails, the epidermis is associated with large, organized scales and homeostatic FCTCs line periosteum, perichondrium, dermis, and other connective tissues. Upon injury or amputation, damaged tail tissues trigger immune responses that peak around day 7 (D7). The first major regenerative phase is the inflammation phase, characterized by tail stump histolysis in which cathepsin-K (<italic toggle="yes">ctsk<sup>+</sup></italic>) osteoclasts and other phagocytic cells enter injury sites and eliminate dead tissue and debris [<xref rid="B7-jdb-13-00015" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Wound closure also occurs in this phase, generating <italic toggle="yes">krt5<sup>+</sup></italic> WE that forms under scabs [<xref rid="B7-jdb-13-00015" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The blastema phase occurs at day 14 (D14) and is designated by the formation of masses of stem-like mesenchymal cells. <italic toggle="yes">A. carolinensis</italic> blastema cells are derived from <italic toggle="yes">col3a1<sup>+</sup></italic> fibroblasts, which eventually differentiate into most of the mesenchyme-derived tissue populations within regenerated tails [<xref rid="B7-jdb-13-00015" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The last phase involves terminal regeneration and occurs at day 28 (D28) with reconstitution of most of the tail tissues. <italic toggle="yes">A. carolinensis</italic> tail regrowth is characterized as imperfect due to differences in some regenerated tissue types compared to originals. For example, skin neogenesis is disorganized in regenerated tails with smaller, irregular scales that lack chromatophores. Furthermore, segmented ossified vertebrae of original tails are replaced with unsegmented cartilage tubes [<xref rid="B9-jdb-13-00015" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-jdb-13-00015" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Blastema FCTCs are derived from resting interstitial fibroblasts liberated through histolysis of stump tissues 0&#x02013;7 days post amputation (DPA). Histolysis is supported by phagocyte populations, particularly <italic toggle="yes">ctsk</italic><sup>+</sup> osteoclasts, which invade amputated tail stumps. Indeed, phagocytic cell populations have previously been shown to be vital to the regenerative process in lizards and other species capable of epimorphic regeneration [<xref rid="B7-jdb-13-00015" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-jdb-13-00015" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B11-jdb-13-00015" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-jdb-13-00015" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-jdb-13-00015" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Untargeted depletion of phagocytic cells via clodronate liposomes has been shown to abrogate histolysis and prevent blastema and normal WE formation [<xref rid="B8-jdb-13-00015" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Following phagocyte depletion, the same FCTC populations that would contribute to blastemas formed scars instead [<xref rid="B8-jdb-13-00015" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Taken together, these studies suggested that osteoclasts and other phagocytes contribute pro-regenerative and anti-fibrotic signals independent of histolytic activities.</p><p>Studies involving untargeted phagocyte depletion via clodronate liposomes are unsuitable for testing the specific roles of osteoclasts in epimorphic regeneration. Zoledronic acid (ZA) is an anti-osteoporosis medication that belongs to a class of drugs known as bisphosphonates [<xref rid="B14-jdb-13-00015" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In mammals, bisphosphonates inhibit bone loss and remodeling by encouraging osteoclast apoptosis [<xref rid="B14-jdb-13-00015" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. ZA has been shown to decrease osteoclast activity, prevent bone resorption, and significantly reduce blastema size in the axolotl salamander [<xref rid="B15-jdb-13-00015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Currently, the roles of osteoclasts in stimulating blastema and WE formation in lizards have not been studied.</p><p>To investigate the role of lizard osteoclasts in establishing a pro-regenerative niche for <italic toggle="yes">col3a1<sup>+</sup></italic> blastema fibroblasts and <italic toggle="yes">krt5<sup>+</sup></italic> WE cells, we employed probe sequencing technology to isolate and profile cell populations over time in the presence and absence of osteoclast activity [<xref rid="B16-jdb-13-00015" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Hybridization chain reaction fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was used to label and isolate <italic toggle="yes">col3a1<sup>+</sup></italic> fibroblasts and <italic toggle="yes">krt5<sup>+</sup></italic> epidermal cells to perform bulk RNA-sequencing. With this technology, we show that osteoclasts promote a pro-regenerative, anti-fibrotic program in blastema fibroblasts.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-jdb-13-00015"><title>2.

By D28, tails of ZA-treated lizards exhibited substantial growth inhibition and uncleared distal vertebrae, indicating the interference of vertebral ablations from osteoclast inhibition. Compared to controls, the tails of ZA-treated lizards exhibited cleft outgrowths protruding from tail stumps around distal vertebral remnants and severely diminished regenerated tail lengths [<xref rid="jdb-13-00015-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>C,E].

HCR Probe-Based Cell Labeling Allows for Targeted Isolation of Specific Lizard Tail Cell Populations</title><p>To better understand how specific cell populations contribute to tail regeneration, various isolation techniques were attempted. Current methods of lizard transgenesis do not yet support fluorescence reporter gene insertion [<xref rid="B18-jdb-13-00015" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Combined with the lack of monoclonal antibodies validated for reactivity with lizard protein epitopes, these technical challenges have historically hindered isolation of specific lizard cell populations. Recently, researchers have shown that ligation of fluorescent hybridization chain reaction (HCR) probes to specific mRNA transcripts within cells allows for fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) of specific cell populations [<xref rid="B16-jdb-13-00015" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Since HCR probes are specifically designed to target any mRNA transcript regardless of species, these probes represent a preferred alternative to antibody-based methods for use in non-traditional organisms. Here, we also showed that HCR probe-based isolation of lizard cells was also compatible with downstream applications such as PCR and bulk RNA-seq analysis. In validation experiments, lizard fibroblasts were sorted based on expression of collagen type I (<italic toggle="yes">col1a1</italic>) and osteopontin (<italic toggle="yes">spp1</italic>), which were chosen based on their high expression levels in both original and regenerated lizard tail tissues [<xref rid="B7-jdb-13-00015" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Original lizard tails were digested into single-cell suspensions, labeled with DAPI and cy5-HCR probes targeting either <italic toggle="yes">col1a1</italic> or <italic toggle="yes">spp1</italic>, and analyzed by flow cytometry [<xref rid="jdb-13-00015-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>A]. DAPI labeling allowed for the selection of cells and exclusion of cell debris, and cells stained with DAPI only (DAPI control) provided gating for cy5-HCR probe-treated samples [<xref rid="jdb-13-00015-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>A]. RNA was isolated from cells belonging to each of the three labeling conditions: (1) DAPI control, (2) positive cy5-HCR label, and (3) negative cy5-HCR label. Finally, RNA was analyzed by PCR using primers targeting known markers of lizard tail cell populations [<xref rid="B7-jdb-13-00015" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. For example, because lizard erythrocytes are nucleated and often resistant to red blood cell lysis techniques, contamination with erythrocytes has confounded previous attempts at transcriptomic profiling of lizard tail tissues. Thus, we were eager to test the abilities of <italic toggle="yes">col1a1</italic>- and <italic toggle="yes">spp1</italic>-targeted HCR probes to exclude erythrocytes, and we included conditions utilizing primes to hemoglobin-D (<italic toggle="yes">hbD</italic>).

Specifically, both positively selected HCR-labeled fibroblast populations exhibited higher expression for their respective fibroblast markers compared to negative populations and unsorted DAPI controls, suggesting true enrichments of fibroblast populations. HCR-isolated fibroblast populations also exhibited lower expression of erythrocyte and immune cell markers <italic toggle="yes">hbD</italic> or <italic toggle="yes">ifi30</italic> compared to negative populations and unsorted cells.

Proliferation of both cell populations persists through D28, when tail tissues are fully differentiated. Conversely, when osteoclast activity is inhibited by ZA treatment, both blastema and WE fail to form. We hypothesize that osteoclast inhibition leads to dysregulated fibroblast signaling characterized by reduced proliferative capabilities and impaired expression of pro-regenerative ECM.

Discussion</title><p>As amniotes, lizards are the closest relative to mammals capable of appendage regeneration and represent informative model organisms for studying the divergent healing responses between lizards and mammals. Little information is available concerning the molecular mechanisms driving epimorphic regeneration in lizards compared to urodele amphibians. Similarly, roles that specific phagocytic cell types contribute to blastema formation and subsequent regeneration remain uninvestigated. The specific osteoclast inhibitor ZA afforded opportunities for targeted investigations into the roles of osteoclast activity in regulating lizard tail regeneration. We showed that inhibition of osteoclast activity led to impaired distal vertebral ablation and shedding and subsequent dysregulation of lizard tail regrowth. Furthermore, we validated probe sequencing as an effective technique for examining transcriptomes of specific cell populations while establishing baseline gene expression profiles for blastema fibroblast populations during regeneration.</p><p>Though previous reports have identified <italic toggle="yes">col3a1<sup>+</sup></italic> fibroblasts populations as the primary contributor of blastema formation, the proliferative potentials of these cells during critical stages of the regenerative process have remained unstudied [<xref rid="B7-jdb-13-00015" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].

Histological analyses also confirmed that lizard blastema fibroblasts exhibited similar lineage restrictions to those reported during salamander limb regeneration and were excluded from generating new muscle or nervous tissue [<xref rid="B7-jdb-13-00015" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B26-jdb-13-00015" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>We also investigated the proliferative potential of <italic toggle="yes">krt5<sup>+</sup></italic> epidermal cells during WE formation.

Future work will further explore crosstalk between fibroblasts and epidermal cells during lizard tail regrowth.</p><p>ZA treatment was used to investigate the role of osteoclast activity during lizard tail regeneration, and we describe several negative effects of osteoclast inhibition on regeneration. Treatment with ZA prevented blastema formation, as well as severely stunted lizard tail regrowth. Interestingly, osteoblast inhibition caused dysregulation in both fibroblast and epidermal compartments. ZA treatment caused reductions in blastema fibroblast and WE cell proliferation, leading to smaller blastemas and thinner WE. Furthermore, ZA treatment affected proliferation within specific regions of regenerating lizard tails, suggesting spatial dependencies of osteoclast signaling. For example, ZA treatment caused reductions in proliferative <italic toggle="yes">krt5</italic><sup>+</sup> epidermal cells within the deepest WE layers in contact with blastema fibroblasts [<xref rid="jdb-13-00015-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>]. In urodele and Xenopus tail blastema models, nervous tissue from spinal cords connects with WE to generate signaling centers that stimulate migration of regeneration-competent cells to blastemas [<xref rid="B29-jdb-13-00015" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B30-jdb-13-00015" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Something similar might be happening in regenerating lizard tails, in which WE maturation and thickening are inhibited due to loss of osteoclast activity, resulting in the disappearance of signaling centers, diminished proliferative capacities, and failures to regenerate.</p><p>Comparing gene expression profiles of <italic toggle="yes">col3a1<sup>+</sup></italic> blastema fibroblasts isolated from amputated tails of ZA-treated versus control lizards provided additional insights into the roles of osteoclast activity in supporting blastema formation and regeneration. Specifically, we showed that osteoclast signaling promoted a pro-regenerative phenotype among tail fibroblasts, marked by the expression of anabolic ECM genes such as <italic toggle="yes">col9a2</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">col11a2</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">col2a1</italic>. Osteoclast inhibition caused these same fibroblast populations to shift toward a fibrotic myofibroblast phenotype marked by catabolic genes such as <italic toggle="yes">mmp9</italic>. Taken together, we hypothesize that lizard osteoclasts also work to create an environment that favors fibroblast proliferation and regenerative matrix deposition over myofibroblast differentiation and scar deposition.</p><p>Probe sequencing technology has previously been used in other non-traditional organisms to circumvent the need for traditional antibody or genetic labeling techniques [<xref rid="B16-jdb-13-00015" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Here, we validate the technique for use in <italic toggle="yes">A. carolinensis</italic> lizards to isolate and compare fibroblast populations over the time course of tail regrowth and in the presence and absence of osteoclast activity. Probe-based isolation of fibroblast populations was achieved using a commercially available HCR platform. Lizard fibroblast enrichment via HCR probes was validated via PCR, and probe sequencing of HCR-sorted fibroblasts confirmed previously reported expressional trajectories during tail regrowth [<xref rid="B7-jdb-13-00015" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. This study also utilized probe sequencing to profile the effects of osteoclast inhibition on fibroblast fate determination between blastema fibroblasts versus myofibroblasts. Probe sequencing will be utilized in future investigations into specific molecular interactions among osteoclasts, blastema fibroblasts, and WE cells.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclaimer/Publisher&#x02019;s Note:</bold> The statements, opinions and data contained in all publications are solely those of the individual author(s) and contributor(s) and not of MDPI and/or the editor(s).
