This disease tends to cause symmetric inflammatory responses in small joints, with patients often experiencing joint stiffness (morning stiffness) upon waking, accompanied by redness, swelling, and severe pain.In the early stages, these types of discomforts are commonly observed in the proximal interphalangeal joints. Over time, however, the affected areas may gradually extend to other major joints, including the wrists, feet, knees, and even hips [<xref rid="pone.0323372.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. If the progression of RA is not effectively controlled, it will inevitably lead to severe joint dysfunction and even deformity, significantly limiting the&#x000a0;patient's&#x000a0;ability to perform daily activities [<xref rid="pone.0323372.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In extreme cases, the disease may invade vital organs such as the heart and lungs, further exacerbating the deterioration of the&#x000a0;patient's&#x000a0;health, potentially rendering them completely unable to work and incapable of independent living [<xref rid="pone.0323372.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Recent epidemiological studies have revealed a concerning trend: from 1990 to 2017, the global age&#x02013;standardized incidence rate of RA increased significantly by 8.2%.In China, this severe health challenge is equally prominent, with the number of RA patients exceeding 5 million. The male&#x02013;to&#x02013;female prevalence ratio is as high as 1:4, indicating that women are more vulnerable to RA and bear a disproportionately heavier disease burden compared to men [<xref rid="pone.0323372.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323372.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. RA not only poses a severe threat to the physical and mental health of individual patients but also imposes a substantial economic burden on their families and the broader socioeconomic system.The high cost of treatment, long&#x02013;term care requirements, and reduced income due to limited work capacity collectively create a complex and extensive economic burden [<xref rid="pone.0323372.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323372.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Consequently, RA has emerged as a pressing public health issue that demands heightened attention from all sectors of society and the implementation of effective measures.To address this challenge, we must increase research funding, raise public awareness, and optimize diagnostic and treatment strategies to offer patients a brighter future.</p><p>With the intensification of population aging, shifts in lifestyle, widening cognitive disparities, and rapid advancements in healthcare, the incidence trends and disease burden of RA in China and globally are expected to exhibit significant regional differences [<xref rid="pone.0323372.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323372.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Despite the rapid advancements in global medical technology over recent decades, which have significantly reduced disability rates and alleviated disease burdens, the overall burden of RA remains severe and cannot be overlooked due to the uneven distribution of medical resources worldwide and relatively weak public health awareness [<xref rid="pone.0323372.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. As the world's largest developing country, China has made significant progress in the medical field, yet there remains a gap in healthcare standards compared to developed countries.Notably, the lack of public awareness and emphasis on early prevention and standardized treatment of RA presents numerous challenges and difficulties for its diagnosis and treatment in China [<xref rid="pone.0323372.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Therefore, closely monitoring and tracking the temporal trends in the burden of RA has become an essential prerequisite for formulating effective public health strategies.</p><p>The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) database is an indispensable tool for evaluating disease trends globally, as well as at national and regional levels. It provides us with comprehensive and reliable epidemiological data and analytical methods [<xref rid="pone.0323372.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Leveraging the valuable resource of the GBD database, we can access a diverse set of metrics for measuring disease burden, encompassing dimensions such as incidence, prevalence, mortality, and DALYs. This enables comprehensive and in&#x02013;depth assessments of disease burden trends at global and country&#x02013;specific or regional levels, providing policymakers in the public health sector with invaluable perspectives and data support [<xref rid="pone.0323372.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Building on this foundation, this study leverages the robust capabilities of the GBD database to meticulously extract detailed data on RA in China and globally from 1990 to 2021, including but not limited to incidence, prevalence, mortality, DALYs, as well as key demographic information such as gender and age distribution.Through a series of systematic and in&#x02013;depth analyses, this study aims to uncover significant differences between China and the global context in terms of RA across temporal, age, and gender dimensions, while exploring its developmental trends and evolution.These findings not only contribute to a more comprehensive and profound understanding of the intrinsic characteristics of this complex disease but also provide a solid foundation and guidance for formulating evidence&#x02013;based public health policies and implementing effective RA control measures.By accurately capturing the trends of RA, future efforts can more effectively allocate medical resources and optimize prevention strategies, ultimately reducing the global burden of RA and improving patients&#x02019; quality of life and well&#x02013;being.</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>Data and methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Data sources</title><p>The data for this study were sourced from the GBD 2021 database, meticulously developed by the renowned Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington.IHME employs a series of standardized and highly comparable methods to conduct comprehensive, systematic, and scientific evaluations of the burden of over 300 diseases and injuries across 204 countries and territories worldwide.In this process, the center also incorporates more than 80 risk factors closely related to disease burden, thoroughly integrating and meticulously organizing their attributed impacts on disease burden, thereby ensuring data comprehensiveness and accuracy [<xref rid="pone.0323372.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In this study, we employed two standardized tools widely used in the field of global disease burden research&#x02014;Disability Model&#x02013;Mixed Effects Regression DisMod&#x02013;MR2.1 and the Cause of Death Ensemble Model (CODEm) to perform estimations.DisMod&#x02013;MR2.1, an advanced Bayesian meta&#x02013;regression disease modeling tool, excels in integrating fragmented and heterogeneous epidemiological data on non&#x02013;fatal diseases and injuries. By comprehensively evaluating data on incidence, prevalence, mortality, and age&#x02013;standardized DALYs, it significantly enhances the consistency among epidemiological parameters, ensuring precision and reliability in data estimation [<xref rid="pone.0323372.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. CODEm is a highly integrated analytical tool designed for in&#x02013;depth analysis of cause&#x02013;of&#x02013;death data. It seamlessly integrates a variety of modeling strategies to accurately analyze ratios or cause fractions and rigorously tests out&#x02013;of&#x02013;sample predictive validity, carefully selecting the most optimal covariates to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the analysis results [<xref rid="pone.0323372.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323372.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. This study utilized the online query platform (<ext-link xlink:href="http://ghdx" ext-link-type="uri">http://ghdx</ext-link>. healthdata.org/gbd-results-tool/) to meticulously select and process GBD 2021 data. During the query, we set the location to &#x0201c;China, Global,&#x0201d; the cause to &#x0201c;Rheumatoid Arthritis,&#x0201d; and the time span to &#x0201c;1990&#x02013;2021,&#x0201d; with age groups divided into 5&#x02013;year intervals, ranging from &#x0201c;15&#x02013;19 years&#x0201d; to &#x0201c;&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;95 years.&#x0201d; Subsequently, we precisely extracted authoritative data on the incidence, mortality, prevalence, and DALYs of RA from 1990 to 2021 from the GBD database. Given the public availability of the GBD 2021 data, this study was exempted from requiring additional approval from the institutional ethics committee. Throughout the research process, we adhered strictly to the Guidelines for Accurate and Transparent Health Assessment Reporting to ensure the study's scientific rigor and credibility.</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>This study utilized GBD 2021 data to focus on the incidence, prevalence, mortality, DALYs, and corresponding annual standardized metrics for RA in China and globally, including age&#x02013;standardized incidence rate(ASIR), age&#x02013;standardized prevalence rate(ASPR), age&#x02013;standardized rates of mortality(ASMR), and age&#x02013;standardized DALY rate(ASDR). Additionally, crude rates for incidence (CIR), prevalence (CPR), mortality (CMR), and DALYs across different age groups were used to comprehensively depict the disease burden of RA and its trends in China and globally.

On this basis, we conducted a comparative analysis of the distribution characteristics of ASIR, ASPR, ASMR, and ASDR among RA patients across different age groups and genders in China and globally from 1990 to 2021. Additionally, using the Joinpoint Regression Program 5.1.0 software developed by the U.S. National Cancer Institute, we investigated the trends in standardized rates of RA burden indicators in China and globally from 1990 to 2021. Using a log&#x02013;linear regression model, we precisely calculated the average annual percent change (AAPC) and its 95% confidence intervals (CIs) [<xref rid="pone.0323372.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. If the lower limit of the AAPC 95% CI exceeds 0, it indicates an upward trend in the metric. If the upper limit of the AAPC 95% CI is below 0, it indicates a downward trend. If the 95% CI range includes 0, the trend change is not statistically significant. The significance level was set at &#x003b1;&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.05 [<xref rid="pone.0323372.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323372.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].

The results indicated that both China and global ASIR and ASPR showed a continuous upward trend with significant growth, while China&#x02019;s ASMR and ASDR exhibited considerable fluctuations but an overall declining trend. In contrast, global ASMR and ASDR remained relatively stable or showed a slight decline. Additionally, RA prevalence, incidence, mortality, and DALYs, as well as their age&#x02013;standardized rates, were consistently higher in females compared to males. From an age perspective, RA cases and incidence were predominantly concentrated in middle&#x02013;aged and elderly populations, with higher mortality rates observed among older adults. These findings suggest that RA prevention and management remain a significant challenge both in China and globally.</p><p>From 1990 to 2021, the growth rate of RA prevalence in China was significantly higher than the global level. During this period, China's ASPR increased by approximately 17%, compared to a global increase of about 14.44%. In terms of incidence, China's ASIR grew by 18.2%, while the global ASIR increased by 13.14%. This trend aligns with findings from a global RA burden analysis [<xref rid="pone.0323372.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. This difference may be attributed to changes in population structure, accelerated aging, and increased public awareness of RA. As the most populous developing country in the world, China faces a rapidly aging population, which may partially explain the faster increase in RA prevalence [<xref rid="pone.0323372.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Moreover, modern lifestyles, including sedentary behavior, dietary changes, and reduced physical activity, have also increased the risk of developing RA. Particularly, with the accelerated urbanization in China, a large rural population has migrated to cities, and the resulting new lifestyles have, to some extent, impacted health and contributed to the growing burden of chronic diseases [<xref rid="pone.0323372.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323372.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Additionally, with the improvement of public health awareness, more individuals are actively seeking early diagnosis and treatment, which may have led to the identification of more RA cases, thereby contributing to the observed increase in incidence rates [<xref rid="pone.0323372.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Over the past three decades, advancements in RA treatment have significantly reduced the risk of mortality and long&#x02013;term disability among patients. The widespread use of novel antirheumatic drugs and immunosuppressants, including traditional medications and biologics, has effectively reduced joint inflammation and damage, enabling early disease control, slowing disease progression, and subsequently lowering RA&#x02013;related mortality and long&#x02013;term disability [<xref rid="pone.0323372.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323372.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], which is consistent with the findings of this study.The results indicate that although the number of RA&#x02013;related deaths has increased in China and globally, the age&#x02013;standardized ASMR has shown an overall declining trend. From 1990 to 2021, the ASMR and ASDR in China and globally decreased by 22.8% and 26.23%, respectively, while the reductions in ASDR were more modest, with decreases of 0.4% and 1.46%, respectively. Meanwhile, this trend can be attributed to the emphasis on public health and the widespread dissemination of health knowledge in both China and globally. The improvement in public health awareness has encouraged individuals to prioritize early disease screening and timely medical consultation, thereby enhancing early diagnosis and treatment coverage and ultimately reducing RA&#x02013;related mortality and disability rates [<xref rid="pone.0323372.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Therefore, the author believes that the increase in RA prevalence in China and globally is primarily driven by population aging, changes in lifestyle, and improved health awareness. In the future, efforts should be made to further strengthen early screening and diagnosis of RA, particularly in communities and rural areas with relatively limited medical resources, to ensure that more patients receive timely diagnosis and treatment during the early stages of the disease. Additionally, education on promoting healthy lifestyles should be intensified, guiding residents toward healthier habits, including a balanced diet, increased physical activity, and reduced sedentary behavior. Furthermore, governments and healthcare institutions need to enhance the promotion and accessibility of new medications, ensuring that patients can afford and access effective treatments. These interventions are expected to further reduce RA&#x02013;related mortality and disability rates, thereby alleviating the social and economic burden of the disease.However, a more detailed such as genetic, hormonal, environmental, population aging, lifestyle, and health awareness factors to the patient burden of RA should be conducted in-depth research.This understanding will enable the development of more targeted and effective strategies for prevention and management, addressing both individual and public health needs. In the future the complexity of these interactions necessitates a robust research agenda, leveraging advanced epidemiological methods and interdisciplinary collaboration to translate findings into clinical practice.</p><p>This study demonstrates that the incidence, prevalence, mortality, and DALYs of RA significantly increase with age, showing distinct age&#x02013;related characteristics. In 1990, the age group with the highest incidence and prevalence of RA in China was 35&#x02013;39 years old; by 2021, this peak shifted to the 50&#x02013;54 and 54&#x02013;59 age groups. This trend shift reflects the rapid socioeconomic development, continuous medical advancements, and increased life expectancy in China since the 1990s. However, with increased economic pressures and work burdens, younger generations have lower fertility rates, leading to a rising proportion of elderly individuals and a growing concentration of chronic disease burdens, such as RA, in middle&#x02013;aged and elderly populations [<xref rid="pone.0323372.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Meanwhile, the immune system function in middle&#x02013;aged and elderly individuals gradually declines, accompanied by hormonal changes and the accumulation of environmental factors, reducing their resistance to chronic diseases and increasing the risk of RA incidence and prevalence [<xref rid="pone.0323372.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0323372.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In contrast, the global peak of RA incidence and prevalence was concentrated in the 60&#x02013;64 age group in 1990, but by 2021, it had shifted to the 50&#x02013;59 age group. This difference may be attributed to variations in healthcare conditions, lifestyles, and the pace of population aging across different countries and regions. Developed countries, with more abundant medical resources and wider availability of early RA screening and treatment measures, may enable earlier diagnosis, resulting in a younger age of onset.RA can cause joint dysfunction and pain, limiting many patients&#x02019;mobility and their ability to perform basic activities such as walking, dressing, and household chores, thereby significantly reducing their quality of life. Moreover, the progression of RA is closely associated with high mortality rates and DALYs. Furthermore, RA significantly increases the risk of cardiovascular complications [<xref rid="pone.0323372.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The systemic inflammatory response triggered by RA may impair normal cardiovascular function, leading to endothelial damage and lipid metabolism abnormalities, which in turn raise the likelihood of cardiovascular events such as heart attacks and strokes, further exacerbating the health burden on patients [<xref rid="pone.0323372.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323372.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In summary, with the intensification of global aging, the burden of RA is rising both in China and globally. This highlights the need for increased attention to the health of aging populations. Future efforts should focus on improving disease management for this demographic by optimizing personalized treatment strategies and developing comprehensive management plans tailored to the multimorbidity characteristics of elderly patients, including interventions such as pharmacological therapy, physical therapy, and psychological support.Simultaneously, efforts should be made to strengthen the prevention and management of RA&#x02013;related complications, particularly the monitoring and intervention of cardiovascular disease risks. Healthcare resources should be directed toward aging populations, with a focus on improving the capacity of primary healthcare services to ensure timely diagnosis and treatment for elderly patients. Furthermore, through policy support and health education, societal awareness of elderly RA patients should be enhanced to provide them with more comprehensive protection and support systems.Between 1990 and 2021, there were significant gender differences in the burden of RA in both China and globally. In both China and globally, females exhibited significantly higher incidence, prevalence, mortality, and DALYs of RA compared to males. Substantial evidence also suggests that gender plays a critical role in the onset and progression of RA [<xref rid="pone.0323372.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323372.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The underlying reasons for this phenomenon may be related to women's unique physiological characteristics, hormonal fluctuations, and social roles [<xref rid="pone.0323372.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Studies have shown that women's unique immune system characteristics may make them more susceptible to autoimmune diseases [<xref rid="pone.0323372.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. For example, during special periods such as pregnancy, menopause, and menstruation, hormonal fluctuations may disrupt the balance of the immune system, potentially increasing the risk of developing RA [<xref rid="pone.0323372.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323372.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The daily living environment is also an important factor contributing to the risk of RA in women. For instance, women may take on more household chores and caregiving responsibilities in daily life, and the prolonged overuse of hand and foot joints, combined with psychological stress, may contribute to the onset of RA [<xref rid="pone.0323372.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323372.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The differences in RA burden across age groups are particularly pronounced in middle&#x02013;aged and elderly populations. Specifically, DALYs for females peaked in the 55&#x02013;59 age group, highlighting the prominent role of postmenopausal women in the RA burden. In contrast, postmenopausal women face more chronic health issues, making the impact of RA on their quality of life and overall health more severe [<xref rid="pone.0323372.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323372.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. These findings suggest that RA prevention and control strategies should take gender differences into account, with a particular focus on physiologically susceptible age groups in women to enhance prevention and early intervention. Regular monitoring, pharmacological interventions, and optimizing work and living environments for women at risk of immune imbalance due to estrogen decline during menopause and postmenopause can help reduce their susceptibility to RA.</p><p>This study systematically evaluated the burden of RA in China and globally from 1990 to 2021, highlighting that despite significant advancements in RA treatment technologies, the absence of a cure underscores the importance of early prevention and lifestyle adjustments. The findings suggest that improving diet, increasing physical activity, and adopting other healthy lifestyle interventions can effectively reduce the incidence and progression of RA, particularly among middle&#x02013;aged and elderly women [<xref rid="pone.0323372.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Furthermore, strengthening public health strategies and disease education to raise public awareness of the importance of RA prevention is key to reducing the burden of RA. However, this study has certain limitations. Firstly, the data analyzed in this study is current only up to 2021. Although this represents the latest available database at the time of analysis, it has inherent limitations in predicting and analyzing potential new trends and changes that may arise in the future. As a result, there are constraints regarding the timeliness of the data for forward - looking research. Secondly, the study relies on secondary data from the GBD database, although provides extensive data, its multiple sources may introduce errors or omissions during the data collection and integration process, potentially affecting the accuracy of the results. Moreover, it may not accurately reflect the specific conditions of individual regions. Variations in medical resource distribution, environmental factors, and lifestyle habits across different regions could lead to discrepancies between the actual RA burden and the database data, limiting the applicability of the study's conclusions to specific locales.Thirdly, the lack of primary patient-level data limits the ability to perform detailed analyses on individual risk factors or to adjust for all possible confounders.Fourthly, the GBD database does not provide detailed information on genetic, hormonal, or environmental factors, which are important for understanding the etiology and progression of RA. Therefore, future research should aim to investigate these factors to better understand the observed trends.In conclusion, RA is a global public health challenge that significantly impacts individuals, families, and societal health. With the intensification of aging populations globally, particularly in China, the burden of RA is expected to continue increasing. Therefore, implementing effective public health strategies, enhancing public health education, and improving lifestyles will be crucial in addressing this challenge.</p></sec><sec id="sec021" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material id="pone.0323372.s001" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>APC of ASIR, ASPR, ASMR and ASDR for global RA from1990 to 2021.</title><p>(a) ASIR; (b) ASPR; (c) ASMR; (d) ASDR.</p><p>(TIFF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0323372.s001.tif"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pone.0323372.s002" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S2 Fig</label><caption><title>Global comparison of incidence, prevalence, deaths and DALYs counts by age group and their crude rates, 1990 and 2021.</title><p>(a) Number of incidence and CIR; (b) Number of prevalence and CPR; (c) Number of deaths and CMR; (d) Number of DALYs and CDR.</p><p>(TIFF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0323372.s002.tif"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pone.0323372.s003" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S3 Fig</label><caption><title>Comparison of RA incidence, prevalence, death and DALYs among men and women of different age groups in global in 1990.</title><p>(a) Incidence;(b)Prevalence;(c) Deaths;(d) DALYs.</p><p>(TIFF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0323372.s003.tif"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pone.0323372.s004" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S4 Fig</label><caption><title>Comparison of RA incidence, prevalence, death and DALYs among men and women of different age groups in global in 2021.</title><p>(a) Incidence;(b)Prevalence;(c) Deaths;(d) DALYs.</p><p>(TIFF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0323372.s004.tif"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pone.0323372.s005" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S5 Fig</label><caption><title>Comparison of all&#x02013;age cases with age&#x02013;standardized incidence, prevalence,deaths, and DALYs in global men and women, 1990&#x02013;2021.</title><p>(a) Number of incidence and ASIR; (b) Number of prevalence and ASPR; (c) Number of deaths and ASMR; (d)Number of DALYs and ASMR.</p><p>(TIFF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0323372.s005.tif"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We appreciate all the academics who have contributed to the GBD study and all authors devote to the article.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0323372.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Figus</surname><given-names>FA</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Piga</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Azzolin</surname><given-names>I</given-names></name>, <name><surname>McConnell</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Iagnocco</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name>. <article-title>Rheumatoid arthritis: Extra-articular manifestations and comorbidities</article-title>. <source>Autoimmun Rev</source>. <year>2021</year>;<volume>20</volume>(<issue>4</issue>):<fpage>102776</fpage>. <comment>doi: </comment><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/j.autrev.2021.102776</pub-id>
