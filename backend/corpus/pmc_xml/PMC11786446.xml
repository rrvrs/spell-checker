COVID-19 affected every aspect of implementation. Although supportive in principle, many staff were unconvinced that legislative changes alone would increase consent rates. Many staff were redeployed or left their jobs. As a result, staff were not able to work collectively as intended for implementation. Staff received routine donor audit data suggesting the law was yet to make a difference to consent rates, reducing their enthusiasm and commitment.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">Implementation could have been more impactful if delayed.

In 2021, it was estimated that over 144,000 organs were transplanted world-wide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In the United Kingdom (UK), approximately 4,600 transplants were performed in 2022/2023. However, it was also estimated that around 7,000 patients were on waiting lists, with over 430 dying during that period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Consent to deceased organ donation is regarded as one of the main barriers to making more organs available for transplant in the UK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>The policy context</title><p id="Par6">Although there is no definitive evidence that opt-out systems are any more effective at raising organ donation consent rates than opt-in systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], between 2015 and 2023 each of the devolved nations of the UK responsible for the National Health Service (NHS) moved to a &#x02018;soft&#x02019; opt-out system of consent to deceased organ donation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. These are referred to as &#x02018;soft&#x02019; opt-out systems because the family of the deceased continue to be involved in the organ donation discussion and can also potentially override the deceased person&#x02019;s donation decision made in life. Wales was the first UK devolved nation to implement a &#x02018;soft&#x02019; opt-out system in 2015, which has yet to demonstrate significantly increased consent rates compared to the previous opt-in system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">In May 2020, in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, when health services were required to quickly reconfigure to meet the challenge of caring for thousands of critically sick patients requiring high dependency and intensive care, England implemented its &#x02018;soft&#x02019; opt-out system. Under the new system, all adults aged over 18 years were considered to have consented to organ donation (deemed consent), unless they had indicated that they did not want to be a donor during their lifetime by registering an opt-out decision on the Organ Donor Register, by informing their family members, or were in one of the excluded categories. However rather than replace the opt-in system, the new system added a deemed consent pathway. In addition only certain organs, tissues and their use were covered by the &#x02018;soft&#x02019; opt-out system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Excluded organs (e.g. the brain), tissues (e.g. the trachea) and their use still required family or another type of consent (e.g. first person) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">The law change was intended to be supplemented by a set of initiatives to increase the chances of a successful implementation. These included media campaigns to raise awareness about the change; expansion of the workforce responsible for obtaining support for organ donation from family members; and additional targeted training of NHS staff (See Appendix 1 for the full list of the intended organ donation implementation support package). This package was not delivered as planned, mostly as a result of the COVID-19 Pandemic which coincided with the date when the law change came into effect.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>The UK organ donation system</title><p id="Par9">NHS Blood and Transplantation (NHSBT) is a Special Health Authority [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] that provides blood and transplantation services across the UK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Special Health Authorities deliver services on a national, rather than local level and are created by the Secretary of State through secondary legislation. The deceased organ donation system comprises services in 12 regions, with nine covering England [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Any patient with a severe brain injury or a patient where decisions are being made to withdraw treatment is considered a potential donor and should be referred as soon as possible via a national referral telephone number [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. If the patient is identified as a potential organ donor, a Specialist Requester (SR) or Specialist Nurses in Organ Donation (SNOD) will be mobilised to speak to the family about organ donation and establish the mode of consent. This process has over time become increasingly specialised with the implementation of the SR role and includes bespoke training with a focus on communication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>The study</title><p id="Par10">This analysis was part of a wider evaluation examining the impact(s) of the changes on the whole organ donation system including the public and families who were approached about organ donation after their relative had died [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Our objectives were to explore awareness of the law change and the experiences of health care professionals (including their systems of support) who are directly (e.g. NHSBT) and indirectly (e.g. Intensive care, accident and emergency) tasked with delivering organ donation services in England.</p><p id="Par11">We were also interested in exploring the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the NHS and organ donation system, which coincided with implementation of the soft opt-out legislation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec6"><title>Design</title><p id="Par12">We used a mixed-methods convergent analysis design [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. We sought to capture the views and experiences of an extensive range of respondents (including NHSBT staff, Clinical Leads in Organ Donation (CLODs), emergency care unit staff, operating theatre staff and adult intensive care unit staff) with a widely distributed survey. In parallel, we aimed to gain in-depth understanding of the views of health care professionals tasked with the implementation of the law change, using semi-structured interviews with purposively sampled staff in two purposively selected NHSBT regions, based on organ donation activity, geographic coverage, consent rates and higher than average ethnic minority populations.</p><p id="Par13">The theoretical framework underpinning our exploration of implementation processes and staff perceptions and experiences was Normalisation Process Theory (NPT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. This is a widely used framework for understanding the factors influencing the implementation of policy or service change in the health care sector in terms of the degree to which the change becomes &#x0201c;normalised&#x0201d; by staff. NPT investigates the levels of coherence (sense making); cognitive participation (relational work); collective action (operational work); and reflexive work (appraisal work) involved in the implementation process. NPT guided the survey questions and topic guides for interview, analysis and data integration.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Data collection tools</title><p id="Par14">The two surveys were designed for the study to collect information about staff awareness and understanding of the law change; degree of support for the change in the law; reasons for supporting/ not supporting it; and the impact of COVID-19. The second survey additionally collected information about the implementation of the changes; their perceived impact in general and on organ donation rates in minority ethnic groups and faith groups; ways of addressing concerns of families whose involvement did not lead to organ donation; and views on NHSBT&#x02019;s key performance indicators (see Appendix 2). Similarly, the topic guides for the interviews were devised to explore perceptions and experiences, perceived impact, changes over time and COVID-19 considerations. The two surveys and topic guides were shared with key stakeholders (including the study&#x02019;s advisory group) and the study&#x02019;s Patient and Public Involvement and Engagement (PPIE) representative (JB) to ensure they captured relevant information.</p><p id="Par15">We took a number of steps to maximise the validity, reliability and rigour of the data we were collecting, and the subsequent analyses. To minimise the risk of social desirability bias of responses to our surveys, we emphasised in our information sheet that responses would be anonymised in reports. We also piloted the survey questions with a number of individuals with similar characteristics to those completing the survey to ensure that the question wording was unambiguous, neutral, and in the case of closed-ended questions, that we had categorical options to select from. We randomised response options where appropriate to minimise primacy bias. We agreed beforehand the analysis plan for the two surveys and the qualitative research. We used the four-dimension criteria (credibility, dependability, confirmability and transferability) as qualitative markers of rigour throughout [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Detailed fieldnotes were often read out to the team who were then able to share their expertise and perspectives to help further contextualize data. We also presented emerging findings at meetings attended by our advisory group and wider stakeholders to check whether they found our interpretation of the data credible.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Sampling</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Surveys</title><p id="Par16">Two surveys were conducted with NHS and NHSBT staff in England (23 August 2021- 10 January 2022 and 14 November 2022- 28 January 2023). This enabled us to observe changes in views over time. In recognition of the expected low response to surveys conducted at a time of high demand on healthcare workers, we sought to invite all workers we could reach with our survey without aiming for a specific sample size. The surveys were disseminated using the online survey platform Qualtrics XM. Invitations to the survey were disseminated using a combination of direct invitations sent by the Legislation Project Lead at NHSBT to NHSBT staff (nurses and managers) and CLODs physicians, alongside cascading invitations through various professional networks and encouraging completion through the British Association of Critical Care Nurses (BACCN) newsletter which has the widest reach of critical care nurses in the UK. Respondents to the first survey were asked to provide an e-mail address for the second one; those who did so, received a direct invitation to complete the second survey. To incentivise the completion of the second survey (in light of the low response to the first survey), we offered a &#x000a3;5 Amazon voucher to the first 500 respondents who completed the second survey.</p><sec id="Sec10"><title>Interviews</title><p id="Par17">Two NHSBT regions were purposively selected as sites for the staff interviews. London was selected for its high(er) numbers of potential organ donors, ethnically diverse population, and concentration of large acute hospitals. The North West England site was selected as it covers north England, has higher than average numbers of ethnic minority and under-represented groups, and covers a wide geographic area. Within each region two NHS Trusts were selected based on factors such as high and low performance regarding organ donation consent rates, NHSBT classification of level 1 and level 2 centres for a high enough level of organ donation activity to examine in more depth the interactions, processes, and activities between NHS and NHSBT staff.</p><p id="Par18">We aimed to undertake two rounds of interviews with a minimum of 20 interviews across each site and follow-up 12-18 months into implementation. However, since the changes were not implemented as planned, it soon became clear that there was no value in continuing the follow-up interviews. Interviews were undertaken by two experienced female researchers (LM &#x00026; LW), mostly virtual (Teams, Zoom) with a small number face-to- face interviews. LM undertook interviews across both sites and had previously worked with some participants on a similar evaluation in Wales. In each NHS Trust, we identified participants through purposive and snowball sampling and continued our interviews until the point of data saturation (where interviews were not yielding new insights or themes). This included healthcare professionals working directly in organ donation, such as SNODs, SRs and CLODs, and indirectly, e.g., those working in Intensive Care Units (ICU) and Emergency Departments (ED).&#x000a0;Key NHSBT personnel, including regional and team managers were contacted directly to identify potential participants to recruit. Each Trust&#x02019;s CLOD acted as a lead Principal Investigator (PI) to help identify and recruit NHS personnel working within the targeted specialities, namely intensive care units and emergency departments, as well as from other linked clinical areas, e.g., Stroke units. We sent an &#x02018;invitation to participate email&#x02019; to the identified individual, along with a participant information sheet.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Analysis</title><sec id="Sec12"><title>Surveys</title><p id="Par19">Survey responses were mainly analysed and presented as the number of responses (and percentages) by professional group. The small number of responses from some professional groups (especially in the first survey) prevented us from testing the statistical significance of differences in responses. Open-ended narrative responses were analysed alongside qualitative interview data.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Interviews</title><p id="Par20">Interviews were transcribed verbatim, coded against NPT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and analysed in NVivo 12 using the Framework approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Familiarisation with the data was achieved by researchers (LM and LW) reading and re-reading transcripts and accompanying audio recordings, and by annotating and making notes and memos on initial thoughts. Visual maps of the NPT constructs aided the analysis. Summary findings were also coded as broadly &#x0201c;positive&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;negative&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;no difference&#x0201d; against NPT in terms of respondent responses to the changes in organ donation system processes, practices and perceived impacts.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Data integration</title><p id="Par21">The research team met to discuss, refine and agree the analytical coding framework (see Appendix 3) where NPT constructs were interpreted and mapped for both interview and survey data. We analysed the quantitative and qualitative data separately, and then brought the initial findings together into a narrative using NPT as the organising framework to present the findings.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Reflexivity</title><p id="Par22">The research team consisted of academics and lay representatives with various experience in health, social and policy research and organ donation. Two members of the team (LM and JN) were involved in a similar evaluation of the changes to the Welsh law on organ donation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In Wales, while donation rates were observed to increase in some areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], none of these observations could be attributed directly to the law change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. We sought to minimise the risk of the views of the researchers influencing the qualitative data collection and interpretation by agreeing the topic guide for the interviews beforehand and conducting joint analysis meetings. The inclusion of a lay member on the team aided objectivity and was used as a &#x02018;bias check&#x02019; throughout.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Stakeholder engagement and Patient and Public Involvement and Engagement (PPIE)</title><p id="Par23">Researchers attended meetings and training events, organ donation committee meetings, NHSBT team meetings including those allocated to Specialist Requesters, SNODs and management and reviews of documents and processes. We recruited a lay member as a core member of the research team, who has experience of organ donation as a carer of a person who became a donor. Our advisory group was made up of expert and lay members including donor families who had input into the data collection, interpretation and validation of results.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Findings</title><p id="Par24">We recruited 244 NHS and NHSBT staff to the first survey and 738 to the second (see Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> for breakdown of survey responses by professional group). It was not possible to calculate the response rate to the surveys, since invitations were disseminated using newsletters to professional groups whose size cannot be measured accurately to provide a denominator for the response rate estimates. A total of 70 interviews representing 59 staff were completed across the two sites (see Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> for details).

Some were optimistic that the changes might give greater priority to organ donation within intensive care &#x02013; as something that is delivered as an integrated part of the service &#x02013; but were cautious about whether the law change would assist with any specific local issues such as bed capacity, staff turnover and burnout. Most preferred to focus and build on what individuals were already doing irrespective of the law change, such as promoting the stories of donors who went on to save multiple (young) lives, excellent examples of multi-disciplinary team working, community engagement and general organ donation promotion.</p><p id="Par28">Many clinicians felt a law change overlaid on the complexity of death and dying conversations, which are ultimately emotional (not rational), would make almost no difference to their practice or consent rates. The &#x02018;softness&#x02019; of the legislation was both regarded as &#x02018;good enough&#x02019; i.e. at the limit of what is currently likely to be acceptable in the UK, but a cause of frustration especially when trying to explain to colleagues what in fact had changed or what they might need to consider doing differently, if anything. Others commented that the organ donation service might now potentially have put itself in a weaker position by relying on the fact that people have not opted out instead of people having to opt in. They judged that opt in still remains easier to talk about and to promote to families and colleagues especially when organ donation is infrequent. Overall NHS staff in London were more concerned with staffing issues (than the law change), some not currently having a link nurse or even seen a SNOD since before the pandemic.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>NHSBT staff</title><p id="Par29">Some SNODs/SRs were initially concerned that the law change would take away the family&#x02019;s capacity to &#x02018;gift&#x02019; (as decisions are given to individuals to make while they are alive) and the greater emphasis in performance assessment being given to consent rates. Many explained how the nature of their conversation with families had changed, but that this had evolved over time (especially in the Northwest as many SNODs/SRs had been in post for longer). Most still found talking about the benefits of organ donation easier and preferable than discussing the law. Some were interested to see what the law change would do to their individual consent rates, and a few suggested that the changes in the ways data are collected and presented now would give a more accurate picture of the complexities SNODs/SRs encounter on a daily basis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>NHS and NHSBT staff</title><p id="Par30">Within NHSBT and NHS staff involved in organ donation there was overall disappointment that the changes did nothing to stop families overriding the decisions of people who had opted in and many wondered what proportion of &#x0201c;new deemed cases&#x0201d; would have said &#x0201c;yes&#x0201d; anyway under the old system, making measuring change very challenging:</p><p id="Par31">

Another factor for some intensivists was suddenly feeling left out of decision making, when there was a direct link created between NHSBT and the family at end of life, and observing the high(er) burden on families. The law in practice did nothing to reduce these issues and CLODs in particular reflected a tension between their role in promoting organ donation and maintaining or re-enforcing NHSBT standard operating procedures (SOPs) which are designed to keep organ donation separate from end-of-life care.</p><p id="Par49">

These audit data showed that the law change was not having the desired impact on organ donation consent rates in the initial implementation period. When comparing the two surveys, there was a corresponding decline in the percentage of respondents in the survey who perceived that the changes would result in an increase in consent rates, and an increase in those who believed the changes would reduce consent rates (see Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). A similar trend was observed in relation to the perceived impact on the number of donations (see Figure <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Support for the law in general also decreased over time (see Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). When we asked respondents to indicate the main perceived benefits of the changes, the promotion of family discussions about organ donation was the most frequently selected (selected by 58% of respondents), followed by the perceived facilitation of organ donation discussions among staff (selected by 46% of respondents).

To address these issues, staff most frequently advocated a media campaign to raise awareness among the public, as well as streamlining or shortening the processes involved in organ donation:</p><p id="Par79">

These decreasing trends in support for the law change and increase in frustration with the system were also prevalent in the interviews, as described below.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>Views on NHSBT key performance indicators (second survey)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12913_2025_12224_Fig5_HTML" id="MO5"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>NHS staff</title><p id="Par82">Some staff reflected a dilemma with trying to encourage brain death testing independently from organ donation as the two are so intertwined in practice and there were frequently frustrations on how death testing is captured in the audit data, its accuracy and relevance to missed organ donation potential.</p><p id="Par83">There was a move towards organ utilisation as a priority area during the course of the study (due to the recent publication of recommendations on ways to maximise organ transplant from living and deceased donors). There was a consensus that poor utilisation dissuades wider NHS staff from engaging with organ donation (especially in hospitals) and that the law would do nothing to help this. Others reflected that devolved implementation is already causing problems in what are always evolving end of life practices and establishing national consensus and keeping guidelines up to date.</p><p id="Par84">Staff in general felt that in order for anything to change, the impetus needed to come from a change in the public who would come to expect organ donation as a part of end of life. Many also reflected on the possibility that the law change was out of step with some sub-cultures in society as well as wider societal expectations and views on deceased organ donation, &#x0201c;If you want to do something in 10 years, interventions might (if you are lucky) get you there in 8-9 years, we basically asking people to be less religious, less sectarian less everything and this takes time.&#x0201d; (clinician interview)</p><p id="Par85">Others discussed the quality of Organ Donor Register decisions, judging the extent to which decisions were adequately informed and proxy decision making, and that judging the quality of those decisions remained challenging.

Some felt that in some ways NHS guidelines and NHSBTs standard operating procedures had gone too far by involving families too much in end of life decision making, and there was a genuine unease around declaring death using neurological criteria, related to some recent media cases around withdrawing treatment and declaring brain death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].

The media campaign and formal launch were cancelled, all staff education and training was paused, all SNODs/SRs were redeployed to COVID-19 related activities and transplant services were severely disrupted. Unsurprisingly, our first survey (conducted between 08/2021 and 01/2022), indicated that over three-quarters of respondents (77%) said the pandemic had affected their ability to perform organ-donation-related tasks, to a great extent, or to some extent.

An equal number, however, also identified positive changes, in the form of innovative adaptations to help with implementation (for example, videocalls with family members) that were facilitated as a consequence of the pandemic.

There were mixed messages and views about when SNODs/SRs should or should not be mentioning the &#x02018;soft&#x02019; opt-out law change during their conversations with family members. SNODs/SRs shared that they often had negative experiences with families when talking through the law change and what it meant, which significantly affected their perceptions of the practicability of the law change. NHSBT staff sometimes found it challenging to make sense of, and distinguish, old from new practice, especially as the &#x02018;soft&#x02019; opt-out was implemented into the existing opt-in system, neither system had universal coverage. After receiving initial training and education concerning the law change, many staff in the NHS and NHSBT were redeployed to help treat severely ill patients with COVID-19. This meant that there was an overall loss of opportunities for collective cognitive participation in implementing the law change because organ donation was not the priority during the pandemic. Overall, the Northwest region seemed to find it more straight forward to implement the change in law, in part because the SNODs/SRs in this region covered North Wales and had been working with the Welsh &#x02018;soft&#x02019; opt-out system since 2015 and there were very active organ donation committees supporting implementation.</p><p id="Par110">Many felt that the continued requirement from NHSBT imposed on other NHS staff not to mention organ donation to family members was harming collective action and caused frustration when staff felt punished for doing so, especially when they were trying to facilitate organ donation. Despite this frustration amongst NHS staff, SNODs&#x02019;/SRs&#x02019; confidence with implementing the deemed consent pathway increased with the number of deemed approaches they had made.</p><p id="Par111">There are many ongoing opportunities for reflexive monitoring in the organ donation system as NHSBT routinely collects a mass of data, which is fed back to all those involved in organ donation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. On the one hand, NHSBT appeared to be reassured that there was little difference in practice and consent rates following implementation of the law, due to anxieties that the law change and implementation during COVID-19 would make things worse, and on the other disillusioned that nothing had changed in their practice or their consent rates. They faced the same challenges as before &#x02013; the law gave them no new tools to navigate the complexities of speaking to the acutely bereaved or influencing the family&#x02019;s behaviours in regard to deceased organ donation. NHS clinicians too felt that NHSBTs standard operating procedures did not easily reflect reality on the ground, and were not always helpful in what were unique and complex, discussions and negotiations.</p></sec><sec id="Sec33"><title>Meaning of this study</title><p id="Par112">Our study has shown the complexities of trying to bring about change in a system where the key implementers (SNODs/SRs) are sometimes only in post for a short-term, have less time and resources than in the recent past to promote an activity (organ donation) which, for the majority of NHS staff, is very rare. This means that it is difficult to achieve coherence, cognitive participation and collective action to support implementation that is meaningful and sustainable across the NHS and NHSBT. This was made especially challenging to achieve in the unique context of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p id="Par113">Over time, support for the law change decreased as did any perceived positive impact the law might have on consent or the organ donation system. In their reflexive monitoring and appraisals, staff continued to feel that the reasons for refusals were the same (processes too long, family divided or had previously said they did not want to donate). The lack of clout of the law, its limited capacity to cope with population heterogeneity, irrelevant nuances in the law in practice, and the lack of impact on end-of-life proxy decision-making gave no more reassurance to anyone that the law would work in a practical help anybody in the system. Organ donation remains relatively rare even for ICU staff and sits outside clinical care of patients and thus requires staff involved to go to great efforts to secure donations, and within a permanently overstretched system and overworked workforce, making organ donation a priority outside NHSBT continued to prove challenging.</p><p id="Par114">Introducing an opt-out policy in England automatically switched the default position of nearly 45 million adults to one that, in principle, should have positively supported organ donation. However, in practice, this has resulted in a series of standard operating procedures trying to cover a whole range of processes and scenarios and are now standing in direct opposition to the aims of the changes, which were to make organ donation a routine part of end-of-life care. While staff on the frontline remained highly motivated and engaged with organ donation and the good it might bring about, the lack of evidence of a positive effect on consent rates contributed to staff becoming disillusioned with the law change and any potential good it might bring about.</p></sec><sec id="Sec34"><title>Implications for policy and practice</title><p id="Par115">The findings presented in this paper are consistent with similar research in other countries which indicates deemed consent has had positive impacts on consent rates in some countries and negative impacts in others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], and that knowledge and awareness of healthcare staff about deemed consent and how it is intended to work is generally low [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] Due to the mixed evidence, it is too soon to tell whether England is likely to be one of the positive cases but without the additional implementation strategies (discussed above) impact (on consent rates) will likely remain marginal.</p><p id="Par116">It seems appropriate now that the crisis phase of the pandemic is over to take stock and consider what would further enhance implementation of the law change. When thinking about further changes and enhancements that could be made to the current &#x02018;soft&#x02019; opt-out system three years after initial implementation, findings suggest that it would be helpful to revive the programme of support for the law change, which was cancelled due to the pandemic, with a focus on rebuilding and stabilising the NHS and NHSBT workforce involved in organ donation in the wake of COVID-19. Other initiatives to consider include revising and relaunching training and renewing the public media campaign. It will likely be challenging to move organ donation up the NHS priority list when there is an ongoing staffing crisis, staff are striking for more pay and there is a huge backlog of patients requiring treatment, but it is clear that unless organ donation becomes a higher priority, it will be difficult to bring about the required changes. NHS staff outside NHSBT, in particular, need to become more involved in deceased organ donation, to be encouraged to believe that it is their business to be involved in organ donation and to be provided with more stimulating work processes (e.g. examining the NHSBT veto on clinical staff becoming more involved in organ donation conversations) in order to stay motivated to maximise organ donation opportunities. Operational processes need to adapt to the intentions of the new legislation and &#x02018;soft&#x02019; opt-out, rather than compete with it. Markers of success need to be individually tailored and more meaningful (e.g. number of lives saved or improved) and not just on establishing what is and is not deemed consent. Overall, current processes and operating procedures need to be changed such that they make implementation of the &#x02018;soft&#x02019; opt-out easier and create simpler work processes for everyone.</p></sec><sec id="Sec35"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p id="Par117">This is the largest real-time evaluation of the implementation of a switch from opt-in to opt out organ donation legislation. The highly novel and rigorously conducted study was timed to coincide with the initial implementation phase so that memory recall was recent. It involved large numbers of purposively selected staff interviews and survey responses, which when integrated provide a detailed picture of the implementation challenges. Findings will have an impact as they provide the first robust evidence on the ineffective initial implementation phase and a clear steer on how to optimise implementation and further increase consent rates.</p><p id="Par118">Some of our data collection was hampered by COVID-19, in particular the low response to the first survey, but we recruited a high percentage (approximately 52%) of relevant NHSBT staff (SRs, SNODs and managers) and CLODs (approximately 70%) to the second survey. It was not possible for us to calculate a response rate to the surveys for reasons described above, which also meant we could not establish how representative our sample was of the population whose views we were seeking. Another limitation of our research was that some follow-up interviews were paused as there was very little evidence of impact or change over time. NPT was helpful in visualising and integrating data and explaining why the ambitions of the Act were not yet coming about in practice.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec36"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par119">Implementing the law change at the height of the pandemic and in a crisis situation when many staff were retrained and redeployed elsewhere has meant that implementation strategies were ineffective, diluted or did not happen. Although broadly supportive of the law changes as morally the right thing to do, NHSBT staff were not generally convinced that the &#x02018;soft&#x02019; opt-out system would deliver the expected increased consent rates as envisaged by legislators. NHS staff, in particular, were not able to fully consider or process the required changes to implement the &#x02018;soft&#x02019; opt-out legislation during the pandemic due to other competing priorities and general disruption to care as usual. The NHS now needs to reprioritise organ donation (although this will be challenging given the current pressures on the NHS) and relaunch and revise the continued implementation of the &#x02018;soft&#x02019; opt-out system with a largely (albeit slowly) replenished workforce. Nonetheless, even with a relaunched implementation a &#x02018;soft&#x02019; opt-out system is always going to be difficult to implement if the main goal is to significantly increase consent rates.</p></sec><sec id="Sec190" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>
