However, under some conditions, p53 can clump together to form aggregates. These aggregates cannot stop cancer and may even help cancer grow. This makes p53 aggregates a potential marker of cancer. We have developed a very sensitive test to catch and detect the rare p53 aggregates in the blood. With this test, we find that there are more p53 aggregates in the blood of glioblastoma (a highly aggressive brain cancer) patients than people without cancer. Our test is 90.57% accurate in diagnosing glioblastoma and may also help predict cancer recurrence and monitor treatment response.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>CNS cancer</kwd><kwd>Diagnostic markers</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100000289</institution-id><institution>Cancer Research UK (CRUK)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EDDPMA-May23/100016</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Klenerman</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer Nature Limited 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par7">p53 is a tumour suppressor protein that protects genome integrity by regulating a wide range of cellular processes, such as DNA repair<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>, cell cycle arrest<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>, and apoptosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Given its broad tumour-suppressing functions, <italic>TP53</italic> is the most frequently mutated gene in human cancer, and the production of mutant p53 protein is intimately associated with oncogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Wild-type (WT) and some mutant forms of p53, such as the R248Q and R175H mutants, can form amyloid aggregates that lose the tumour-suppressing functions of p53 and exert tumour-promoting activities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. p53 aggregation has been documented in various cancers, including neuroblastoma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, breast cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, and ovarian cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Understanding the implications of p53 aggregation can provide new insights into cancer pathology and therapy.</p><p id="Par8">Glioblastoma (GB) is one of the most aggressive and recurrent brain tumours, with patients having an average survival of 14.6 months and a 5-year survival of 7.2%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Although there is currently no cure for GB, detection of GB in its nascent, low-grade form may improve patient survival, underscoring the urgent need for an effective diagnostic biomarker<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Overall, the <italic>TP53</italic> gene is mutated in ~28% of GB patients, and the mutation rate of <italic>TP53</italic> in different GB subtypes can vary from 0% to 54%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, suggesting that p53 may play a critical role in GB development. Notably, the ARF-p53-MDM2 pathway, an important tumour suppressor pathway, is dysregulated in 84% of GB patients and 94% of GB cell lines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Overexpression of mutated p53, including the aggregation-prone mutants, is common in GB and may lead to the accumulation of p53, and, subsequently, the formation of p53 aggregates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Moreover, p53 aggregates have been found to promote chemoresistance in GB cells, suggesting a potential relationship between p53 aggregation and GB malignancy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Therefore, p53 aggregates may serve as a promising diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for GB.</p><p id="Par9">The observation of p53 aggregates in GB cells and in other cancer cell lines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> suggests that p53 aggregates may be detectable in plasma collected by venesection (liquid biopsy). Here, we developed an ultrasensitive assay targeting p53 aggregates in human plasma based on single-molecule array (SiMoA) technology, an immunoassay capable of detecting proteins at femtomolar concentrations (10<sup>&#x02212;15</sup>&#x02009;M)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>.

All sample collection involved in this study was approved by the institutional ethics committee. Patients with suspected GB on pre-operative contrast-enhanced MRI were chosen for participation in the study. Sampling was performed during the initial surgery for a new diagnosis of glioma.

Specifically, SiMoA utilises antibody-conjugated paramagnetic beads to capture target proteins in the sample, followed by incubation with a biotinylated detector antibody and streptavidin-&#x003b2;-galactosidase fusion protein (SBG), forming single immunocomplexes on the bead. The beads are then introduced to a microwell array, such that each microwell contains only one or no bead. The immunocomplex-carrying bead in the microwell can catalyse the hydrolysis of a fluorogenic substrate, resorufin &#x003b2;-D-galactopyranoside (RGP), enabling the quantification of p53 aggregate concentration in the sample. Here, we employed two p53 antibodies, DO-1 and PAb240.

The D-D pair cannot detect p53 monomers due to identical epitope binding.

It should be noted that, in this study, the SiMoA assay works in a digital fashion where the AEB values were dependent on the number of p53 aggregates but not affected by the aggregate size distribution.

Samples containing higher concentrations of the target protein will have more beads with immunocomplexes containing enzymes and hence more microwells will be fluorescent, leading to a higher AEB.

When comparing the mean cluster areas of plasma samples with those of recombinant WT and R248Q p53 monomer and aggregates at 1&#x02009;nM, we found that most control samples had similar cluster areas to those of monomeric WT or R248Q p53; while the GB patient samples exhibited higher cluster areas comparable to those of the 1&#x02009;nM WT p53 aggregates (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>). Notably, one control sample showed exceptionally high mean cluster areas and localisations per cluster, while the buffer showed higher mean cluster areas than WT p53 monomers and aggregates. This was because the control and buffer samples had very small number of clusters compared with patient or recombinant protein samples, and a few relatively large clusters in the images of these samples could result in abnormally high average cluster areas or number of localisations per cluster. These large, but very rare, clusters may be induced by debris, surface defect, or non-specific binding of the detector antibody. These data collectively suggest that more and larger p53 aggregates exist in the GB patients&#x02019; plasma, which may be responsible for the elevated signals in the SiMoA assays.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><title>Validation of the presence of p53 aggregates in GB patient plasma.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Diffraction-limited images of the plasma samples of three GB patients (P1, P2, P3) and two controls (C1, C2) on the SiMPull surface.

We therefore developed a calibrator composed of silica beads conjugated with the epitopes targeted by the DO-1 and PAb240 antibodies.

In addition, we observed increased p53 aggregate concentrations in cancer patients with brain metastases, suggesting that they may have diagnostic and prognostic applications beyond GB.</p><p id="Par39">We observed no correlation between the presence/absence of <italic>TP53</italic> mutation and plasma concentration of p53 aggregates; there was also no significant difference between the p53 aggregate concentrations in the brain homogenate samples of GB patients with WT and mutant <italic>TP53</italic>. However, elevated p53 transcript and aggregates were observed in GB patients but not controls. These results are consistent with several studies that demonstrated the presence of WT p53 aggregates in cancer and we hypothesise that levels of p53 aggregation may reflect this<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. WT p53, as a transcription factor, is responsible for the response to DNA damage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>, hypoxia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>, and oxidative stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>, all of which are found in brain cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. The concentration of WT p53 given the conditions associated with rapid tumour cell growth have been calculated to be above that required for aggregate seeding (18&#x02013;180&#x02009;nM) where the capacity for WT p53 to form aggregates at physiological concentrations (50&#x02013;100&#x02009;nM) has also been demonstrated albeit with lower efficiency than mutant <italic>TP53</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>.

The DO-1 antibody-conjugated beads are thought to capture and enrich all p53 species, whereas the PAb240 antibody detects p53 aggregates that expose the unfolded DNA-binding domain. In contrast, while the D-D antibody pair is thought to detect multimeric p53, it did not show a clear separation between controls and GB patients, presumably due to the presence of p53 dimers and/or tetramers in the plasma of healthy individuals. However, while the presence of p53 aggregates in GB patient plasma has been validated by super-resolution imaging using the D-P antibody pair, it remains unclear whether the elevated SiMoA signals result purely from p53 aggregates, since the PAb240 antibody may also bind to unfolded p53 monomers. Further investigation is required to fully validate the exact species detected by SiMoA, as well as to characterise the size distribution of the detected p53 aggregates to shed light on their mechanism of production and biological roles. The p53 aggregate concentration trajectories showed broad correlation with the patients&#x02019; clinical profiles but these were sometimes difficult to interpret given the opportunistic method by which the samples were collected and the resultant gaps in longitudinal sampling. Also, we did not see a correlation between p53 aggregate concentration and survival within these patients, but this is perhaps unsurprising given the few patients for which we had multiple timepoints and the multifactorial nature of prognostication in glioma. A comprehensive correlation analysis between the patients&#x02019; p53 aggregate concentrations and clinical profiles is therefore needed to confirm the clinical implications of p53 aggregates, ideally for both pre-operative and follow-up patients; however, the multiplicity of prognostic factors in patients with brain cancer, such as the size and location of the tumour and the functional status of the patient, mandate a multivariant analysis with a larger numbers of patients included.</p><p id="Par41">Our study highlights the potential utility of plasma p53 aggregate concentrations for early detection, diagnosis and monitoring of patients with brain cancer. Earlier detection of both primary and recurrent disease in GB and IDH mutant glioma would enable rapid institution of treatment and thereby maximise the potential for patient benefit. There is preliminary evidence that earlier detection of GB, in its low-grade state, may improve survival<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. Given its high diagnostic accuracy, the p53 aggregate assay in the present study may serve as an early screening tool or assistive diagnostic method for GB; however, additional data are required to confirm the earliest time point possible for p53 aggregate to indicate GB development, and the optimal clinical threshold with balanced sensitivity and specificity. Monitoring GB recurrence may also bring important clinical benefit for GB patients, as GB ultimately recurs in all cases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Importantly, detection of GB recurrence may reflect the effectiveness of ongoing therapeutic strategy; for example, discovering chemoresistance early may enable timely alternation of the treatment plan. Still, this demands in-depth investigation by correlating p53 aggregate concentrations with follow-up patients&#x02019; treatment records, such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and surgery, and other clinical characteristics (e.g., genetic information) in a larger cohort. Similarly, early detection of brain metastasis enables the rapid institution of a broad range of therapies that are not available when lesions are large and symptomatic. While we have discovered elevated p53 aggregate concentrations in several primary cancers with brain metastasis within a relatively small cohort, comprehensive correlation analyses within larger cohorts are needed to understand whether p53 aggregation is truly associated with brain metastasis.</p><p id="Par42">Although MRI remains the primary method for identifying brain tumours, including at recurrence, alternate lower cost approaches, such as liquid biopsy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>, that do not have the logistical challenges of MRI, and that avoid the high levels of patient anxiety whilst awaiting an MRI scan would be advantageous. Furthermore, the SiMoA assay is compatible with high-throughput testing and has a relatively low cost (~$20 per assay) compared with techniques that detect other cancer biomarkers, such as circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) sequencing. Therefore, the p53 aggregate assay holds the potential to be widely adopted in clinics and healthcare systems for large-scale screening of cancer, and may help clinicians in primary care refer potential cancer patients for further medical examinations.</p><p id="Par43">There are several limitations with this study. Firstly, there are a few outliers with exceptionally high AEB values in both the control and GB patient groups, which cannot be explained by their clinical profiles. The elevated AEB values may result from contamination during sample handling, or the presence of human anti-mouse antibodies in these samples<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. These antibodies in the samples may bind to the capture and detector antibodies, both of which are mouse-origin, and lead to abnormally high AEB values. However, more investigations are needed to examine these hypotheses. Secondly, the specific p53 species detected by the SiMoA assay have not been fully resolved. While its diagnostic or prognostic value may be unaffected, understanding the population of unfolded p53 or p53 aggregates in plasma, as well as their structure and source, may provide fundamental insights into the development of GB and other cancers. Thirdly, the fact that p53 aggregates can be detected in IDH mutant primary and metastatic brain tumours indicates that the presence of p53 aggregate is not an exclusive biomarker for GB diagnosis. Hence, additional blood biomarkers need to be developed and used in combination with p53 aggregates to enhance the diagnostic specificity. Glioma has been shown previously to be a particularly challenging cancer to detect through liquid biopsy and as such, these data may indicate broader applicability of this approach across cancers in which liquid biopsy is more straightforward. In addition, given the broad tumour-suppressing functions of p53, p53 aggregates may be expected to be present in the blood plasma of patients with various cancers other than primary brain cancer, especially those with <italic>TP53</italic> mutations. Thus, the prevalence of <italic>TP53</italic> mutation across cancers and the broad applicability of p53 aggregate detection may enable pan-cancer diagnostic tests to be developed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary information</title><p>
