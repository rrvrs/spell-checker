Rho-kinases (ROCK) are known to be important for stable changes in synaptic strength, especially LTP. In this study, we investigated whether LTP inhibition in synapses primed with 1-Hz stimulation was affected by ROCK inhibition in young adult male rats. The study also examined the pattern of tau phosphorylation that occurs during metaplastic regulation, applying into perspective the phosphorylation of tau protein by ROCK. Field potentials consisting of an excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP) and population spike (PS) were recorded from the granule cell layer of the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG). Metaplastic LTP was induced by strong tetanic stimulation (HFS) of the lateral perforant path after a low-frequency stimulation (LFS) protocol. A glass micropipette was inserted into the granule cell layer of the ipsilateral dentate gyrus to record fEPSP and drug infusion. Drug infusion (saline, <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;8; fasudil, <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;8, 10&#x000a0;&#x000b5;M) was started after the 15-min baseline recording and lasted for 60&#x000a0;min. Total and phosphorylated tau levels were measured in the stimulated hippocampus, which was immediately removed after the electrophysiological recording. LFS prevented the induction of LTP in response to HFS and even produced synaptic LTD in the saline-infused group (83.8&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;2.6% of the baseline), but moderate potentiation of fEPSP (121.1&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;7.7% of the baseline) occurred at the end of recording in the experiments where fasudil infusion was performed. LFS caused a comparable early depression, and HFS resulted in a comparable potentiation of the PS amplitude in both groups. Granular cells of the DG failed to exhibit synaptic LTP inhibition in the presence of fasudil, and levels of total and phosphorylated GSK-3&#x003b2; and levels of phosphorylated tau (Ser<sup>396</sup> and Ser<sup>202</sup>-Thr<sup>205</sup>) were found to be lower than those of the control group. Based on these findings, it can be concluded that pharmacological inhibition of ROCK results in impaired ability of dentate gyrus neurons to inhibit synaptic LTP, and this result is accompanied by decreased phosphorylation of GSK-3&#x003b2; and tau proteins. The negative effect of fasudil on neuronal function should not be neglected when evaluating its effects as a therapeutic agent for diseases.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Hippocampus</kwd><kwd>Synaptic plasticity</kwd><kwd>ROCK</kwd><kwd>Fasudil</kwd><kwd>Protein Tau</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Erciyes University</institution></funding-source></award-group><open-access><p>Open access funding provided by the Scientific and Technological Research Council of T&#x000fc;rkiye (T&#x000dc;B&#x00130;TAK).</p></open-access></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par5">Synaptic plasticity is a process in which synaptic strength changes in an activity-dependent manner within the brain. Experimentally, high-frequency stimulation (HFS) of presynaptic fibers can boost synaptic strength (long-term potentiation, LTP), whereas low-frequency stimulation suppresses it (long-term depression, LTD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Activation or inactivation of intracellular molecular cascades mediates these processes by altering the number and composition of ionotropic &#x003b1;-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA)-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs) within the postsynaptic membrane. Activity-dependent modulation of AMPAR trafficking plays an important role in the expression of NMDA receptor-dependent LTP and LTD in the hippocampus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. LTP and LTD can be induced within seconds or minutes; however, their permanence depends on protein synthesis.
</p><p id="Par6">Tau phosphorylation may serve as a regulatory mechanism to avoid NMDA receptor over-excitation, demonstrating its vital role in regulating synaptic function. Interestingly, many kinases that play critical roles in synaptic plasticity are involved in abnormal tau phosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Under physiological conditions, a small fraction of tau in dendrites and spines is phosphorylated upon NMDA receptor activation through a signaling cascade that is also activated by the induction of synaptic plasticity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. We have previously shown that stimulation of the perforant pathway &#x02013; dentate gyrus synapses by HFS increased the phosphorylation of total-tau and phospho-tau at Thr<sup>181</sup>, Ser<sup>202</sup>/Thr<sup>205</sup>, Ser<sup>396</sup>, and Ser<sup>416</sup> residues in the hippocampus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. In contrast, LFS is unable to phosphorylate thr<sup>181</sup> and thr<sup>231</sup> epitopes of tau but possesses kinase activity similar to that of HFS in the phosphorylation of Ser<sup>396</sup> and Ser<sup>416</sup> epitopes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. As a result, we believe that synaptic plasticity-related tau phosphorylation may rise abnormally, potentially leading to neurodegenerative changes, in cases where one of the intracellular signaling pathways is primarily altered, even if plasticity remains within normal limits due to the compensatory effect of other intracellular pathways.</p><p id="Par7">The Rho family of small GTPase RhoA and its downstream effector Rho-kinase (ROCK) are considered major regulators of synaptic plasticity and dendritic spine formation, including LTP. Pharmacological inhibition of ROCKs decreases tau phosphorylation in cellular models of tauopathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], and ROCK inhibitors represent a viable therapeutic route for reducing the pathogenic forms of tau protein in tauopathies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. We found that in the presence of the Rho kinase (ROCK) inhibitor, fasudil favors the induction of LTD over LTP. Furthermore, reduced HFS-LTP was accompanied by decreased Thr<sup>181</sup> phosphorylation, while enhanced LFS-LTD was accompanied by decreased Thr<sup>231</sup>. In addition, ser<sup>416</sup> phosphorylation was increased following LTP and LTD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">The mechanism by which ROCKs regulate synaptic plasticity is not fully understood. ROCKs, a member of the serine&#x02009;&#x02212;&#x02009;threonine kinase family, can be activated by small GTPases, the inhibition of which affects the function of many downstream substrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Researchers have identified two mammalian forms of ROCKs, ROCK1 and ROCK2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Because of auto-inhibition, ROCKs are inactive in their native form [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Phosphatase and tensin homologs regulate the ROCK signaling pathway by altering the ability of phosphatidylinositol (PI)&#x02212;3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3) to produce Akt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. When the PI3K/Akt pathway is inhibited, the ROCK pathway is upregulated through Rho, leading to the activation of various enzymes, such as LIM-domain-containing protein kinases (LIMK) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], myosin light chain kinase (MLC), and phosphatase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Numerous studies have demonstrated that LIMKs are involved in both LTP and LTD. For instance, the LIMK1/cofilin pathway affects the trafficking and accumulation of AMPA at the synapse following LTP induction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. However, after inducing LTP, activating the PI3K-Akt pathway inhibits GSK-3&#x003b2; activity, preventing synapses from expressing LTD for up to 1&#x000a0;h [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p id="Par9">The ability to generate activity-dependent synaptic plasticity in a pool of neurons is dynamically regulated by the prior activity history [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Prior activity history established by priming stimulations at low frequencies (1&#x02013;10&#x000a0;Hz) may influence the threshold for subsequent LTP, resulting in LTP inhibition. Although prior investigations have shown that ROCK inhibition promotes LTD expression, its influence on LTP inhibition and related tau phosphorylation remains to be studied.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Experimental animals</title><p id="Par10">Experiments were performed in vivo on adult male Wistar Albino rats aged 2&#x02013;3&#x000a0;months. The guiding principles for the care of laboratory animals approved by the Erciyes University were applied to the care and use of animals. Experimental animals were obtained from the Erciyes University Experimental Research and Application Center (ERAC, Kayseri, Turkey). They were housed in rooms with a controlled environment (20&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C temperature and 60% humidity, lights on at 8:00 and off at 20:00). The rats were fed tap water as drinking water and Purina rodents were fed ad libitum. On the day of the experiment, the rats were anesthetized with urethane and transferred to the experimental room. Sixteen animals were used in this study. The rats were divided into two groups according to the intra-hippocampal infusion solution: saline (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;8) and fasudil (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;8) infusion groups.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Stereotaxic surgery</title><p id="Par11">The rats were anesthetized with urethane (1.2&#x000a0;g/kg) by intraperitoneal injection and then placed on a stereotaxic frame (David Kopf Instruments) and the bite bar was adjusted to match the dorsoventral coordinates at the bregma and lambda. A lengthwise incision was made on the head of each rat and all connective tissues were removed using 3% hydrogen peroxide to expose the bregma. Using a hand drill, the skull in the right hemisphere was removed to expose the brain. Following an 8-mm craniotomy, bipolar stainless steel wire electrodes (127&#x000a0;&#x000b5;m in diameter, insulated except ends) were lowered into the angular bundle of the perforant pathway (PP) according to flat skull stereotaxic coordinates (6.5&#x000a0;mm posterior to bregma, 3.8&#x000a0;mm lateral to the midline). The stimulating electrode was connected to the output of a stimulus isolator (World Precision Instruments, USA).

This metaplastic inhibition of LTP was previously demonstrated in the cornu ammonis 1 (CA1) region of hippocampus slices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Metaplasticity appears to be critical for maintaining synaptic memory traces and synaptic plasticity within a dynamic range [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The specific mechanisms of metaplasticity remain unclear; however, a decrease in successive LTP appears to be based on NMDA activity and lasts from to 30&#x02013;90&#x000a0;min [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. An attractive explanation for NMDAR-dependent metaplasticity is the long-term alteration of enzymes that regulate synaptic plasticity by previous synaptic &#x0201c;priming&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. We previously reported that both HFS-induced neuronal plasticity and LFS-induced neuronal plasticity were attenuated by fasudil, an inhibitor of Rho-associated kinases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The present study describes the ability of the DG to produce LTP at synapses that have been primed with low-frequency activity and demonstrates that metaplastic inhibition of LTP is defective under pharmacological inhibition of ROCK by fasudil. Considered together with our previous study, the present findings support the important role of the Rho/ROCK signaling network in the regulation of synaptic plasticity (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Inhibition of the Rho/ROCK signaling pathway has also been shown to improve LTP deficiencies associated with certain neuropathologies. In an experimental study using a brain ischemia model, long-term inhibition of ROCK improved the impaired LTP by regulating gamma-aminobutyric acid A (GABA A) and GABA B receptors in the brain tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The neuroprotective effects of fasudil may also be due to decreased cerebral blood flow, inflammatory responses, tau phosphorylation, actin cytoskeleton reorganization, and apoptosis. In addition to these neuroprotective effects, our study indicates an inhibitory effect of locally applied fasudil on the metaplastic control of neuronal activity.</p><p id="Par29">In this study, the findings obtained from the control group showed that LFS inhibits synaptic LTP but cannot prevent the potentiation of neuronal output. The LTP of the EPSP provides direct information about synaptic plasticity, as it depends on presynaptic inputs. However, LTP of the PS represents an increase in the number of neurons that fire simultaneously, depending on alterations in intrinsic excitability and synaptic strength. Therefore, it can be argued that the LTP suppressing effect of LFS occurs mostly at the synaptic level, independent of changes in neuronal excitability. In contrast, fasudil appears to prevent the inhibitory effect of LFS at the synapse level but does not affect neuronal excitability. The increasing effect of fasudil on synaptic protein expression appears to be consistent with our findings. Fasudil enhances the expression of PSD-95 and Syn in oxygen-glucose-deprived SH-SY5Y cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. However, fasudil may also affect synaptic transmission via a presynaptic mechanism. A study of primary rat hippocampal cultures found that fasudil does not alter postsynaptic structure but accelerates vesicle turnover and decreases the number of released vesicles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. In contrast, regulation of neuronal excitability is mainly achieved by voltage-gated K channels. Although the vasorelaxant effect of fasudil is attributed to the selective activation of vascular Kv7.4/Kv7.5&#x000a0;K<sup>+</sup> channels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], the present study does not support the long-term effect of fasudil on K<sup>+</sup> channels.</p><p id="Par30">Priming the presynaptic input immediately before HFS administration alters the form of plasticity to expressed in postsynaptic neurons. The current study showed that LTP, which is expected to be expressed after HFS, is inhibited by LFS. Moreover, fasudil prevented metaplastic inhibition of synaptic LTP. It is difficult to assess whether there is a relationship between the metaplastic effects and fasudil without data on the effect of fasudil on LTP. Our previous research indicated that fasudil reduced HFS-induced neuronal plasticity while leaving the baseline synaptic strength unaffected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], whereas the current study demonstrated that the inhibitory effect of low-frequency stimulation on long-term potentiation caused by high-frequency stimulation was prevented by fasudil administration. These findings not only demonstrate the contribution of Rho-kinases to synaptic plasticity but also support the dependence of the effect on the induction method.</p><p id="Par31">GSK-3&#x003b2; is an unusual enzyme because it has high basal activity, which is primarily determined by the phosphorylation status of the Ser<sup>9</sup> epitope. The dephosphorylation of this residue by Ser/Thr protein phosphatases leads to further activation of GSK3&#x003b2;, whereas phosphorylation of ser<sup>9</sup> by a variety of kinases results in inhibition of its activity. Our molecular findings indicated that fasudil-induced disinhibition of metaplastic LTP is accompanied by a decrease in the inhibitory phosphorylation of GSK-3&#x003b2;. As GSK-3&#x003b2; is an effective tau kinase, this effect is expected to be accompanied by an increased tau phosphorylation pattern. Indeed, fasudil significantly reduced phosphorylation of the Ser<sup>396</sup> and Ser<sup>199</sup>-Thr<sup>202</sup> residues. Fasudil, however, significantly reduced phosphorylation of the Ser<sup>396</sup> and Ser<sup>202</sup>-Thr<sup>205</sup> residues. In contrast, in our previous study, fasudil down-regulated Thr<sup>181</sup>-Tau expression levels after HFS and Thr<sup>231</sup>-Tau expression levels after LFS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Although these findings indicate the importance of tau phosphorylation in synaptic regulation, more detailed studies are required to understand the relationship between metaplastic LTP inhibition and tau phosphorylation.</p><p id="Par32">In neurodegenerative diseases, tau aggregation is associated with post-translational modifications. An increase in tau phosphorylation may affect the hydrophilicity, spatial conformation, and stability of the tau protein, promoting tau protein aggregation and the formation of neurofibrillary tangles. These tangles are characterized by high phosphorylation of tau proteins and are involved in the regulation of microtubule dynamics. Some of the hypotheses regarding abnormal phosphorylation of Tau proteins include phosphorylation of Tau by GSK-3&#x003b2; or cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5), and other Tau-related kinases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In previous studies, selective inhibition of ROCKs has been shown to alleviate the pathologies caused by tauopathies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. ROCKs are considered therapeutic targets for several neurodegenerative disorders, including stroke, Alzheimer&#x02019;s, disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], Parkinson&#x02019;s disease (PD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Although the findings of this study were obtained from healthy young adult rats, reduced tau phosphorylation accompanying metaplastic regulation suggests a protective effect of fasudil-induced ROCK inhibition.</p><p id="Par33">As a result, this study is the first to show that ROCKs are involved in metaplastic LTP regulation. Based on our findings, we speculate that fasudil disrupts processes that prevent LTP from reaching saturation levels by altering tau phosphorylation. These findings highlight the need for detailed studies to evaluate ROCKs as therapeutic targets for neurodegenerative diseases.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher's note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><p>C.S.: Responsible for the study design and electrophysiological studies, H.S.: Responsible for research, material preparation, and western blot, E.B.: Responsible for data processing and writing, N.D.: Responsible for methodology and supervision.
