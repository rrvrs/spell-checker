The incidence, mortality, and prognosis of esophageal cancer show significant variation across age groups, sexes, and geographical regions [<xref rid="tca70082-bib-0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. While the disease is predominantly diagnosed in older adults, there has been a concerning rise in early&#x02010;onset esophageal cancer (EOEC) [<xref rid="tca70082-bib-0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="tca70082-bib-0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="tca70082-bib-0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], defined as occurring in individuals under 50&#x02009;years of age [<xref rid="tca70082-bib-0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="tca70082-bib-0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. This trend has been observed in several regions, including both high and low socio&#x02010;economic settings, and has been linked to a complex interplay of risk factors, including smoking, alcohol consumption, obesity, and gastroesophageal reflux disease [<xref rid="tca70082-bib-0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="tca70082-bib-0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Despite growing awareness of EOEC, the global burden remains inadequately addressed, with a notable gap in studies that focus on younger populations [<xref rid="tca70082-bib-0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Although there is substantial literature on esophageal cancer, several key gaps remain in our understanding of EOEC. First, the risk factors associated with esophageal cancer are well documented for older populations, but there is limited research on how these factors impact younger cohorts differently [<xref rid="tca70082-bib-0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Second, while regional disparities in the burden of EOEC have been reported, the influence of socio&#x02010;economic factors on the disease burden has not been adequately explored [<xref rid="tca70082-bib-0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Socio&#x02010;economic development plays a crucial role in healthcare access, lifestyle behaviors, and cancer prevention strategies. For example, regions with lower socio&#x02010;economic status often lack the infrastructure and resources for early screening, contributing to a higher burden of EOEC. Additionally, socio&#x02010;economic factors, such as income and education levels, have been shown to influence lifestyle behaviors that contribute to the development of EOEC. Understanding these socio&#x02010;economic influences is essential to designing targeted interventions and reducing disparities in EOEC outcomes globally.</p><p>To address these knowledge gaps, this study provides a comprehensive evaluation of the global, regional, and national burden of EOEC from 1990 to 2021, utilizing data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2021 database. By assessing the incidence, mortality, and disability&#x02010;adjusted life years (DALYs) associated with EOEC, stratified by age, sex, and socio&#x02010;demographic index (SDI), this study aims to elucidate global patterns and socio&#x02010;economic influences on EOEC outcomes. Using advanced analytical methods such as joinpoint regression, age&#x02010;period&#x02010;cohort modeling, and frontier analysis, we seek to deepen our understanding of EOEC trends and inform policy decisions aimed at improving cancer prevention, early screening, and control strategies among younger individuals. This study is timely and essential, especially in light of the projected increase in EOEC burden due to ongoing socio&#x02010;economic disparities and insufficient healthcare resources in certain regions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="tca70082-sec-0006"><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><sec id="tca70082-sec-0007"><label>2.1</label><title>Overview</title><p>This study is part of GBD 2021, which assessed the burden of 371 diseases, injuries, and 88 risk factors across 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2021 [<xref rid="tca70082-bib-0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].

In accordance with the International Classification of Diseases, 10th edition (ICD&#x02010;10), all cancers coded C15.0&#x02013;C15.9, D00.1, and D13.0 were classified as esophageal cancers [<xref rid="tca70082-bib-0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].

Disability weights ranged from 0 (representing full health) to 1 (representing death). Given that GBD 2021 includes esophageal cancer cases only for individuals aged 20 and above, and EOEC is typically defined as occurring in individuals under 50, our study focuses specifically on individuals aged 20&#x02013;49 (defined as early&#x02010;onset esophageal cancer, EOEC). We obtained data on incidence, mortality, and DALYs for EOEC from the Global Health Data Exchange (<ext-link xlink:href="https://ghdx.healthdata.org/gbd-results-tool" ext-link-type="uri">https://ghdx.healthdata.org/gbd&#x02010;results&#x02010;tool</ext-link>), stratified by age, sex, and region, along with DALYs attributable to various risk factors, including their 95% uncertainty intervals (UI).</p></sec><sec id="tca70082-sec-0009"><label>2.3</label><title>Estimation of Mortality, Incidence, and <styled-content style="fixed-case" toggle="no">DALYs</styled-content>
</title><p>GBD 2021 employed a comprehensive and systematic approach to estimate mortality, incidence, and DALYs associated with esophageal cancer. The GBD database first consolidates mortality data from various sources, including vital registration systems, verbal autopsy, and cancer registry data, which are standardized to ensure comparability across sources. Cause&#x02010;specific models, such as the Cause of Death Ensemble model (CODEm), are used to estimate esophageal cancer deaths by age, sex, year, and geographic location. Incidence data are derived from cancer registries and other relevant sources, and modeled alongside death data to calculate DALYs.

</title><p>We calculated and reported the proportion of esophageal cancer DALYs attributable to smoking, alcohol consumption, low vegetable intake, and chewing tobacco. The definitions of these risk factors and their relative risk for esophageal cancer have been detailed previously [<xref rid="tca70082-bib-0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Additionally, the SDI was used to assess the relationship between a country's socioeconomic development and the age&#x02010;standardized incidence and mortality rates of EOEC.

Details of the standardization methods are provided in the <xref rid="tca70082-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supporting Information</xref>. To comprehensively assess the burden of EOEC, we analyzed trends in incidence, mortality, and DALYs at global, regional, and national levels from 1990 to 2021. Annual percent change (APC) and average annual percent change (AAPC), along with their corresponding 95% CI, were calculated using joinpoint regression analysis (see the <xref rid="tca70082-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supporting Information</xref>) [<xref rid="tca70082-bib-0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="tca70082-bib-0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Conversely, an APC or AAPC estimate with a 95% CI upper bound below zero suggests a downward trend. If the 95% CI for APC or AAPC includes zero, it indicates a stable trend.</p><p>The association between EOEC burden and SDI across 21 regions and 204 countries and territories was assessed using smoothing spline models. The computation accounting for SDI and disease rates in each location produced the predicted values. The Locally Weighted Scatterplot Smoothing method, which automatically calculates the degree, number, and placement of nodes based on data and span parameters, was used to fit smooth splines. <italic toggle="yes">R</italic> indices and <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> values for the age&#x02010;standardized rate and SDI association were calculated using Spearman correlation analysis.

This method identifies top&#x02010;performing countries and territories, setting standards and objectives for others. The &#x0201c;effective difference&#x0201d; (the difference between current and potential EOEC burden) for each country and territory was computed, accounting for SDI.</p><p>Lastly, the age&#x02010;period&#x02010;cohort model within the maximum likelihood framework, along with the Bayesian age&#x02010;period&#x02010;cohort (BAPC) model using nested Laplace approximations, was employed to forecast the future disease burden from 2022 to 2050 [<xref rid="tca70082-bib-0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="tca70082-bib-0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].

By concentrating on individuals aged 20&#x02013;49, we aimed to provide specific insights into the dynamics and determinants of EOEC in younger populations. The analysis yielded several key findings: firstly, a significant overall decline in the incidence, mortality, and DALYs associated with EOEC was observed globally, with the most substantial reductions occurring between 2003 and 2007. Secondly, considerable geographic variation was noted in the burden of EOEC, with Southern Sub&#x02010;Saharan Africa exhibiting the highest incidence, mortality, and DALY rates, whereas Andean Latin America demonstrated the lowest. Thirdly, sex&#x02010;based disparities were evident, with men demonstrating consistently higher rates across all measures compared to women. The association between EOEC burden and the SDI highlighted the impact of socio&#x02010;economic development on disease outcomes. This research contributes novel insights by examining the intersection between EOEC burden and socio&#x02010;economic disparities, which has been less examined in prior studies. Furthermore, the temporal analysis of global, regional, and national trends offers a comprehensive understanding of how public health initiatives, socio&#x02010;economic development, and modifications in risk factors have shaped EOEC outcomes over the past three decades. Moreover, this study applied frontier and predictive analyses, providing essential perspectives on the future trajectory of EOEC burden, which could inform global cancer control strategies.</p><p>The observed decline in ASIR, ASMR, and DALYs for EOEC from 1990 to 2021 aligns with previous studies indicating reductions in esophageal cancer incidence in high&#x02010;income regions, attributable to advances in cancer screening, early detection, and the mitigation of high&#x02010;risk behaviors such as smoking and alcohol consumption [<xref rid="tca70082-bib-0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="tca70082-bib-0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].

Our study extends these findings by highlighting that while the global trend is declining, there are regions still struggling with high burdens, possibly due to a lack of healthcare resources, poor cancer awareness, and continued exposure to risk factors such as tobacco and alcohol.</p><p>Our results indicated a significant disparity between men and women, with men showing consistently higher incidence, mortality, and DALY rates than women. This finding is consistent with the work of Schneider et&#x000a0;al., who reported a predominance of esophageal cancer in males, which they attributed to the higher prevalence of tobacco and alcohol use among men [<xref rid="tca70082-bib-0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Moreover, Lagergren et&#x000a0;al. identified that lifestyle factors such as smoking and alcohol consumption, which are more prevalent among males, are major risk factors for esophageal adenocarcinoma, further reinforcing our findings [<xref rid="tca70082-bib-0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Similarly, Patel et&#x000a0;al. also reported that men are at higher risk of developing EOEC, and our findings corroborate this pattern globally [<xref rid="tca70082-bib-0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>Regarding age&#x02010;specific differences, our study revealed that the incidence, mortality, and DALYs rates for EOEC increased with age within the 20&#x02013;49 age group, with men in the 35&#x02013;39 age group and women in the 40&#x02013;44 age group showing the steepest declines. These observations align with the findings of Hur et&#x000a0;al., who reported that younger cohorts have benefited more from risk reduction interventions, particularly in high&#x02010;income regions where public health campaigns targeting smoking cessation have been effective [<xref rid="tca70082-bib-0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>The inverse relationship between SDI and EOEC burden observed in this study underscores the impact of socio&#x02010;economic development on reducing disease incidence and improving survival outcomes. This observation is in agreement with Holmes and Vaughan, who showed that regions with higher socio&#x02010;economic status generally experienced lower incidence and mortality rates due to better healthcare access, higher health literacy, and greater availability of cancer screening programs [<xref rid="tca70082-bib-0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The significant reduction in EOEC burden in countries like Kazakhstan and the Republic of Korea, which demonstrated the sharpest declines in ASIR, ASMR, and ASDR, suggests that sustained socio&#x02010;economic improvements and effective public health policies have positively impacted these countries [<xref rid="tca70082-bib-0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>However, some regions, such as Central and Eastern Europe, exhibited higher&#x02010;than&#x02010;expected EOEC burdens despite having higher SDI, a finding consistent with the work of Vaughan et&#x000a0;al. who attributed these elevated rates to cultural and lifestyle factors, including high alcohol consumption [<xref rid="tca70082-bib-0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Additionally, Castro et&#x000a0;al. reported that high alcohol consumption in these regions has historically contributed to high esophageal cancer rates, which explains why socio&#x02010;economic improvements alone have not sufficed in reducing the burden in these areas [<xref rid="tca70082-bib-0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>The current study identified smoking, alcohol use, low vegetable intake, and chewing tobacco as significant contributors to the global EOEC burden. These findings align with previous research emphasizing the role of lifestyle factors in the development of esophageal cancer [<xref rid="tca70082-bib-0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="tca70082-bib-0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Recent studies have highlighted that obesity, often associated with poor diet and sedentary lifestyles, is becoming an increasingly important risk factor for EOEC, especially in high&#x02010;income regions, where rising incidence trends have been observed in younger populations [<xref rid="tca70082-bib-0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Similarly, Lagergren and Holmes identified smoking and alcohol use as major risk factors, particularly for esophageal adenocarcinoma, which is more prevalent in younger individuals [<xref rid="tca70082-bib-0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="tca70082-bib-0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>Interestingly, our findings also indicated that the proportion of DALYs attributable to chewing tobacco has increased in high&#x02010;SDI countries, whereas it has decreased in low&#x02010;SDI countries. This divergence may reflect shifts in social norms and public health policies targeting tobacco use in different regions. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported similar observations, noting that while cigarette smoking has decreased due to public health efforts, the use of alternative tobacco products, such as smokeless tobacco (including chewing tobacco), has remained prevalent, particularly in certain states and demographic groups [<xref rid="tca70082-bib-0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p>The reduction in EOEC burden attributable to dietary risks and tobacco use from 1990 to 2021 is consistent with the findings of Hur et&#x000a0;al. and Castro et&#x000a0;al., both of whom reported that public health initiatives promoting healthy eating and smoking cessation have successfully reduced the prevalence of risk factors for esophageal cancer in high&#x02010;income regions [<xref rid="tca70082-bib-0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="tca70082-bib-0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. However, as our study shows, these improvements are not uniformly distributed, and some regions, particularly those with lower SDI, continue to face high burdens due to persistent risk factors and inadequate public health interventions.</p><p>Our predictive analysis suggests that by 2050, the global burden of EOEC is expected to increase significantly, with Southern Sub&#x02010;Saharan Africa projected to have the highest incidence and mortality rates. These projections highlight the urgency of addressing the modifiable risk factors contributing to EOEC, particularly in regions facing socio&#x02010;economic challenges. The projected increase in EOEC burden is in line with the observations of Schneider et&#x000a0;al., who emphasized the potential impact of population growth and aging, coupled with ongoing exposure to high&#x02010;risk behaviors, on the future burden of esophageal cancer [<xref rid="tca70082-bib-0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>The frontier analysis conducted in this study offers valuable insights into the performance of different countries in managing EOEC burden relative to their level of socio&#x02010;economic development. Similar to the findings of Pohl and Welch, our analysis revealed significant disparities between countries, with some low&#x02010; and middle&#x02010;income countries performing better than expected based on their SDI, while others lagged behind [<xref rid="tca70082-bib-0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. These findings suggest that effective public health interventions and cancer control programs can significantly improve outcomes, even in countries with limited resources.</p><p>This study is distinguished by several strengths. Firstly, it provides a comprehensive assessment of the global, regional, and national burden of EOEC over a 30&#x02010;year period, utilizing the robust and standardized GBD 2021 database. This long&#x02010;term analysis allowed us to identify critical trends and disparities in EOEC burden, providing valuable insights into the evolution of this disease across different socio&#x02010;economic contexts. Secondly, the use of advanced statistical methodologies, including joinpoint regression and age&#x02010;period&#x02010;cohort models, enabled a thorough evaluation of temporal trends and the effects of age, period, and cohort on EOEC outcomes. The inclusion of frontier analysis further added depth to our understanding by comparing the performance of various countries relative to their development, highlighting both successes and areas in need of improvement. Additionally, the predictive analysis to 2050 offers forward&#x02010;looking insights, which are crucial for informing policy decisions and preparing for future healthcare needs. The stratification of data by age, sex, and SDI provides nuanced details that can guide targeted public health interventions, making the study highly relevant for healthcare policymakers and practitioners focused on reducing the EOEC burden.</p><p>Despite these strengths, our study has several limitations. The primary limitation is the reliance on GBD data, which is derived from multiple data sources and modeling techniques, leading to potential biases and inaccuracies, especially in regions with limited data availability. Underreporting and misclassification of cancer cases, particularly in low&#x02010; and middle&#x02010;income countries, may result in underestimation of the true EOEC burden. Additionally, the GBD database only includes individuals aged 20 and above, limiting our ability to analyze EOEC in younger populations and to compare trends across the full age spectrum of esophageal cancer. Another limitation is the attribution of risk factors, which are based on existing literature and assumptions that may not fully capture the complexity of risk exposure across different regions. This could lead to inaccuracies in estimating the relative contributions of individual risk factors to EOEC burden. Moreover, the study did not consider the potential interactions between multiple overlapping risk factors, such as smoking, alcohol consumption, and dietary habits, which often co&#x02010;occur and may collectively influence disease risk. Finally, while the study explores the relationship between SDI and EOEC burden, it does not account for other social determinants of health, such as access to healthcare, education, and urbanization, which could significantly impact disease outcomes.</p><p>In conclusion, our study provides a comprehensive assessment of the global burden of EOEC from 1990 to 2021, highlighting significant declines in incidence, mortality, and DALYs, alongside marked regional and socio&#x02010;economic disparities. These findings highlight the importance of addressing modifiable risk factors and improving healthcare access in low&#x02010;SDI countries. Future research should focus on understanding regional variations and developing targeted public health interventions to reduce the EOEC burden effectively.</p></sec><sec id="tca70082-sec-0020"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>All authors had full access to the data in the study and take responsibility for the integrity of the data and the accuracy of the data analysis.
