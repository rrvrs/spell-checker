</sup> During advance care planning, people receive information about potential health trajectories and treatment options, identify values that are relevant for defining goals of care and what medical outcomes might or might not be acceptable, and often record their results and decisions for future care.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr1-02692163251331168" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
</sup> Evidence compiled by systematic reviews highlights several positive effects of advance care planning, particularly in the context of terminal illness, such as reducing hospitalisation, increasing use of palliative services, increasing concordance between actual care and people&#x02019;s care wishes, and decreasing use of life-sustaining treatment that would drastically lower quality of life.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-02692163251331168" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="bibr3-02692163251331168" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Other reviews suggest shortcomings in the practice.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr4-02692163251331168" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
</sup> Studies show that outcomes of advance care planning are influenced by legislations, institutional policies and cultural factors<sup>
<xref rid="bibr5-02692163251331168" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
</sup> as well by numerous barriers, such as lack of training and time to conduct conversations,<sup>
<xref rid="bibr6-02692163251331168" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
</sup> its inadequate implementation (e.g. offering it too late).<sup>

</sup></p><p>While advance care planning programmes exist in which patients are only provided with decision aids and complete the process by themselves, in most cases, advance care planning relies on a healthcare professional who supports patients to understand, explore and make decisions.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr5-02692163251331168" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
</sup> Recognising the complexity and life-and-death implications of the decisions made during this process, healthcare professionals need to be trained to be able to conduct advance care planning conversations.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr1-02692163251331168" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
</sup> Internationally, these trainings can be designed only narrowly for professionals with clinical duties, mainly doctors<sup>
<xref rid="bibr8-02692163251331168" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
</sup> and nurses,<sup>
<xref rid="bibr9-02692163251331168" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>
</sup> as well as interdisciplinary, open to any professionals working in the healthcare domain, such as social workers.<sup>

<xref rid="bibr1-02692163251331168" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
</sup></p><p>There are specific roles to be played at each moment of advance care planning, that is, when initiating or conducting it, as well as when documenting preferences. The European Association for Palliative Care<sup>
<xref rid="bibr1-02692163251331168" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
</sup> identified six &#x02018;recommended roles and tasks&#x02019; that reflect this complexity: adopting a person-centred approach; having the necessary skills and being open to talk about diagnosis, prognosis, death and dying; providing individuals with clear and coherent information; possibility for non-physician facilitators to be involved in advance care planning; possibility of it being initiated in and outside of health-care settings; involving health-care providers to discuss diagnosis, prognosis, medical options. Specific studies have also looked more in depth into the issue of advance care planning professional roles. Most often, they conjugate roles and responsibilities according to the main profession of the person conducting advance care planning: nurses,<sup>

</sup></p><p>Throughout the literature, the role of leading advance care planning conversations is identified as a critical element of the process and requiring particular competences. As Carr et al.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr18-02692163251331168" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>
</sup> showed, self-efficacy is statistically associated with an increased number of conducted conversations, while knowledge isn&#x02019;t; this shows that practices and engagement are modelled by what facilitators think about themselves. Despite existing guidance, several studies point out the fact that many professionals identify the need to clarify their own role within advance care planning and associate this to a barrier in practicing and implementing it.<sup><xref rid="bibr6-02692163251331168" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="bibr19-02692163251331168" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="bibr20-02692163251331168" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> This highlights the evermore relevance of looking into how professionals understand their roles and how these conceptions are being constructed (e.g. during training but also with experience),</p><sec id="section8-02692163251331168"><title>Aim</title><p>Our aim was to explore how professionals who conduct advance care planning conversations perceive, define and describe their role during advance care planning (what can be identified as &#x02018;role self-ascription&#x02019;).

Interviews in French were transcribed verbatim and those in German were transcribed directly in French. The interview guide was developed by ACS (see <ext-link xlink:href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/suppl/10.1177/02692163251331168" ext-link-type="uri">Supplemental Material 1</ext-link>). It gathered basic sociodemographic information and explored the participant&#x02019;s advance care planning training and current practice, their perceptions about advance care planning and their role within it, and practices, challenges and resources related to communicating with beneficiaries during advance care planning. Participants were invited to open share their experiences and perceptions, without referring to hypothesis or expected results.

Two conversations were inductively coded by the three authors (ACS, MB, a palliative care psychologist and researcher and ERT a medical doctor specialised in geriatrics), independently and in parallel. Codes were assigned to sentences or paragraphs containing several sentences. The team compared and reviewed the codes. This stage was extremely useful in identifying aspects from the interview that relate to how facilitators perceive and experience their roles. We found that establishing a certain level of coherence at this stage was essential, particularly given our different disciplines. Then, ACS conducted an initial inductive descriptive coding of the whole data. ACS subsequently identified and grouped similar codes into broad themes, which she then then differentiated into sub-themes when relevant (i.e. when the theme contained too diverse aspects). Themes were not mutually exclusive of each other and could occur in tandem. Driven by the way in which participants talked about the topic, the themes revolved around two dimensions: (i) what are the roles of facilitators and how they are expressed or made manifest (<xref rid="table1-02692163251331168" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), and (ii) the aspects that led to or characterised these roles (<xref rid="table2-02692163251331168" ref-type="table">Tables 2</xref> and <xref rid="table3-02692163251331168" ref-type="table">3</xref>).

I <bold>accompany</bold> people on the road they want to take and I use my expertise to help&#x02019;, F8). Facilitators provide a concrete aid also in providing with documentation and helping them to put their preferences into writing, for example by identifying the medical decisions that associate with their preferences. As &#x02018;translators&#x02019;, they render terms understandable to individuals and the care choices understandable to healthcare professionals. Facilitators don&#x02019;t give advice about what medical decision might be most suited and don&#x02019;t decide on the person&#x02019;s behalf. Keywords associated to this role category comprise of &#x02018;to facilitate&#x02019;, &#x02018;to accompany&#x02019;, &#x02018;to translate&#x02019;, &#x02018;to help&#x02019;.</p><p>&#x02018;Counsellors&#x02019; recognise their mission as being more directive than that of the facilitator; they give selective information relative to the medical situations and interventions in a way that is considered as relevant for the person, and inform people of what is medically indicated or not (&#x02018;I must help the other person to find the right solution&#x02019;, F9). The counsellor role was also described as related to constructive questioning of individual&#x02019;s decisions when these don&#x02019;t reflect their preferences or when they refer to medically irrelevant acts. Keywords associated to this role category comprise of &#x02018;to counsel&#x02019;, &#x02018;to guide&#x02019;, &#x02018;to support&#x02019;, &#x02018;to coach&#x02019;, &#x02018;to consult&#x02019;.</p><p>This typology is, however, conceptual, since all but one participant referred to endorsing roles from both categories and being, at times, &#x02018;facilitators&#x02019;, and at others, &#x02018;counsellors&#x02019;, according to the situation.

Some need that I ask questions as they are (in the document) and others, I feel, prefer that they are formulated differently, F2). Two other aspects in particular were noted. Firstly, the person&#x02019;s personal &#x02018;degree of self-determination&#x02019;, that is, to what extent they understand their health situation, have reflected about medical options, and have already made choices. People who have already positioned themselves and are knowledgeable about medical technology and their health situation don&#x02019;t require much advice but rather a support to translate and transcribe wishes, while those who are less knowledgeable and undecided or haven&#x02019;t thought of the subject require more active guidance and counselling (&#x02018;There are people whose ideas are sufficiently clear. I try to withdraw as much as possible and just make them realise when there are incoherences (. . .) Others clearly need examples. So in that case, I am more of a guide&#x02019;, F6). Second, the professional&#x02019;s role was also dependent on the person&#x02019;s &#x02018;communication capacity and desires&#x02019;, that is to what extent they welcomed and requested certain information, as well as their ability to process it (&#x02018;We adapt to the patient.

I am ((name)) and I am a nurse and I do ACP in this context&#x02019;, F3).

Certain professions were considered more competent to conduct advance care planning, such as being a clinician or a medical specialist. Another aspect was related to &#x02018;being involved in the care plan&#x02019; of the person. Here, participants noted the challenges of &#x02018;double hatting&#x02019; (being the patient&#x02019;s treating doctor and doing an advance care planning with them): individuals might be less adamant to refuse treatments that facilitators suggest, and facilitators need to prioritise symptom management, which might be disruptive for advance care planning.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="section20-02692163251331168"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="section21-02692163251331168"><title>Main findings</title><p>This study provides evidence about how professionals self-ascribe their role within advance care planning discussions by exploring accounts of how they perceive, define and describe it.

While facilitators put the onus on autonomous decision-making (prioritising the person&#x02019;s right to document their choice independent of medical indications), counsellors focus more on informed decision-making (prioritising the person&#x02019;s need to receive information that is personalised and a clear explanation of what is medically indicated).</p><p>This dual polarisation is by far not representative for most participants, who rather referred to their role shifting dynamically between these two categories, showing that role borders are permeable and that they juggle with a dual attitude. Role ascription is anchored in what the individuals themselves make relevant as needing, as well as in the identity and position of the professional themselves. Professions were deemed important to the point to which some participants didn&#x02019;t initially acknowledge endorsing another advance care planning -specific role than that of their clinical professions. Professionals who do advance care planning with their patients experience certain challenges in maintaining their role (and continuing advance care planning) when patients had symptoms in need of tending. All this shows that competences and stances from main professions overflow the role of professionals. This begs the question of to what extent certain desirable competences for advance care planning professionals are found within specific professions, and, more globally, of the place of communication as professional competence.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr33-02692163251331168" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>

</sup></p><p>Role fluctuation can be challenging, since it requires a lot of adaptation and flexibility. Role boundaries are permeable, with specific practices or activities being conjugated in a way that tend more towards one role than another.

</sup> highlight, to this regard, the importance of the concept of &#x02018;liminality&#x02019;, that is, the experience of role transition, or rather when a person feel &#x02018;betwixt and between&#x02019; roles. Ibarra and Obodaru argue that liminal experiences can be more or less institutionalised, and, in particular, that under-institutional liminal experiences are subjectively more challenging for individuals (because they have less guidance and support) but have a greater potential for identity growth (since they allow more room for individual agency and creativity). More research is necessary to explore dimensions such as shifting from professional roles to ACP roles as well as shifting between the typologised ACP roles.</p></sec><sec id="section24-02692163251331168"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>This study explores how professionals self-ascribe roles during advance care planning discussions, a topic that has been under-researched. Its strengths reside in the diversity of participants (clinicians and one non-clinician), and in the inductive approach used for data analysis, that allowed to be faithful to participants&#x02019; experience. This study also has limitations. Firstly, a greater number of participants would have allowed to reach a more granular analysis. Indeed, role flexibility generates a diversity of patterns in which participants would experience and understand their roles. Furthermore, we only captured participants&#x02019; subjective point of view, but we acknowledge that a more naturalistic approach would be more informative (e.g. relying on recorded advance care planning conversations) to develop an understanding of role dynamics. Only one of the participants was not a clinician. Since profession seems to be an important factor in role ascription, important questions related to the relevance of the clinical background are eschewed. Finally, the sample size of healthcare professions other than nursing (4/14) is too small to generalise with confidence. However, given that ACP is overwhelmingly done by nurses in the jurisdiction from which the participants were drawn, this somewhat mitigates the concern.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="section25-02692163251331168"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Roles that professionals undertake during advance care planning encounters can be aggregated in two overarching categories, &#x02018;facilitators&#x02019; and &#x02018;counsellors&#x02019;, according to whether they prioritise autonomous decision-making or informed decision-making. In practice, however, roles fluctuate between these two categories, according to individual-related aspects (to what extent the person is informed and eager to engage in autonomous decisions, and what their communication capacity and desires are) or professional-related aspects (their clinical or non-clinical profession and their involvement in the individual&#x02019;s care plan). This means that advance care planning requires professionals to be very adaptable and flexible throughout the process in order to identify the role that they can invest in each situation. Additionally, our results also show that the professionals themselves distinguish between the roles of facilitator and counsellor, which has ethical implications in terms of responsibility. Training and further research need to take into consideration this complexity and address it explicitly.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="section26-02692163251331168" specific-use="figshare"><title>Supplemental Material</title><supplementary-material id="suppl1-02692163251331168" position="float" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>sj-docx-1-pmj-10.1177_02692163251331168 &#x02013; Supplemental material for Role self-ascription of professionals conducting advance care planning conversations: A thematic analysis</title></caption><media xlink:href="sj-docx-1-pmj-10.1177_02692163251331168.docx"/><p>Supplemental material, sj-docx-1-pmj-10.1177_02692163251331168 for Role self-ascription of professionals conducting advance care planning conversations: A thematic analysis by Anca-Cristina Sterie, Mathieu Bernard, Ralf J Jox and Eve Rubli Truchard in Palliative Medicine</p></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank the study participants for sharing their experiences and the team of the Service of palliative and supportive care and of the Chair of geriatric palliative care of the Lausanne University Hospital for their support before, during and after the piloting of this study.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Consent and data sharing:</bold> All participants provided oral and written informed consent.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Data availability:</bold> Transcripts may be available from the first author upon reasonable request.</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>The author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding:</bold> The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: For this study ACS was awarded the K&#x000e4;the Zingg-Schwichtenberg fund of the Swiss Academy of Medical Sciences.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Ethical approval:</bold> Ethical approval was received from the regional Ethics Committee (2020-01922).</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>ORCID iDs:</bold> Anca-Cristina Sterie <inline-graphic xlink:href="10.1177_02692163251331168-img1.jpg"/>
