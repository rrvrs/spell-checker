Assessment schemes have been developed in response to this need. We report here an initial assessment of the reliability of all globally known cases of proposed human-induced earthquakes and invite specialists on particular cases to refine these results. 1235 cases were assessed, requiring over 1000&#x000a0;h of work. From the 881 cases for which scorable evidence is available, we class 87% as &#x02018;Confidently Induced&#x02019;, 10% as &#x02018;Probably Induced&#x02019;, 2% as &#x02018;Equivocal&#x02019; and &#x0003c;&#x02009;1% as &#x02018;Confidently Natural&#x02019;. The most seismogenic activities are fracking, research, geothermal, water reservoir impoundment, conventional oil and gas. Least seismogenic activities are construction, deep penetrating bombs, coal bed methane. 354 cases (29%) lack enough information to be assessable. Future work could include applying data mining techniques including natural language processing and AI to uncover new evidence. Future best practice for rapid assessment of cases would ideally involve an independent panel of scientists who rapidly apply a questionnaire scheme, reach consensus, and inform a response.</p><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1038/s41598-024-81632-3.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Natural hazards</kwd><kwd>Solid Earth sciences</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>This paper is a continuation of work originally initiated and funded by the Nederlandse Aardolie Maatschappij BV (NAM), Schepersmaat 2, 9405 TA Assen, The Netherlands.</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer Nature Limited 2024</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Main</title><p id="Par8">Human-induced earthquakes are a global phenomenon caused by various activities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Their negative effects vary from societal nuisance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> to major economic losses and human fatalities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. There are major challenges in predicting the occurrence and magnitude of induced earthquakes. It is, however, very likely that they will become more commonplace as human populations grow and Earth&#x02019;s resources are increasingly exploited. To date, over 1200 scientifically proposed cases of induced seismicity have been documented globally<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. The scientific evidence, and thus the reliability of claims for induced earthquakes, is highly variable in completeness and quality. Temporal trends and bias exist whereby interest in such earthquakes is linked to the proliferation of causative activities and their associated controversies. Global interest, often in terms of opposition, to fracking of shales and other low-permeability petroleum reservoirs expanded from around 2012 and increased public awareness of induced earthquakes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par9">In the absence of universally applicable quantitative approaches to determine case reliability, questionnaire schemes have been developed for specific seismogenic activities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. These have evolved in complexity and applicability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. The most recent such scheme, &#x0201c;Evaluating Proposals of Induced Earthquakes (<italic>E-PIE</italic>)&#x0201d;, was developed to be universally applicable regardless of causative activity. <italic>E-PIE</italic> is objective, based entirely on the strength of claimed evidence, and de-emphasises the personal opinions of the assessor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Such schemes are becoming critical tools for industries where operators and regulators recognise the potential for induced seismicity and need to act rapidly if it occurs.</p><p id="Par10">In this study we provide an initial, comprehensive, standardised evidence assessment of all currently known, worldwide cases of induced seismicity. A single assessor independently applied the <italic>E-PIE</italic> scheme to 1235 proposed cases in the Human-Induced Earthquake Database (<italic>HiQuake</italic>). This publicly available database is the largest and most complete compilation of scientifically proposed human-induced earthquakes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. The assessment took over 1000&#x000a0;h of study. A preferred approach would have been to use an expert panel to assess all 1235 cases, but this would have required excessive resources. The application of a consistent scheme by a single assessor provides a uniform, preliminary set of results suitable for assessing induced seismicity through time and across different industries.</p><p id="Par11">Compromise was required in applying a standardised assessment scheme to the broadest range of cases and the contentious nature of such work. The results should thus be viewed as initial and provisional.

Of the 1235 cases studied, the assessor found there was insufficient evidence to score <italic>any</italic> question for 354 cases (29%). These were scored as &#x02018;no evidence&#x02019; across all nine questions (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, grey dotted area). Such cases are commonly presented in tables without supporting data, a common situation for water reservoir impoundment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, mining<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, conventional oil and gas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> and nuclear explosions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Questions 1&#x02013;4, which refer to the temporal and spatial distributions of the seismicity in relation to the activity, were dominated by induced evidence (45&#x02013;66%). Questions 6&#x02013;9, which refer to auxiliary seismic parameters such as focal mechanisms, seismic swarm evolution and surface deformation, were most lacking of evidence (40&#x02013;65%). Question 5, which relates to pre-industrial seismicity, had the greatest proportion of scores that were &#x02018;equivocal&#x02019; (i.e. regional seismicity occurred before the activity, 33%) and &#x02018;natural&#x02019; (i.e. local seismicity occurred before the activity, 12%).</p><p id="Par13">

We explored the <italic>E-PIE</italic> scores and statistics for each of these activities (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>; Online Methods: <italic>Application of E-PIE scheme</italic>). There was significant overlap in the range of <italic>E-PIE</italic> scores for cases within most activities. However, there were differences between activities. Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> shows activities in order of reducing median <italic>E-PIE</italic> score. Cases in fracking, research, oil and gas/waste fluid injection, and groundwater extraction mostly lay in the Confidently Induced range with fracking being most numerous. Cases in waste fluid disposal, geothermal, and carbon capture and storage (CCS) activities generally spanned the range from Confidently Induced to Probably Induced. Cases in oil and gas, chemical explosions, mining, water reservoir impoundment, conventional oil and gas, and nuclear explosions activities were mostly within the Probably Induced range. Construction lies on the boundary between Probably Induced and Equivocal, whilst deep penetrating bombs was mostly within the Equivocal range. Coal bed methane (CBM) comprises a single case entirely within the natural range. Nuclear explosions contained the highest-scored case (the Cannikin test: 1.00). The lowest scored case is the Center, Texas, waste fluid disposal case where the earthquake sequence began before the industrial activity.

The most seismogenic activities are fracking, research, geothermal (i.e. stimulation, production, injection and circulation), water reservoir impoundment, and conventional oil and gas.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Key questions for determining induced or natural cause</title><p id="Par23">The majority of evidence presented in favour of induced seismicity relates to <italic>E-PIE</italic> questions 1&#x02013;4 (Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) which address the temporal and spatial nature of earthquakes relative to the industrial activity. These four questions are the most influential in determining whether the earthquakes are induced<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. To reflect this importance in <italic>E-PIE</italic>, these questions utilise an exit criterion in question 1 and increased weighting in questions 2&#x02013;4. Questions 5 and 6 examine whether the area was seismically active prior to the implicated activity (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). If so, this weakens the case that earthquakes were induced (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). These questions are least prominent in the evaluation of mining and water reservoir impoundment cases where pre-existing seismicity is commonly not considered or presented. Questions 7&#x02013;9 provide the opportunity to add evidence from additional data (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). These data may comprise analyses not yet developed, thus ensuring <italic>E-PIE</italic> remains applicable if new methods are developed. These questions also enable inclusion of diverse information from a range of activities. Well-documented activities including fracking, geothermal, groundwater extraction, nuclear explosions, oil and gas, research, waste fluid disposal, and water reservoir impoundment commonly provide evidence that can be input into these questions.</p><p id="Par24"><italic>E-PIE</italic> scores vary widely within each activity class (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). The median score and interquartile range for each activity distinguishes the least-seismogenic (construction, deep penetrating bombs and coal bed methane) from more-seismogenic activities. The single coal bed methane case is the only one scored as natural because of the earthquakes&#x02019; distance and the induced stress field being incompatible with the focal mechanism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. There is significant overlap in the results for the remaining activity classes such that the <italic>E-PIE</italic> score of any individual case is not a reliable indicator of the claimed activity. This implies that for induced seismicity in areas of mixed activity, the assessment results cannot be used to determine the causative activity.</p><p id="Par25">The ranking of activities based on their median score (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>) provides an indication of the likelihood seismicity was induced when considering the evidence collated within <italic>HiQuake</italic> and the variable numbers of individual cases within each activity. The interquartile range for each activity provides insight into scoring consistency during this initial assessment. Considering median and interquartile range in this context, fracking (409 cases), oil and gas/waste fluid injection (4 cases), and research (14 cases) are scored as Confidently Induced with relatively narrow ranges due to consistently comprehensive documentation of evidence.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Utilisation of E-PIE and other questionnaire schemes</title><p id="Par26">Major advantages of questionnaire schemes such as <italic>E-PIE</italic> are their simplicity and rapid application. Whereas detailed scientific studies might provide more robust assessments, rarely are these possible within the hours to days required by operators or regulatory bodies during activities. This problem was highlighted by the 2022 M<sub>W</sub> 5.2 Peace River earthquake, Alberta, Canada. The Alberta Energy Regulator initially stated the earthquake was natural<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> but later conclusively demonstrated it was induced by wastewater disposal. The latter conclusion was also reached retrospectively by an expert panel applying both the Verdon<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> and <italic>E-PIE</italic> schemes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par27">Rapid assessment holds value in sometimes producing unexpected results that may prompt further examination and discussion. Best practice for rapid assessment of potentially induced earthquakes may comprise a readily available independent panel of scientists across regulation, industry, and academia. Panel members may apply the same questionnaire scheme and consensus may inform the course of action. A statistical analysis of the variation in questionnaire results between individual scientists and schemes, and the effect of averaging results, has been presented<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. An independent panel could also debate historic cases of induced seismicity. Repeat assessments of cases by the same, or new panels, could be carried out as needed to consider new observations, data, and/or analytical methods.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Cases lacking published evidence</title><p id="Par28">A significant proportion (29%) of cases in <italic>HiQuake</italic> lack supporting evidence, despite being proposed in scientific literature, and thus could not be assessed using <italic>E-PIE</italic>. These cases are commonly listed in published tables of known induced seismicity and hence included in <italic>HiQuake</italic>. They are prevalent in the activities water reservoir impoundment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, mining<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, conventional oil and gas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> and nuclear explosions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Cases may be based on general opinion, or the supporting evidence may lie in un-referenced or unpublished material. We made every effort to include all material available during the assessment process. However, significant potential clearly exists to extend the results to these cases by applying data mining techniques such as natural language processing and artificial intelligence to uncover new or overlooked evidence in the vast literature that now exists.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Online methods</title><sec id="Sec13"><title>Application of the E-PIE scheme</title><p id="Par29">The <italic>E-PIE</italic> questionnaire scheme<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) was applied to the entire <italic>HiQuake</italic> database of proposed human-induced earthquakes. <italic>HiQuake</italic> contained 1235 cases as of 10th December 2021, the version used for this study. A single assessor with a Ph.D. in earthquake seismology worked for around 1000&#x000a0;h over a 20-month period to perform this task. To facilitate the assessment process and data management of the results, <italic>E-PIE</italic> was coded into an interactive form. Using this form, each of the nine questions in <italic>E-PIE</italic> must be answered with one of four responses: &#x02018;no data&#x02019;, &#x02018;natural&#x02019;, &#x02018;equivocal&#x02019; or &#x02018;induced&#x02019;. Answers represent the evidence proposed in the scientific literature and not the assessor&#x02019;s opinion of this evidence. In this way, the results are as objective as possible.</p><p id="Par30">The scientific literature used to assess each case was illustrative, not comprehensive, due to the vast volume that exists for many cases. For publication-rich cases only prominent and commonly cited literature (e.g. publications in leading peer-reviewed scientific journals commonly cited throughout induced seismicity research) were included. In cases where no data were found to answer any <italic>E-PIE</italic> question, the case was labelled &#x02018;insufficient evidence&#x02019; to distinguish it from cases where individual questions are scored &#x02018;no data&#x02019;. In the rare instances where proposed evidence for a question was contradictory, the assessor prioritised the proposed evidence relating to the most rigorous scientific process, including validation of results using additional methodologies. Where proposed evidence was contradictory but considered of equal credibility the assessor recorded a response of &#x02018;equivocal&#x02019;.</p><p id="Par31">To visualise and interpret the collective results of the <italic>E-PIE</italic> assessments, a single quantifiable score was calculated for each case<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> as follows. The following scores were applied to the response to each question: 0 for a (no data), -1 for b (natural), 0 for c (equivocal), and 1 for d (induced). The scores are then normalised by their <italic>E-PIE</italic> weightings for each question (Questions 1 and 5&#x02013;9 are each weighted 1/36th and questions 2, 3 and 4 are each weighted 10/36th ). Summing produces an aggregate score analogous to the Induced Assessment Ratio (IAR)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. The weighted proportion of &#x02018;no data&#x02019; responses is totalled and subtracted from 1 to produce a value of &#x02018;coverage&#x02019; in the range of 0 to 1. The aggregate score is then multiplied by the coverage to produce the final <italic>E-PIE</italic> score in the range &#x02212;&#x02009;1 (natural), through 0 (equivocal) to +&#x02009;1 (induced).</p><p id="Par32">The results were interpreted by question and activity. For each of the 16 activities, summary statistics of the minimum, maximum, first quartile, third quartile and median value were calculated.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Cluster analysis</title><p id="Par33">Calculated <italic>E-PIE</italic> scores of the 1235 <italic>HiQuake</italic> cases yield a continuum from natural (-1), through equivocal (0), to induced (+&#x02009;1). Clustering exists within this continuum, providing an objective way to informally group and reference cases. Jenks Natural Break Optimisation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> was used to determine discrete clusters, whereby the variance within each cluster is minimised while the variance between clusters is maximised. The optimisation is expressed as the Goodness of Variance Fit (GVF), with values calculated for cluster sizes two through eight. Four clusters, with GVF of 0.93, were selected as the minimum number of clusters with sufficient GVF. This maintained most cluster break points in the six- and seven-cluster optimisations, while minimising inter-cluster spacing (Figure <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>a, Table <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S2</xref>, Figure S5). Kernel density estimation (KDE)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> was conducted for the <italic>HiQuake</italic> population, which supports the four-cluster optimisation (Figure <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>b).</p><p id="Par34">We checked for underlying clustering inherent to the <italic>E-PIE</italic> scheme by producing a population of all possible permutations of <italic>E-PIE</italic> (Figure S3a) and by taking a random subset of the 1235 scores (Figure S3b). Comparable cluster analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> and KDE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> was conducted with the random subset (Figure S4a, S4b) and the results compared to those utilising the <italic>HiQuake</italic> population (Figure S5). Cluster break points within the random subset and <italic>HiQuake</italic> populations were found not to coincide and crucially the <italic>HiQuake</italic> clusters spanned break points from the random subset in multiple cases across all cluster optimisations (Figure S5). This demonstrates that clustering inherent to the <italic>E-PIE</italic> scheme did not significantly influence the <italic>HiQuake</italic> population and the resultant cluster analysis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Logical conflicts</title><p id="Par35">The nine <italic>E-PIE</italic> questions were answered independently by the assessor. Each question is designed to be independent and not overlap logically with other questions since this would result in some data being counting twice (with the exception of question 1 when the response &#x02018;natural&#x02019; is selected<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>). The combinations of plausible logical conflicts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> within <italic>E-PIE</italic> are shown in Table S6. &#x02018;Natural&#x02019; responses to questions 1, 2, 3 or 7 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) imply a natural origin is required and &#x02018;induced&#x02019; responses to questions 4 or 7 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) imply an induced origin is required. All other responses allow ambiguity in the final result and so either solution is permitted.</p><p id="Par36">A conditional statement was used to search for logical conflicts within the assessor&#x02019;s responses for each case. A logical conflict exists if the following conditional statement (written here in no specific code) is met:</p><p id="Par37">
