Thus, recovery from psychosis entails more than the reduction of psychotic symptoms. When living with a psychotic disorder, people can feel recovered while still experiencing psychotic symptoms (e.g. when hallucinations are perceived in a less stressful way) and vice versa; conversely, the absence of symptoms does not necessarily mean people feel recovered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. This subjective experience of recovery, which is often referred to as personal recovery (PR), is described in the widely endorsed conceptual framework CHIME, an acronym representing five complementary processes that, according to people with severe mental illness (SMI), are instrumental to PR: (1) Connectedness; (2) Hope and optimism about the future; (3) Identity and overcoming stigma; (4) Meaning in life; and (5) Empowerment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Symptoms, adverse childhood experiences and other environmental stressors might have a negative impact on these processes. Moreover, different social aspects of people&#x02019;s experience are important to several of the elements of PR, particularly Connectedness, which includes interpersonal relationships and social inclusion; and Identity, whose rebuilding mostly takes place within the context of stigma and discrimination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">Of all patients with SMI, those with psychosis battle with the highest levels of public stigma. Furthermore, they experience high rates of trauma, and, in many cases, limited social networks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. It was shown by a thematic synthesis of qualitative research from the patients&#x02019; perspective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] that these patients face two particular barriers to PR: social exclusion and stigma, whether perceived or internalized.</p><p id="Par7">The role of social factors in the onset of psychosis has been well established. The factors in question include social exclusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], childhood adverse events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], and social rank [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. As a result, an increasing body of recovery-oriented interventions in psychosis now focus on interpersonal factors and social functioning. Some examples are family interventions, including psychoeducation about psychosis and engaging both patients and family in this [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], resource groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] and individual placement and support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">Although such interventions proceed from the principle that recovery is promoted by strengthening social networks and social functioning, a meta-analysis of factors associated specifically with PR in psychosis found relatively weak effect sizes for its relationship with social factors (social support 0.28; work &#x00026; housing 0.23; and psychosocial functioning 0.31) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. These weak associations might indicate that social involvement either has a limited effect on PR, or that it may affect PR differently in different people. One such difference among psychotic disorder patients may be their personality traits.</p><p id="Par9">Although we could not find studies on the associations between personality traits and PR in psychotic disorder patients, some studies investigated the associations between personality traits and Quality of Life (QoL) in both the general population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] and in psychotic disorder patients. QoL is sometimes viewed as an aspect of PR. A systematic review of the influence of personality traits on QoL in psychotic disorder patients concluded that neuroticism and extraversion were the traits associated with QoL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. More specifically, impaired QoL was found to be associated with high levels of neuroticism in people with psychosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. This was confirmed by Van Dijk et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], who found that higher levels of neuroticism and lower levels of extraversion were associated with lower QoL. Of note, both associations remained stable over time.</p><p id="Par10">Next to the wider literature on the association between personality traits and social functioning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], mixed results were found regarding this in people with psychosis. Social functioning is a broad concept, which is based on both an objective, quantifiable dimension (e.g., such as the ability to meet the social roles associated with being a family member or friend, or vocational engagement); and a subjective dimension comprising self-reported measures of social roles and measures of satisfaction (or of the problems experienced) with family life, recreational activities, and life as a whole [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. To avoid conceptual overlaps with the subjective measurement of PR (such as Connectedness in CHIME), and with the subjective rating of social interaction in personality traits, we limited social functioning to objective, quantifiable dimensions of social involvement. While the study of Boyette et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] indicates a strong role for extraversion in social involvement (e.g. withdrawal), Lysaker and Davis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] found no association at all between extraversion and social involvement (e.g. the frequency of social contact). </p><p id="Par11">Taken together, neuroticism and extraversion may thus be the important factors to focus on when studying the associations between social involvement and PR in psychosis. In this study, we therefore aim to provide insight into the association between social involvement and PR, exploring how it may be influenced by neuroticism and extraversion. Since extraversion indicates a higher degree of sociability, positive emotionality and general activity, we hypothesize it to have a positive moderating effect on the association between social involvement and PR. While neuroticism, indicating the susceptibility to negative affect and psychological distress, and therefore potentially the tendency to withdraw from social interaction, to have a negative moderating effect.</p><p id="Par12">Therefore, we expected: (1) the association between social involvement and PR to be relatively weak, with neuroticism and extraversion having opposite moderating effects on the association, namely; (2) that extraversion would strengthen the association between social involvement and PR; while we expected (3) neuroticism would weaken the association between social involvement and PR.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Participants and study design</title><p id="Par13">This cross-sectional exploratory study used baseline data from the UP&#x02019;S study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], and was reported according to the STROBE guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. UP&#x02019;S is an observational cohort study intended to investigate recovery processes in people with a non-affective psychotic disorder. Participants are followed for ten years. Every year, an assessment takes place in which interactions between different dimensions of recovery are explored (clinical, functional, social and personal recovery). Furthermore, potential determinants of the different recovery dimensions are explored, including for example personality traits. In the current study, we selected the baseline data of participants in UP&#x02019;S recruited between October 2017 and December 2022.</p><p id="Par14">Participants were recruited mainly from outpatient teams of ten mental healthcare institutions in the southwestern Netherlands. The teams that participated in the UP&#x02019;S study consisted of specialized early-episode psychosis services, and Flexible Assertive Outreach Teams (FACT) that provided care for SMI patients, including psychotic disorder patients. The UP&#x02019;S study included patients aged between 18 and 65 years, who had a primary diagnosis of a schizophrenia-spectrum disorder according to DSM-5. Patients with insufficient proficiency of the Dutch language were excluded.</p><p id="Par15">To ensure that inclusion in the study was independent of symptom severity, eligible participants who fulfilled the inclusion criteria at each participating location were selected randomly through a search in the electronic patient files. After evaluation by the clinician involved, student researchers (master&#x02019;s students in psychology or medicine) approached patients to provide information on the study, and to ask their informed consent to participate. These student researchers participated in the teams, and were trained and supervised with regard to assessing, scoring and entering data. See Van Aken et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] for an extensive description of the study protocol. </p><p id="Par16">The UP&#x02019;S study was approved by the Regional Committee for Medical and Health Research Ethics in Rotterdam (Registration code: MEC-2017-340).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Measures</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Sociodemographic and patient characteristics</title><p id="Par17">Sociodemographic data comprised age, gender, employment status, living situation (e.g., alone, with partner, or in an mental health care (MHC) institution). The following patient characteristics were collected: DSM-5 diagnosis, Positive and Negative Symptom Scale-Remission Tool (PANSS-R, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]) scores, and duration of care (years since first contact with MHC).</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Personal recovery</title><p id="Par18">The outcome measure used to examine PR was the Recovery Quality of Life 10-item version (ReQoL-10), a user-friendly patient-reported outcome measure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. This questionnaire contains themes related to concepts of quality of life and recovery in accordance with the CHIME framework, such as hope, belonging and relationships, and autonomy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]; although it was not validated against the CHIME framework, it was recommended as one of the patient-reported outcome measures for PR by the Psychotic Disorders Working Group of the International Consortium for Health Outcomes Measurement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Items score from 0 (none of the time) to 4 (most of the time), or the reverse if items are worded negatively. Sum scores range from 0 (low degree of recovery) to 40 (high degree of recovery). If at least nine out of ten scores had been recorded, missing values were imputed on the basis of the participant&#x02019;s mean score.</p><p id="Par19">For this study we used the Dutch translation of the ReQoL, which showed good internal consistency estimates (Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.862, McDonald&#x02019;s Omega&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.863) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Social involvement</title><p id="Par20">In this study, we conceptualized social involvement as the amount of interaction with others in society, as an aspect of social functioning. Like social functioning, interaction with others has an objective dimension (the frequency of interactions) and a subjective dimension (the perceived quality of these interactions). To quantify social involvement, we selected three questions within the UP&#x02019;S study, that identified the frequency of interactions with others: (1) &#x0201c;How often do you meet friends or good acquaintances?&#x0201d;; (2) &#x0201c;How often do you meet your family or family-in-law?&#x0201d;; and (3) &#x0201c;How often do you spend time on social leisure activities away from home?&#x0201d;, a category that included activities such as visits to catering facilities and hobbies in club-like environments. These interviewer-rated questions were answered on a scale ranging from 0 (daily), 1 (weekly), 2 (at least once a month), 3 (less than once a month), 4 (rarely never), to 5 (I don&#x02019;t have friends/family/leisure activities). To constitute a formative measure for social involvement, the three frequency-related questions were selected from basic questions assessing social determinants (e.g., social contacts, socio-economic status, and working and living situation) that had been developed specifically for the UP&#x02019;s study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], and where each item reflected a specific, related but separate element of social involvement. The answers to these three questions were summarized on an index scale, with lower scores indicating more frequent interactions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Personality traits</title><p id="Par21">Neuroticism and extraversion were assessed using the NEO Five Factor Inventory <italic>(</italic>NEO-FFI-3) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], whose neuroticism and extraversion scales both have acceptable internal consistency. Psychometric properties were also acceptable in a population of psychotic disorder patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. For the neuroticism scale, Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha was 0.842 and McDonald&#x02019;s omega was 0.849; for the extraversion scale, the respective values were 0.743 and 0.725. Total mean scores were calculated from responses on a 5-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree), with higher scores indicating higher levels of the specific trait. Missing values were not imputed.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Analysis</title><p id="Par22">IBM SPSS Statistics (Version 27) was used for all data analysis. Sociodemographic and patient characteristics were summarized, using means and standard deviations or percentages for categorial variables. Correlation analyses were performed using Pearson&#x02019;s or Spearman&#x02019;s correlation coefficients (<italic>r or r</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub><italic>)</italic> Assumptions for linear regression analyses were checked using scatter plots. To check whether the different social involvement questions could be put into one index-score with an equal weighting factor, sensitivity analyses were performed by repeating all regression analyses in different compositions (e.g., an index with question 1 and 2, versus 1, 2 and 3). Even though question 3 (time spent on social leisure activities) had a stronger correlation with PR than questions 1 and 2 (contact with friends and contact with family), the sensitivity analysis revealed very similar results.</p><p id="Par23">To answer the research question, five regression models were conducted. Model 1 included the base model with the direct effect of social involvement on PR. In model 2, we added neuroticism but not extraversion to this base-model, and in model 3, we added extraversion but not neuroticism. To check for moderation effect of the personality traits, models 4 and 5 included the interaction effects of neuroticism and extraversion with social involvement. The incremental validity is indicated by the change in R-square when adding variables to the model.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>Descriptions of the study sample</title><p id="Par24">At the time of data analysis, 320 participants had been included in the UP&#x02019;S study.

These 36 participants did not differ with respect to sample characteristics and baseline scores. The mean age, gender distribution, and living situation of the sample were representative of patients in treated in FACT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. At the time of assessment, participants had mild or no psychotic symptoms, and relatively good PR.

Although social involvement was found to be significantly positively associated with PR, it could, as expected, explain only 6% of the variance in PR. Contrary to our hypotheses, however, neither of the personality traits moderated the association between social involvement and PR. As a result, the weak association between social involvement and PR observed in previous research could not be explained by a moderating effect of neuroticism and extraversion. Furthermore, after addition to the model, neuroticism appeared to have added a considerable proportion of unique variance in PR, while extraversion explained only a modest amount of unique variance.</p><p id="Par30">Despite the growing number of social interventions aiming to increase PR through processes such as enhancing connectedness, and to tackle themes such as social isolation, and perceived social stigma, relatively few studies have explicitly investigated the association between social factors and PR. The relatively weak associations found to date [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], were confirmed by our finding that only a small proportion of the variance in PR was explained by social involvement, defined as the quantity of social interactions in our study. However, PR may in fact depend more on <italic>the quality</italic> of these interactions than the quantity. Not only has the importance of the quality of interaction and social support been stressed in studies of patient accounts of PR in psychosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], there is also some evidence that, in psychosis, the extent of <italic>self-reported</italic> interpersonal interaction and prosocial activities is associated with PR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Our reason for using an interviewer-rated quantitative measure, was based on our desire to avoid conceptual overlap with patient-rated PR (e.g., connectedness). We therefore suggest that future studies assess the quantity and quality of social involvement simultaneously.</p><p id="Par31">Our tentative finding that neuroticism plays a strong negative role in PR, is in line with previous research findings that high levels of neuroticism in people with psychosis were a strong predictor of quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], and that these effects were stronger in patients with psychosis than in controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Neuroticism indicates a susceptibility to negative affect and psychological distress. Affective symptoms consistently have a stronger association with PR than psychotic symptoms do [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]; and, in patients with psychosis, negative affect has a stronger negative association with subjective quality of life than in controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In line with these studies, and more recent findings in individuals at risk for psychosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], our results suggest that PR in people with psychosis may be enhanced by targeting negative emotions and underlying stress factors. Together with our suggestion that PR may depend more on the quality of social interactions, it is possible that PR will be promoted by interventions such as social-skills training, which not only has a direct impact on the quantity of social interactions, but also on the quality, and an indirect impact on negative symptomatology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><p id="Par32">We hypothesized that the small association between social involvement and PR would be facilitated by extraversion, which indicates higher degrees of sociability, positive emotionality and general activity. With regard to PR, we expected that more extraverted patients would tend to place a stronger emphasis on social involvement than patients with lower extraversion scores would. However, although the impact of extraversion on social functioning is well-established in the general population, this association is more ambiguous in people with psychosis; while some studies find no association [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], other studies indicate a stronger role for extraversion in social functioning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. One explanation for this ambiguity might be the fact that social involvement is a broad construct measured in different ways; in the study of Lysaker and Davis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] an interviewer rated instrument was used, while Boyette et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] used a self-reported questionnaire. Moreover, it has been speculated that the positive effects of extraversion on sociability are nullified by high levels of public and perceived stigma in people with psychosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. It is also the case that, like quality of life, PR is a highly subjective construct, which may represent a strong network of close relationships for one person, whereas another person may forego such relationships in favor of personally meaningful activities or accomplishments, such as professional advancement or creative pursuits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Future studies should take account not only of such diversities in social involvement and PR, but also of the potential role of public stigma in psychosis.</p><sec id="Sec14"><title>Limitations</title><p id="Par33">Although the weak association we observed between social involvement and PR is in line with previous research, social involvement, PR, and personality traits are all complex constructs. Our results should therefore be viewed both with caution and with reference to the following potential methodological issues.</p><p id="Par34">Firstly, the fact that we did not assess social involvement with a specific and validated questionnaire is an important limitation in our study. However, low associations were also found between social involvement and PR by several previous studies that <italic>did</italic> use validated questionnaires for this purpose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Nevertheless, other aspects of social functioning such as workplace, vocational engagement and daily routines like shopping for groceries have been neglected in this study and should be included in future research.</p><p id="Par35">The fact that we found no associations between variables may have been due to the characteristics of this psychosis sample, which was characterized by low levels of current psychotic symptoms, and relatively high levels of PR and social interaction. Perhaps only the more symptomatically recovered patients agreed to participate in the study, however, symptom severity in our sample was very similar to that of a study with a resembling population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Although scores on neuroticism and extraversion both showed low variance in our sample, the mean scores and dispersion of the two traits were equally high, and both resembled those of similar samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p><p id="Par36">Another limitation is that we did not look at interactions between traits in personality profiles, but included neuroticism and extraversion as separate traits. It is conceivable that the combination of traits (e.g., low extraversion in combination with high neuroticism) had a stronger impact than the effect of the two traits separately. However, this was not confirmed in the study by Ridgewell et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], which, both separately and in combination, examined the effects of neuroticism and extraversion on quality of life and overall functioning in people with psychosis, and found no difference between the two approaches. These findings, together with the low variance in neuroticism and extraversion scores in our sample, made us decide not to include extra analyses with combination of traits. However, future research should take this into account.</p><p id="Par37">Finally, regarding the use of ReQoL-10 as a PR-questionnaire, the low association with social involvement may have been due to the possibility that the ReQoL-10 places less emphasis on the CHIME process &#x0201c;Connectedness,&#x0201d; as only 1 out of 10 items (&#x0201c;I feel lonely&#x0201d;) reflected connectedness. An earlier meta-analysis, which examined whether the type of PR-questionnaire could explain any heterogeneity between studies regarding the associations between social factors and PR, found that such an influence was marginal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p id="Par38">Our results give rise to four main points of interest for future research. The first stems from the fact that our moderation analysis did not include correction for factors such as negative symptoms and negative affect. Since neuroticism indicates susceptibility to negative affect and psychological distress, we assumed that it might be a reflection of these factors. Future studies should address this.</p><p id="Par39">Second, this was a cross-sectional study. However, clinically relevant answers about causality may be provided by longitudinal research that examines the effect of personality traits&#x02014;especially neuroticism&#x02014;on the association between social involvement and PR over time in psychotic disorders. Although one study found that the association between neuroticism and subjective well-being remained stable over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], more longitudinal research may answer questions such as whether the courses of personal and symptomatic recovery are influenced by a high degree of neuroticism, or whether personality traits are affected by poor recovery. Such research may reveal why trajectories of recovery differ between people, and thus lead to the development of more personalized treatment plans.</p><p id="Par40">Third, although the duration of care in our psychosis sample was relatively long, with a wide range of durations, its distribution did not allow for separate analyses that would make it possible to compare an early-episode group of patients (e.g., the first five years after a first episode of psychosis) with a more chronic group. Perhaps the moderating effect of personality traits increases over time in treatment. Differentiating between an early episode and a longer duration of care group would be all the more interesting, as personality traits generally become stable when individuals reach their early thirties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par41">Finally, questions about the impacts of stigma and rejection in the association between social involvement and PR are raised not only by our finding that extraversion added only a moderate amount of unique variance to the model of PR and social involvement, but also by the ambiguity of findings on the association between extraversion and social functioning in psychosis in the earlier literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Future research in this area might reveal that facilitating PR in psychosis is partly a question of addressing the image of psychosis that prevails in society [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]<italic>.</italic></p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par42">This study showed that levels of social involvement are only marginally associated with PR, and that this lack of a strong association cannot be explained by a moderating effect of neuroticism and extraversion. Our finding that the explained variance of PR was increased particularly by the addition of neuroticism to the model of social involvement and PR, is in line with a large body of literature on the effects of neuroticism on QoL, and illustrates the importance, when treating people with psychosis, of attending to their negative affect and underlying distress. Attending to negative affect and underlying stressors actually constitutes the main target point of several interventions, such as cognitive behavior therapy for psychosis. As our results are based on the quantity of social interactions, they do not undermine the potential importance of the quality of social interaction that patients emphasize in their accounts of PR from psychosis, or of the support they obtain from it.</p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#x02019;s Note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are grateful for the generosity of time and effort by the patients in the UP&#x02019;S study.
