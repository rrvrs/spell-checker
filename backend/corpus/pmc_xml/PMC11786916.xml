In Portugal, approximately 30&#x000a0;% of annual deaths are attributable to CVD, ahead of cancer and respiratory diseases, mostly due to stroke and acute myocardial infarction [<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In addition, CVD is associated with a significant morbidity and socioeconomic burden, manifested by the high costs of diagnostic exams, treatments, and hospital admissions, as well as the loss of productivity, both of patient and their caregivers [<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p id="p0015">Addressing this crucial public health problem is imperative and must start with primary cardiovascular (CV) prevention. Approximately 80&#x000a0;% of CVD related to atherosclerosis can be prevented by improving lifestyle and controlling CV risk factors, being estimated that one out of three deaths can be avoided [<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However, prevention is often underestimated, with low health literacy being one of the main barriers. This lack of awareness and understanding of the importance of CVD among the general population leads to weak involvement in preventive measures. In this setting, it is urgent to implement measures and strategies to place prevention at the top of the healthcare priorities, developing a culture in society that encourages disease prevention and health promotion. The current evidence is unanimous in demonstrating the widespread poor control of the classical CV risk factors, which are highly prevalent in the general population, such as hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidaemia, obesity, smoking, physical inactivity and dietary risk factors [<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p id="p0020">Early detection of these CV risk factors, and risk stratification are essential steps to reduce clinical events. The role of physicians is utmost important for early identification of risk factors, but patients&#x02019; involvement could be also crucial to its recognition. In this context, there are several validated and recommended scores for CV risk stratification frequently applied in clinical practice, especially the SCORE2/SCORE2-OP [<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. As these scores must be applied by physicians, or at least by other health professionals, they might not reach individuals who do not regularly use health services, but already have increased CV risk. The development of risk stratification methodologies allowing self-reporting, ideally based on digital tools and without the need for healthcare facilities, could expand the ability to identify individuals at risk. Self-reported CV risk stratification may be particularly suitable for resource-limited environments, while allowing adjustments in the periodicity and type of referral for healthcare, improving the allocation of resources with a potentially favourable socioeconomic impact. In fact, these methodologies, already tested in several contexts, could have positive beneficial effects on global CV health [<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>]. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of self-reported CV risk factors in individuals without known CVD, using a digital tool.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Methodology</title><sec id="sec2.1"><label>2.1</label><title>Study design and population recruitment</title><p id="p0025">The <bold>RADICAL Study</bold>

The digital self-reported CV risk stratification tool included information for study participants, informed consent, and a questionnaire.</p><p id="p0030">Before enrolment on the study, participants were asked to confirm inclusion and exclusion criteria. Men and women aged 40&#x02013;69 years from the general population without known CVD, willing and able to provide informed consent were eligible to participate. The only exclusion criterion was a pre-existing history of a CVD, including coronary artery disease; acute myocardial infarction; previous treatment of the coronary arteries by percutaneous intervention or surgery; stroke; transient ischemic attack; peripheral arterial disease (carotid or lower limbs); heart failure; atrial fibrillation; aortic artery aneurysm; valvular heart disease; and other CVD reported in the questionnaire by the participants.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><label>2.2</label><title>Development and validation of the digital tool</title><p id="p0035">The digital tool integrated 23 questions about both classical and lifestyle CV risk factors, including age, sex, current smoking, body weight, height, blood pressure, lipid profile, diabetes, sleeping habits, dietary habits (fruit and vegetable, red and/or processed meat, and salt intake), and exercise/physical activity. Composite dietary risk factors were defined as the simultaneous occurrence of consuming less than five portions (400&#x000a0;g) of fruits and vegetables daily, consuming at least one portion of red and/or processed meat daily, and adding salt during meal preparation. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated from the reported body weight and height and classified according to the WHO cut-offs used to determine overweight (&#x02265;25&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>) and obesity (&#x02265;30&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>) [<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p id="p0040">The validity of a questionnaire is determined by analysing whether it measures what it intends to measure. Evaluation and validation of the questionnaire was carried out by nine invited external experts, with solid clinical and scientific experience in the thematic area of the instrument under analysis. Pre-requisites for the selection of these experts were scientific publications about CV prevention in indexed journals and at least two years of clinical experience. The expert group panel consisted of five cardiologists, two general practitioners&#x02019; doctors, one nutritionist and one exercise physiologist.</p><p id="p0045">After presenting the study protocol and signing the informed consent, the expert group received the digital tool and they were invited to answer, anonymously, whether questions were logical and relevant for its purpose.

The sample size was determined considering the recommendations of Perneger and colleagues [<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. These authors suggest that before carrying out a study with the application of one questionnaire to the targeted population, it is recommended to test the questions on a small sample (around 30 to 50) of participants. The reliability of the questionnaire was assessed using Cronbach's alpha coefficient. A Cronbach's alpha value of 0.7 or higher indicates good internal consistency [<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p id="p0055">The digital tool showed a moderate internal consistency (Cronbach's &#x003b1;&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.638). Furthermore, the results of this preliminary analysis confirmed the accessibility of the digital tool and the possibility of completing the questionnaire in less than 5&#x000a0;min.

Most individuals had at least one CV risk factor, being particularly relevant the prevalence of hypercholesterolemia, physical inactivity, hypertension, and overweight/obesity. Dietary risk factors and sleep habits were also important findings identified in this analysis.</p><p id="p0135">Self-reporting of CV risk factors using a digital tool seems feasible and could be useful for risk stratification, widening the screening of individuals at increased risk, improving the management of these risk factors, and the referral for evaluation by healthcare professionals. Our data also highlight the necessity of targeted interventions and integrated strategies for early detection and treatment of modifiable CV risk factors.</p><p id="p0140">Even with some regional variations, the overall prevalence of modifiable CV risk factors among European countries is high and in accordance with the burden of CVD [<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Although the novel methodology used to report CV risk factors in this study, its overall prevalence in the Portuguese population aligns with already known and published data. For example, in the AMALIA study, which used a community questionnaire applied through a household approach, the self-reported prevalence of hypertension was 23.5&#x000a0;%, hypercholesterolemia 19.7&#x000a0;%, diabetes 8.9&#x000a0;%, smoking 16.3&#x000a0;%, overweight/obesity 51.6&#x000a0;%, and physical inactivity 65.3&#x000a0;% [<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Also the prevalence of inadequate consumption of fruits and vegetables, as well as red and processed meats, was consistent with that observed in the National Food, Nutrition and Physical Activity Survey of the Portuguese general population (2015&#x02013;2016) [<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. This consistency may enhance the perceived robustness of the digital tool used in this study, as despite relying on self-reported data, it demonstrates its ability to adequately assess CV risk factors.</p><p id="p0145">To decrease this current impact of CVD, early identification of risk factors and implementing strategies to improve CV prevention, especially based on lifestyle modification, is essential. Improving health literacy is crucial for this purpose, through sharing clear and simple messages about recognizing risk factors, understanding their implications, and adopting basic preventive measures. The first step to optimize CV prevention is risk stratification, which allows for the implementation of preventive and therapeutic interventions tailored to each risk class [<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation 2 (SCORE2) and SCORE2-OP are currently recommended by the European Society of Cardiology, estimating the risk of fatal and non-fatal CV events at 10 years in individuals aged between 40 and 69 years and 70 or over, respectively. These scores encompass multiple variables with proven associations with CVD development, including age, sex, systolic blood pressure, non-HDL cholesterol and smoking, and are applied to apparently healthy individuals [<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Despite the unquestionable usefulness of these models, some controversial aspects persist, such as their scope and widespread practical applicability in the population setting. At the physician level, some barriers also limit the implementation of CV risk calculation scores.</p><p id="p0150">Current risk scores rely on a set of clinical features and laboratory measures that typically require the presence of a physician, which limit and reduce the ability to evaluate many individuals without access to face-to-face visits. In this setting, there is a growing number of self-assessment tools designed for risk prediction across several health conditions. These tools are mainly intended to alert, educate, modify lifestyle behaviours, or directly refer high-risk individuals to healthcare professionals for further evaluation. In the actual era, characterised by the widespread availability of digital tools aimed to facilitate healthcare delivery, involving patients in their own risk stratification, is increasingly relevant. Internet and smartphone use has exponentially grown in the past decade, opening the possibility that these increasingly prevalent technological tools could improve health. Digital health interventions, using modalities such as telemedicine, web-based strategies, email, mobile applications, text messaging, and monitoring sensors, can potentially shift healthcare from the traditional physical medical institutions to a more individualised and accessible model of care [<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p id="p0155">Self-reporting risk factors using digital tools can provide a reliable and accurate estimation of CV risk. These tools must be simple, provide a quick estimation and clear individualised recommendations [<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The tool used in our study meets these criteria. Insights from the Minnesota Heart Survey showed that self-reported knowledge of risk may be useful for identifying individuals at low CV risk, but the authors emphasize that such self-reporting should always be followed by clinical evaluation if symptoms or history suggestive of CVD [<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The DiCAVA, a 10-year CVD risk model based on machine learning, demonstrated a very good predictive capacity and feasible utility in remote settings where cholesterol and blood pressure measurements are not always convenient. This highlight that even the most well-established predictors are not always essential [<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Another novel, simple risk score showed to be an easy-to-use tool to predict CV events in adults from self-reported information without the need for laboratory or physical examination data. This risk score included 6 items and had comparable predictive performance to the guideline-recommended atherosclerotic CVD risk score but relied solely on self-reported information [<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Self-screening for assessing CV risk showed similar results to the standard methods, with high clinical performance to rule out intermediate or high CV risk [<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Even in elderly individuals, the use of digital tools seems to be feasible, as evidenced by a community-based cross-sectional survey conducted among Malaysian older adults (7117 individuals aged &#x02265;50 years), which used a standardised structured questionnaire to evaluate the prevalence of self-reported CV risk factors [<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p id="p0160">Beyond the role of self-reporting risk factors and other characteristics, digital tools have also been used in interventions to control risk factors and decrease CVD risk. A meta-analysis aiming to assess the benefit of digital health interventions on CVD outcomes (CVD events, all-cause mortality, hospitalizations) and risk factors, showed that these strategies can overall reduce CVD outcomes (nearly 40&#x000a0;%) and have a positive impact on risk factors, versus usual care. These benefits were largely driven by improvements in outcomes among higher risk individuals, including in those targeting secondary CVD prevention [<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Another meta-analysis suggests that specific digital health interventions, namely automated email messages, may improve CVD risk outcomes. However, as the evidence was inconclusive for some of the interventions analysed, further research into specific digital modalities is required, including newer technologies, such as wearable tools [<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The benefits of digital interventions have been shown in the control of specific CV risk factors, including smoking cessation, exercise adherence, weight loss, diabetes, and hypertension self-management [<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>].</p><p id="p0165">It is essential that healthcare providers consider digital health interventions to promote CVD prevention. Further research is needed to explore more recent and interactive tools, such as those using artificial intelligence, improving the interaction with the user, and integrating personalised feedback from healthcare professionals. Independently of the adopted methodology, and as deeply recognised, the risk factors evaluated in our study are essential components that should be incorporated to assess and improve CV health [<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p id="p0170">The present study has some limitations. Self-assessment of CV risk factors, without previous specific education and explanation could have led to misreporting. Otherwise, the voluntary participation and the use of social media and digital tools could influence the characteristics of the participants, as for example the higher number of women. As some analysis already revealed, some subjects are not aware of, or under report, the presence of CV risk factors. The potential discrepancies between self-reported and objective presence of CV risk factors reveal that some caution must exist when using self-reported data [<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. This self-misclassification can lead to inappropriate referral to healthcare for additional evaluation and lead to unnecessary costs or treatments. To mitigate this fact, the reported answers by the participants in this study and the used digital tool should be validated. In this context, development of educational interventions is essential to improve personal knowledge about CV risk factors. Some important determinants of CV risk were not evaluated but could be important to for the overall risk evaluation, especially socioeconomic factors, and regional distribution.</p><p id="p0175">The RADICAL Study shows a high prevalence of modifiable CV risk factors in adults without known CV disease. Beyond the relevance of traditional risk factors, such as hypercholesterolemia, overweight/obesity and hypertension, the results regarding physical activity, dietary and sleeping habits are concerning. A self-reported identification of CV risk factors using a digital tool could be feasible and help to improve CV prevention. Further research is needed to explore the application of more recent digital technology on CV risk stratification and interventions to reduce the burden of CVD.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>CRediT authorship contribution statement</title><p id="p0180"><bold>Jos&#x000e9; Ferreira Santos:</bold> Writing &#x02013; review &#x00026; editing, Writing &#x02013; original draft, Visualization, Validation, Supervision, Software, Resources, Project administration, Methodology, Investigation, Formal analysis, Data curation, Conceptualization. <bold>In&#x000ea;s Castela:</bold> Writing &#x02013; review &#x00026; editing, Writing &#x02013; original draft, Visualization, Methodology, Investigation. <bold>Sara Gamboa Madeira:</bold> Writing &#x02013; review &#x00026; editing, Validation, Methodology, Investigation, Conceptualization. <bold>Sofia Furtado:</bold> Writing &#x02013; review &#x00026; editing, Validation, Supervision, Investigation, Conceptualization. <bold>Hugo Vieira Pereira:</bold> Writing &#x02013; review &#x00026; editing, Validation, Conceptualization. <bold>Diana Teixeira:</bold> Writing &#x02013; review &#x00026; editing, Writing &#x02013; original draft, Visualization, Validation, Supervision, Project administration, Methodology, Investigation, Formal analysis, Data curation, Conceptualization. <bold>H&#x000e9;lder Dores:</bold> Writing &#x02013; review &#x00026; editing, Writing &#x02013; original draft, Visualization, Validation, Supervision, Software, Resources, Project administration, Methodology, Investigation, Funding acquisition, Formal analysis, Data curation, Conceptualization.</p></sec><sec sec-type="COI-statement" id="coi0010"><title>Declaration of competing interest</title><p id="p0185">No conflicts of interest, financial or otherwise, are declared by the authors.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="cebib0010"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Roth</surname><given-names>G.A.</given-names></name><name><surname>Mensah</surname><given-names>G.A.</given-names></name><name><surname>Johnson</surname><given-names>C.O.</given-names></name><name><surname>Addolorato</surname><given-names>G.</given-names></name><name><surname>Ammirati</surname><given-names>E.</given-names></name><name><surname>Baddour</surname><given-names>L.M.</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Global burden of cardiovascular diseases and risk factors, 1990-2019: update from the GBD 2019 study</article-title><source>J.
