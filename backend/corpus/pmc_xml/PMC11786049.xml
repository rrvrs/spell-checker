The novel serine/threonine kinase NEK6 is highly expressed in various cancers and affects the prognosis of patients. However, the role of NEK6 in OC is still unclear.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> In this study, the expression profiles of NEK6 in OC and its roles in the development of OC were investigated. The expression profiles of NEK6 across cancers and OC were explored using bioinformatics analysis, and its expression in OC patients was detected by immunohistochemical (IHC) staining. The correlation between its expression and clinicopathological factors was also analyzed. Furthermore, the NEK6 levels in the tumor tissues of OC patients were detected via RT&#x02012;qPCR and Western blotting. Biological functions, including cell growth, migration, invasion and apoptosis, were analyzed using MTT, Transwell and flow cytometry assays, respectively.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Bioinformatics analysis revealed that NEK6 was highly expressed in most human cancers, including OC. IHC revealed 67.27% moderate or strong NEK6 staining in tumor tissues, 32.73% (36/110) weak staining, and negative or weak NEK6 staining in normal ovarian tissues, and its high expression was correlated with clinicopathological factors, including histological grade (<italic>P</italic>=0.008) and metastasis (<italic>P</italic>=0.006). The Kaplan&#x02012;Meier survival curve revealed that OC patients with high expression of NEK6 had poorer overall survival rates (<italic>P</italic>=0.025). NEK6 was overexpressed in OC tissues and SK-OV-3 and A2780 cells, and when NEK6 was knocked down with siRNAs, cell growth, migration and invasion were inhibited, whereas cell apoptosis was significantly promoted.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> NEK6 is highly expressed in OC; its overexpression indicates poor prognosis; and NEK6 knockdown leads to inhibited growth, migration and invasion while promoting the apoptosis of OC cells. These findings indicate that NEK6 is a potential oncogene and a poor prognostic factor in OC, suggesting that NEK6 can serve as a new therapeutic candidate for OC and that NEK6 inhibition may be an effective strategy for OC treatment.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>NEK6</kwd><kwd>ovarian cancer</kwd><kwd>prognosis</kwd><kwd>metastasis</kwd><kwd>proliferation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Ovarian cancer (OC) is one of the most common malignant tumors in women worldwide, and its incidence rate is the third highest after that of only cervical carcinoma and endometrial carcinoma <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>. Malignant ovarian cancer, especially epithelial cancer, is difficult to detect early and has unknown causes. Apart from hereditary OC, primary prevention measures are not available. Currently, early diagnosis and treatment are advocated for early detection of lesions. Therefore, discovering biomarkers for the early diagnosis of OC and finding new molecular therapeutic targets are the primary tasks in conquering OC and are currently hot topics in the study of the molecular pathological mechanisms of OC <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>.</p><p>The never in mitosis gene A (NIMA)-related kinase (NEK) family was originally found in fungi and consists of 11 serine/threonine kinase members, including NEK1-11, which are considered key initiators of mitosis <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>. NEKs have been identified in various important cellular processes. Unlike those of traditional kinase families, the kinase characteristics of NEKs are not distinct, and their role in cell cycle regulation was initially known. Recent studies have shown that NEKs play roles in cell cycle arrest <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, the DNA damage response, mRNA splicing, mitochondrial homeostasis, genome organization and primary cilia function in mammals <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>. Recently, NEKs were shown to be abnormally expressed in different cancers and play vital roles in the development of cancer <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>. However, the molecular mechanism of NEKs in tumorigenesis is still unclear.</p><p>NEK6 is a serine/threonine kinase and a new member of the NEK family <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, and it has been reported that NEK6 is essential for promoting cell cycle progression by participating in cell mitosis <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>. Inactivation of NEK6 leads to cell apoptosis and mitotic arrest. In addition, NEK6 is necessary for cell cycle progression. Recent studies have also revealed that NEK6 is a new checkpoint of DNA damage, and its inactivation is crucial for G2/M phase arrest after DNA damage during the cell cycle <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>. Studies have also shown that NEK6 plays potential roles in several cancers <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, including prostate cancer (PC) <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, and breast cancer (BC) <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>. In addition, it has been reported that NEK6 is associated with hypoxia in OC <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, but its mechanism has not been explored. In this study, the expression of NEK6 in OC and its role in the progression of OC were explored.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Data collection and bioinformatics analysis</title><p>The data of OC patients and normal controls from the databases of the Tumor IMmune Estimation Resource (TIMER2.0, <ext-link xlink:href="https://cistrome.shinyapps.io/timer/" ext-link-type="uri">https://cistrome.shinyapps.io/timer/</ext-link>) <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>; differential gene expression analysis in tumor, normal, and metastatic tissues (TNMplot, <ext-link xlink:href="https://tnmplot.com/analysis2/" ext-link-type="uri">https://tnmplot.com/analysis2/</ext-link>) <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>; and the University of ALabama at the Birmingham CANcer data analysis portal (UALCAN, <ext-link xlink:href="https://ualcan.path.uab.edu/index.html" ext-link-type="uri">https://ualcan.path.uab.edu/index.html</ext-link>) <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> were used for pancancer analysis of NEK6 expression.

Epithelial cancer is the most common type of OC, but ovarian epithelial cancer accounts for the highest mortality rate among various gynecological tumors, posing a serious threat to women's lives <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>. Owing to the complex embryonic development, tissue anatomy, and endocrine function of the ovary, early symptoms are not typical, and distinguishing the tissue type and benign and malignant ovarian tumors before surgery is quite difficult. Epithelial ovarian cancer is prone to metastasis and invasion, and only 30% of patients present with tumors limited to the ovaries during surgery. Therefore, early diagnosis poses a major challenge <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>.</p><p>The main characteristic of cancer is abnormal cell proliferation, which may be caused by an imbalance in cell cycle regulation <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>. Studies have shown that the expression of NEKs in the G1 phase of the cell cycle is low but increases in the S and G2 phases; however, when cells enter mitosis, their expression decreases <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>. NEK activity peaks in the S and G2 phases and leads to the separation of centrosomes in the G2/M phase <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>. Therefore, high expression of NEKs leads to chromosomal instability and aneuploidy in cancer cells. In addition, high expression of NEKs activates several carcinogenic pathways, leading normal cells to transform into cancer cells through excessive proliferation and metastasis <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>. Therefore, recent studies have focused on the correlation between NEKs and various cancers, revealing their involvement in gastric cancer <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, prostate cancer <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, colon cancer <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, breast cancer <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, hepatocellular carcinoma <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, glioblastoma <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, pancreatic cancer <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> and cervical cancer <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>.</p><p>As an important member, NEK6 has also been found to be overexpressed in various cancers. NEK6 has been reported to be a central kinase responsible for the development of castrated tolerant prostate cancer <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, and knocking out NEK6 can reduce clonogenesis, proliferation, cell viability and mitochondrial activity and further increase intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), NEK6 is significantly upregulated, indicating poor prognosis in HNSCC patients. An increase in NEK6 expression leads to immune cell infiltration and an increase in various immune checkpoints <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>. In hepatocellular carcinoma, NEK6 is highly expressed and promotes cell proliferation <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>. NEK6 is significantly upregulated in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (CCRCC) and significantly promotes CCRCC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion and inhibits apoptosis <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>. NEK6 is overexpressed in breast cancer, and its high expression is associated with histological grade, tumor size and TNM stage. Cox regression analysis revealed that NEK6 expression is an independent prognostic factor for cancer. NEK6 plays a role in promoting the proliferation of breast cancer cells and may become a promising therapeutic target for breast cancer <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>.</p><p>In this study, we found that NEK6 was highly expressed in most human cancers, including OC, via a pancancer analysis with bioinformatics tools. Furthermore, among a total of 110 OC patients, IHC revealed that NEK6 was positively stained in tumor tissues and negatively stained in normal tissues and that its overexpression was correlated with clinicopathological factors, such as histological grade and metastasis. In addition, OC patients with high NEK6 expression had a lower survival rate. Moreover, when NEK6 was knocked down with siRNAs, the growth, migration and invasion of OC cells were inhibited, while apoptosis was significantly promoted.</p><p>In summary, NEK6 is an oncogene in OC and may be a poor prognostic factor, suggesting that NEK6 may be a novel candidate therapeutic target for OC and that inhibiting NEK6 may be an effective strategy for OC treatment.</p></sec></body><back><ack><sec><title>Funding</title><p>This study was supported by a grant from the Science Foundation of Nantong City, Jiangsu Province, China (MS22022013).</p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>Data used and analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author.</p></sec><sec><title>Author contributions</title><p>Conception and design: Sainan Gao, Yuquan Zhang.
