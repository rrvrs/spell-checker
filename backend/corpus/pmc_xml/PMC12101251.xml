Community pharmacists are well positioned to address this lack of access; thus, this study aimed to explore the perceptions of rural and remote consumers and pharmacists with respect to community pharmacists expanding their services in these communities. Qualitative, semi-structured interviews were undertaken with consumers and pharmacists recruited from community pharmacies in the far north, north west, and central west Queensland. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research guided question development, with the responses deductively coded and thematically analysed. Thirteen pharmacists and twenty-three consumers were interviewed, with both groups citing the benefit of reduced wait times. Key barriers were pharmacist workload, time constraints, inadequate infrastructure, and limited consumer awareness of services. Pharmacists highlighted the need for better reimbursement models and professional collaboration, while consumers valued accessibility and convenience but were concerned about the costs of services. This study has highlighted the benefits of expanded pharmacy services as perceived by the key stakeholders: consumers and pharmacists. However, future research investigating a larger sample in more rural and remote locations is needed to ensure the successful implementation of sustainable funding models to deliver better access and health outcomes for consumers in these communities.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>rural pharmacy</kwd><kwd>scope of practice</kwd><kwd>community pharmacy</kwd><kwd>access to healthcare</kwd><kwd>qualitative interviews</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>This research received no external funding.</funding-statement></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-pharmacy-13-00071"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Timely access to healthcare professionals is becoming increasingly challenging, particularly for rural and remote communities [<xref rid="B1-pharmacy-13-00071" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Consumers residing in these areas reported waiting longer than they felt acceptable for healthcare in comparison to their metropolitan counterparts [<xref rid="B1-pharmacy-13-00071" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. This delay in healthcare access has led to higher rates of chronic diseases and poorer health outcomes compared to those in urban areas [<xref rid="B2-pharmacy-13-00071" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Unique challenges, such as geographic isolation, limited infrastructure, low population density, workforce shortages, and increased healthcare costs, have exacerbated the delays, resulting in increasing rates of hospitalisation [<xref rid="B2-pharmacy-13-00071" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. An investigation into public hospitals revealed a sustained growth in emergency department presentations, with hospitals currently operating at full capacity, increasing the risk of an unsustainable healthcare system [<xref rid="B3-pharmacy-13-00071" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Australian studies have shown that the wellbeing of the GP workforce has also been declining, with 7 in 10 GPs experiencing feelings of burnout in 2023 due to overwhelming demands, especially in rural towns [<xref rid="B4-pharmacy-13-00071" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], leaving many communities at risk of losing access to essential local healthcare services.</p><p>Community pharmacists are often the first point of call regarding health advice for patients in rural areas; however, practising to their full scope is often neither utilised nor understood [<xref rid="B5-pharmacy-13-00071" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Rural community pharmacists have a unique opportunity to expand the scope of their practice to address current gaps in rural healthcare [<xref rid="B6-pharmacy-13-00071" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In Queensland, Australia, the role of the pharmacist has evolved significantly, with the Extended Practice Authority allowing pharmacists to administer immunisations and prescribe antibiotics for uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTI) following specialised training [<xref rid="B7-pharmacy-13-00071" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. This evolution has led to the incorporation of these service delivery models into everyday practice, highlighting pharmacists&#x02019; expertise, capabilities, and commitment to expanding their role further within community pharmacy.</p><p>Further developments in expanded practice are apparent internationally, with consumers reporting positive experiences with community pharmacy-based expanded services. In the United Kingdom (UK), a study conducted by Lowrie et al. found that patients identified community pharmacies as an appropriate setting for a heart failure management service. This service was reported to positively impact their care, with pharmacists enhancing their own understanding of the condition, while also effectively addressing a gap in supporting patients self-management [<xref rid="B8-pharmacy-13-00071" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. A survey by Navarrete et al. conducted in Japan, Thailand, and Canada found that pharmacists who provided a sexual reproductive health (SRH) service were interested in expanding their roles; however, most pharmacists expressed the need for additional training in SRH services (Japan = 79%; Thailand = 91%; Canada = 84%) [<xref rid="B9-pharmacy-13-00071" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In Australia, a study conducted in rural Queensland by Taylor et al. stated that 98% of consumers (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 55) would prefer to go to the pharmacy for their ear conditions rather than to a GP [<xref rid="B10-pharmacy-13-00071" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. This is attributed to the fact that 87% of consumers valued the in-depth information provided by the pharmacist, which enhanced their understanding of their treatment [<xref rid="B10-pharmacy-13-00071" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Beyene et al. found that community pharmacists were confident in their ability to provide a community pharmacy anticoagulation management service, which increased their job-satisfaction and enhanced pharmacist&#x02013;patient relationships, allowing them to assist patients with other aspects of their health [<xref rid="B11-pharmacy-13-00071" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. These studies have demonstrated that pharmacists have the capability to positively impact patient outcomes by expanding their scope of practice, [<xref rid="B12-pharmacy-13-00071" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] alleviating pressure on emergency departments reducing patient wait times and the overall strain on the healthcare system [<xref rid="B13-pharmacy-13-00071" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Nevertheless, in Australia, despite the expertise and well-recognised role of rural community pharmacists, there is a lack of access to structured or funded care models to support the expansion of their practice, restricting efforts to reduce health disparities in these regions [<xref rid="B5-pharmacy-13-00071" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The current literature highlights a notable gap between the trial phase of a service and its successful implementation in rural communities. Expanded practice trials such as LISTEN UP (Locally Integrated Screening and Testing Ear and Aural Programme) and a Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) case finding, although resulting in favourable outcomes, have not been integrated into routine pharmacy practice [<xref rid="B10-pharmacy-13-00071" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B14-pharmacy-13-00071" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. This disconnect may be due to insufficient knowledge surrounding funding allocation and inadequate structural frameworks for pharmacists to implement these services [<xref rid="B10-pharmacy-13-00071" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Additionally, these studies have often failed to include the perspectives of both consumers and pharmacists, both of whom are key stakeholders in the effective delivery of expanded services in these rural communities. Therefore, this study aimed to explore rural and remote consumer and pharmacist perceptions of community pharmacists expanding their services in rural communities in Queensland, specifically in Barcaldine, Emerald, Mount Isa, and Weipa.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-pharmacy-13-00071"><title>2. Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2dot1-pharmacy-13-00071"><title>2.1. Study Design</title><p>An ethnographic lens of rural culture was applied to this descriptive qualitative study. This involved the researchers immersing themselves in the remote communities in which they were collecting data.

Participants, Setting, and Recruitment</title><p>During January&#x02013;February 2023, rural consumers and pharmacists at community pharmacies in Barcaldine, Emerald, Mount Isa, and Weipa, Queensland were conveniently sampled to participate in an interview by face-to-face invitation. Convenience sampling allowed for collection of data from a broad range of consumers who visit pharmacies, rather than those purposely selected who may have more interest in pharmacy services. Two pharmacists and fourteen consumers were invited but declined to participate due to time constraints. These communities were selected for the study to allow for a diverse data spread across remote Queensland. To be eligible for inclusion in the study the participants invited were required to be 18 years or older, understand and speak English and be living in the remote community in which the research was conducted.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3-pharmacy-13-00071"><title>2.3. Procedure and Semi-Structured Interview</title><p>All eligible participants that agreed to participate were given a study information leaflet detailing the purpose of the study, a confidentiality statement and consent form. Participants were interviewed face-to-face in the community pharmacies, with the interviews audio recorded via voice recorder and the data de-identified in the transcription process. Demographic data, including gender, location, time living in the rural location, and years of experience (pharmacists only), were also collected.</p><p>The schedule of interview questions was developed prior using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) to ensure that the data aligned with the aim of the study (<xref rid="app1-pharmacy-13-00071" ref-type="app">Appendix A</xref>) [<xref rid="B15-pharmacy-13-00071" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The CFIR is a collection of constructs consisting of individual subconstructs that correlate with successful implementation of innovations across a range of applications [<xref rid="B15-pharmacy-13-00071" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Tailoring questions based on the CFIR produced quality data that either supported or hindered the implementation of expanded services. This allowed for recommendations to be formulated that were specific to the facilitation of expanded services in rural community pharmacies [<xref rid="B15-pharmacy-13-00071" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The interview schedule was piloted with three experts in qualitative methodology to ensure content validity. <xref rid="pharmacy-13-00071-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> summarises the domains or constructs of the CFIR specific to implementation of expanded pharmacy services in rural communities [<xref rid="B15-pharmacy-13-00071" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot4-pharmacy-13-00071"><title>2.4. Data Analysis</title><p>The qualitative data were analysed thematically utilising the Braun and Clarke thematic analysis framework, which includes familiarisation with the data, the generation of initial codes, searching for themes, reviewing themes, defining and naming these themes, and writing up the findings [<xref rid="B16-pharmacy-13-00071" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The raw, de-identified transcripts were transcribed verbatim to remove any errors from the automated software transcription, which allowed the researchers to familiarise themselves with the data. The transcripts were then coded deductively against the CFIR framework [<xref rid="B15-pharmacy-13-00071" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], allowing for the emergence of themes throughout the data. The themes generated reflected the core CFIR domains, namely, innovation, inner setting, outer setting, characteristics, and implementation, and the generated codes in the data were grouped under their respective CFIR construct [<xref rid="pharmacy-13-00071-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>] [<xref rid="B15-pharmacy-13-00071" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The themes were reviewed to verify that the codes categorised under each theme were relevant to the CFIR constructs. This approach refined patterns from the qualitative data into pre-existing, evidence-based themes, allowing for the extrapolation of findings to reach conclusions relevant to the aim of the study. The data gathered were integrated under the constructs of the CFIR, comparing the perspectives of the consumers and pharmacists using the &#x0201c;following the thread&#x0201d; protocol [<xref rid="B17-pharmacy-13-00071" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. This method of data amalgamation is well established and has been identified as a validated framework for the integration of various datasets [<xref rid="B17-pharmacy-13-00071" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Objectivity, assumed knowledge, and bias were minimised, and four participants were engaged in a member checking process to ensure that their code/theme interpretations were an accurate representation of their voice.</p><p>After 28 interviews, data saturation was achieved, and no new themes had emerged for four interviews; however, the remaining eight participants who had volunteered to participate were included in the interview and analysis process to ensure that no emergence of new linkages or themes occurred. The research team met regularly throughout the data collection phase to engage in critical self-reflection, promote continuous self-awareness, and reflect upon their biases and values to ensure reflexivity.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot5-pharmacy-13-00071"><title>2.5.

Discussion</title><p>This study investigated consumers&#x02019; and pharmacists&#x02019; perceptions across diverse rural locations in Queensland to gain insight into the views of these populations on expanding pharmacy services. Consumers and pharmacists recognised that there is a deficit in access to healthcare professionals in rural locations and believed that pharmacists have the potential to reduce this gap. This study highlights consumers&#x02019; perception of pharmacists as knowledgeable, accessible, and trustworthy health professionals. Additionally, consumers would be willing to utilise expanded practice services if offered by their pharmacy. However, consumers still viewed doctor and pharmacist roles as distinct, preferring to seek only specific services such as repeat prescriptions, short course antimicrobials, and chronic disease screening from their pharmacist.</p><p>On a global scale, community pharmacists are providing various expanded practice services; however, in Australia, such services are limited [<xref rid="B6-pharmacy-13-00071" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. This study demonstrated consumer support for expanded pharmacy services in rural and remote areas. The types of services, frequently suggested by consumers, focused on chronic disease management for conditions such as diabetes mellitus, respiratory issues (particularly asthma), cardiovascular disease, and dermatological conditions. These findings are consistent with previous Australian studies, which showed a high demand for pharmacists&#x02019; involvement in chronic disease management [<xref rid="B6-pharmacy-13-00071" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Given that over 60% of Australians are expected to develop a chronic disease at some stage of their life, these recommendations align with the current health needs expressed by consumers [<xref rid="B18-pharmacy-13-00071" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Additionally, our results reflect that services which predominantly support the needs of the older population were more commonly proposed among consumers, whereas conditions that typically affect younger demographics, such as sexually transmitted infections and drug and alcohol support services, were seldomly recommended for implementation [<xref rid="B6-pharmacy-13-00071" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, it was found that consumers often lacked awareness regarding the range of services that pharmacies offered, as well as the pharmacist&#x02019;s scope of practice. Limited awareness and consequent underutilisation of pharmacy services is an issue, which is not exclusive to Australia. A systematic review of expanded pharmacy services conducted in the UK also noted that lack of public awareness was an influential factor for inadequate consumer participation in pharmacy services [<xref rid="B19-pharmacy-13-00071" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Furthermore, this review supports our findings that consumers recognised the need for increased advertising and promotion of the services offered within the pharmacy to increase uptake [<xref rid="B19-pharmacy-13-00071" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>Previous studies conducted in Malta have found that consumers do not fully recognise the value of a pharmacist and view them more as &#x0201c;glorified shopkeepers&#x0201d; [<xref rid="B20-pharmacy-13-00071" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. However, the findings of this study contradict this, with all consumers indicating a positive relationship with their pharmacist. Consumers acknowledged that this relationship influenced their preference for receiving expanded practice services from the pharmacist rather than their GP. In addition to feeling valued, consumers noted that accessibility and convenience were key advantages of pharmacists offering expanded practice services. Studies in both New South Wales, Australia, and the UK resonate with these findings, proving that convenience and accessibility were key facilitators for consumer utilisation of expanded practice services [<xref rid="B19-pharmacy-13-00071" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-pharmacy-13-00071" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-pharmacy-13-00071" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Unsurprisingly, this is particularly significant given that over 50% of people living in rural areas work full time [<xref rid="B22-pharmacy-13-00071" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. As work demands continue to grow and schedules overload, convenience becomes a crucial determining factor for consumers choosing where and when to access healthcare.</p><p>Most consumers indicated that they would be willing to pay for expanded pharmacy practice services, valuing the convenience and accessibility that these services provide. However, with rural and remote residents earning a weekly household income that is approximately 30% less than those who live in metropolitan locations, consumers expressed concerns that cost would be a significant barrier to accessing these services [<xref rid="B23-pharmacy-13-00071" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Overall, our results highlight that pricing comfort for consumers is multifaceted and largely influenced by the nature of the service, the level of pharmacist involvement, and the duration of the consultation. This observation is consistent with an Australian study exploring consumer perceptions of expanded practice in rural community pharmacy, suggesting that further research into the willingness to pay for specific expanded services may be valuable [<xref rid="B6-pharmacy-13-00071" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. While all consumers agreed that they would be confident in utilising expanded practice services if offered by their pharmacy, the majority preferred to seek specific services that involved a short consultation with the pharmacist, as they saw doctor and pharmacist roles as distinct. These findings align with a study in Scotland that demonstrate that even those who see their pharmacist as a first point of call for medical related questions, still turn to their GP for more in-depth consultations [<xref rid="B8-pharmacy-13-00071" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B19-pharmacy-13-00071" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Furthermore, the same Scottish study found that consumers will often use an initial consultation with the pharmacist to determine if they should self-refer to their GP [<xref rid="B8-pharmacy-13-00071" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B19-pharmacy-13-00071" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>The majority of pharmacists had a positive attitude towards expanded practice services and felt confident in their ability to provide them. However, many pharmacists expressed frustration towards current issues facing rural communities such as long wait times for healthcare and restrictive prescribing legislation, strongly advocating for change. This sentiment aligns with that of the Pharmaceutical Society of Australia, which asserts that &#x0201c;red tape and regulations get in the way of pharmacists and must go&#x0201d; [<xref rid="B24-pharmacy-13-00071" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Learnings from pharmacist prescribers in New Zealand could further support the development of expanded practice in rural Australia, with services including responding to medicine queries, medicine use review, medicine therapy assessments, and medicine optimisation being common tasks provided by pharmacists in prescribing roles [<xref rid="B25-pharmacy-13-00071" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Importantly, pharmacists reported that the key perceived benefits for patients included improved health outcomes and understanding of medicines, and benefits for the health services included supporting the workloads of busy primary healthcare staff [<xref rid="B25-pharmacy-13-00071" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>Currently, many pharmacists feel underutilised in their roles, despite their qualifications and skills, and are motivated to up-skill to provide these expanded services. A Western Australian study investigating pharmacist vaccination services found that pharmacists reported significant professional satisfaction from undertaking these roles [<xref rid="B26-pharmacy-13-00071" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In addition to professional gratification, pharmacists felt that providing these services created opportunities to build therapeutic relationships and improve communication between healthcare professionals, ultimately benefiting consumers [<xref rid="B26-pharmacy-13-00071" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. However, despite positive consumer demand, pharmacists acknowledged that workload and time constraints are major barriers to implementing expanded practice services. Other concerns that were frequently raised by pharmacists regarded adequate funding and reimbursement that reflects the effort and time involved for pharmacist consultations. Pharmacists emphasised the need for effective finance models as an incentive to provide expanded practice services to ensure sustainability [<xref rid="B27-pharmacy-13-00071" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>The findings of this study have reinforced the well-documented issue that individuals who live in rural and remote locations experience poorer health outcomes and limited access to healthcare services compared to their metropolitan counterparts, highlighting the implications for future expanded practice and recommendations regarding targeted interventions to address these disparities.</p><sec><title>Strengths and Limitations</title><p>The strength of this study is that is presents the perspectives of the key stakeholders, namely, both the customers and the pharmacists, interviewed in person in their rural location, which allowed for an in-depth exploration of pharmacists expanding their practice. This study&#x02019;s limitations include the study design, involving the recruitment of consumers within a pharmacy setting, which may have led to the inclusion of participants who regularly visit these pharmacies and have a more favourable view of the pharmacists, therefore potentially introducing an unintentional bias to the findings. In addition, although recruitment included four towns across the far north, central west, and northwest Queensland, these findings might not be generalisable to other rural communities, both nationally and internationally. Findings may also have limited generalisability in other countries, as pharmaceutical services are governed by specific regulations, and factors such as healthcare access, interprofessional relationships, health literacy, and the skills and knowledge of pharmacists may vary significantly across countries. Economic, cultural, and geographical differences could further limit the generalisability of these results to other contexts.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec5-pharmacy-13-00071"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>Limited access to healthcare professionals in rural and remote areas contribute to poorer health outcomes and higher rates of chronic disease for these populations [<xref rid="B1-pharmacy-13-00071" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-pharmacy-13-00071" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. This study has highlighted common perspectives held by both rural consumers and pharmacists on potentially expanding pharmacy services to address the healthcare gaps in these communities. Consumers, although often unaware of the expanded services offered, were positive about these services, while pharmacists, despite the challenges of workload and funding, were keen to provide these services to better serve the needs of their communities. Both agreed on community pharmacists&#x02019; unique position to offer expanded services due to their convenience of access. Insights into the barriers and facilitators of implementing expanded pharmacy services have been provided. Future research will be required to prioritise the development of effective funding and reimbursement models, as well as to increase consumer awareness through targeted education strategies. Ultimately, it has been determined that expanded practice services can play a crucial role in transforming healthcare delivery for Australians residing in rural and remote communities.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors would like to sincerely thank the rural and remote consumers and pharmacists who gave their valued time to participate in the study.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclaimer/Publisher&#x02019;s Note:</bold> The statements, opinions and data contained in all publications are solely those of the individual author(s) and contributor(s) and not of MDPI and/or the editor(s).
