While breast cancer survival has improved over recent years, with nearly 9 in 10 patients surviving 5&#x000a0;years or more [<xref rid="pon70093-bib-0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], there are persistent ethnic and socioeconomic inequalities in breast cancer survival, which contribute to broader health inequalities [<xref rid="pon70093-bib-0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pon70093-bib-0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pon70093-bib-0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. These are most notable among women of Black African and Black Caribbean descent (hereafter referred to as Black women), who typically have poorer cancer experiences and outcomes [<xref rid="pon70093-bib-0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pon70093-bib-0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Indeed, compared with their White British counterparts, Black women are more likely to be diagnosed with breast cancer at an advanced stage and more likely to be diagnosed with aggressive forms of breast cancer (such as triple negative breast cancer), both of which are associated with poorer survival [<xref rid="pon70093-bib-0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pon70093-bib-0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pon70093-bib-0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>One potential avenue for reducing inequalities in breast cancer outcomes is through screening. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have shown that regular mammographic screening can significantly reduce mortality (from breast cancer) amongst women aged 50&#x02013;70&#x000a0;years [<xref rid="pon70093-bib-0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. As a result, many European countries have implemented mammographic screening to improve breast cancer outcomes [<xref rid="pon70093-bib-0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. As with all screening, however, the extent to which the benefits of mammography are realised, and the extent to which they are equitable, is highly dependent on uptake. Studies consistently find that ethnic inequalities in breast screening persist among women from ethnic minority groups [<xref rid="pon70093-bib-0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pon70093-bib-0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pon70093-bib-0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and are most prominent among Black women [<xref rid="pon70093-bib-0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pon70093-bib-0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. For example, a recent study by Kerrison et al.&#x000a0;found that 44.95% of Black women attended a breast screening appointment, between March 2016 and September 2020, compared with 63.08%, 49.73%, 51.03% and 46.41% of women of White British, Asian, Mixed and Other ethnicity, respectively [<xref rid="pon70093-bib-0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Previous reviews have synthesised the barriers to breast cancer screening among ethnic minority groups. Such reviews indicate a number of factors as barriers to breast screening, including stigma, religious beliefs, low risk perceptions and distrust in health professionals [<xref rid="pon70093-bib-0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pon70093-bib-0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. However, these reviews have aggregated data from different ethnic minority groups, without making distinctions between them [<xref rid="pon70093-bib-0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pon70093-bib-0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pon70093-bib-0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], despite wider research indicating that the barriers to healthcare vary between ethnic groups (e.g., due to differences in cultural attitudes and religious beliefs) [<xref rid="pon70093-bib-0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pon70093-bib-0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>Earlier research has also tested the effectiveness of interventions to address barriers to breast cancer screening, experienced by women from ethnic minority backgrounds [<xref rid="pon70093-bib-0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Community health education and health promotion workshops to raise awareness have been documented as being effective at increasing uptake in these populations [<xref rid="pon70093-bib-0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Reports of improvement in knowledge and attendance from some ethnic groups, following targeted interventions, have also been reported in relation to South Asian and Somali women [<xref rid="pon70093-bib-0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pon70093-bib-0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. To the best of our knowledge, there have been no reviews synthesising which interventions are effective for Black women, in particular. Such reviews are needed to inform policy designed to reduce inequalities in screening uptake and breast cancer outcomes. The present research is intended to address these gaps in the literature.</p></sec><sec id="pon70093-sec-0020"><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><p>A systematic review was conducted to synthesise barriers to breast cancer screening, experienced by Black women, living in the UK.

Studies were eligible for inclusion if they met the following, pre&#x02010;specified, eligibility criteria: (1) reported the results of studies conducted in the UK; (2) were available in English Language and (3) investigated barriers or facilitators to breast screening or the use of interventions designed to promote uptake of breast cancer screening among Black women. Studies exploring barriers and facilitators to breast cancer screening, across multiple ethnic groups were eligible for inclusion, if they documented barriers or facilitators attributable to Black women. As a targeted population review, only those data that could be attributed to Black women were extracted and included in the analysis. Studies that focused on barriers and facilitators to (and interventions to promote the use of) breast cancer treatment, help&#x02010;seeking, symptom appraisal and self&#x02010;examination were excluded. Similarly, those not peer&#x02010;reviewed (i.e., &#x02018;grey literature&#x02019;) were also excluded. The full inclusion and exclusion criteria are documented in Supporting Information&#x000a0;<xref rid="pon70093-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>: Appendix 2.</p><p>The protocol for the review was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42023395839) and followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta&#x02010;Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines [<xref rid="pon70093-bib-0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The quality of included studies was assessed and described using the Mixed Method Appraisal Tool (MMAT) [<xref rid="pon70093-bib-0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The tool was applied independently, by two authors (A.E.A. &#x00026; R.S.K.), with disagreements arbitrated by a third author (A.M.). Similarly, two authors (A.E.A. &#x00026; R.S.K.) independently assessed the articles at each stage of the selection process (i.e., title, abstract and full paper review). Here too, disagreements were discussed with, and arbitrated by, a third author (A.M.). Finally, the reference lists of papers passing full paper review were checked for additional relevant articles, which subsequently underwent abstract and full paper review, using the methods described for those identified through the database searches.</p></sec><sec id="pon70093-sec-0050"><label>2.3</label><title>Data Synthesis</title><p>A mixed methods approach to data synthesis was adopted. In the first phase, qualitative data were analysed using thematic synthesis. The extracted data were coded, and themes were developed relating to barriers and facilitators of breast screening uptake. During the second phase, quantitative data that assessed barriers and facilitators of breast screening, and the effects of&#x000a0;interventions to promote uptake, were categorised and described using narrative synthesis. In the final phase, findings from the thematic and narrative synthesis were triangulated to foster new insights into which barriers interventions may, or may not, address effectively.</p><p>Thematic synthesis is a method used to synthesise qualitative findings from qualitative research and allows researchers to identify patterns across a wide range of studies to provide a comprehensive and in&#x02010;depth understanding of the research topic [<xref rid="pon70093-bib-0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. It involves the development of themes through iterative coding of extracted data, such as participant verbatim quotes and original authors' themes and discussion. Narrative synthesis on the other hand was used to systematically summarise and interpret the findings from quantitative studies. It involves condensing and integrating the findings from individual studies to create a coherent and comprehensive narrative that addresses the research question or objective [<xref rid="pon70093-bib-0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="pon70093-sec-0060"><label>3</label><title>Results</title><sec id="pon70093-sec-0070"><label>3.1</label><title>Characteristics of Included Studies</title><p>A total of 987 articles were identified from the database searches (see Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="pon70093-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

In their study, Barter&#x02010;Godfrey and Taket [<xref rid="pon70093-bib-0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] explored personal reasons why women attend or do not attend screening. They included women from a range of ethnic minority groups, aged 50&#x02013;64&#x000a0;years. The study observed that decision to attend breast screening was personal and was linked to individual attitudes. Women were more likely to attend breast screening if they reported screening was important to them. Furthermore, pain and anxiety were important factors that discouraged re&#x02010;attendance. Black women were, under&#x02010;represented in the survey (Black African: 7%; Black Caribbean: 10%; White British &#x00026; White Irish: 73%). Nonetheless, the study found significant differences in perceived risk, specifically for Black women, who perceived their personal risk of developing breast cancer to be low, compared to the White British and other minority ethnic groups (Chi square, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.033). Advice from the GP or health workers facilitated screening attendance (35%). On the other hand, most of the BME women (31%) declined to attend breast screening because of personal inconveniences. This finding corroborates those observed in the qualitative studies [<xref rid="pon70093-bib-0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="pon70093-sec-0100"><label>3.4</label><title>Narrative Synthesis of Interventions</title><p>Four quantitative studies testing the effectiveness of interventions were identified.</p><p>Atri et&#x000a0;al. [<xref rid="pon70093-bib-0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] conducted a randomised controlled trial, across 26 GP practices, to investigate whether uptake of screening could be improved by training reception staff to contact previous non&#x02010;attenders. The study results indicated that screening attendance was higher among Black women in the intervention group (telephone reminder) than among Black women in the control group (no reminder; 8% vs. 4%, respectively). Inferential comparisons were not possible, due to the small number of Black participants included in the research. The Black participants from different backgrounds (British, Caribbean and African), were treated as a single group in the analysis. The response from each group, consequently, was not differentiated. The barriers targeted or addressed were not specified [<xref rid="pon70093-bib-0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Kernohan [<xref rid="pon70093-bib-0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] evaluated the impact of a community health promotion intervention, employing a health education strategy (i.e., breast cancer and mammogram awareness workshops) to increase breast cancer knowledge and screening uptake in a non&#x02010;controlled, stratified sample, in Bradford. Six months post&#x02010;intervention, the study reported an increase in breast screening uptake by &#x02018;African&#x02010;Caribbean&#x02019; women, compared with baseline (53.37% [<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;87] vs. 12.27% [<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;20]) [<xref rid="pon70093-bib-0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>Offman et&#x000a0;al. [<xref rid="pon70093-bib-0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] evaluated the effectiveness of a telephone reminder intervention to improve breast screening uptake, knowledge, and access, for ethnic minority groups. The study reported that, while the intervention was effective for South Asian women, with a significant increase in the Adjusted log&#x02010;odds of attendance (ALOA), in practices with higher proportions of registered South Asian patients (4% increase in odds of attendance per 10% increase in South Asian population, 95% CIs: 1%&#x02013;7%, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.003), there was a significant decrease in the odds of attendance in practices with higher proportions of Black women (11% decrease in odds of attendance per 10% increase in Black population, 95% CIs: 9% vs. 16%, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.001) [<xref rid="pon70093-bib-0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Finally, Bell et&#x000a0;al. [<xref rid="pon70093-bib-0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] conducted an observational study evaluating a multilingual screening information leaflet and GP endorsement letter, sent out to women 2&#x000a0;weeks before the screening invitation. Black African and Black Caribbean participants were categorised with the White British women as English speakers, while the Somali women were grouped as non&#x02010;English speakers [<xref rid="pon70093-bib-0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The multilingual information leaflet was used to address language barriers. However, the majority of Somali women were unable to read English or Somali. Link workers were allocated to explain the information leaflet and help the women to make informed decision about attending the screening. Out of the 31 women visited by the link worker, 12 (41%) attended breast screening [<xref rid="pon70093-bib-0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="pon70093-sec-0110"><label>3.5</label><title>Triangulation of Thematic and Narrative Synthesis</title><p>Through the triangulation process, we sought to identify the barriers each intervention had attempted to address, and which interventions increased screening uptake. We began by summarising the barriers identified in this review (see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="pon70093-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Followed by the interventions and the barriers they had attempted to address. We found that health promotion and breast awareness information were attempting to address: &#x02018;Understanding of, and concerns about, the breast screening, the procedure and the reliability of test results&#x02019;, while screening reminders to non&#x02010;attenders and prospective attenders aimed to tackle &#x02018;General barriers to accessing healthcare services (including breast screening)&#x02019;, by helping women to schedule appointments that are convenient. The intervention delivered through community health promotion appeared to lead to improvements in screening uptake among Black women [<xref rid="pon70093-bib-0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pon70093-bib-0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. On the contrary, interventions addressing &#x02018;General barriers to accessing healthcare services (including breast screening)&#x02019; through telephone reminders from GP practices did not appear to promote decisions leading to increased screening uptake among Black women, however, increase uptake was observed among South Asian women [<xref rid="pon70093-bib-0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>None of the interventions attempted to address other barriers identified in the thematic synthesis, such as emotional barriers (e.g., cancer fear), or cultural barriers (e.g., stigma).</p></sec></sec><sec id="pon70093-sec-0120"><label>4</label><title>Discussion</title><sec id="pon70093-sec-0130"><label>4.1</label><title>Summary of Key Findings</title><p>This mixed&#x02010;methods systematic review synthesised the barriers and facilitators to breast cancer screening reported by women of Black African and Black Caribbean descent. Four studies that highlighted barriers to breast screening, conducted in the UK, were included in the review and contributed to the synthesis of six overarching themes.</p><p>One of the key issues delineated from the literature, is that Black women often report uncertainty regarding the effectiveness and accuracy of breast screening. While there were gaps in knowledge about breast cancer and the screening procedure, lack of awareness about breast cancer risk factors perpetuated misconceptions of low personal risk of developing breast cancer [<xref rid="pon70093-bib-0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pon70093-bib-0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Similar barriers have been observed in cervical screening with the Black women [<xref rid="pon70093-bib-0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] suggesting that the experience may not be limited to breast cancer screening.</p><p>Furthermore, emotional responses, including fear of potential positive diagnosis and anxiety about breast cancer treatment, loss of marriage partner or marriage prospect were consistent with emotional barriers to cervical and bowel screening, including cancer fear in general, experienced by Black women [<xref rid="pon70093-bib-0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pon70093-bib-0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] particularly those of Black African descent [<xref rid="pon70093-bib-0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pon70093-bib-0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. This illustrates the importance of family networks for Black women, and a significant interplay between health, cultural, and social influences [<xref rid="pon70093-bib-0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pon70093-bib-0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>Socio&#x02010;demographic and healthcare delivery barriers suggest that systematic issues such as accessibility to screening and lack of tailored communication strategies from health professionals can lead to mistrust. This mistrust is not only relevant to breast screening but also to other NHS cancer screening and health services, emphasising the need for culturally sensitive healthcare approaches [<xref rid="pon70093-bib-0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pon70093-bib-0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pon70093-bib-0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p>Moreover, personal beliefs about breast cancer as either a treatable disease or a death sentence was a determining factor in breast screening uptake. Black women who believed that early detection leads to better treatment outcomes were likely to attend breast screening compared to those who believed it to be a death sentence [<xref rid="pon70093-bib-0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Additionally, religious beliefs, cultural taboos and stigma played a crucial role in how breast cancer and screening were perceived, with some women feeling that discussing cancer is a taboo or against their religious beliefs. Cancer was often viewed as being inflicted by Black magic or from supernatural source [<xref rid="pon70093-bib-0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. This is supported by research on cancer fear and fatalism, for instance, Vrinten et&#x000a0;al. found cancer stigma was higher amongst individuals from ethnic backgrounds [<xref rid="pon70093-bib-0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p><p>Similar barriers are noted in early diagnosis of symptomatic breast cancer and cervical cancer, where excessive reliance on faith [<xref rid="pon70093-bib-0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pon70093-bib-0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pon70093-bib-0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="pon70093-bib-0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="pon70093-bib-0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] and stigma surrounding cancer can prevent Black women from participating in screening [<xref rid="pon70093-bib-0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="pon70093-bib-0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p><p>This study also reviewed interventions to address barriers and promote uptake among women of Black African and Black Caribbean descent. No studies targeting this population, specifically, were identified; however, four studies exploring the use of interventions to promote uptake among ethnic minority groups, broadly, were identified, many with data stratified by ethnicity.</p><p>From these four studies, we were able to delineate which interventions had been effective, and which barriers they successfully targeted. We found that community health education and awareness intervention attempted to address poor knowledge and understanding about cancer and concerns about breast screening while screening reminders to non&#x02010;attenders and prospective attenders aimed to tackle practical barriers to accessing healthcare services, including breast screening [<xref rid="pon70093-bib-0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pon70093-bib-0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. For instance, Atri et&#x000a0;al. telephone call reminder intervention to non&#x02010;attenders recorded an overall improvement in screening uptake in the intervention than the control group (8% vs. 4%); however, Black African and Caribbean women were grouped as Black participants and statistical analysis for each group were not specified [<xref rid="pon70093-bib-0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Notably, there was observational evidence to support increase uptake of Breast screening by Black women using health education and community outreach [<xref rid="pon70093-bib-0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="pon70093-sec-0140"><label>4.2</label><title>Comparisons With the Previous Literature</title><p>Overall, the findings of this review are consistent with those reported in other studies exploring ethnic inequalities in cancer screening participation and help&#x02010;seeking behaviour. The following presents a comparison of the findings from this study with the extant literature.</p><p>This review identified misconceptions about the causes of breast cancer as a key barrier to breast screening. For example, in studies exploring ethnic inequalities to cervical screening, lack of knowledge was identified as an important barrier to screening uptake [<xref rid="pon70093-bib-0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>In addition, this study found that most Black women who live in the UK may not see themselves as being at risk of breast cancer. The relative low incidence of breast cancer among this population group may have facilitated these perceptions. However, this observation has also been reported in studies exploring ethnic inequalities in help&#x02010;seeking for breast cancer symptoms as well as cervical screening risk&#x02010;awareness which have included Black women [<xref rid="pon70093-bib-0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pon70093-bib-0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="pon70093-bib-0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="pon70093-bib-0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p><p>Importantly, the finding that emotional responses to cancer can act as a barrier to breast cancer screening is well established in the previous literature [<xref rid="pon70093-bib-0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pon70093-bib-0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pon70093-bib-0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Women of Black African and Black Caribbean descent may experience emotional barriers more profoundly than their White British counterparts, due to cultural differences in perceptions of cancer for instance: Black women do not talk about cancer [<xref rid="pon70093-bib-0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pon70093-bib-0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] and cancer is pre&#x02010;determined and often linked to supernatural sources, the disclosure of diagnosis could result in being stigmatised [<xref rid="pon70093-bib-0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="pon70093-bib-0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Our findings suggest they may experience a wider range of emotional barriers, including fear of positive diagnosis, family abandonment and stigmatisation [<xref rid="pon70093-bib-0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pon70093-bib-0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pon70093-bib-0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>This review has also identified the perception of breast cancer as a &#x02018;death sentence&#x02019; as a prominent deterrent to screening uptake among Black women, particularly, women from African descent [<xref rid="pon70093-bib-0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pon70093-bib-0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. This has been described as a barrier in several other studies [<xref rid="pon70093-bib-0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pon70093-bib-0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="pon70093-bib-0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Previous negative experiences with health professionals as potential disincentives to the uptake of health services has been previously documented [<xref rid="pon70093-bib-0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pon70093-bib-0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. This study indicates that there is a communication gap between GPs and Black women. It suggests the need for culturally sensitive communication with GPs in breast screening and other health services to build trust. Lack of access to screening, due to non&#x02010;registration with a GP, was an important barrier to Black women due to immigration status. Similarly, the difficulty in making an appointment with the GP particularly among ethnic minority women were reported as barriers in help seeking for cancer symptoms [<xref rid="pon70093-bib-0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p><p>Moreover, the present review found that some Black women who received the invitation failed to prioritise attending screening. This is a common theme throughout the barriers to screening literature where difficulties managing competing priorities and obtaining a convenient appointment are frequently identified as significant barriers to screening. These practical barriers were depicted among the wider BAME population and were linked to low socio&#x02010;economic status [<xref rid="pon70093-bib-0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="pon70093-bib-0039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].</p><p>Finally, the role of religious beliefs, cultural taboos and stigma are well established mechanisms underpinning inequalities in help&#x02010;seeking and screening participation. Previous research exploring differences in locus of control (how strongly people believe they have control over the situations and experiences that affect their lives), between ethnic groups, have found that women from ethnic minority groups score higher on measures of external locus of control (indicating they are less likely to believe they have control over the situations and experiences that affect their lives), and concluded that high religiousness may explain some of this variation (i.e., that it is &#x02018;God's decision who lives and who dies', that &#x02018;God's will cannot be defied through Western Medicine&#x02019;, or that &#x02018;God would save them&#x02019;) [<xref rid="pon70093-bib-0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="pon70093-bib-0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="pon70093-sec-0150"><label>4.3</label><title>Implications for Policy and Future Research</title><p>The findings of this review have implications for future research. While research exploring barriers experienced by women of Black African and Black Caribbean descent have been published, these populations have been treated as a single group [<xref rid="pon70093-bib-0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pon70093-bib-0040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Important cultural differences exist between women of African and Caribbean descent (e.g., women of African descent are more likely to report fear of being stigmatised by breast cancer than women of Caribbean descent). Future research should attempt to differentiate the cultural barriers experienced by each population. In addition, further research with women who are eligible for screening and/or do not attend screening is required to determine the ecological validity of the barriers and facilitators identified in this review, as the majority of participants included in the studies were either not eligible for screening or were attenders. The women not eligible for screening may experience different barriers to those reported by non&#x02010;attenders or screening eligible women [<xref rid="pon70093-bib-0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>Furthermore, the studies in this review were conducted in specific parts of England and Wales and may not reflect barriers experienced by women living in all countries of the UK. Likewise, studies of interventions were found (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;4) but none explicitly focused on barriers experienced by Black women in the UK. Importantly, at present, it is not clear from the existing literature whether low attendance amongst ethnic minority groups is due to poor sampling strategies or ethnic minority groups not volunteering as study participants. Therefore, future research should implement better sampling strategies for recruiting Black African and Black Caribbean participants and find ways, perhaps targeted, for researchers to reach out to these populations [<xref rid="pon70093-bib-0040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="pon70093-bib-0041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="pon70093-sec-0160"><label>4.4</label><title>Strengths and Limitations</title><p>A strength of this review is the specificity of focusing on women of Black African and Black Caribbean descent, eliminating the crude groupings of Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) group women together (which other studies have confirmed could mask salient differences) [<xref rid="pon70093-bib-0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In addition, studies were drawn from peer&#x02010;reviewed literature, increasing the reliability of the data synthesised. Another strength of the systematic review lies in the methodological search of the peer&#x02010;reviewed literature, guided by PRISMA Framework.</p><p>The limitations to this review include: (1) some studies in this review were conducted with a mix of women eligible and non&#x02010;eligible for screening, meaning that some of the barriers may have been anticipated rather than directly experienced, thus limiting the validity of some of the findings; (2) the exclusion of grey literature, which may contain important insights and (3) exclusion of non&#x02010;English language papers (e.g., Welsh), which, again, may have provided useful insights.</p></sec></sec><sec id="pon70093-sec-0170"><label>5</label><title>Conclusion/Recommendations</title><p>This mixed&#x02010;methods systematic review identified a number of barriers to breast cancer screening experienced by women of Black African and Black Caribbean descent.

Further research, including Black women who are eligible for screening, or who do not attend screening, is also required, as the present research has focussed largely on those who attend or are not eligible, to understand the differences in barriers experienced.</p></sec><sec id="pon70093-sec-0180"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>
