Leveraging these pandemic-driven insights will be key to ensuring that the swift adaptations and lessons learned will transition into lasting elements of Ireland&#x02019;s health system.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Universal healthcare</kwd><kwd>Health system reform</kwd><kwd>COVID-19</kwd><kwd>Ireland</kwd><kwd>Health policy</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010414</institution-id><institution>Health Research Board</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>APA-2019-012</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Burke</surname><given-names>Sara</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Wuhan University Global Health Institute 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par2">The COVID-19 pandemic underscored challenges and opportunities for health systems worldwide. In Ireland, the pandemic arrived early in the implementation of health reform efforts that included the planned introduction of universal healthcare. This policy brief synthesises key research findings from 13 studies carried out under the <italic>Foundations</italic> research programme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], which employed co-production with senior health system decision-makers to harness key reform learnings from the pandemic response (2020&#x02013;2023). Critical insights into how Ireland&#x02019;s planned move towards universal healthcare was navigated and impacted during the crisis are presented, offering important research and policy implications for countries undergoing substantial health system transformation.</p><p id="Par3">Unlike most high-income countries, Ireland does not have universal healthcare. This has resulted in a complex, fragmented health&#x000a0;system with both&#x000a0;public and private financing and provision,&#x000a0;where approximately half of&#x000a0;the population purchases voluntary health insurance for faster access to certain&#x000a0;health services. Eligibility for public healthcare services without charge is largely&#x000a0;means tested and while&#x000a0;there has been an expansion of&#x000a0;the&#x000a0;General Practitioner (GP) visit card, there has been&#x000a0;a failure to progress a universal entitlement to healthcare. Major organisational reforms in the 1990s culminated in the establishment of the Health Service Executive (HSE), which replaced eight regional Health Boards from 2005 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]; however, persistently&#x000a0;long waitlists and delayed access to&#x000a0;care sparked further calls for change. The current reform programme&#x02014;a ten-year plan called Sl&#x000e1;intecare &#x02013; aims to establish a universal health system based on medical&#x000a0;need rather than ability to pay; providing timely, integrated and quality care in the most appropriate setting.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Research synthesis</title><p id="Par4">Thirteen publications from the <italic>Foundations</italic> research programme were selected for analysis.

Published in 2017, Sl&#x000e1;intecare signalled political consensus on the goal of universal healthcare, but wavering support affected its rollout pre-2020, particularly in terms of promised entitlement expansions and service delivery reorganisation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Policy intent to develop population-based resource allocation showed potential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], however efforts to reduce prescription charges and expand free GP care were inconsistent&#x000a0;during this time. Despite sustained if somewhat muted political endorsement and funding allocations in government budgets from 2017 to 2019, the 2018 implementation plan lacked clarity and sufficient financial backing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">The arrival of COVID-19 in March 2020 further disrupted early reform efforts, at least initially, prompting a rapid shift in the health system&#x02019;s focus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. During the first phase of COVID-19, Ireland&#x02019;s health system priorities shifted to public health and taking non-acute care out of hospitals to free up capacity for COVID-19 and acute/specialist outpatient care. However, the response was impacted by legacy workforce allocation issues, in part underpinned by workforce shortages prior to the pandemic as well as decades of acute care prioritisation over community settings. Although overall staffing increased by 8.9% during the pandemic, there were 13,645 more publicly-funded workers in acute settings compared to the community by August 2021 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. This imbalance meant that primary care and community-based services faced workforce and redeployment challenges, indicating a lack of commitment to recruit the necessary staff-mix to achieve a universal health system and highlighting the need to revisit workforce strategies.</p><p id="Par7">This initial period was the pressure point that revealed Ireland&#x02019;s health system weaknesses by intensifying pre-existing problems such as waitlists for acute and specialist outpatient care and barriers to healthcare access. Public hospital waiting lists increased by 19.1%, from 729,937 in January 2019 to 869,676 in January 2021; 629,919 patients awaited a first outpatient appointment, with 27.1% waiting over 18&#x000a0;months; and 3.76 million COVID-19 tests were conducted with GPs delivering 2.31 million telephone triages by March 2021, contributing to professional burnout [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Additionally, new challenges emerged including the public health implications of delayed and lost care during the first wave in 2020 (e.g. 81,712 fewer Emergency Department [ED] presentations and 210,357 fewer non-COVID-19 hospital admissions) as well as increases in emergency alcohol-related, self-harm and mental health admissions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Together, this highlighted the urgent need for a universal, resilient health system capable of addressing new, evolving population health needs as well as future pandemics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">At the same time, other areas of Ireland&#x02019;s response demonstrated system adaptions with potential to drive universal health reform forward. This included a universal community-based approach to COVID-19 care and temporary policy measures to mitigate Ireland&#x02019;s complex public/private divide to ensure equitable care access [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]; core aims of the Sl&#x000e1;intecare reform programme. Specifically, COVID-19 was classified as a notifiable disease, exempting all patients from public hospital charges for treatment of symptoms; the government also negotiated the public take-over of private hospitals for the first three months of COVID-19 and offered private-only medical&#x000a0;consultant contracts to work in the public system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. However, this arrangement faced criticism for its cost and underutilising capacity, leading to its termination after three months.</p><p id="Par9">Ireland&#x02019;s pandemic response also led to significant health system changes that enabled agile and rapid solutions through increased funding, relaxed procurement processes and fast-tracked digital health responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. These more flexible conditions fostered trust and collaboration within and across the health system, resulting in innovations to improve access to integrated care such as the use of telemedicine, enhanced communication channels and rapid adaptation of care models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Successes were also observed in responses targeting certain populations considered &#x02018;vulnerable&#x02019;, including those accessing homelessness services. Measures including eviction bans and the relocation of service users into single occupancy housing helped to reduce infection rates, COVID-19 related deaths and homelessness presentations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Nonetheless, the sustainability/continuation of the system changes implemented during the crisis remains uncertain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Moreover, clarity regarding entitlements and poor healthcare access continue to be major concerns despite the recent abolition of in-patient hospital charges, expansion of eligibility for free GP services and a new public-only contract for medical consultants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par10">Finally, developments since 2022 suggest a gradual return of policy attention to, and capacity for, the decentralisation of health care delivery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. However, governance challenges such as accountability deficiencies, poor transparency, unclear roles and responsibilities, inadequate implementation capacity and competing policy visions, have prompted reflection on the role and definition of universalism within the new regional framework; namely, whether it continues to be a central goal of health reform and the level of commitment to universalism in the COVID-19 context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p id="Par11">The narrative account demonstrates how crises can be powerful catalysts for change. The pandemic jolted Ireland&#x02019;s health system from its path of incremental reform, forcing rapid adaption and innovation. This echoes a punctuated equilibrium approach to understanding policy-making processes, where long periods of stability are interrupted by brief, intense periods of significant change. The pandemic represents a punctuation point, propelling the system towards necessary reforms and innovations that might otherwise have taken decades to achieve. While a &#x02018;new normal&#x02019; for Ireland&#x02019;s trajectory towards universal healthcare emerged, past practices and political stances regarding its desirability/viability continue to shape new governance, leadership and service-delivery arrangements&#x000a0;in 2025. The question now is whether Ireland will solidify the lessons learned during the pandemic to ensure foundational elements of universal healthcare become permanent, enduring fixtures of the health system, rather than fleeting crisis measures.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Implications for health systems research and policy</title><p id="Par12">
