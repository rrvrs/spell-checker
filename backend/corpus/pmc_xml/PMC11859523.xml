Although not all women are affected to the same degree or in the same way, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is the most common mental health consequence of IPV.</p></sec><sec id="sec7413"><title>Objectives</title><p>To assess the psycho-traumatic impact of IPV on female victims. To study the factors associated with PTSD among these women.</p></sec><sec id="sec7414"><title>Methods</title><p>We conducted a descriptive and analytical cross-sectional observational study, carried out over a 10-month period from March 2021 to December 2021, among female victims of IPV consulting psychiatric emergencies at UHC H&#x000e9;di Chaker, Sfax, Tunisia for medical expertise at the request of the court. We studied the PTSD in these women using the Post Traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist Scale (PCLS).</p></sec><sec id="sec7415"><title>Results</title><p>The total number of participants was 120 with an average age of 37.27 years. The majority had secondary education or less (62.5%), were professionally active (53.3%), and were financially dependent on their partners (26.7%). As for the women&#x02019;s clinical characteristics, 19.2% were under psychiatric care, 15% had attempted suicide and 10% had a history of childhood abuse. Regarding the couple&#x02019;s profile, marriage was arranged in 58.3% of cases, and the average duration of marriage was 12.34 years, exceeding 10 years in 44.2% of cases.</p><p>The impact reported by our women was 100% psychological and 96.7% familial. As a result, 75.8% had sought help from family and friends, and 55.8% had decided to separate from their partners.</p><p>According to the PCLS scale, 78.3% of female victims showed PTSD with a positive score &#x0003e; 44. It was associated with a higher number of suicide attempts (p=0.04), a marriage duration exceeding 10 years (p=0.02), help-seeking (p=0.001), and divorce (p=0.014).</p></sec><sec id="sec7416"><title>Conclusions</title><p>PTSD is a particularly serious psychiatric condition. However, its impact remains insufficiently understood and taken into account in medical, psychological, social, and legal care. Knowing the psycho-traumatic consequences of violence is absolutely essential to better protect, support, and care for victims.</p></sec><sec id="sec7417"><title>Disclosure of Interest</title><p>None Declared</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="2"/></counts></article-meta></front></article>
