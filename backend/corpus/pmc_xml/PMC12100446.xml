Determining the financial implications of including housing as a covered benefit is of particular interest and is currently not well understood.</p><p>In addition to state agencies, Medicaid managed care organizations can play a key role in building cross-sector partnerships with community-based organizations (CBOs) and local government agencies to help develop the infrastructure for efforts to address unmet HRSNs, like housing.<sup><xref rid="zoi250417r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> This is particularly true in Oregon, where the 2012 Medicaid transformation created a new type of managed care organization, coordinated care organizations (CCOs),<sup><xref rid="zoi250417r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> which use a more community-driven and collaborative model to provide care. Rather than using set capitation rates for physical, behavioral, and oral health care services, CCOs have flexibility via a global budget to coordinate across health care services and support health-related services that may reduce or replace the need for health care services.<sup><xref rid="zoi250417r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> The most recent 1115 waiver provides an opportunity to use this existing infrastructure and experience supporting HRSNs to test a groundbreaking version of a housing benefit, leveraging the strengths of the existing model and attempting to create additional alignment with the housing sector.</p><p>Ahead of the statewide implementation of HRSN services under Oregon&#x02019;s newest 1115 waiver, the state&#x02019;s largest CCO, Health Share of Oregon (hereafter, <italic>Health Share</italic>), developed and implemented a housing benefit pilot program.<sup><xref rid="zoi250417r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> The pilot and the upcoming statewide HRSN services use an approach similar to rapid rehousing, where temporary assistance is provided to prevent or shorten the amount of time individuals and families are homeless.<sup><xref rid="zoi250417r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Health Share partnered with the Center for Outcomes Research and Education to evaluate the housing benefit pilot program.

This study was limited to analysis of secondary data and deemed exempt from informed consent in accordance with 45 CFR 164.512(i)(2)(ii). This report follows the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (<ext-link xlink:href="http://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/strobe/" ext-link-type="uri">STROBE</ext-link>) reporting guideline for cohort studies.</p><sec id="H2-1-ZOI250417"><title>Pilot Program Description and Evolution</title><p>Planning for the housing benefit pilot began in January 2022, and the program ran for 2 years, providing temporary rental assistance, housing navigation, and additional supports (eg, utility assistance and short-term hotel/motel stays) to individuals experiencing insecure housing or homelessness and families enrolled with Health Share. Eight priority populations were initially identified that would roll out over time; these populations represented key times of transition when individuals could most benefit from expedited access to housing supports. The pilot was developed in collaboration with health system partners, counties, housing experts, and a stakeholder group, including people with lived experience of homelessness. Enrollment for individuals aging out of foster care, transitioning from a substance use disorder (SUD) residential program, or exiting the corrections system began in May 2022. In late 2022, eligibility was expanded to include individuals transitioning out of recuperative care programs and 2 specific inpatient medical settings. The program originally enrolled participants for a period of 12 months. Individuals exiting assertive community treatment programs, acute care rehabilitation, or inpatient psychiatric care were slated to become eligible later in the pilot but were not launched. Capacity challenges among housing and health care partners led to a pause in enrollment from late March through the end of May 2023. When the program reopened for enrollment in June 2023, only individuals who were at risk of homelessness rather than those experiencing chronic homelessness were eligible. Additionally, only 2 of the original priority populations remained eligible for new enrollment (individuals leaving SUD residential programs and individuals aging out of foster care), participants were enrolled for a period of 6 months, and new enrollments were limited to 10 per week. These changes were made to align the program&#x02019;s specifications more closely with the newly announced Medicaid benefit&#x02019;s design, in addition to addressing ongoing capacity challenges. The program closed for new enrollments on October 31, 2023.</p><p>Individuals were referred to the program by a variety of sources; frequently, the referral source was the current location of the individual (eg, individuals exiting residential treatment were typically referred by the treatment program itself). On referral, a central benefit administrator (CBA) confirmed individuals&#x02019; Medicaid eligibility and enrollment in Health Share, and they were connected to a care coordinator based in the CBA and to a housing navigator at a partnering CBO. The housing navigator and care coordinator collaborated to complete initial needs assessments and then provided ongoing support to participants. As shown in <xref rid="zoi250417t1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, the program provided a spectrum of housing supports, including housing navigation, hotel/motel stays, move-in support and fees, monthly rent support, utility deposits and back payments, monthly utility assistance, home remediation services, home accessibility and safety modifications, healthy home goods, and renter&#x02019;s insurance. This cohort study describes participants served by the program, their needs and the extent to which the program met those needs, and the initial costs associated with including housing as a covered Medicaid service.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="zoi250417t1"><label>Table 1. </label><caption><title>Types of Support Provided by the Housing Benefit Pilot Program</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><col width="24.04%" span="1"/><col width="41.69%" span="1"/><col width="34.27%" span="1"/><thead><tr><th valign="top" align="left" scope="col" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Benefit category</th><th valign="top" align="left" scope="col" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Description/examples</th><th valign="top" align="left" scope="col" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Recommended rate or cap</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" scope="row" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Housing navigation, support, and sustaining services</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Includes pre- and posttenancy support and wraparound support services.

Participant information on gender, race, ethnicity, and language preferences are self-reported at the time of Medicaid enrollment. Race and ethnicity within the member enrollment files are then grouped by the state using 2023 Office of Management and Budget standard definitions, including American Indian or Alaskan Native, Asian, Black, Hispanic, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, White, and other (including categories not available to participants during the Medicaid enrollment process). Program data were the source of information on participants&#x02019; baseline needs and service utilization. Specific program data sources included referral forms, which captured additional participant demographics and priority population; a general assessment, which was completed at enrollment and collected information on participants&#x02019; health and social needs; a housing needs assessment, which included information about members&#x02019; health, social, and housing needs at enrollment; a housing plan, which captured the plan for addressing participants&#x02019; housing needs; and invoices for benefit utilization. There was a high degree of missingness in housing needs assessments (30%) due to differences in pilot implementation across CBOs and individual staff practices, including belated implementation of the needs assessment as a required form. Additionally, only 82% of individuals with a completed housing needs assessment could be matched to Medicaid enrollment data due to data entry errors in the housing needs assessment. The housing needs assessment was administered by housing navigators; participants could describe their most recent housing type or select prefer not to respond to questions about their most recent living situation; select yes, no, or unknown to questions about their housing histories; and choose yes, no, unknown, or prefer not to respond to answer questions about their criminal, medical, substance use, and mental health histories; additionally, participants could skip any questions that they did not know the answer to or to which they did not want to respond.</p><p>Invoice expenditures were aggregated by individual and by service category, forming a longitudinal dataset. Duration of program participation was determined from individual enrollment and termination dates. Per-member per-month expenditures for housing navigation and other services, as well as mean total cost per enrolled member were estimated for those who received at least 1 service within each benefit category.

The pilot program demonstrated a clear need for additional housing supports in the region, and the substantial number of individuals deemed ineligible due to not being part of a designated priority population underscores the breadth of the housing crisis. Individuals experiencing housing instability are certainly not limited to Health Share&#x02019;s members or specific priority populations, and at the same time, a single program cannot meet the volume of need that has resulted from the housing crisis. This was illustrated by the need for the pilot to pause and address capacity limitations, including limiting to 2 priority populations from the original 8. Furthermore, participants reported needing additional nonhousing social supports at high rates. Intentionally building partnerships between health and social services organizations through ecosystems of care and working together collaboratively is necessary to address participants&#x02019; complex HRSNs.<sup><xref rid="zoi250417r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="zoi250417r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup></p><p>In general, baseline housing needs of enrolled participants were aligned with the services they used. Support for rent, utilities, and move-in were the most frequently reported housing needs at enrollment, and these were also the most frequently accessed services. These highly used services underscore the level of need for housing support among Medicaid members. However, while utility assistance and rent support were highly used, the level of use was still 20 to 30 percentage points lower than reported need. For example, 82% of participants reported a need for monthly utility assistance at enrollment, but only 55% of participants used this service. On the other hand, short-term hotel and motel stays were used much more frequently than would have been anticipated based on reported need; at enrollment, 16% of participants reported needing this service, but it was used by 33% of participants. For participants whose needs assessments could be matched to invoices, service utilization among those with identified needs was also examined; monthly rent, monthly utilities, move-in fees and support, and hotel and motel stays were received by most participants who identified these needs at baseline. Alternatively, many participants who identified needs for renter&#x02019;s insurance, utility deposits or reinstatements, and home modifications did not receive those services. These comparisons between need and utilization were an important takeaway for the program&#x02019;s design and may have implications for other programs considering what services to include or exclude. They also highlight the importance of considering the housing context outside of the program itself; limited affordable housing supply and issues finding long-term housing placements willing to accept program participants resulted in the use of hotel and motel stays as a stopgap after transitioning out of the institution from which the individual was referred, and this happened for more individuals than had identified this resource as a need at baseline. In addition, 2 significant programmatic changes made during the pilot&#x02019;s pause (adjusting eligibility guidelines to focus on individuals at risk of homelessness rather than those experiencing chronic homelessness and providing the benefit for 6 rather than 12 months) could have also contributed to differences in needs and utilization, as some of the participants originally enrolled may have had needs beyond what could have been provided by the pilot. Participant histories provide additional context that may have been relevant to levels of need; for example, while 16% of participants reported being evicted or asked to move in the past 7 years, this number may underestimate the prevalence of informal evictions that they experienced. Informal evictions happen up to 5 times more often than formal ones, emphasizing the need for a systemwide approach to prevent homelessness, which could include permanent supportive housing, transitional housing, and legal interventions.<sup><xref rid="zoi250417r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup></p><p>The costs associated with the pilot also represent a key finding and provide a first step toward understanding what services can and should be covered by Medicaid and the related financial implications of these services. Monthly rent support, short-term hotel and motel stays, and housing navigation services were the largest types of expenditures per month and overall. As discussed, hotel and motel stays were not necessarily identified as a baseline need, but the reality of the housing search and application process meant that participants used this component of the benefit frequently, resulting in costs nearly as high as monthly rent support. In addition, while navigation services were structured as set monthly payments, the level of interaction between participants and program staff and the types of wraparound support provided varied across CBOs. In total, across all benefit categories, the mean (SD) expenditure per member per month was $2225 ($1586). In interpreting these costs, it is important to note that they do not account for implementation and infrastructure supports that were required for getting the pilot program off the ground. Beyond understanding and sharing the costs associated with providing these kinds of services in the pilot program, a critical next question in this work will be to understand the impact of these investments. Analyses are ongoing to assess participants&#x02019; health care utilization and costs during and after program enrollment, as well as pilot effects on health, housing, and social outcomes. A study of a similar program implemented under North Carolina&#x02019;s current Medicaid 1115 waiver (known as the Healthy Opportunities Pilots [HOP]) recently examined health care use and spending, and researchers found increases in spending at enrollment followed by decreasing trends, adding to the body of literature suggesting that addressing HRSNs is key to improving health and reducing health care costs overall.<sup><xref rid="zoi250417r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> In terms of program implementation, the pilot described in this study was similar to North Carolina&#x02019;s HOP in that HOP participants who accessed housing services also frequently used navigation and utility support, but HOP did not provide support for monthly rent (ie, the most used service in the current study).<sup><xref rid="zoi250417r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> The descriptive analysis presented in this study, as well as subsequent studies analyzing impacts of this pilot and Oregon&#x02019;s HRSN benefit, also contribute to our growing understanding of the HRSN landscape and will allow for comparison across efforts happening in different states, like Oregon and North Carolina.</p><p>A key issue uncovered during the pilot program&#x02019;s pause was the need for the program to define its intention clearly; this meant recognizing that health care agencies are not the entities best situated to provide long-term housing, especially for individuals experiencing chronic homelessness. This is skilled work often provided by housing and homeless service entities, including continuums of care and CBOs, that have the relationships, infrastructure, and staff with lived experience to meet the complex needs of this population. That said, there is still an important role for health care agencies as partners with housing and homeless services organizations that can provide a temporary bridge and resources, especially for those at risk of losing housing during times of transition, such as exiting an SUD residential program. To do this effectively, cross-sector collaboration, communication, and true partnership are critical and will require agreement on shared goals, staff training, and infrastructure investments. In addition, efforts to engage CBOs that provide culturally specific services are paramount to ensuring equitable access and supports.</p><sec id="H2-7-ZOI250417"><title>Limitations</title><p>The pilot and its evaluation experienced several limitations. For example, the flexibility in implementation was a strength of the pilot but also meant that there was significant variability in the model. Participants&#x02019; interactions with the program and the services they used were largely dependent on the housing navigator, care coordinator, and CBO to which they were connected. Previous evaluations of similar programs have emphasized the importance of consistency in service delivery models to ensure that all participants receive high-quality services.<sup><xref rid="zoi250417r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> Establishing and communicating clear eligibility guidelines and service requirements can help minimize differences in experiences across participants and support CBO partners in developing processes that are sustainable and streamlined with their own internal procedures. A limitation of the evaluation presented in this study is that it relies entirely on program data, some of which were missing or unable to be matched to administrative data sources; moreover, the reliance on program data means the voices of participants are also missing from this analysis. Primary data collection with participants, including both surveys and qualitative interviews, are ongoing as individuals exit the program, and these data will be used to understand program impacts and gain insight on program experiences directly from participants. Furthermore, while information on costs may be helpful to the development of similar programs, it should be noted that costs are reported as means across priority populations for the duration of the pilot and as such may underestimate or overestimate the costs of working with members who have higher or lower needs.</p></sec></sec><sec id="H1-5-ZOI250417"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Overall, this cohort study provides critical information on who was served by the housing benefit program, their needs and the extent to which the program met those needs, and the cost implications of the program, all of which provide insights into how Medicaid benefits can be used to support housing as a part of health. These findings are valuable as Oregon embarks on statewide implementation of HRSN benefits, as well as nationally as other states implement similar initiatives to support housing and social needs under Medicaid. Previous research has found evidence that housing efforts save cost and reduce burden on the health care system,<sup><xref rid="zoi250417r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="zoi250417r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> but health care partners are also new to this space. The pilot underscored the necessity of defining clear roles and collaborative frameworks between the health care and housing sectors to effectively support populations at risk for housing instability. Overall, the housing benefit pilot offers insights into the primary housing needs of Medicaid members and mean costs for these housing supports as a Medicaid benefit. While Medicaid alone cannot solve the housing crisis, better understanding costs and level of need can inform broader applications and encourage other regions and states to effectively integrate housing supports into health care systems.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="REF-ZOI250417"><title>References</title><ref id="zoi250417r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="webpage"><person-group><string-name><surname>De Sousa</surname>
