High EE rates in staff-patient studies are typically lower than in families, with negligible rates of high emotional overinvolvement (EOI). However, indirect comparisons can suffer from many biases.</p></sec><sec id="sec2818"><title>Objectives</title><p>This study directly compared patients with schizophrenia living in halfway houses or with their families on the EE of their caregivers, adjusting for patient- and caregiver-related confounders.</p></sec><sec id="sec2819"><title>Methods</title><p>We included 40 inpatients with schizophrenia living in halfway houses and 40 outpatients living with their families and recorded the EE of the caring staff (N=22 nurses) or parents (N=56), respectively, through Five Minutes Speech Sample interviews. Each nurse rated 1-12 inpatients and each inpatient was rated by 2-5 nurses, totaling 155 nurse ratings. Each outpatient was rated by one or both parents. Due to the multilevel structure of EE ratings, generalized linear mixed models were fitted. We first adjusted only for differences in patient-related confounders between groups and then added basic caregiver-related demographics.</p></sec><sec id="sec2820"><title>Results</title><p>Compared to outpatients, inpatients were older (p=0.001), less well educated (p=0.002), had a longer disease duration (p=0.047), more hospitalizations (p=0.012), lower severity of psychotic (p=0.027) and, specifically, negative symptoms (p=0.015), and lower perceived criticism (p=0.001). Nurses were younger (p&#x0003c;0.001) and better educated (p=0.001) than parents. After adjusting for patient-related confounders only, EOI was significantly higher in parents (p=0.027) while criticism did not significantly differ between groups. However, after also adjusting for caregiver demographics (age, gender and education), criticism was significantly higher in nurses (p=0.027) while differences in EOI became non-significant.</p></sec><sec id="sec2821"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Differences in EE, when directly compared between parents and professional caregivers, may be explained by differences in patient-related characteristics, caregiver demographics as well as other caregiver characteristics to be investigated in future studies.</p></sec><sec id="sec2822"><title>Disclosure of Interest</title><p>None Declared</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="1"/></counts></article-meta></front></article>
