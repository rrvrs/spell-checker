Mood Disorders are common, encompass cognitive impairments and occur in later life including first onset after the age of 50 years of age. There is a considerable overlap between depression and dementia. The relationship between depression and dementia will be reviewed and the implications for diagnosis and treatment will be discussed. Novel agents targeting alternative neurotransmitter pathways and inflammatory processes are promising potential treatment options. Neurostimulation treatments play a role with ECT at present having the best utility for late onset depression.</p><p>
