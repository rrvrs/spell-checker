1. Introduction</title><p>Cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) manifests in up to 80% of individuals with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). However, CLE can also occur independently, without progression to systemic involvement or the presence of autoantibodies. CLE significantly impacts quality of life and is clinically heterogeneous in both severity and morphology. Discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE) is a chronic form of cutaneous lupus characterized by erythematous, scaly lesions that progress to atrophy, fibrosis, and hypo-and/or hyperpigmentation. Current treatments for DLE remain challenging, expensive, and not always effective.<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup></p><p>Anifrolumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets type I interferon receptors that are pivotal in the pathogenesis of SLE. It was approved in 2021 for adults with moderate to severe SLE, following the results of the phase II MUSE trial and the phase III TULIP-1 and TULIP-2 trials; it has shown promise in treating SLE, particularly for patients with refractory cutaneous symptoms.<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup> A pooled analysis of the TULIP studies showed significant improvement in patients with a baseline Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus Disease Area and Severity Index-Activity (CLASI-A) score of&#x02005;&#x02265;10 when treated with Anifrolumab compared to placebo.<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup> Notably, only a few case reports document anifrolumab effectiveness in treating discoid lupus. This report presents 2 cases of patients with refractory discoid lupus who achieved positive outcomes with anifrolumab, emphasizing its potential in treatment-resistant cases.</p></sec><sec><title>

3.1. Case report 1</title><p>A 43-year-old woman known to have hypothyroidism was diagnosed with discoid lupus and patchy alopecia 5 years prior. Despite multiple treatments, including topical and intralesional steroids, hydroxychloroquine, oral corticosteroids, azathioprine, methotrexate, and belimumab, the patient experienced frequent relapses, particularly when corticosteroids were tapered. Consequently, she maintained a daily corticosteroid dose of 20&#x02009;mg, which was the only effective treatment in controlling her symptoms. The patient presented with discoid lesions across multiple scalp areas, characterized by intense inflammation, redness, and hyperpigmentation. Her CLASI-A score was 18 (Fig. <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A&#x02013;C). She reported significant itching and psychological distress due to the lesions&#x02019; appearance, though she denied any systemic symptoms associated with SLE.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Discoid lesions in the first patient before and after anifrolumab treatment. Images (A, B, C) show erythematous, thickened, and hyperpigmented lesions with distinct scaling and inflammation, indicating active disease. Images (D, E, F), taken 3 months after anifrolumab therapy, demonstrate a marked reduction in erythema, thinning of lesions, decreased scaling, and improved pigmentation, suggesting a positive therapeutic response.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="medi-104-e42518-g001" position="float"/></fig><p>Lupus serology showed a positive antinuclear antibody (ANA) by immunofluorescence with a titer of 1:80; however, subsequent tests were negative. Other autoimmune markers, including anti-double-stranded DNA and Smith antibodies, were also negative. Laboratory results, including complement levels, complete blood counts, inflammatory markers, and urinalysis, were within normal limits. Scalp skin biopsy findings were consistent with discoid lupus, showing epidermal atrophy, subepidermal bullous formation, vacuolar interface changes at the dermal-epidermal junction, and a thickened basement membrane. A superficial and deep perivascular and peri adnexal infiltrate was also identified.</p><p>The patient received intravenous anifrolumab at 300&#x02009;mg every 4 weeks. Hydroxychloroquine and methotrexate were continued, and she was vaccinated against varicella-zoster 2 weeks prior to starting anifrolumab.</p><p>Following the first anifrolumab injection, the patient reported noticeable improvement. At the 3-month follow-up, there was a significant reduction in lesion inflammation, redness, and itchiness, with some hair regrowth in affected scalp areas (Fig. <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>D&#x02013;F). Her CLASI-A score decreased from 18 to 3 post treatment. Corticosteroids were tapered gradually until complete cessation, and the patient tolerated anifrolumab well, with no reported side effects or need for premedication before infusions. Continued follow-up over the subsequent 6 months revealed sustained remission, with no new flares or adverse effects. As of February 2025, the patient remains stable on anifrolumab, hydroxychloroquine, and low-dose methotrexate (7.5&#x02009;mg weekly), with excellent disease control.

3.2. Case report 2</title><p>A 19-year-old woman with SLE was diagnosed one year earlier, based on a clinical history of arthritis, discoid lesions, leukopenia, and positive ANA titer. Initial treatment with corticosteroids and hydroxychloroquine resolved her arthritis but was less effective in managing the discoid scalp lesions. Upon presentation, she had active discoid lesions on multiple scalp areas, accompanied by patchy hair loss. She reported no history of systemic involvement.</p><p>Physical examination confirmed active discoid lesions presenting as erythematous, atrophic patches with peripheral hyperpigmentation and patchy alopecia in various scalp regions (Fig. <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A, B). Her CLASI-A score is 8. Initial blood work revealed a low white blood cell count of 3.4&#x02005;&#x000d7;&#x02005;10&#x02079;/L (4&#x02212;11&#x02005;&#x000d7;&#x02005;10&#x02079;/L), with normal renal and hepatic profiles and no proteinuria on urinalysis. ANA testing was positive via immunofluorescence at a titer of 1:160, while extractable nuclear antigen testing was negative. Complement testing initially showed a mildly low C3 level with normal C4 levels; however, subsequent tests returned normal results for all parameters.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Discoid lupus lesions in the second patient before and after anifrolumab treatment.

Azathioprine was prescribed for 5 months but also yielded no improvement. The patient declined high-dose corticosteroids; a 20&#x02009;mg dose provided only a partial response and was stopped. Methotrexate was introduced at a maximum dose of 20&#x02009;mg but was reduced to 15&#x02009;mg due to gastrointestinal side effects, with no improvement in the lesions. Her CLASI-A score remained at 8 despite ongoing treatment with hydroxychloroquine and methotrexate. Ultimately, a decision was made to initiate monthly anifrolumab at 300&#x02009;mg after a negative quantiferon screening. She received a varicella-zoster vaccine 2 weeks before starting anifrolumab, alongside continued hydroxychloroquine and methotrexate.</p><p>After initiating anifrolumab, the patient demonstrated marked improvement in cutaneous symptoms, with significant reductions in erythema and itching. Following the third injection, noticeable hair regrowth was observed, and the patient expressed satisfaction with the treatment outcome, reporting no adverse effects.

4. Discussion</title><p>DLE is often a refractory condition that can severely impact patients&#x02019; quality of life, causing significant psychosocial stress due to visible scarring, especially in sensitive areas like the face and scalp. The chronic and frequently disfiguring nature of DLE lesions can lead to psychological distress, reduced self-esteem, and social withdrawal, as patients may feel self-conscious about their appearance. Effectively managing DLE is essential not only to control disease activity but also to alleviate its psychosocial burden and improve overall quality of life.</p><p>DLE treatment is challenging, as many patients do not respond to first-line therapies, such as topical corticosteroids and hydroxychloroquine. Limited treatment options exist beyond these initial therapies, often necessitating systemic immunosuppressive agents that carry additional risks and require careful monitoring. Furthermore, most available efficacy data for DLE treatments are derived from case reports or based on SLE management strategies, rather than controlled trials specific to DLE. This lack of dedicated research contributes to uncertainties in optimal management and underscores the need for targeted, evidence-based studies on effective therapies for refractory DLE cases.</p><p>Anifrolumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting the type I interferon receptor, has shown promise for the treatment of refractory DLE. Data from the TULIP trial demonstrated a significant improvement in skin disease activity, with reduced lesion severity in patients unresponsive to standard therapies.<sup>[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup> Although anifrolumab has shown effectiveness in clinical trials on cutaneous lupus, its effects on specific CLE subtypes are not well defined.<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup></p><p>Our patients showed a successful response to anifrolumab after multiple prior treatments had failed, with significant improvement after the first injection. Limited case reports have documented similar findings, consistently supporting the effectiveness of anifrolumab in refractory discoid lupus.<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup> Moreover, most cases reported improvement after early doses, highlighting the potential of anifrolumab for rapid and effective relief in difficult-to-treat cases.<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup> This suggests that anifrolumab is a potential option for managing DLE by effectively targeting the interferon pathway involved in lupus pathogenesis.</p><p>In conclusion, these cases underscore anifrolumab as a promising treatment option for refractory DLE, particularly when conventional therapies prove ineffective. Anifrolumab played a key role in reducing inflammation and lesion severity, improving quality of life by addressing both the physical and psychological burdens of DLE. These findings may guide physicians in considering anifrolumab as a viable option in challenging DLE cases. However, further research with larger studies is needed to confirm its efficacy and safety in this population, establishing a stronger basis for its use in managing resistant cases of discoid lupus.</p></sec><sec><title>Author contributions</title><p><bold>Conceptualization:</bold> Roaa Aljohani.</p><p><bold>Formal analysis:</bold> Roaa Aljohani.</p><p><bold>Funding acquisition:</bold> Roaa Aljohani.</p><p><bold>Writing &#x02013; original draft:</bold> Roaa Aljohani.</p><p><bold>Writing &#x02013; review &#x00026; editing:</bold> Roaa Aljohani.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>
