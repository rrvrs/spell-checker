This study evaluates the safety of using RM for procedural sedation in the emergency department (ED) comparing its administration by registered nurse anaesthetists versus house officers in 1st year residency in emergency medicine and emergency medicine physicians without previous anaesthesiologic specialisation. Secondary aims were patient satisfaction and proportion of successful procedures.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">This prospective study was performed at the ED at Aalborg University Hospital from 10 May through 20 August 2024. Five emergency medicine physicians (group 1) started administering RM to patients after completion of training and direct supervision. Results were compared to patients sedated by two registered nurse anaesthetists (group 2) who had been administering RM more than 50 times before study start. Time was recorded during sedation and a questionnaire filled out immediately after the patient had awakened. T-tests or Mann-Whitney U tests were used to compare groups.

Procedural sedation aims to induce a state, where the patient can tolerate unpleasant procedures, as well as maintaining adequate cardiorespiratory function and protective airway reflexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Such sedatives and analgesics are mostly used by physicians and nurses with anaesthesiologic specialisation but are also in use by physicians without previous anaesthesiologic specialisation performing brief and moderate sedation in the ED [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] and in ambulatory settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Commonly used sedatives in such settings are Midazolam, Propofol, Ketamine, Dexmedetomidine and Remifentanil, each with their pros and cons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Remimazolam (RM) is a novel ultra-short acting benzodiazepine. It has an onset of action of 1&#x02013;3&#x000a0;min and has a plasma half-life of 10&#x000a0;min. It is an ester-based benzodiazepine and is rapidly hydrolysed into inactive metabolites. These metabolic qualities give a moderate sedation for a short duration of time and rapid recovery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Recent studies comparing RM with Propofol and Midazolam outside of the operating room show no difference in sedation efficacy, but faster recovery and shorter stay in the hospital for patients receiving RM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Studies investigating safety find RM to be as safe as Midazolam and Propofol when applied for procedural sedation and general anaesthesia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Similar to other benzodiazepines, potential side-effects of RM are hypotension, hypoventilation, bradycardia, and risk of aspiration.</p><p id="Par7">This prospective observational clinical cohort study aimed to investigate the safety of using RM for sedation in the ED, comparing its administration by health professionals with or without specialisation in anaesthesia.

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par36">During procedural sedation with RM administered by emergency medicine physicians or nurse anaesthetists, two out of 103 patients experienced severe respiratory adverse effects that could be effectively treated in the emergency department. Patients were safe to leave unsupervised after a median of 15&#x000a0;min in both groups, and procedural success was high in both groups.</p><p id="Par37">In this pragmatic clinical study, the incidence of any adverse events is reported. Many patients received opioids during the procedural sedation with RM (26% in group 1/emergency medicine physicians and 18% in group 2/nurse anaesthetists).</p><p id="Par38">Only two patients developed severe respiratory adverse effects, and in both patients, symptoms could be resolved in the emergency department by simple airway manoeuvres, bag-valve-mask ventilation for a short period of time and/or administration of an antidote. These procedures are all well known by the staff in E.Ds. The proportion of patients requiring a manual airway manoeuvre is lower than in a recent prospective observational study of adult patients receiving RM in an ED in the Netherlands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par39">Amnesia was reported in most patients which is desired for patients undergoing painful procedures. While most patients showed objective signs of pain during the procedure, this had minimal impact on their overall satisfaction, as nearly all patients had amnesia for the procedure. These findings are consistent with those of Yao et al., who also reported a high patient satisfaction after sedation with RM during colonoscopy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p id="Par40">There were positive experiences with all attempted procedures. Several of the colleagues, who performed the painful procedures on the patients, expressed ability to more easily perform the procedures. They attributed this to their experience of improved sedation, better patient relaxation, and reduced time consumption due to easier adjustment of sedation and anesthetic depth. However, data has not been collected regarding this. Providers expressed confidence in the safety of administering RM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p id="Par41">Time from first dosage until 87% of emergency medicine physicians without anaesthesiologic specialisation and 88% of registered nurse anaesthetists could safely leave patients unsupervised was less than 20&#x000a0;min. Our findings on the rapid onset and recovery times are consistent with an existing study on the sedative effect of RM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The rapid recovery time and no active metabolites makes RM useful in the ED, as patients can be discharged earlier than after general anaesthesia.</p><p id="Par42">Sancheti et al. states the following essential properties for sedatives: rapid onset, short half-life and pharmacologic reversibility, minimal impact on cardiac and respiratory function and lack of accumulation with sustained use as well as reliance on a particular organ metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The abovementioned properties were consistent with our findings concerning the safety and effectiveness of RM. The ED treats a diverse patient population with various comorbidities, enhancing the generalisability of our findings to other settings. However, in our opinion, it is essential that the setting has an on-call anaesthesiologist.</p><sec id="Sec16"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p id="Par43">The study was conducted in a non-randomised clinical setting with consecutive patient inclusion, where the assignment to nurse or physician was based on provider availability during shifts. No formal power analysis was conducted, as this was an observational study based on the availability of patients receiving Remimazolam in our ED during the study period. All patients undergoing procedural sedation with RM during the study period were included, which minimised selection bias during the inclusion process. Providers were attending clinical duty during the inclusion and sedation of the patients. While this design offers certain advantages, it has notable limitations, particularly the lack of comparison to &#x0201c;standard care&#x0201d; scenarios, such as sedation in the emergency department using Alfentanil&#x02009;+&#x02009;Midazolam or nerve blocks and admission to an orthopaedic department while awaiting operating room availability Another limitation is that, due to the real-world nature of this study, a strictly matched-cohort analysis was not feasible.</p><p id="Par44">A notable limitation is that patient satisfaction was assessed by the administering provider, potentially introducing treatment provider bias and a response bias. Additionally, the outcome &#x0201c;provider experience&#x0201d; is susceptible to outcome-assessor bias, as the same individual who performed the procedural sedation also evaluated their own experience.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par45">Severe respiratory adverse effects were rare in both groups. The vast majority of patients receiving Remimazolam experienced amnesia and adequate pain relief during the procedure. Most patients could be safely left unsupervised within 20&#x000a0;min post-procedure. Half of the procedures performed in the ED using Remimazolam would otherwise have required general anaesthesia in an operating room setting.</p><p id="Par46">These findings demonstrate that Remimazolam is a safe and effective alternative for procedural sedation in the ED, administered by emergency medicine physicians or registered nurse anaesthetists. Remimazolam&#x02019;s rapid onset, short recovery time, and predictable pharmacokinetics make it particularly advantageous in the fast-paced ED environment, where minimizing patient wait times and procedural delays is crucial. The ability of non-anaesthesiological emergency medicine physicians and registered nurse anaesthetists to safely administer RM further underscores its feasibility for broader clinical implementation.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#x02019;s note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Not applicable.</p></ack><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><p>S.A contributed with investigation, writing - original draft, writing &#x02013; review &#x00026; editing and visualization.
