</xref> The main symptoms of achalasia include dysphagia, regurgitation, chest pain, and weight loss according to the Eckardt symptom score. But, in the actual clinical setting, patients complaining of sleep problems are often encountered. However, no studies have comprehensively examined the patient populations in which sleep problems caused by achalasia occur and whether they are improved by peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM). In this study, we investigated the rate of sleep problems assessed by GERD&#x02010;Q (AGQ) in patients with achalasia, assessed whether POEM improves these sleep problems (AGQ), and further determined the factors associated with the improvement in sleep problems (AGQ) in these patients after POEM.</p></sec><sec id="deo270064-sec-0060"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="deo270064-sec-0070"><title>Study design</title><p>In this study, we retrospectively analyzed the data of consecutive patients who were diagnosed with achalasia and who underwent POEM at a single institution (Department of Gastroenterological Surgery, Fukuoka University Faculty of Medicine) between March 2016 and December 2020.

Cases where the post&#x02010;POEM scores were lower than the pre&#x02010;POEM scores were classified as &#x02018;improved,&#x02019; while cases where the scores remained the same or increased were classified as &#x02018;non&#x02010;improved.&#x02019; Statistical analysis was then performed based on these classifications.

POEM was performed under general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation, and the patients were in the supine position. Carbon dioxide insufflation was used during endoscopy. An electrosurgical triangle tip knife with an integrated water jet function (KD&#x02010;645L; Olympus Corp.) was the preferred surgical device, whereas a FlushKnife BT (DK2620J; Fujifilm) or SB Knife Jr. (MD&#x02010;47703L; Olympus Corp.) was used when necessary. Posterior myotomy was the primary choice, and the myotomy length was determined based on the type of achalasia.

</p><p>In the present study, a notably high proportion of patients with achalasia reported experiencing sleep problems (AGQ; <italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;110 [62%], Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="deo270064-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).

Sleep problem (AGQ) was also the third most common symptom of achalasia. In patients with achalasia, sleep problems (AGQ) may be caused by 1) awakening during sleep due to dysphagia, regurgitation, and/or chest pain, 2) difficulty in falling asleep due to anxiety, or 3) brain excitation due to hormonal abnormalities caused by insufficient food intake (similar to those associated with dieting).<xref rid="deo270064-bib-0018" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>18</sup>
</xref> Furthermore, sleep problems (AGQ) may arise from a combination of multiple factors rather than a single one. We investigated the factors associated with the improvement of sleep problems (AGQ). Our findings indicate that the improvement of dysphagia and regurgitation before POEM led to improvements in sleep problems (AGQ). These results highlight the importance of improving dysphagia and regurgitation with POEM to improve sleep problems (AGQ) in patients with achalasia. To effectively address dysphagia and regurgitation, it is crucial to address the inadequate LES relaxation and/or abnormal esophageal body contraction, both of which contribute to these symptoms.</p><p>Among the patients included in the present study, Chicago classification Type I and Type II were identified in 149 of 171 patients (87.1%). In all patients, we ensured complete incision of the LES using the double&#x02010;scope method during the POEM procedure. We believe that this approach played a significant role in the improvement of dysphagia and regurgitation, which consequently led to the amelioration of sleep problems (AGQ) associated with achalasia. In patients classified as Type III according to the Chicago classification, dysphagia and regurgitation are caused by abnormal esophageal body contraction in addition to inadequate LES relaxation. In patients classified as Type III, we believe that achieving an adequate myotomy length in the esophageal body, guided by endoscopy, barium esophagography, and manometry, along with the aforementioned double&#x02010;scope method, contributed similarly to the improvement in dysphagia, regurgitation, and even sleep problems (AGQ).</p><p>In Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="deo270064-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, patients with sleep problems (AGQ) 3 months after POEM were categorized into Groups A to D based on the presence or absence of symptomatic post&#x02010;POEM GERD and pre&#x02010;POEM sleep problems (AGQ). At 3 months post&#x02010;POEM, 17 patients were found to have sleep problems (AGQ). Of these 17 patients, 11 had symptomatic GERD, while six did not. Group A included five patients (five of 177 [2.82%]) who had no sleep problems (AGQ) before POEM but developed both sleep problems (AGQ) and symptomatic GERD afterward. It was considered that sleep problems (AGQ) in this group were caused by symptomatic GERD after POEM. Group B included six patients (six of 177 [3.39%]) who had sleep problems (AGQ) before POEM and had symptomatic GERD and sleep problems (AGQ) after POEM. It was considered that the sleep problems (AGQ) caused by achalasia were either not improved by POEM, or that although POEM improved the achalasia&#x02010;related sleep problems (AGQ), new sleep problems (AGQ) might have developed due to symptomatic GERD or other factors in this group. Group C included two patients (two of 177 [1.13%]) who had no sleep problems (AGQ) before POEM but had sleep problems (AGQ) without symptomatic GERD after POEM. Because symptomatic GERD was absent, sleep problems (AGQ) in this group after POEM were likely caused by factors other than GERD. Group D included four patients (four of 177 [2.26%]) who had sleep problems (AGQ) both before and after POEM but did not have symptomatic GERD. It was considered that the sleep problems (AGQ) caused by achalasia were either not improved by POEM, or that although POEM improved the achalasia&#x02010;related sleep problems (AGQ), new sleep problems (AGQ) might have developed due to factors other than symptomatic GERD. In this study, there were no cases of sleep problems (AGQ) caused by POEM failure. Based on these results, the occurrence of sleep problems (AGQ) related to symptomatic GERD after POEM is estimated to be 5&#x02013;11 out of 177 patients (2.82%&#x02013;6.21%), even if we assume that all patients in Group B had sleep problems (AGQ) due to symptomatic GERD. However, as mentioned later in the Limitations, this study did not consider important factors such as sleep disorders (e.g., sleep apnea or insomnia), the use of sleep medications, alcohol or smoking history, and specific sleep problems (e.g., difficulty falling asleep or early morning awakening). Therefore, I believe these figures might be regarded as reference values.</p><p>Currently, the Eckardt symptom score is widely used in POEM to evaluate the effectiveness of achalasia treatment and compare it with traditional treatment methods, such as Heller&#x02010;Dor surgery and balloon dilation.<xref rid="deo270064-bib-0019" ref-type="bibr">

</xref> However, the Eckardt symptom score does not include all important measures related to the quality of life of patients, such as sleep problems, as examined in this study. Additionally, weight loss, which is one of the items included in the Eckardt symptom score, does not occur after POEM, and chest pain cannot be distinguished from pain caused by GERD. Therefore, the appropriateness of the Eckardt symptom score in determining the effectiveness of POEM treatment is questionable. The primary goal of achalasia treatment is to improve the overall quality of life of affected individuals; therefore, it is hoped that the Eckardt symptom score can be further developed to incorporate quality&#x02010;of&#x02010;life assessments. In such cases, the evaluation of sleep problems, which was the focus of the present study, will be necessary.</p><p>This study has several limitations that should be noted. First, an overall assessment of sleep was not performed. In this study, &#x0201c;sleep problems (AGQ)&#x0201d; were evaluated only through the GERD&#x02010;Q, which is not specifically designed to assess sleep. GERD&#x02010;Q Q5 asks whether heartburn or reflux affects sleep. Furthermore, important factors such as sleep disorders (e.g., sleep apnea or insomnia), use of sleep medication, alcohol or smoking history, and specific sleep problems (e.g., difficulty falling asleep or early morning awakening) were not considered. Additionally, objective data indicating sleep such as electroencephalography during sleep, were not collected. Therefore, the content and causes of sleep problems (AGQ) were not evaluated through more objective methods beyond the questionnaire. Second, this was a single&#x02010;center retrospective study, which may limit the generalizability of the findings to other settings or populations. Third, the data collected were only short&#x02010;term, with follow&#x02010;up conducted 3 months after the POEM procedure. Longer&#x02010;term data would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the effects of the POEM procedure on sleep problems (AGQ) in patients with achalasia. Fourth, multivariate analysis was not performed in this study. Finally, we hope that future studies address these limitations with longer&#x02010;term follow&#x02010;up periods, specialized questionnaires for sleep problems, and objective data specific to sleep problems (such as electroencephalography), to provide a more robust understanding of the relationship between achalasia and sleep problems.</p></sec><sec id="deo270064-sec-0170"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Sleep problems assessed by GERD&#x02010;Q (AGQ) were observed in more than 60% of patients with achalasia in the present study, ranking as the third most common symptom.
