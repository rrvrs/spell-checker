However, bacteria have evolved mechanisms to expel excess zinc ions from their cells, enabling them to thrive in environments rich in metal ions at high concentrations. This evolutionary advancement limits the clinical application of metal ions as antimicrobial agents. In this study, we aimed to investigate the potential of zinc ionophores to overcome bacterial resistance by elevating intracellular zinc ion levels.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We employed the zinc ionophore PBT2 to elevate intracellular zinc ion levels in Klebsiella pneumoniae, a bacterium known for its resistance to various antibiotics. By treating K. pneumoniae with PBT2, we aimed to assess its impact on bacterial resistance to tigecycline, an antibiotic commonly used in clinical settings. The changes in intracellular zinc ion levels, superoxide dismutase activity, reactive oxygen species concentration, and cell wall synthesis pathway were monitored to evaluate the mechanism of action of PBT2.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Our results revealed that PBT2 successfully reversed the resistance of K. pneumoniae to tigecycline. Specifically, PBT2 increased the concentration of intracellular zinc ions in K. pneumoniae, leading to a suppression of superoxide dismutase activity within the cell and an elevation of reactive oxygen species concentration. These changes impaired the oxidative stress response of the bacteria. Additionally, the disruption of zinc homeostasis significantly inhibited the cell wall synthesis pathway in K. pneumoniae, potentially restricting the efflux pump mechanism that predominantly drives tigecycline resistance.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The findings of this study pave the way for innovative strategies and approaches in the clinical development of novel antimicrobial agents. By using zinc ionophores such as PBT2 to elevate intracellular zinc ion levels, we can overcome bacterial resistance to antibiotics like tigecycline. The suppression of superoxide dismutase activity and elevation of reactive oxygen species concentration suggest that PBT2 impairs the oxidative stress response of K. pneumoniae, further enhancing its susceptibility to antibiotics. Furthermore, the inhibition of the cell wall synthesis pathway and restriction of the efflux pump mechanism provide additional mechanisms by which PBT2 reverses antibiotic resistance. These results highlight the potential of zinc ionophores as a novel class of antimicrobial agents and warrant further investigation into their clinical applications.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>PBT2</kwd><kwd>zinc</kwd><kwd>GlmU</kwd><kwd>tigecycline</kwd><kwd>Klebsiella pneumoniae</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>The author(s) declare financial support was received for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.

Moreover, the slowdown in the discovery and commercialization of new antimicrobial drugs further exacerbates this issue. Researchers are actively exploring various strategies to address bacterial resistance to existing antimicrobial drugs. These strategies include the development of new antibiotics, phage therapy, and repurposing existing drugs (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Wang et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Donlin and Meyers, 2022</xref>). Some studies suggest that repurposing existing drugs may be a promising strategy. These drugs may not have been initially developed as treatments for infectious diseases. Rediscovering the potential of these drugs and adjusting their existing therapeutic uses can reduce the time, cost, and risk associated with developing new drugs, providing a novel approach to tackling antibiotic resistance (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">De Oliveira et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">De Oliveira et&#x000a0;al., 2022b</xref>).</p><p>5,7-Dichloro-2-[(dimethylamino)methyl]quinolin-8-ol (PBT2) has previously been investigated as a potential treatment for Alzheimer&#x02019;s and Huntington&#x02019;s diseases and has entered Phase II clinical trials. Experimental results have shown that PBT2 has the ability to facilitate the intracellular transport of zinc ions. PBT2 is a second-generation hydroxyquinoline analogue. As a metal ion carrier, PBT2 has been shown to bind zinc ions in a 2:1 ratio, and the formed PBT2-zinc complex can transport tightly regulated zinc ions into bacterial cells. Zinc is the second most abundant transition metal ion in the human body and plays a crucial role in immune function. According to relevant literature reports, zinc deficiency affects many people worldwide, resulting in adverse effects on human health, including compromised immune defenses and increased susceptibility to infections (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Guilbert, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Haase and Rink, 2014a</xref>; <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Haase and Rink, 2014b</xref>). Bacterial pathogens encounter significant fluctuations in metal ion abundance during host colonization. Related research has confirmed that zinc contributes to resisting bacterial infections (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Maunders et&#x000a0;al., 2024</xref>; <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Stiles et&#x000a0;al., 2024</xref>; <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Wang et&#x000a0;al., 2024</xref>), but the specific mechanisms are still unclear. To better understand and address bacterial resistance issues, further research is needed on the effects of zinc stress on bacterial resistance mechanisms. This can lead to a better understanding of bacterial resistance mechanisms against antibiotics and the exploration of more effective antibacterial treatment methods.</p><p>Carbapenem-resistant <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> (CRKP) is one of the important nosocomial pathogens (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Karampatakis et&#x000a0;al., 2023</xref>), capable of causing various infections and developing resistance to multiple antimicrobial drugs (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Kumar et&#x000a0;al., 2023</xref>; <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Li et&#x000a0;al., 2023</xref>). The emergence of multidrug resistance limits the choice of available drugs, with tigecycline and polymyxins becoming the last resort. Tigecycline belongs to the glycylcycline class of antibiotics, which inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 16S rRNA of the 30S ribosomal subunit, overcoming the resistance mechanisms of acquired ribosomal protection and active efflux associated with tetracycline drugs, reducing the likelihood of bacterial resistance to tigecycline (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Liu et&#x000a0;al., 2024</xref>). Among these mechanisms, the efflux pump transport system plays a crucial role in resistance. Efflux pumps are widely present on bacterial cell membranes, allowing bacteria to pump antimicrobial drugs entering the cell out of the cell, thereby reducing the drug concentration inside the bacterial cell and leading to resistance. In <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic>, there are various efflux pump systems, such as the AcrAB-TolC efflux pump, OqxAB efflux pump, and KpgABC efflux pump, among others. Overexpression of these efflux pumps can mediate tigecycline resistance (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Yang et&#x000a0;al., 2023</xref>; <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Zheng et&#x000a0;al., 2023</xref>). In this study, we found that the combined use of PBT2 and zinc ions can reverse tigecycline resistance in carbapenem-resistant <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic>. This mechanism differs from traditional forms of drug resistance, as the antimicrobial action of metal ions makes it difficult for bacteria to develop corresponding resistance.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s2"><label>2</label><title>Results</title><sec id="s2_1"><label>2.1</label><title>Strain selection</title><p>In this experiment, a total of 14 strains of tigecycline-nonsusceptible <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> (TNSKP) were collected.

</xref>). Co-incubation with the efflux pump inhibitor Pa&#x003b2;N resulted in a &#x02265;4-fold decrease in the MIC values of 14 TNSKP strains, confirming the involvement of efflux pumps in tigecycline resistance.</p></sec><sec id="s2_2"><label>2.2</label><title>The effect of PBT2 combined with zinc on the growth of <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic>
</title><p>The KP29 strain exhibited an eightfold decrease in MIC value following co-incubation with the efflux pump inhibitor, further confirming that tigecycline resistance is primarily mediated by efflux pumps. Based on these results, the KP29 strain was selected for further investigation. We chose the subinhibitory concentration of PBT 2 (64 &#x003bc;M) as the drug concentration for the subsequent study. We explored the effects of CA-MH broth (MH), zinc ion group (Zinc), PBT2 group (PBT2), and PBT2+Zinc ion group (PZinc) on the alteration of multidrug resistance in <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic>. Under conditions of PBT2 (64&#x003bc;M) and zinc ions (256&#x003bc;M), the MIC for tigecycline in <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> changed by more than fourfold (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">
<bold>Table&#x000a0;1</bold>

Growth curve experiments showed no significant changes with the sole addition of Zinc (256&#x003bc;M), whereas the addition of PBT2 (64&#x003bc;M) alone significantly altered the growth curve. The most pronounced changes were observed when both PBT2 (64&#x003bc;M) and Zinc (256&#x003bc;M) were added together (<xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material">
<bold>Supplementary Figure S1</bold>

Through whole-genome sequencing, we extensively examined the situation of the AcrB and Oqxb efflux pump genes. The results showed that under zinc stress conditions, these efflux pump genes did not undergo genetic mutations. This ruled out gene mutation as a reason for zinc ion affecting resistance. Subsequently, we performed transcriptome sequencing to observe the expression changes of these efflux pump genes. Interestingly, in the PBT2+Zinc treatment group, the expression of AcrB and Oqxb efflux pump genes was upregulated (3.2log2-fold, 2.6log2-fold).

Carbapenem-resistant <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> (CRKP) has shown a year-on-year increase, further limiting drug options, with tigecycline and polymyxins becoming the last resort for CRKP infections. As the use of tigecycline in therapy increases, its resistance has garnered significant attention. Therefore, it is necessary to develop new antibiotics and identify new targets for treating resistant bacteria.</p><p>Initially developed for treating Alzheimer&#x02019;s and Huntington&#x02019;s diseases, PBT2 has drawn attention due to its unique zinc ion transport properties (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Adlard et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>). In the medical field, the combined use of PBT2 and zinc ions has been demonstrated to exhibit outstanding bactericidal effects against Gram-positive bacteria (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Brazel et&#x000a0;al., 2022</xref>; <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">De Oliveira et&#x000a0;al., 2022b</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we observed that the combined application of PBT2 and zinc ions significantly altered the multidrug resistance of CRKP to tetracycline antibiotics, especially tigecycline. This finding is consistent with research by De Oliveira, David M P et&#x000a0;al (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">De Oliveira et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>), whose experimental results indicated that the combined use of PBT2 and zinc ions not only altered CRKP&#x02019;s resistance to tigecycline but also successfully reversed its resistance to polymyxins. In studies on Neisseria gonorrhoeae, PBT2 altered polymyxin resistance by reducing phosphoethanolamine modification of lipid A on the cell wall (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Jen et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>). However, there have been no previous reports on the specific mechanisms by which PBT2 affects tigecycline resistance. Therefore, building upon existing research, this study delves into the potential mechanisms underlying PBT2-mediated changes in tigecycline resistance.</p><p>The role of PBT2 in resistance is largely attributed to its ability to enrich zinc ions within cells. In this study, internal concentrations of iron, manganese, copper, and zinc ions in CRKP were measured using ICP-MS. The results confirmed that PBT2 significantly increased the intracellular zinc ion concentration (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">
<bold>Figure&#x000a0;1</bold>
</xref>). Excessive zinc ion concentrations may affect the uptake of iron and manganese ions to some extent. Early studies (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Osman and Robinson, 2023</xref>) described complexes of divalent transition metals with polydentate acidic organic ligands, leading to the establishment of the Irving-Williams series: Mn&#x000b2;<sup>+</sup> &#x0003c; Fe&#x000b2;<sup>+</sup> &#x0003c; Co&#x000b2;<sup>+</sup> &#x0003c; Ni&#x000b2;<sup>+</sup> &#x0003c; Cu&#x000b2;<sup>+</sup> &#x0003e; Zn&#x000b2;<sup>+</sup>. This series systematically reveals the variations in the thermodynamic stability of metal complexes: Mn and Fe exhibit relatively lower binding affinities, while Cu and Zn have higher binding affinities. Generally, metal ions with lower affinities can be easily replaced by ions with higher affinities. For example, manganese poisoning can lead to the inhibition of Mg-dependent enzymes (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Hohle and O'Brian, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Pi et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>).Elevated zinc levels can impair manganese uptake through the mismetallation of Mn substrate-binding proteins (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">McDevitt et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>CRKP exhibits diverse mechanisms of resistance to tigecycline, with the efflux pump transport system being the most predominant. These genes encode efflux pump proteins that anchor to the cell membrane and cell wall through a series of complex biological pathways. Bacteria pump out antimicrobial drugs through these efflux pumps to develop resistance. The tigecycline and Pa&#x003b2;N combination experiment (<xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material">
<bold>Supplementary Table S1</bold>
</xref>) confirmed that efflux pumps are the main factor contributing to tigecycline resistance. To explore the extent to which efflux pumps are involved in PBT2-induced changes in tigecycline resistance, this study utilized gene editing technology to construct CRKP strains with knockout mutations in the Oqxb, AcrB, TetA, and AcrB-TetA efflux pump genes. The CRKP strain with knockout mutations in the AcrB-TetA efflux pump genes was unable to grow in tigecycline-containing medium, and the MIC values of the other four strains increased by &#x02265;4-fold (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">
<bold>Figure&#x000a0;3</bold>
</xref>). Importantly, the MIC values of meropenem did not change under PBT2 (64&#x003bc;M) and zinc ion (256&#x003bc;M) conditions. Combining these two sets of data suggests that intracellular zinc ion enrichment may limit tigecycline resistance primarily through efflux pump mechanisms. Transcriptomic studies further supported this hypothesis, showing upregulation of AcrB, Oqxb, RND and AcrD efflux pump genes in the PBT2+zinc treatment group(<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">
<bold>Table&#x000a0;2</bold>
</xref>), although the upregulated efflux pump genes seemed ineffective in their function.</p><p>Based on recent research advances, we observed that PBT2 can alter MIC values, and the antimicrobial drugs affected by it appear to exhibit similarities in their resistance mechanisms. For example, PBT2 can reverse <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> resistance to ampicillin (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Brazel et&#x000a0;al., 2022</xref>), as well as <italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic> and <italic>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</italic> resistance to tetracyclines (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Jen et&#x000a0;al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">De Oliveira et&#x000a0;al., 2022a</xref>), and <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> resistance to polymyxins (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">De Oliveira et&#x000a0;al., 2022b</xref>). Most of these resistances are associated with changes in bacterial efflux pump mechanisms or binding sites on the cell wall. Further studies have revealed that zinc ion enrichment within cells significantly inhibits the acetyltransferase activity of GlmU enzyme, thereby severely affecting cell wall metabolism (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Brazel et&#x000a0;al., 2022</xref>). GlmU enzyme is a key bifunctional enzyme in cell wall synthesis responsible for UDP-GlcNAc synthesis, an essential precursor for cell wall biosynthesis. Our metabolomic data showed a downward trend in UDP-GlcNAc content in the PZinc group (<xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material">
<bold>Supplementary Figure S3</bold>
</xref>). Additionally, the analysis of gene expression supported the notion that zinc ion enrichment may affect GlmU enzyme activity,GT2-GlmU-N-bac, UDPNAET, FosA, and GlmM are key genes involved in bacterial cell wall synthesis and their expression is upregulated (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">
<bold>Table&#x000a0;2</bold>
</xref>), although the upregulated genes seemed ineffective in their function. a hypothesis further validated by scanning electron microscopy observations. Building upon this research background and preliminary experimental results, we propose a potential resistance mechanism: PBT2, by promoting intracellular zinc ion enrichment in CRKP, affects the protein activity of GlmU enzyme, thereby reducing peptidoglycan synthesis. This process may also be accompanied by a loss of function of RND type efflux pumps at the cell membrane. The combined effects of these factors ultimately lead to the reversal of tigecycline resistance. However, how the blockage of bacterial cell wall synthesis pathways specifically affects the function of efflux pump proteins still requires further experimental validation. Meanwhile, considering the cost and toxicity of the PBT2 drug, animal experiments were not conducted in this study to assess its actual effects. Nevertheless, based on previous related research (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Brazel et&#x000a0;al., 2022</xref>; <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">De Oliveira et&#x000a0;al., 2022a</xref>), PBT2 combined with zinc ions has demonstrated favorable adjuvant therapeutic effects in mouse infection models.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="s4"><label>4</label><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our study demonstrates that PBT2 effectively enriches intracellular zinc in <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic>, leading to the reversal of tigecycline resistance in a high-zinc environment.

Notably, disruption of zinc homeostasis markedly inhibits K. pneumoniae&#x02019;s cell wall synthesis pathway. This inhibition may partially constrain the efflux pump mechanism, a primary driver of tigecycline resistance, thereby presenting novel perspectives and strategies for treating infections caused by this bacterium.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><label>5</label><title>Experimental procedures</title><sec id="s5_1"><label>5.1</label><title>Efflux pump inhibition experiment</title><p>First, Mueller-Hinton (MH) agar medium with a pH between 7.2 and 7.4 was prepared.
