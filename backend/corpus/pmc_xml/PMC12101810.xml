Evaluation revealed hypercalcemia, tachycardia, and elevated plasma and urine catecholamine metabolites. Despite the absence of classic paroxysmal symptoms, such as episodic headache, palpitations, and sweating, hypertension combined with orthostatic hypotension and elevated catecholamines raised strong suspicion for pheochromocytoma. Management involved a multidisciplinary approach, with scheduled amlodipine and labetalol effectively normalizing blood pressure and heart rate. This case underscores the importance of considering pheochromocytoma in pediatric secondary hypertension, even in the absence of hallmark symptoms, and highlights possible management of overlapping orthostatic hypotension and persistent hypertension. It also demonstrates the utility of interdisciplinary care and cautious antihypertensive management in addressing the complex presentation of pediatric pheochromocytoma.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>catecholamine</kwd><kwd>chiari i malformation</kwd><kwd>neuroendocrine tumor</kwd><kwd>orthostatic hypotension</kwd><kwd>pediatric hypertension</kwd><kwd>pheochromocytoma</kwd><kwd>plasma metanephrines</kwd><kwd>secondary hypertension</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Pheochromocytomas are neural crest cell tumors associated with excess catecholamine production, most commonly located in the adrenal medulla. Most are benign, although malignant pheochromocytomas exist as well. Presentation can be variable, including persistent or paroxysmal hypertension, headaches, palpitations, and/or diaphoresis [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In the United States, pheochromocytoma is rare, with an annual incidence of only three cases per one million people, 20% of which occur in the pediatric and adolescent population [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. This rarity makes diagnosing and managing pheochromocytoma, particularly in younger patients, especially challenging. The prevalence of pediatric hypertension has increased to 4.5%, largely due to obesity-related cases. Secondary hypertension, more common in younger children, is primarily caused by renal disease (78-80%), endocrine issues (11%), and, less frequently, by cardiac (2%) or pulmonary conditions. Pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas account for only 0.5-2% of secondary hypertension cases, so common causes should be prioritized during evaluation [<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Symptoms, laboratory results, and family history can help identify rare catecholamine-secreting tumors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="cases"><title>Case presentation</title><p>A 14-year-old female with a notable history of anxiety, Chiari I malformation, orthostatic hypotension, and unremarkable family and surgical history presented to the emergency department (ED) with pain in the lower back and bilateral lower extremities. She was found to be hypertensive with a blood pressure of 145/98 mmHg and was subsequently admitted for further evaluation and management.</p><p>The patient reported a one-day history of bilateral flank and calf pain, rated as 6/10, accompanied by two episodes of non-bloody, non-bilious vomiting. Her pain improved to 2/10 following administration of Toradol in the ED. She denied any history of trauma, joint pain, weakness, or bowel or bladder incontinence. On physical examination, a bruise was noted on her back, though it was non-tender. Additional findings included bilateral calf tenderness and tachycardia. No other significant abnormalities were identified.</p><p>Initial evaluation</p><p>Laboratory investigations revealed hypercalcemia (11.3 mg/dL), hyperproteinemia (10.1 g/dL), and proteinuria (70 mg/dL) on urinalysis (Table <xref rid="TAB1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was mildly elevated at 24 mm/hour, while creatine kinase and thyroid function tests were unremarkable (Table <xref rid="TAB1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Imaging with lumbar and thoracic spine X-rays showed mild spinal curvature but no acute findings.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="TAB1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Results of additional laboratory evaluations for alternative causes of persistent hypertension.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr style="background-color:#ccc"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">

These catecholamine-secreting tumors account for approximately 0.1-0.6% of all cases of secondary hypertension [<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. This case highlights the rare presentation of secondary hypertension with a strong suspicion for pheochromocytoma in a pediatric patient with pre-existing orthostatic hypotension and Chiari I malformation. The clinical overlap between these conditions presented a diagnostic challenge, emphasizing the importance of recognizing and managing complex presentations of hypertension in adolescents. While pheochromocytoma is exceedingly rare in children, this case contributes to the growing body of evidence supporting its consideration in the differential diagnosis of pediatric secondary hypertension.</p><p>Hypertension in children is typically attributed to renal, cardiac, or endocrine causes. In this patient, the significant elevations in metanephrine and normetanephrine levels pointed strongly toward a catecholamine-secreting tumor. While hypertension is a hallmark symptom of pheochromocytoma, the presentation in this case was atypical due to the coexistence of orthostatic hypotension, syncopal episodes, and non-specific symptoms such as flank and back pain, vomiting, and bruising. The absence of the classic paroxysmal symptom triad, i.e., episodic headache, palpitations, and sweating, further complicated the clinical picture.</p><p>The concomitance of hypertension and orthostatic hypotension in pheochromocytoma is unusual and poorly understood. One hypothesis is that chronic catecholamine excess may lead to decreased vascular responsiveness due to downregulation of alpha-adrenergic receptors and impaired baroreceptor reflex function [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Similar cases, such as a 71-year-old male with orthostasis and syncope, have demonstrated resolution of symptoms following administration of propranolol and tumor resection [<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, there are very limited documented cases of such phenomena within the pediatric population. While cardiac contractility dysfunction may contribute to hypotension in some patients with pheochromocytoma, this was ruled out in our patient following a normal echocardiogram. This highlights the importance of comprehensive cardiovascular evaluation in similar cases.</p><p>The management of this case underscored the role of a multidisciplinary approach. Collaboration among the nephrology, cardiology, and physical therapy teams was crucial. Initial hesitance to initiate antihypertensive therapy due to concerns about exacerbating orthostatic hypotension was addressed via a thorough discussion between the nephrology, cardiology, and general pediatric team, leading to the selection of Labetalol, a mixed alpha- and beta-blocker. This choice was guided by evidence supporting its efficacy in lowering blood pressure steadily without causing abrupt drops [<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In this case, Labetalol effectively normalized both hypertension and tachycardia, demonstrating its suitability for similar pediatric presentations.</p><p>Of note, pediatric pheochromocytomas are more often associated with germline mutations compared to their adult counterparts [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. These mutations frequently involve syndromes such as multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2), von Hippel-Lindau disease, or mutations in succinate dehydrogenase (<italic>SDHx</italic>) genes [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Notably, this patient&#x02019;s incidental initial hypercalcemia raises suspicion for MEN2. Further genetic testing would likely aid in discerning if there is a genetic component to the patient&#x02019;s onset of symptoms; however, a significant limitation, the patient was unfortunately lost to follow-up. Nevertheless, one should consider genetic testing in pediatric cases of pheochromocytoma to identify underlying syndromic associations.</p><p>Another major limitation as a result of the patient being lost to follow-up in this case was the inability to obtain definitive imaging to confirm the presence of a pheochromocytoma. This emphasizes the critical role of robust discharge planning, patient education, and follow-up to ensure continuity of care. Future cases should prioritize streamlined transitions from inpatient to outpatient settings and clear communication with families regarding the importance of post-discharge testing and follow-up appointments to minimize diagnostic delays and optimize outcomes.</p><p>This case also serves as a reminder that rare conditions such as pheochromocytoma should remain on the differential diagnosis for pediatric hypertension, especially when initial workups for more common causes are inconclusive or unremarkable. Early identification and management can prevent severe complications, such as hypertensive end-organ damage, which was fortunately ruled out in this patient but remains a significant risk in undiagnosed cases. Clinicians managing similar cases should remain cautious of confounding factors, such as coexisting conditions or incomplete symptomatology, which may delay diagnosis. Instead, one should maintain a systematic approach to similar cases, starting with detailed history-taking and a focused physical examination, followed by appropriate laboratory and imaging studies. When pheochromocytoma is suspected, timely collection and processing of catecholamine and metanephrine levels are paramount, as delayed testing can complicate diagnosis and treatment planning.</p><p>Overall, this case underscores the challenges of managing coexisting conditions, such as orthostatic hypotension, alongside secondary hypertension, as well as possible considerations for management in such cases. The need to balance effective antihypertensive therapy while avoiding adverse effects highlights the complexity of treatment decisions. Moreover, the integration of multidisciplinary care was instrumental in achieving clinical improvement, emphasizing its value in managing such intricate presentations. By sharing this case, we aim to raise awareness of the diagnostic and management challenges of pheochromocytoma in the pediatric population.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This case highlights the diagnostic and therapeutic challenges associated with pediatric pheochromocytoma, particularly when compounded by coexisting conditions such as orthostatic hypotension. It underscores the necessity of maintaining a broad differential diagnosis in cases of secondary hypertension, even in the absence of classic symptoms. Elevated catecholamine levels strongly suggested pheochromocytoma in this patient, but the lack of definitive imaging due to loss to follow-up highlights the critical importance of robust discharge planning and continuity of care. The successful management of this case, through a multidisciplinary approach and the judicious use of scheduled amlodipine and Labetalol to normalize blood pressure and heart rate, demonstrates the value of collaboration across specialties. Additionally, it emphasizes the need for systematic evaluation and consideration of genetic testing in pediatric cases. By sharing this case, we aim to improve awareness and promote early recognition and intervention for rare but life-threatening conditions such as pheochromocytoma in children.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group content-type="conflict"><title>Disclosures</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Human subjects:</bold> Consent for treatment and open access publication was obtained or waived by all participants in this study.</p><p><bold>Conflicts of interest:</bold> In compliance with the ICMJE uniform disclosure form, all authors declare the following:</p><p><bold>Payment/services info:</bold> All authors have declared that no financial support was received from any organization for the submitted work.</p><p><bold>Financial relationships:</bold> All authors have declared that they have no financial relationships at present or within the previous three years with any organizations that might have an interest in the submitted work.</p><p><bold>Other relationships:</bold> All authors have declared that there are no other relationships or activities that could appear to have influenced the submitted work.</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="other"><title>Author Contributions</title><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Concept and design:</bold>&#x000a0; Aren S.
