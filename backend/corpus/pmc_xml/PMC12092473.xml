It is suggested that this behaviour results from social, affiliative motivations. Dogs have also been known to behave differently when they are being watched (or not) by humans, such as by following commands better (or worse). In this study, we tested whether dogs&#x02019; copying behaviour would also be sensitive to their caregiver&#x02019;s attentional states. The subject&#x02019;s caregiver demonstrated irrelevant and relevant actions in the dot-touching overimitation task, then during trials the caregiver was either watching their dog or turned away. Our results revealed no difference in dogs&#x02019; irrelevant-action copying; however, we found that dogs approached the dots less per trial when their caregiver was watching them. Dogs also copied their caregiver&#x02019;s leftward sliding of a door (to obtain a food reward) more accurately when they were being watched by their caregiver. Finally, dogs who copied the irrelevant action did so more often after obtaining their food reward, which supports that these dogs may have had two separate goals: a primary instrumental goal and a secondary social goal.</p><sec><title>Supplementary information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.3758/s13420-024-00635-2.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Domestic dogs</kwd><kwd>Attentional states</kwd><kwd>Copying</kwd><kwd>Overimitation</kwd><kwd>Social learning</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna</institution></funding-source></award-group><open-access><p>Open access funding provided by University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna</p></open-access></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Psychonomic Society, Inc. 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">If a dog&#x02019;s caregiver turns away or leaves a room, their dog may decide to take some food from their dinner plate. When it comes to obeying caregiver commands or cues, domestic dogs (<italic>Canis familiaris</italic>) behave differently according to human attentional states. For example, Call et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2003</xref>) found that dogs approached a forbidden piece of food more indirectly and obtained the food less often if they were being watched by a human than if the human was engaged in another activity, turned around, or left the room completely. Dogs were shown to also &#x02018;steal&#x02019; more food in front of a human if the target area had low levels of light (Kaminski et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2013</xref>). Similarly, dogs have been shown to obey a &#x02018;lie down&#x02019; command more successfully and for longer while being watched (Schwab &#x00026; Huber, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2006</xref>). Even when a dog&#x02019;s caregiver would show attentive ambiguity (looking away at nothing), dogs responded uncertainly to a &#x02018;lie down&#x02019; command (Vir&#x000e1;nyi et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2004</xref>). One's sensitivity to the attentional cues of others demonstrates that one understands what others can or cannot see. This is a useful skill for individuals who have a will to please or obey others, such as domestic dogs &#x02013; a species that have been following cues of, and cooperating with, their closely bonded humans for thousands of years.</p><p id="Par3">Learning to follow human commands and cues is something that dogs are particularly good at. Many dogs have, and have had, their own jobs in human society. From search and rescue to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) support, dogs can perform well in tasks for and with human partners after proper training (Alexander et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2011</xref>; Maoz et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2021</xref>). And unlike non-human primates (chimpanzees), domestic dogs perform on a similar level to human children in some sociocognitive tasks, especially those that involve following the human gaze or point (MacLean et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2017</xref>). Dogs&#x02019; high level of commitment towards their human partners may explain their tendency to copy them too.</p><p id="Par4">Given their human-directed sociocognitive capabilities, it comes as no surprise that dogs are able to copy humans. In do-as-I-do tasks, dogs can be trained to copy both familiar and novel actions of human demonstrators, such as throwing a bottle or circling another human (i.e., Fugazza &#x00026; Miklosi, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2014</xref>; Huber et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2009</xref>; Top&#x000e1;l et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2006</xref>). Other studies have explored the imitative tendencies of dogs, finding that dogs (i) match the actions of human demonstrators to solve novel tasks (for a review, see Kubinyi et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2009</xref>), (ii) match humans as puppies (Fugazza et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2018</xref>) and without food rewards (Fugazza et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2023</xref>), (iii) struggle to <italic>not</italic> copy their caregiver&#x02019;s action in a bidirectional task (Range et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2010</xref>), and even (iv) copy novel human actions after a delay (Fugazza, Pogany, &#x00026; Miklosi, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2016</xref>; Huber et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2014</xref>). It seems that dogs cannot ignore even their caregiver&#x02019;s goal-irrelevant actions in a novel problem-solving task, as they were shown to copy their caregiver&#x02019;s (unnecessary) touching of coloured dots on the wall (Huber et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2018</xref>). Other studies have demonstrated this seemingly irrational faithfulness to humans, where dogs were found to follow an (mis)informant with a false belief (Lonardo et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2021</xref>) and a communicative demonstrator (Kup&#x000e1;n et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2011</xref>) towards an empty food container. Notably, however, dogs do not always follow misleading human cues &#x02013; for example, from an inaccurate informant in Pelgrim et al.&#x02019;s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2021</xref>) study or from the true-belief informant of Lonardo et al.&#x02019;s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2021</xref>) study. Dogs can recognise intentions (i.e., V&#x000f6;lter et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2023</xref>), so whether or not dogs follow misleading cues may depend on whether these cues appear deceitful or not. Someone with a true belief or inaccurate pointing may come across as deceitful and therefore untrustworthy.</p><p id="Par5">The copying of another&#x02019;s irrelevant actions was first documented in human children (Horner &#x00026; Whiten, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2005</xref>), and was then called &#x02018;overimitation&#x02019; by Lyons et al., (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2007</xref>). However, Whiten et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2009</xref>) preferred to use the more neutral term &#x02018;over-copying&#x02019; since overimitation studies do not typically examine the faithful replication of movement trajectories (e.g., Huber, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">1998</xref>), which is often a necessary feature when defining <italic>imitation</italic>. Nonetheless, overimitation is the most common term in the literature. We henceforth use overimitation in the sense of general irrelevant-action copying or matching, when action causal-irrelevance is perceivably obvious (i.e., Lyons et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2007</xref>).</p><p id="Par6">For humans, there is evidence that overimitation is influenced by social factors, such as the demonstrator&#x02019;s characteristics, the presentation format of the demonstration, and the language used during the overimitation tasks (for a review, see Hoehl et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2019</xref>). One notable factor that influences human overimitation is the attentional states of the demonstrator. Stengelin et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2019</xref>) showed that children, from both Namibia and Germany, copied more (irrelevant) actions from a model who was watching them during their turn to operate the task&#x02019;s puzzle box. Another study showed that children reduced their overimitation when a model turned away, but not when the model was watching them or had left the room (Marsh et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2019</xref>). Dogs are also sensitive to human attentional states in terms of obedience, but they have not (yet) been tested for this sensitivity in a social learning context.</p><p id="Par7">It is suggested that dogs copy irrelevant actions for social, affiliative motivations. For example, dogs have proceeded to overimitate their caregiver more than a stranger (Huber et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2020</xref>), have obtained high overimitation scores alongside high caregiver-relationship scores (Huber et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2022</xref>), and have often overimitated after already achieving their instrumental (food) goal (Mackie &#x00026; Huber, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2023</xref>). Dog puppies have also spontaneously copied human actions such as touching a box with the nose in the complete absence of food rewards, which would make these actions also causally irrelevant to an instrumental (food) goal (Fugazza et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2023</xref>). The task used in Huber et al.&#x02019;s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2022</xref>) and Mackie and Huber&#x02019;s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2023</xref>) studies was a dot-touching task for dogs, purposely designed to physically disconnect irrelevant and relevant actions, thus increasing causal transparency between these two actions. Often human-designed puzzle boxes have pseudo-instrumental irrelevant actions, meaning that the physical connectedness of these actions could easily be misinterpreted as causal relevance to obtaining the reward (i.e., Schleihauf &#x00026; Hoehl, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2021</xref>). A disconnection would reduce the chances of overimitation occurring as a result of causal misunderstanding. So, the motivation for a dog to overimitate, by copying the touching of (at least) one or more irrelevant coloured dot(s) on the wall in Huber et al.&#x02019;s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2018</xref>) task, is likely to have other (social) reasons behind it. But it is unclear whether these reasons are related to affiliation, to be like or associate with the bonded-caregiver, or perhaps an intention to please their <italic>watchful </italic>caregiver, someone who usually holds expectations that the dog should follow their commands (in this case, actions interpreted as cues).</p><p id="Par8">As dogs have shown sensitivity to human attentional states in obedience tasks &#x02013; tasks to follow human commands or cues &#x02013; would they alter their overimitation behaviour if their caregiver is watching them or turned away? If so, then copying irrelevant (or relevant) actions may be related to the dog&#x02019;s will to please their watchful caregiver (i.e., as in Schwab &#x00026; Huber, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2006</xref>), rather than pure affiliation. Our study investigated dogs&#x02019; sensitivity to their caregiver&#x02019;s attentional states in the context of the dot-touching overimitation task (from Huber et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2018</xref>). After the dog received their caregiver&#x02019;s task demonstration (containing both irrelevant and relevant actions), we manipulated whether the caregiver would be watching them closely or turned away facing a wall during the dog&#x02019;s task trial (four demonstrations and trials total). We scored each dog for their irrelevant-action copying accuracy (from 0 to 4) during these trials, where a score of two plus (touching at least one irrelevant dot) was considered overimitation. Thus, with a two-tailed hypothesis that dogs may be overimitating for either affiliation or simply following cues, we predicted that dogs would either have equally high irrelevant-copying accuracy scores between conditions (caregiver watching or caregiver turned away), <italic>or</italic> dogs would score higher when their caregiver was watching them. Additionally, if dogs are overimitating for non-instrumental (social) reasons, we also predicted that overimitation would more often occur <italic>after</italic> obtaining the reward, since this was found to be the case in Mackie and Huber (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2023</xref>). Dogs may prioritise the attractive food reward in the dot-touching task to only later copy their caregiver&#x02019;s irrelevant actions, especially if their overimitation has alternative social motivations. We did not make any predictions concerning any copying of the goal-relevant action, but we included the measurement and analysis of the dog&#x02019;s relevant-action copying between our two conditions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Ethics statement</title><p id="Par9">The ethics committee of the University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna approved this study and its procedures, in agreement with good scientific practice and national legislation guidelines (ref: ETK-173/10/2022). Written consent was obtained from the dogs&#x02019; caregivers, who participated voluntarily with their dogs and were told that they could withdraw from the study at any time. Extra informed consent was obtained from the caregivers who appear in the pictures in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.

Therefore, the total number of dogs tested at the Clever Dog Lab for this study was 78. The first 15 dogs were randomly assigned to the two conditions, while the remaining 48 were assigned to balance the conditions for age, sex and breed. There were 33 dogs (16 females, 17 males) in the watching condition and 30 dogs (15 females, 15 males) in the turned-away condition. Mixed dogs represented the highest number of subjects (23 dogs), but no breed was over-represented in the final sample. See Online Supplementary Materials (<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">OSM</xref>) for Participant List (which contains; dog age, breed, condition, obedience score, if they had reported training, task success, if they were an overimitator or not, and Clever Dog Lab experience).</p><p id="Par11">Dogs and their caregivers were recruited through the Clever Dog Lab database and website, social media, and from dog parks. All dogs were required to be between 1 and 12 years old, food motivated, above 30 cm (to reach the apparatus door), and na&#x000ef;ve to the dot-touching overimitation task.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Design and procedure</title><sec id="Sec6"><title>Procedure</title><p id="Par12">Caregivers arrived at the Clever Dog Lab with their dogs to first read and sign the study&#x02019;s consent and data protection forms. During this time, caregivers were in the presence of the experimenter who could answer questions about the study and tell caregivers that they could withdraw at any time. Caregivers were not informed of the study&#x02019;s hypotheses, or about overimitation in particular, until after the session was complete.</p><p id="Par13">The session itself took place in the green room of the Clever Dog Lab (6.0&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;3.3 m) and lasted around 20 min. It was recorded on two video cameras (Panasonic HC-V777, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.panasonic.com">www.panasonic.com</ext-link>) and one ceiling camera. Their outputs were framed together in an.mp4 video file for behavioural coding. The session contained four phases for each dog: a 1-min habituation phase in the room off leash, a 1-min obedience test, a warm-up cup-game, and lastly, four caregiver demonstrations and dog trials of the dot-touching overimitation task, in which we had one of the two manipulations of the caregiver&#x02019;s attentional state (watching or turned away). On completion of the session, the dog was guided to the food reward if they were unsuccessful and the caregiver received an A4-sized study certificate for their participation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Design</title><p id="Par14">This study had a mixed design. We had four task trials, which were a within-subject measure, and two between-subject conditions, where the only difference was that of the attentional state of the caregiver during the dot-touching overimitation task. In the <italic>watching condition</italic>, the caregiver closely watched their dog during the four trials of the task, and in the <italic>turned-away condition</italic>, the caregiver turned away and faced the wall during the four trials of the task.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Obedience test</title><p id="Par15">Sixty dogs experienced a mini-obedience test before the warm-up and the main task. The obedience test lasted 1 min and contained five commands (including sit and stay) from the caregiver in the absence of food rewards. This test was to calculate a score of command-following for each dog (Appendix <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">A</xref>). However, due to large behavioural variance we did not extract reliable scoring from the obedience test to analyse (see <italic>Behavioural coding</italic>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Warm-up cup-game</title><p id="Par16">All dogs experienced a warm-up cup-game in attempt to raise the dog&#x02019;s motivation to pay attention to the caregiver and to collect food rewards. The warm-up also ensured that the dog could (and was motivated to) retrieve food in preparation for the main task. The cup-game itself was a replication of Mackie and Huber&#x02019;s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2023</xref>) and Huber et al.&#x02019;s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2018</xref>) attention task. Three cups were placed upside-down, 60 cm apart, and 2 m in front of the dog (on a leash with the experimenter sitting behind). The caregiver kneeled behind the cups and placed a piece of kibble (or equivalent treat) under one of them for the dog to find. The dog was released by the experimenter and chose a cup by sniffing or touching it. If the first choice was correct, the dog was allowed to eat the reward. There were six rounds of the warm-up cup-game, with the food position alternating between the middle cup (three times), the left, the right, and the middle cup again.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>The dot-touching overimitation task</title><p id="Par17">Finally, all dogs participated in four trials of a novel problem-solving task to obtain a piece of sausage (or equivalent treat) &#x02013; the dot-touching overimitation task (from Huber et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2018</xref>). The set-up of this task included: (i) two coloured dots (blue and yellow) printed on separate A4-sized sheets of paper and stuck to the wall (around 55 cm apart, 50 cm above the floor, and 130 cm to the left of the food chamber), (ii) a wooden panel (150&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;100 cm) containing a food chamber (6&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;7 cm) hidden behind a sliding door (10&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;9 cm) mounted in the middle of the panel (50 cm above the floor), and (iii) a chair on the opposite side of the room for the experimenter to sit on with the dog next to them (around 200 cm away from the dots and wooden panel).</p><p id="Par18">Each trial began with a caregiver task-demonstration. This was taught to the caregiver by the experimenter through a video example, then the caregiver was asked to practice it before beginning the task. When ready, the experimenter, caregiver and dog (on a leash) entered the testing room. The experimenter sat in the chair with the dog by her side (in a position to view the demonstration). The caregiver (standing next to the dog and experimenter) then walked towards the opposite wall and positioned on his/her hands and knees to demonstrate the task&#x02019;s actions in a dog-like manner. To demonstrate the <italic>causally-irrelevant action</italic>, he/she looked at the dog (or called their name if necessary) to ensure the dog was paying attention, and touched the blue dot, then the yellow dot, with his/her nose. Then to demonstrate the <italic>causally-relevant action</italic>, he/she moved to the wooden panel, got on his/her hands and knees, and slid the door open to the left with his/her nose (while maintaining the dog&#x02019;s attention). He/she took the food from the chamber to show the dog, then placed it back and slid the door closed again (hiding this with his/her body). Afterwards, the caregiver returned to stand by the experimenter and dog (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).</p><p id="Par19">Depending on the condition, the caregiver either stood watching the dog or turned away to face a wall for the four trials. The dog was released to begin their 1-min task trial. During the trial, the caregiver was instructed to stand still and not interrupt or help the dog in any way, while the experimenter did the same. Dogs were excluded from the study if the caregiver attempted to influence the dog during trials, such as by pointing at the food chamber.

Dog behaviours of interest were the irrelevant- and relevant-action scores from the dot-touching overimitation task (see Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> for behaviour descriptions). We also coded the irrelevant-action copying&#x02019;s (overimitation&#x02019;s) timing with regards to the goal &#x02013; whether dogs touched at least one dot before or after obtaining their food reward. Command-following scores were coded from the obedience test, with the score representing the number of commands followed, with a maximum score of 5 (see Appendix <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">A </xref>for details).

Mackie and Huber (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2023</xref>) had varying findings for these two types of behaviours; with no effect of trial for their overimitation scores but a decrease per trial for approaching the dots. We therefore recoded the irrelevant-action scores (ordinal, 0&#x02013;4) into an overimitation score (binary, yes or no) and an approach score (binary, yes or no) for two binomial mixed models. Overimitation was scored as yes if the dog touched at least one dot in its trial and no if it did not. Approach was coded binomially for whether or not the dog approached the wall with the dots in its trial, by walking or smelling directly in front of either one or both of them (0 for no, 1 for yes).</p><p id="Par22">The experimenter (JT) coded all of the 63 dog videos for these behaviours. Additionally, 20% (13 randomly selected videos) were coded by KG, an external and na&#x000ef;ve coder, to analyse the coding reliability. KG received a scoring guide (resembling Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) and cropped videos, which contained only the obedience test and the four 1-min trials of the dot-touching overimitation task (without their demonstrations). The inter-coder agreement (weighted Cohen&#x02019;s Kappa) was almost perfect for the irrelevant-action scores (0.98), perfect for the relevant-action scores and irrelevant-action timing (1.0), but the command-following scores only had substantial agreement (0.74).</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Data analysis</title><p id="Par23">The data were analysed using the software R Studio. To examine whether the attentional state of caregivers affected the dogs&#x02019; performance during the overimitation task, we fitted an ordinal (i.e., cumulative logit link) mixed model. We built two models, one with the accuracy score of the irrelevant action (OI_score) and one using the accuracy score of the relevant action (REL_score) as response variables (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Both models were identical and included condition (turned-away/watching) as the test predictor of interest, along with trial number (1, 2, 3, 4), age squared, and sex (male/female) as control predictors. We also included subject as a random intercept effect to account for repeated measurements of the same individuals, and trial within subject as a random slope effect (Barr et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2013</xref>; Schielzeth &#x00026; Forstmeier, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2009</xref>). The obedience score was not included in the ordinal mixed models, as it proved difficult to score reliably given the variation of dog behaviours during the obedience test. This measure also would have required us to subset the data. Additionally, two dogs&#x02019; relevant action scores were removed for experimenter error and one dog&#x02019;s fourth trial was removed for technical issues. We fitted the models in R (Version 4.2.0, R Core Team, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2022</xref>) using the clmm function of the package ordinal (Version 2020.8&#x02013;22). Prior to fitting the model we z.transformed the covariates trial number and age, to ease model convergence and achieve easier interpretable model coefficients (Schielzeth, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2010</xref>).

This revealed that collinearity was not an issue (max VIF REL_score: 1.21; max VIF OI_score: 1.16). After fitting the model, we confirmed that the model assumptions of proportional odds were not violated by dichotomizing the scoring as at least 1, at least 2, at least 3, and at least 4, fitting logistic models with the obtained response variables, and inspecting the model estimates. These varied only a little, suggesting that the assumption was not strongly violated. We assessed model stability with respect to the model estimates by comparing the estimates from the model including all data with estimates obtained from models in which individuals were excluded one at a time (Nieuwenhuis et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2012</xref>). This revealed that the models were of good stability. We determined the significance of individual predictors by dropping them from the full model, one at a time, and comparing the resulting model with the full model. For model comparisons, we used a likelihood ratio test (Dobson and Barnett, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2018</xref>). We calculated 95% confidence intervals for the model estimates and fitted values by applying the function &#x02018;bootMer&#x02019; of the package &#x02018;lme4&#x02019;, applying 1,000 parametric bootstraps, or the &#x02018;confint&#x02019; function in R depending on the model complexity.

Additionally, younger and older dogs performed better than middle-aged dogs with respect to their relevant-action scoring. For each trial, dogs scored higher and higher for the relevant-action, but lower and lower for the irrelevant-action. However, after we separated overimitation scores (dogs touching at least one dot) from scores of approaching the dots, we found no trial effect for overimitation and an interaction between condition and trial for the approach behaviour. Dogs approached the wall with the dots less per trial when being watched, yet no differently over trials when their owner was turned away. Finally, for overimitation timing, dogs overimitated more often after (rather than before) achieving the food goal in trials where they both touched at least one dot and got the reward. Overall, the number of dogs considered to be overimitators in this study was slightly lower than in previous studies using the dot-touching task (i.e., Huber et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2018</xref>; Mackie &#x00026; Huber, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2023</xref>).</p><p id="Par39">Firstly, we found an interaction between caregiver attentional states and trials for dogs approaching the dots. By conducting two separate analyses on overimitation and approach scores, we found that the effect of trial was lost for touching at least one dot, but remained for approaching the dots (replicating Mackie and Huber&#x02019;s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2023</xref>) findings). The fact that dogs have now repeatedly performed differently in these behaviours reiterates a distinction between dogs&#x02019; lowest level of irrelevant-action scores, their exploration-like approach behaviour, and their overimitation in this task. Results showed that approaching the dots decreased over multiple trials when the caregiver was attentive, but not when she/he was facing the wall. There may have been an initial expectation that approaching the dots would elicit a response from the watchful caregiver. During trials though, caregivers did not interact with or react to their dogs, and dogs likely learned this over trials. Dogs may have behaved &#x02018;obediently&#x02019; or &#x02018;pleasingly&#x02019; towards their watchful caregiver by approaching the dots at first (the location of the caregiver&#x02019;s irrelevant demonstration), but were discouraged over time without any reinforcement from their caregiver and with the discovery of the food-reward location. Alternatively, secure-base effects are found in dog-caregiver bonds &#x02013; for example, like children, dogs explore new rooms, play with strangers, and play more independently in the presence (rather than absence) of their caregivers (Palmer &#x00026; Custance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2008</xref>) &#x02013; so dog exploration-like approaching in our task could have been initially facilitated by the secure-base effect from an attentive caregiver.</p><p id="Par40">Secondly, we found that overimitation behaviour occurred independently of caregiver attentional states, unlike that found in children (Marsh et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2019</xref>; Stengelin et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2019</xref>), and unlike dog obedience behaviour (Call et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2003</xref>; Schwab &#x00026; Huber, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2006</xref>; Vir&#x000e1;nyi et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2004</xref>). For dogs who overimitated, the motivation to copy and match the caregiver&#x02019;s irrelevant demonstration seemed to be unrelated to a desire to obey or please them. Previous studies suggested that dog overimitation is rather related to affiliation. Dogs were found to overimitate their caregiver more than a stranger, and &#x02018;perfect&#x02019; overimitators scored highly on caregiver-dog relationship tests (Huber et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2022</xref>). The present study further supports this affiliative hypothesis with its finding that dogs overimitated more often after the goal was already achieved &#x02013; which was also a finding of Mackie and Huber (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2023</xref>). These authors, alongside Taniguchi and Sanefuji (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2021</xref>), argue that overimitation gains a more social goal once the instrumental goal (obtaining the reward) is completed. Particularly a disconnected irrelevant action (like our dot-touching or Taniguchi and Sanefuji&#x02019;s box-tapping) had little chance to be misinterpreted as relevant, so obtaining the instrumental goal first and efficiently was a priority. Any overimitation afterwards would contain another goal: such as to be like or affiliate with the demonstrator. Together, these findings suggest that dogs, in our study, may have overimitated regardless of their caregiver&#x02019;s attentional state due to such non-instrumental (social) goals.</p><p id="Par41">For the relevant action, dogs showed sensitivity to their caregiver&#x02019;s watchful state by copying the caregiver&#x02019;s leftward push of the sliding door more than when their caregiver was inattentive. This result resembles those from obedience tasks regarding dogs&#x02019; sensitivity to attentional states. In obedience tasks, dogs were more likely to perform a &#x02018;lie down&#x02019; command well if their commander (caregiver) was watching than if the commander left the room or turned around (Schwab &#x00026; Huber, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2006</xref>; Vir&#x000e1;nyi et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2004</xref>). Perhaps our dogs tried to follow the action cue from the caregiver's demonstration through faithful imitation (obtaining a perfect copying score) of the relevant action. And with the caregiver&#x02019;s inattentiveness came no obligation to copy the same direction (left or right push) that the caregiver demonstrated. Taken together with the irrelevant action&#x02019;s lower copying frequencies and its lack of sensitivity to attentional states, there are clear differing motivations behind these two kinds of copying; a strong, food prioritisation for the relevant action, and a secondary, &#x02018;be-like&#x02019; motivation for the irrelevant action.</p><p id="Par42">However, a full obedience-based interpretation would be assuming that the caregiver&#x02019;s demonstration was viewed as some sort of non-verbal command. Our caregiver demonstration was designed to elicit the dog&#x02019;s attention, with eye contact and name-calling if necessary. These caregiver behaviours typically occur during dog training contexts. So, if dogs viewed the demonstration as such a context, as a sort of command, then dogs who had reported training history should have been better at obtaining the reward (as seen in Marshall-Pescini et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2016</xref>). Yet, only six of the 13 reportedly trained dogs managed to do so (scored 3&#x02009;+&#x02009;for relevant-action copying). Likewise, the irrelevant-action demonstration should also have been viewed as a command, but only six of the reportedly trained dogs were overimitators (scored 2&#x02009;+&#x02009;for irrelevant-action copying). Training history alone, therefore, was not enough to support an obedience-based interpretation of dogs&#x02019; copying of the caregiver&#x02019;s relevant action in this study. To do so would require further investigation, such as by having a much larger sample size, by including a forbidden food task (i.e., Call et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2003</xref>), or by manipulating a command-like strictness for the overimitation task&#x02019;s demonstration. The inter-coder unreliability of our command-following behavioural scores from the dog-obedience test is one limitation of the present study.</p><p id="Par43">Possibly both an intent to please <italic>and</italic> social signalling towards a watchful caregiver can explain why dogs copied their caregivers relevant action more accurately and approached the area of the dots (at least in in trial one) more often. Dogs respond more obediently when being watched in forbidden food/command tasks (e.g., Call et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2003</xref>; Schwab &#x00026; Huber, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2006</xref>), which resembled their relevant-copying performance in this study. However, humans copy &#x02018;better&#x02019; when being watched too. For humans, copying can be interpreted as a social signal towards the watcher. For example, adult humans precisely copied the height that their leader placed a block (in a game) if they were aware that their leader was watching them (Krishnan-Barman &#x00026; Hamilton, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2019</xref>). By faithfully imitating their leader&#x02019;s movements, the copiers sent a non-verbal communicative signal that they are paying close attention to their leader and maintaining their social connection. Mimicry, imitating someone&#x02019;s gestures, etc., is also considered a social signal, and it can elicit positive opinions and prosocial dynamics towards the imitator (Farmer et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2018</xref>). One could argue that individuals send these social signals to <italic>please</italic> another person, which is something that dogs are well known for. So, we cannot exclude that dogs were closely imitating their (attentive) caregiver&#x02019;s relevant actions to also please their caregivers in this study. As well as to be obedient, dogs may be using imitation as a social signal. If we consider the dog&#x02019;s overimitation in terms of social signalling, their insensitivity to attentional states would mean that irrelevant copying wouldn&#x02019;t have been used as this kind of social signal, at least from the overimitators in this study.</p><p id="Par44">Our final findings for trials and the relevant-action behaviour replicated Mackie and Huber&#x02019;s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2023</xref>), as dogs improved their copying of their caregiver&#x02019;s relevant-action over trials. Dogs may have been gaining confidence to take the food reward in each trial from the increased awareness that it was permissible. Still, each trial offered dogs the opportunity to experience the directional push in the non-demonstrated direction, and often dogs would slide the door both ways while they were eating their food reward. So, the fact that dogs preferred to copy their caregiver&#x02019;s leftward push over trials supports faithful imitation. Otherwise, dogs were approaching the irrelevant dots less each trial when being watched, and like in Johnston et al.&#x02019;s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2017</xref>) study, these dogs (and dingoes) were likely learning that the action was inconsequential, or causally insignificant to the goal. However, around half of Johnston et al.&#x02019;s dogs and dingoes were still performing the irrelevant (lever-pressing) action after four trials, and our dogs&#x02019; irrelevant-copying was unaffected by trial. Either (all) these persistent overimitators did not learn about the action&#x02019;s irrelevance, even when given multiple chances to do so, or they had other motivations to overimitate.</p><p id="Par45">In general, dog overimitation frequencies in the available experimental studies (Huber et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2022</xref>; Johnston et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2017</xref>; Mackie &#x00026; Huber, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2023</xref>) are not as high or repetitive as in studies of human overimitation (i.e., Lyons et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2011</xref>). So rather than a universal phenomenon, like in humans, it seems that only certain kinds of dogs, with certain motivations, are engaging in overimitation of their closely bonded caregivers. By carefully balancing conditions for characteristics such as sex, breed and age, researchers might be missing key differences between dogs who overimitate and those who do not. For example, we counterbalanced our conditions for age yet still found an effect of age squared on the relevant action. Although literature on age and attachment is underexplored, it is suggested that a dog&#x02019;s attachment to their caregiver changes with age over time (Rehn &#x00026; Keeling, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2016</xref>). This may be a related factor to our finding. Future research on dog overimitation may wish to focus on such characteristics of dogs who <italic>do</italic> overimitate, and how contexts and experimental manipulations can affect these particular dogs&#x02019; motivation to overimitate. Perhaps non-overimitating dogs cannot, or care not to, ever become overimitators themselves.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par46">All in all, this study found that dogs were insensitive to their caregiver&#x02019;s attentional state while copying irrelevant actions, but were sensitive to being watched while copying relevant actions and approaching the irrelevant dots. In particular, dogs copied their caregiver&#x02019;s directional push more when they were being watched than when they were not, and approached the irrelevant dots less per trial when they were being watched. This sensitivity to attentional states aligns with studies on both dog obedience (in terms of command following) and human imitation behaviour. The dogs in this study who both overimitated and got the food reward, did so more often after obtaining the reward, as a kind of secondary goal. Our overimitation results indicate that following cues in a manner to please may not play a role in dog overimitation, instead, results support the affiliative hypothesis &#x02013; that dogs overimitate because of their relationship and closeness with the demonstrator. In conclusion, the dogs in this study showed that they are sensitive to the attentional states of their caregiver, just not enough in the context of overimitation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary information</title><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.<supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM1"><media xlink:href="13420_2024_635_MOESM1_ESM.docx"><caption><p>Supplementary file1 (DOCX 39 KB)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher's Note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to thank the Clever Dog Lab manager, Karin Bayer, for her assistance at the lab, Karoline Gerwisch for her assistance with video coding, and Remco Folsterma for his statistical analysis and knowledge.
