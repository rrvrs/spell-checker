In this study, we investigated the early dynamics of airway epithelial cells during SARS-CoV-2 infection using well-differentiated human nasal and tracheal epithelial cell cultures by incorporating three publicly available single-cell RNA sequencing datasets. We identified a previously uncharacterized cell population, termed virus-rich intermediate (VRI) cells, representing an intermediate differentiation stage between basal and ciliated cells. These VRI cells exhibited high viral loads at all infection time points, strong interferon and inflammatory responses, increased mRNA expression of microvilli-related genes (PAK1, PAK4, VIL1), and suppression of apoptosis markers (BAX, CASP3) alongside increased anti-apoptotic gene expression (BCL2). Cell-cell interaction analysis revealed that VRI cells send signals to basal cells via receptor-ligand pathways such as EPHA and VEGF, likely promoting basal cell differentiation and proliferation through MAPK signaling. These findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 utilizes VRI cells as a primary site for replication and spread, leveraging these cells&#x02019; unique differentiation state to evade host cell death and facilitate viral propagation. This study provides insights into the early cellular responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection and highlights potential therapeutic targets to limit viral spread.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>SARS-CoV-2</kwd><kwd>airway epithelial cell</kwd><kwd>air-liquid interface culture</kwd><kwd>single-cell RNA sequencing</kwd><kwd>virus-rich intermediate</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn1">Korean government (MEST)</funding-source><award-id award-type="contract" rid="cn1">NRF-2022R1A2C1011629</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>The author(s) declare that financial support was received for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.

The pandemic has resulted in millions of deaths globally and has had a profound impact on economic, social, and healthcare systems (<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">Adil et al., 2021</xref>). SARS-CoV-2 shares similarities with previously emerged coronaviruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 (SARS-CoV-1) and middle eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">Rabaan et al., 2020</xref>), particularly in its unique mechanism of infection involving the binding to ACE2 receptors to invade human cells (<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">Perrotta et al., 2020</xref>). The structure and mutations of the spike protein play a critical role in the virus&#x02019;s transmissibility and pathogenicity, with numerous variants such as alpha, beta, delta, and omicron having emerged (<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">Mohammadi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr">Ullrich et al., 2022</xref>). According to recent WHO reports, variants like KP.3 and LB.1 are showing an increasing prevalence globally. Although the number of new cases and deaths has decreased, the positivity rate is rising again (<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">Emerging Diseases and Zoonoses (EZD), EPP, 2024</xref>).</p><p>To better understand the biology of SARS-CoV-2, various studies have been conducted using patient samples. However, these studies often involve testing several days after SARS-CoV-2 infection, making it difficult to understand the initial interactions between the respiratory epithelial cells and the virus (<xref rid="ref50" ref-type="bibr">Ziegler et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">Tian et al., 2022</xref>). Understanding these early interactions is crucial for the development of vaccines and therapeutics. To overcome this challenge, several research have been conducted on early virus infection using <italic>in vitro</italic> models, specifically human airway epithelial cells cultured at the air-liquid interface (ALI) (<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">Silva et al., 2023</xref>; <xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">Bukowy-Bieryllo et al., 2022</xref>). These <italic>in vitro</italic> models, with their potential to promote cell differentiation and optimize airway epithelial cells&#x02019; morphological and histological characteristics, have been used frequently to study the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on host cells (<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">Fiege et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">Gamage et al., 2022</xref>; <xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">Hatton et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">Ravindra et al., 2021</xref>). In addition, recent studies have shown that applying single-cell RNA sequencing technology provides information on differentiation pathways for various cell types and cellular responses to viral infection (<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">Fiege et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">Gamage et al., 2022</xref>; <xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">Ravindra et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>To gain an insight on the early events associated with host cell infection by SARS-CoV-2, we performed the in-depth reanalysis of the datasets from three published papers that investigated the immune, entry factors, and cellular state changes in airway epithelial cells in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection using the ALI model (<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">Fiege et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">Gamage et al., 2022</xref>; <xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">Ravindra et al., 2021</xref>). Some studies indicate that the target cells of SARS-CoV-2 are ciliated cells (<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">Fiege et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">Ravindra et al., 2021</xref>), while others suggest that most cell types are infectable with SARS-CoV-2 (<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">Gamage et al., 2022</xref>). The studies also explain the immune response to viral infection, including the induction of interferon (IFN)-<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> and IFN-<italic>&#x003b3;</italic> and an increase in interleukin (IL)-6 (<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">Fiege et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">Gamage et al., 2022</xref>; <xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">Hatton et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">Ravindra et al., 2021</xref>). Most studies have focused on ciliated cells, known as target cells of SARS-CoV-2, and the immune response to viral infection. When we analyzed three integrated data sets, we were able to identify cell populations characterized by the heavy accumulation of viral genes. We found these cells are intermediate cells transitioning from basal to ciliated cells. However, no studies have yet to elucidate the molecular features of this cell population distinct from rest of cells. Therefore, we investigated the properties of this unique cell population to better understand how SARS-CoV-2 utilizes it in its life cycle and how airway epithelial cells respond to the infection.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec3"><label>2.1</label><title>Data collection</title><p>We used three publicly available single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets: GSE166766 (Illumina NovaSeq 6000) (<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">Ravindra et al., 2021</xref>), GSE157526 (Illumina NovaSeq 6000) (<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">Fiege et al., 2021</xref>), and GSE182475 (Illumina HiSeq 4000) (<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">Gamage et al., 2022</xref>). The datasets consist of human epithelial cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 under varying conditions, including different time points post-infection. Raw sequencing data were downloaded from the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and processed using the Seurat pipeline for quality control, normalization, and integration (<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">Hao et al., 2024</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec4"><label>2.2</label><title>Data processing</title><p>The three single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets were pre-processed using the Seurat R package (v 5.0.3) (<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">Hao et al., 2024</xref>). Quality control was conducted by filtering out cells that exhibited over 30% mitochondrial content, as this may indicate low-quality or damaged cells. Additionally, cells with fewer than 200 detected genes were removed from the analysis to ensure robust representation of the cellular transcriptome. Similarly, features (genes) detected in fewer than three cells were excluded. To mitigate the potential bias caused by variability in cell numbers across datasets and time points, we employed a subsampling strategy (<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">Seirup et al., 2020</xref>). The subsample size was determined by the smallest number of cells present in any dataset, which was 1,700 cells. Therefore, 1,700 cells were randomly selected from each time point to ensure a balanced and comparable analysis across all datasets. For the 28-day post-infection (dpi) time point, present only in dataset GSE166766, a larger number of cells was available. To maintain consistency in the total number of cells analyzed across time points, we subsampled 3,400 cells for this time point. The subsampling was implemented using the dplyr R package (v1.1.4), ensuring uniformity across datasets while minimizing potential skew due to unequal cell representation.</p><p>The subsampled datasets were integrated using the Seurat R package (v 5.0.3) to eliminate batch effects and create a unified dataset for comparative analysis (<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">Hao et al., 2024</xref>). The integration was performed following the standard Seurat v5 workflow, employing the anchor-based canonical correlation analysis (CCA) method via the &#x0201c;IntegrateLayers&#x0201d; function. This method aligns similar cell populations across datasets by identifying anchors, or common cellular states, between samples, thereby effectively mitigating technical variation.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><label>2.3</label><title>Clustering and cell type annotation</title><p>For visualization, uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) was performed on the top 20 principal components. Clustering analysis was conducted on the principal components analysis (PCA)-reduced data using Seurat (v 5.0.3) with a resolution parameter set to 0.8 to derive the UMAP representation. Specific marker genes were employed to identify and annotate each cell type, selected based on an extensive review of the literature and previously published single-cell RNA sequencing studies (<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">Fiege et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">Gamage et al., 2022</xref>; <xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">Hatton et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">Ravindra et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">Hewitt and Lloyd, 2021</xref>).

Pseudo-time was assigned to each cell using the order_cells function, which positions cells along the inferred trajectory based on their transcriptional similarity and progression. The starting root and branching points of the trajectory were manually annotated using known biological insights and the spatial distribution of the identified cell types. The calculated pseudo-time scores were then incorporated into the metadata of the respective Seurat objects to be visualized on existing UMAP embeddings.</p></sec><sec id="sec7"><label>2.5</label><title>Gene ontology analysis</title><p>Gene ontological analysis was performed using the &#x0201c;clusterProfiler&#x0201d; package (v 4.6.2) to identify significantly over-represented biological process (BP) GO terms among differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (<xref rid="ref47" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="ref49" ref-type="bibr">Yu et al., 2012</xref>). DEGs were determined with the FindAllMarkers function, applying thresholds of min.pct&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;0.25 and logfc.threshold&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;0.25, across various conditions. These conditions included different VRI cells subtypes to distinguish functional differences between clusters, as well as the bulk population at different time points to capture global trends during infection. We focused on DEGs with an adjusted <italic>p</italic>-value &#x0003c; 0.05, using the org.Hs.eg.db database for <italic>Homo sapiens</italic>. GO enrichment analysis was similarly filtered with an adjusted <italic>p</italic>-value &#x0003c; 0.05. The resulting GO terms were carefully curated to remove redundant or irrelevant entries, and the most significant terms were visualized based on gene ratio. The genes linked to these GO terms were further used in various downstream analyses, including plotting and scoring.</p></sec><sec id="sec8"><label>2.6</label><title>Cell-cell interaction analysis</title><p>Cell-cell interaction analysis was performed using the CellChat package (v 1.6.1) to examine the signaling interactions between VRI cells and other cell types at various time points post-infection (<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">Jin et al., 2021</xref>). The data were divided by time points to assess changes in cell-cell communication for the infection. Default plotting functions from CellChat, including the netVisual_bubble function, were utilized to visualize these interactions. The netVisual_bubble plots were generated with a default <italic>p</italic>-value threshold of 0.05 to determine significant interactions.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec9"><label>3</label><title>Results</title><sec id="sec10"><label>3.1</label><title>Integration and analysis of scRNA-seq data from SARS-CoV-2-infected ALI cultures experiments</title><p>To gain an insight on overlapping common effects of coronavirus infection on transcriptional profiles of different host cell populations in a single-cell resolution, we reanalyzed scRNA-seq data from air-liquid interface (ALI) cultures of nasal and bronchial cells infected with SARS-CoV-2.

Due to significant variability in the number of cells sequenced in each study and at different time points, we normalized the datasets by subsampling 1,700 cells from each time point within each study. For the 28 dpi time point, a subsampling of 3,400 cells was executed to align the total cell count with other time points, as this time point exclusively exists in the data from <xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">Gamage et al.

The ALI cultures were originally composed of uninfected (mock) samples and samples infected with SARS-CoV-2 at 1, 2, 3, and 28 dpi. Cells in the mock samples were defined as uninfected. In the samples treated with SARS-CoV-2, we identified cells as infected if they had viral reads exceeding 0.1% of total RNAs per cell and as bystander cells, if they were exposed to the virus but failed to satisfy this condition. This approach effectively controlled background noise from misaligned reads in the mock samples. In the analysis of viral infection progression over time, it was noted that the number of infected cells peaked at 3 dpi and then declined by 28 dpi, indicating a reduction in virus-infected cells over the long period of time (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Integration and analysis of scRNA-seq data from SARS-CoV-2-infected ALI cultures. <bold>(A)</bold> UMAP plot displaying scRNA-seq data before integration, showing separate clustering of individual datasets by sequencing platform or sample batch; <bold>(B)</bold> UMAP plot of scRNA-seq data after batch correction and integration using Seurat, showing harmonized cell clustering across all datasets. <bold>(C)</bold> Bar plot illustrating the proportion of cells across different infection time points after integration. <bold>(D)</bold> Bar plot displaying the proportion of cells at days post-infection.

In VRI_stage1, GO terms related to cytoplasmic translation, ribonucleoprotein complex assembly, ribosome biogenesis, and various metabolic processes were prominent. This indicates that VRI_stage1 cells are in a state of high metabolic and biosynthetic activity. In VRI_stage2, active responses to viral infection were characterized by enriched GO terms, including histone modification, RNA splicing, and viral processes. Notable pathways related to RNA splicing via transesterification reactions and spliceosome-mediated splicing were observed, suggesting a key role in gene regulation and adaptation to viral infection. Finally, VRI_stage3 predominantly featured GO terms related to cilium organization and assembly, including microtubule and axoneme assembly. This suggests that VRI_stage3 cells are heavily involved in cilia formation and function.</p><p>When we conducted trajectory analysis to determine the timing of the appearance of these VRI cells during the differentiation of nasal and tracheal epithelial cells, we found that VRI cells are situated between basal and ciliated cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). As expected, pseudo-time progression suggested the following this sequence of differentiation: VRI_stage1, VRI_stage2, VRI_stage3, and ciliated cells (<xref rid="SM2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec12"><label>3.3</label><title>VRI cells serves as a primary site for SARS-CoV-2 infection</title><p>To investigate the relationship between VRI cells and SARS-CoV-2 infection, we first examined the number and proportion of infected cells by cell type. It is well established that ciliated cells are the primary target cells for SARS-CoV-2 (<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">Fiege et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">Ahn et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">Sano et al., 2022</xref>; <xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">Robinot et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">Sims et al., 2005</xref>). At 1 dpi, while the number of infected cells in ciliated cells sharply increases, VRI cells also show a similar number of infected cells to ciliated cells. However, at 2 dpi and 3 dpi, while the number of infected ciliated cells decreases, both the proportion and number of infected cells in VRI increases (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3A</xref>,<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">B</xref>). Notably, VRI cells exhibit the highest number of infected cells at 2 dpi, surpassing all other cell types. This elevated proportion of infected cells in VRI cells remains higher than other cell types, even at 28 dpi (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). To first understand why the number and proportion of infected cells in VRI cells are higher than in other cell types, we examined the expression of known SARS-CoV-2 host factor genes including ACE2, TMPRSS2, TMPRSS4, and CTSL. ACE2 expression was similar between VRI and ciliated cells at the mock stage but increased more rapidly in VRI cells as the infection progressed (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). Although TMPRSS2 expression was higher in ciliated cells, it was also significantly expressed in VRI cells, suggesting that it could facilitate viral entry in these cells.</p><fig position="float" id="fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>VRI serves as a primary site for SARS-CoV-2 infection. <bold>(A)</bold> Bar plots showing the cell counts of infected, uninfected, and bystander cells for different cell types across time points; <bold>(B)</bold> Bar plots depicting the proportions of infected, uninfected, and bystander cells for different cell types across time points; <bold>(C)</bold> Line plots representing the expression levels (log-normalized values) of viral entry and response genes (e.g., ACE2, TMPRSS2, CTSL) over time across different cell types; <bold>(D)</bold> Heatmap showing the expression of viral entry genes (ACE2, TMPRSS2, CTSL, etc.) across VRI-stage cells and ciliated cells relevant populations at time points.

This result aligns with previous studies that have shown downregulation of ACE2 expression following SARS-CoV-2 infection (<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">Lu et al., 2022</xref>). In contrast, VRI_stage1, which precedes VRI_stage2 in the pseudo-time developmental trajectory (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>; <xref rid="SM2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>), exhibited higher expression of entry-related genes, indicating that VRI_stage1 likely serves as the primary entry point for SARS-CoV2. VRI cells exhibit strong interferon and inflammatory responses.</p><p>We investigated genes related to interferon and inflammatory responses to understand how immune responses differ after infection between VRI and other cell types. Compared with other stages of cells, a much stronger interferon and inflammatory response was observed in VRI_stage2 upon infection. Both infected and bystander cells of VRI_stage2 exhibited strong immune responses (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). The absence of expression in the uninfected and parts of the bystander columns (white spaces) reflects the fact that VRI_stage2 cells only emerge after infection, meaning there are no uninfected cells in VRI_stage2. Furthermore, from 2 dpi, all cells in VRI_stage2 are infected, which explains the lack of representation for bystander cells at later time points. IFNL1, an interferon-&#x003bb; gene, was highly expressed as early as 1 dpi, while IFNB1 expression peaked later (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). ISGs such as OAS1, MX1, and ISG15 were also activated, and the pro-inflammatory chemokine CXCL10 was significantly upregulated in both infected and bystander cells of VRI_stage2 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). These results suggest that VRI_stage2 is highly sensitive to SARS-CoV-2 infection and plays a critical role in mounting a strong immune response. Interestingly, in VRI_stage2, the expression of certain ISGs, including IFIT1 and ISG15, was relatively low (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). Despite VRI_stage2 being the cell group with the highest levels of SARS-CoV-2 transcripts, these genes were less activated compared to VRI-stage1 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). This suggests a possible viral immune evasion mechanism that suppresses the activation of these specific ISGs.</p><fig position="float" id="fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>VRI cells exhibit strong interferon and inflammatory responses. <bold>(A&#x02013;D)</bold> Heatmaps depicting the expression levels of key immune response genes across time and infection status in different cell populations; <bold>(A)</bold> VRI_stage1 cells; <bold>(B)</bold> VRI_stage2 cells; <bold>(C)</bold> VRI_stage3 cells; <bold>(D)</bold> Ciliated cells; Each column represents a pseudobulk average of all cells from a single cell type and single study.

This suggests that these cells can still mount an antiviral response but react more gradually. This implies that VRI_stage1 cells become more involved in the immune response as the infection progresses, potentially compensating for the reduced ISG response in VRI_stage2. In contrast, VRI_stage3 showed little to no expression of IFNL1 and IFNB1, with reduced ISG levels (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>), indicating that these cells may be transitioning into differentiation and may be less involved in direct antiviral defense at this stage. In ciliated cells, IFNL expression was observed from 1 dpi, but at lower levels than in VRI_stage2, and ISG expression was moderate (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). This supports the understanding that their capacity to mount a strong interferon response is limited, often leading to cell damage due to viral infection rather than effective immune defense.</p><p>Compared to VRI, other cell types, such as basal cells, showed relatively low expression of IFNB and IFNL. However, ISGs such as IFIT1, IFIT3, and MX1 were highly expressed in basal cells (<xref rid="SM3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S3A</xref>). This suggests that even though basal cells do not produce large amounts of interferon, they may have been stimulated by interferon from other cells. In contrast, suprabasal cells exhibited little to no ISG expression (<xref rid="SM3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S3B</xref>), suggesting that these cells may be more involved in tissue repair or other functional roles rather than in inflammatory responses. A relatively strong response was observed in secretory cells, with high expression of ISGs such as IFIT1, IFIT3, and MX1, along with the chemokines CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11 (<xref rid="SM3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S3C</xref>). This suggests that secretory cells provide physical defense through mucus during viral infection and play a role in recruiting immune cells to the site of infection through chemokines.</p><p>Moreover, IL1A and IL1B showed minimal changes across all cell types (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>; <xref rid="SM3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>), consistent with prior studies indicating that IL1 does not play a significant role in early airway immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection (<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">Ravindra et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">Barnett et al., 2023</xref>). However, at 28 dpi in VRI-stage2, IL-1A is highly expressed. IL6 and TNF were significantly upregulated in VRI_stage1 and VRI_stage2, contributing to the inflammatory response, and it was observed that they were upregulated in both basal and secretory cells at 28 dpi, which is a considerable time after infection (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). This result is similar to increased IL-6 in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and increased IL-1 in severe patients (<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">Fodor et al., 2022</xref>; <xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">Lucas et al., 2020</xref>). This suggests that it could be due to a persistent immune response to the remaining virus in the VRI stage or chronic inflammation. Thus, VRI cells exhibit higher immune gene expression levels than other cell types, demonstrating their important role in the defense mechanism against SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p></sec><sec id="sec13"><label>3.4</label><title>SARS-CoV-2 induced changes in epithelial cell composition</title><p>Our research aims to uncover the reasons behind the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in VRI cells and the significantly higher amounts of viral transcripts. To investigate why there is an accumulation of viral transcripts in VRI cells post-infection, we first conducted GO enrichment analysis for uninfected, bystander, and infected cells between non-VRI and VRI cells. Our GO enrichment analysis revealed that bystander and uninfected cells showed similar enrichment in pathways such as wound healing, epithelial cell migration, and tissue migration. However, bystander cells exhibited additional enrichment in ameboidal-type cell migration and gland development, suggesting a role in tissue remodeling and immune responses. In infected cells, significant enrichment was found in viral processes, regulation of body fluid levels, and cilium assembly, highlighting their involvement in both viral replication and airway fluid regulation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). Interestingly, the GO analysis of VRI_stage3 revealed a strong enrichment for cilium-related processes, including cilium organization and microtubule-based movement (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). This suggests that as infected cells progress into VRI_stage3, they initiate processes related to cilia formation.</p><fig position="float" id="fig5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>SARS-CoV-2 induced changes in epithelial cell composition.

Their research demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 enters cells via cilia and promotes viral production through microvilli formation (<xref rid="ref48" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2023</xref>). By examining the expression levels of microvilli marker genes across various cell types, we found that VRI cells show increased expression of EZR, a key gene for microvilli formation, and VIL1, a structural protein of microvilli (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). Additionally, the PAK1 and PAK4 kinases, identified by Chien-Ting Wu et al. as regulators of microvilli dynamics, were upregulated. This suggests that, after infecting VRI cells, SARS-CoV-2 optimizes them by inducing the formation of both cilia and microvilli, facilitating viral entry and release.</p><p>To investigate post-infection changes in cell populations, including the increase in VRI cells and the decrease in ciliated and basal cells, we utilized CellChat to explore ligand-receptor interactions (<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">Jin et al., 2021</xref>). Since VRI cells are heavily infected by SARS-CoV-2 and likely play a crucial role in the virus&#x02019;s life cycle, we focused on the signals these cells send to other cell types. On 2 dpi, VRI cells were found to send NAMPT and COL1A1 signals to both basal and ciliated cells with the highest communication probabilities (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). Although the NAMPT and COL1A1 signaling pathways exhibited high communication probabilities targeting both basal and ciliated cells, we also identified signals specifically directed toward basal cells that are of particular interest despite having lower communication probabilities. These signals included EPHA, EPHB, and VEGF, which were found to be transmitted from VRI cells to basal cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). Both signaling pathways commonly involve the MAPK pathway downstream (<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">Jiang et al., 2024</xref>; <xref rid="ref46" ref-type="bibr">Wilkinson, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">Perez White and Getsios, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">Doanes et al., 1999</xref>). Upon performing GO enrichment analysis for basal cells on 2 dpi, we observed that the MAPK signaling pathway was highly enriched (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). This suggests that, following SARS-CoV-2 infection, signals such as EPHA, EPHB, and VEGFA are transmitted from VRI cells to basal cells, promoting the differentiation and growth of the basal cells. This finding is crucial in understanding the temporal changes observed in the UMAP plot, where basal cell numbers decrease at 1 dpi and return to normal levels by 3 dpi (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). Additionally, while VRI and ciliated cells increase at 1 dpi, only VRI cells significantly increase at 2 dpi (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). This indicates that basal cell differentiation contributes to the expansion of VRI cells and the newly differentiated VRI cells are reinfected by SARS-CoV-2, leading to a further increase in the number of infected VRI cells.</p><p>To determine why number of ciliated cells decreases and that of VRI cells increases following SARS-CoV-2 infection, we investigated apoptosis markers in VRI and ciliated cells over different time points. In ciliated cells, the pro-apoptotic gene BAX and the executioner caspase CASP3 showed a time-dependent increase in expression following infection. However, in VRI cells, the expression of these two genes decreased up to 2 dpi, while the anti-apoptotic gene BCL2 increased (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>). Additionally, the anti-apoptotic gene PEBP4, which is also involved in lipid metabolism, showed increased expression in VRI_stage2 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). This indicates that apoptosis is suppressed in VRI cells until the peak of infection, likely allowing VRI cells to contribute to the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle by evading cell death. In contrast, ciliated cells initially increased in number after infection but then decreased, which can be attributed to sustained apoptosis.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec14"><label>4</label><title>Discussion</title><p>Here, we investigated the early dynamics of human airway epithelial infection by SARS-CoV-2 and identified an uncharacterized cell population, VRI cells. These VRI cells, positioned between basal and ciliated cells during differentiation, play a critical role in viral replication due to their high viral RNA content. Notably, we identified a subset, VRI_stage2, which only appears post-infection and displays nearly 100% infection (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>; <xref rid="SM4" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S4</xref>). Our analysis shows that VRI cells are intermediate cells transitioning from basal to ciliated cells, and SARS-CoV-2 exploits these cells for replication, rather than fully differentiated ciliated cells, which were traditionally seen as the virus&#x02019;s primary targets. Our pseudo-time trajectory analysis supports the idea that SARS-CoV-2 exploits these intermediate cells for replication (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>), likely due to their dynamic state of differentiation. The significantly higher proportion of infected VRI cells compared to other cell types may explain why some individuals experience prolonged or severe infections. Continuous viral replication in VRI cells could contribute to sustained viral shedding, as evidenced by the persistence of infected VRI cells even at 28 dpi (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3A</xref>,<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">B</xref>). These findings suggest that targeting VRI cells could offer a potential therapeutic strategy to reduce viral load and limit disease progression.</p><p>Building on this, VRI cells warrant further investigation into their identity and function. While they act as a transitional population differentiating from basal to ciliated cells under mock conditions, they emerge as a distinct cell cluster post-SARS-CoV-2 infection, raising the possibility of a novel cell type induced by viral infection. Notably, VRI_stage2, which arises only post-infection and exhibits nearly 100% infection, highlights this distinct identity (<xref rid="SM4" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S4</xref>). Key markers such as ZBTB10, DUSP8, and HIST1H2BG, predominantly expressed in VRI_stage2, suggest specialized roles during infection beyond the transitional differentiation observed in uninfected conditions (<xref rid="SM5" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S3</xref>). These markers, particularly ZBTB10, provide a valuable tool for isolating VRI cells in transwell systems, enabling cytological studies to clarify their structural and functional characteristics. Such experiments will be instrumental in determining whether VRI cells represent a new cell type or an intermediate state with uniquely adapted functions during infection, further elucidating their role in viral replication and pathogenesis.</p><p>Our findings also align with clinical observations from COVID-19 patients. Clinical nasal swabs from COVID-19 patients revealed regions populated by multiple secretory and intermediate cell subsets, similar to the VRI populations we identified, which were largely absent in control participants (<xref rid="ref50" ref-type="bibr">Ziegler et al., 2021</xref>). The accumulation of these intermediate cells may contribute to the impaired mucociliary clearance seen in severe COVID-19 cases, as the virus disrupts normal epithelial cell differentiation and function.</p><p>One of the key findings of our study is that VRI cells exhibit altered gene expression patterns that may enhance viral replication. Our GO enrichment analysis revealed an upregulation of genes associated with cilia assembly after infection (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>), suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 promotes ciliary activity during the early stages of infection. Importantly, VRI_stage3 showed particularly strong enrichment for cilia-related processes, including cilium organization and microtubule-based movement (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). This aligns with the trajectory analysis, which shows the transition from VRI_stage1 to VRI_stage2, and eventually to VRI_stage3 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>; <xref rid="SM2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>), where infected cells likely begin cilia formation. Infected cell also showed significant enrichment in fluid regulation pathways, while gland development pathways were observed in bystander cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). This process contributes to a favorable environment for viral dissemination by improving mucus transportation. This suggests that cilia formation, fluid dynamics, and gland development work together to enhanced viral spread by optimizing the environment for viral propagation.(<xref rid="ref48" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2023</xref>; <xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">Koca et al., 2021</xref>). Additionally, the high expression of ACE2 in cilia makes these cells more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 entry during early infection (<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">Robinot et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">Jia et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">Kawasumi et al., 2022</xref>; <xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">Buqaileh et al., 2021</xref>). This combination of cilia formation, fluid regulation, and high ACE2 expression in VRI cells creates an optimal environment for viral entry and propagation, allowing the virus to spread more efficiently within the airway. Fluid regulation.</p><p>However, this model contrasts with other studies suggesting SARS-CoV-2 eventually causes the loss of cilia, which might facilitate the virus&#x02019;s deeper penetration into the lung parenchyma (<xref rid="ref50" ref-type="bibr">Ziegler et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">Ahn et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">Robinot et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">Bridges et al., 2022</xref>). In our analysis, a decrease in ciliated cells was observed starting at 3 dpi (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>), aligning with previous studies that reported ciliated cell depletion at around 4 dpi (<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">Robinot et al., 2021</xref>). This temporal pattern suggests that SARS-CoV-2 initially upregulates cilia formation and movement to maximize its spread, but as the infection progresses, the virus may induce ciliary depletion, potentially aiding in its deeper invasion into the respiratory tract. Specifically, we found that SARS-CoV-2 induces microvilli formation in VRI cells, driven by the upregulation of key genes such as EZR and VIL1, which is consistent with prior research showing that microvilli enhance viral budding and release (<xref rid="ref48" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2023</xref>; <xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">Bretscher and Weber, 1979</xref>; <xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">Gaeta et al., 2021</xref>) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). When combined with the observed increased cilia formation and movement during the infection, as well as fluid regulation pathways enriched in infected cells, these results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 utilizes a multi-faceted strategy: microvilli for efficient viral release and enhanced ciliary activity for spreading the virus across surrounding cells, and fluid regulation to create a favorable environment for viral dissemination within the host.</p><p>In addition to structural adaptations, SARS-CoV-2 also actively modulates the host&#x02019;s immune response to maintain a replicative advantage. Our analysis of immune-related genes in VRI cells underscores the intricate interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and the host&#x02019;s antiviral defenses. VRI_stage2, the most heavily infected subset, displayed robust interferon and inflammatory responses, including elevated expression of IFNL1, IFNB1, and ISGs such as OAS1, MX1, and ISG15 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). Despite this immune activation, the expression of certain ISGs, including IFIT1 and ISG15, was lower in VRI_stage2 compared to VRI_stage1 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4A</xref>,<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">B</xref>), suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 may employ immune evasion mechanisms to dampen specific antiviral responses. This differential ISG activation across VRI subtypes implies that the virus may fine-tune the host immune response at different stages of cell differentiation, optimizing conditions for viral replication.</p><p>However, while these immune interactions highlight the virus&#x02019;s ability to sustain infection, they do not fully explain the observed changes in cell populations, particularly the increase in VRI cells. To further explore this, we performed a cell-cell interaction analysis, revealing that VRI cells send NAMPT and COL1A1 signals to both basal and ciliated cells. NAMPT signaling is well-known for its role in regulating immune responses and activating inflammatory processes, acting similarly to cytokines and DAMPs in SARS-CoV-2 infection (<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">Audrito et al., 2020</xref>). This suggests that VRI cells engage in immune modulation. COL1A1, on the other hand, is crucial for extracellular matrix remodeling by interacting with integrins, particularly in tissue repair and fibrosis. By triggering the Akt/PI3K pathway through integrins such as ITGA1/ITGB1, it promotes cell survival, growth, and migration (<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">Devos et al., 2023</xref>). These pathways likely support tissue remodeling and may contribute to fibrosis during infection. The presence of these signals underscores the potential of VRI cells to not only sustain viral replication but also drive pathological changes in the infected tissue.</p><p>It is noteworthy that, in addition to the NAMPT and COL1A1 signaling pathways, VRI cells also send EPHA, EPHB, and VEGFA signals specifically to basal cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). Eph-ephrin signaling is known to have direct effects on cell differentiation within tissues (<xref rid="ref46" ref-type="bibr">Wilkinson, 2014</xref>), while VEGFA stimulates the proliferation and growth of basal cells through a VEGFR2-dependent pathway. These signaling pathways are closely associated with the MAPK pathway, a key regulator of cell growth, differentiation, and survival (<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">Perez White and Getsios, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">Doanes et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">Sun et al., 2015</xref>). Our GO enrichment analysis in this study showed the significant upregulation of MAPK pathways in basal cells following SARS-CoV-2 infection; therefore, it confirms our cell-cell interaction analysis result (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). This correlation would indicate that the MAPK pathway has a significant role in promoting basal cell differentiation into VRI cells. By manipulating this pathway, the virus likely secures a reliable source of target cells, enhancing its capacity for replication in the host. These dynamic highlights the critical importance of basal cell differentiation in sustaining the ongoing infection process and facilitating the regeneration and expansion of VRI cells, further supporting viral replication.</p><p>Notably, the Ephrin-Eph signaling pathway, which VRI cells utilize to signal basal cells, has been extensively studied for its role in viral infections. The review &#x0201c;Ephrin-Eph signaling usage by a variety of viruses&#x0201d; emphasizes how various viruses, including Hendra and Nipah viruses, exploit this pathway to mediate their entry into target cells and modulate cell adhesion to establish infection (<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">de Boer et al., 2020</xref>). Since SARS-CoV-2 also uses Ephrin-Eph signaling to connect VRI to basal cells, the same might be true for how the virus manipulates the pathway. Even though speculative, it is possible that SARS-CoV-2 could exploit Ephrin-Eph signaling to modify the host cellular environment and, therefore, mediate its dissemination through alterations in cell-cell interactions.</p><p>Finally, our study provides new insights into how SARS-CoV-2 manipulates apoptosis pathways to enhance its survival within host cells. we observed that SARS-CoV-2 infection led to the upregulation of BCL2 in VRI cells, which is associated with the suppression of apoptosis in these cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>). This contrasts with the response in ciliated cells, where such an anti-apoptotic effect was not observed. The upregulation of BCL2 suggests that SARS-CoV-2 may be employing a strategy similar to other viruses that use BCL2 to extend the survival of their host cells (<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">Kvansakul et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">Barber, 2001</xref>). By upregulating BCL2, SARS-CoV-2 likely extends the survival of VRI cells, maintaining a stable environment for ongoing viral replication.</p><p>Despite the significant findings of this study, several limitations should be noted. First, our <italic>in vitro</italic> models using human nasal and tracheal epithelial cells may not fully capture the complexity of <italic>in vivo</italic> environments, particularly immune responses and interactions with other cell types, limiting direct extrapolation to clinical settings. Further experimental validation <italic>in vivo</italic> will be essential to confirm the role of VRI cells and associated signaling pathways, providing a more comprehensive understanding of their biological significance and therapeutic potential. Second, combining publicly available single-cell RNA sequencing datasets might introduce variability due to differences in experimental conditions and data processing methods. Although we applied rigorous integration methods, including batch effect correction and subsampling, to minimize biases and ensure robust analyses, this potential limitation should be acknowledged. Third, while the study focused on the early stages of infection (1&#x02013;28&#x0202f;days), it did not investigate the long-term effects or potential post-infection sequelae, essential for understanding chronic infections or long COVID. Moreover, the ALI culture system employed, though adequate for mimicking epithelial cells under certain conditions, raises questions about the generalizability of the results across different populations or environmental contexts. Finally, while the study highlights the differentiation of VRI cells as a transitional phase from basal to ciliated cells, further investigations are needed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms and regulatory factors guiding this differentiation process.</p><p>As depicted in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>, our study identified a previously uncharacterized population of Virus-Rich Intermediate (VRI) cells, positioned between basal and mature ciliated cells in the differentiation pathway of the airway epithelium. These VRI cells play a critical role in SARS-CoV-2 replication, acting as a transitional hub where the virus manipulates both cellular structure and function. The figure illustrates how VRI cells progress through distinct stages (VRI_stage1 to VRI_stage3) during infection, with VRI_stage2 exhibiting nearly complete viral infection. SARS-CoV-2 exploits the differentiation process by inducing cilia assembly, microvilli formation, and fluid regulation, all of which enhance viral replication and dissemination. Furthermore, while mature ciliated cells undergo apoptosis, facilitating the virus&#x02019;s deeper invasion into the respiratory tract, VRI cells suppress apoptosis, maintaining an environment that supports continuous viral replication. The cell-cell signaling pathways between VRI cells and basal cells, such as NAMPT/COL1A1 and EPHA/VEGFA, contribute to tissue remodeling and immune modulation, further aiding the virus&#x02019;s ability to thrive within the host. Together, these processes create a dynamic environment that the virus manipulates to optimize its replication and survival within the airway epithelium.</p><fig position="float" id="fig6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>Schematic representation of VRI cell differentiation and role in SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fmicb-15-1507852-g006" position="float"/></fig><p>In conclusion, our study reveals that SARS-CoV-2 intricately modulates the host cell population and morphology during early infection to optimize its replication and spread. The identification of VRI cells as a key player in this process highlights the virus&#x02019;s ability to manipulate host cell differentiation, immune responses, and apoptosis to its advantage. These findings provide a deeper understanding of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and suggest new potential targets for therapeutic intervention. Targeting the pathways that promote differentiation of VRI cells, viral replication, and immune evasion may offer new strategies for controlling SARS-CoV-2 infection and mitigating its impact on the respiratory epithelium.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to acknowledge the assistance of ChatGPT for its help in the translation process and in providing grammar and paraphrasing suggestions during the preparation of this manuscript.</p></ack><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="sec15"><title>Data availability statement</title><p>Publicly available datasets were analyzed in this study.
