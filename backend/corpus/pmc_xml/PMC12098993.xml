This study investigates the potential of solar ponds as wastewater treatment facilities by employing AutoGIS processing and DBSCAN clustering to identify suitable development sites across the African continent and its five regions: North, East, West, Central, and Southern Africa. By integrating environmental data such as solar radiation, wind speed, temperature, clear sky, cloud cover, and precipitation, this research highlights the effectiveness of geospatial tools in addressing clean water access issues. The findings reveal distinct suitability patterns for solar pond development at both continental and regional levels. Key environmental factors, notably direct normal radiation (DNR), temperature, and wind speed, consistently expanded the areas identified as suitable, while cloud cover demonstrated a positive effect. Precipitation showed minimal variation, particularly in Central Africa. Importantly, the study underscores the capability of DBSCAN clustering in handling large datasets, filtering noise, and capturing nuanced regional differences, which varied significantly from continent-wide trends. By streamlining the site selection process, this research offers practical insights into leveraging geospatial technologies to address water access challenges in Africa. The integration of AutoGIS and DBSCAN provides a scalable approach for analyzing complex environmental datasets, paving the way for more informed and sustainable development of wastewater treatment solutions across diverse regions.</p><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1038/s41598-025-01778-6.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>AutoGIS processing</kwd><kwd>DBSCAN clustering</kwd><kwd>Solar ponds</kwd><kwd>Site selection</kwd><kwd>Python programming</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>National Water Research Center (NWRC)</institution></funding-source></award-group><open-access><p>Open access funding provided by The Science, Technology &#x00026; Innovation Funding Authority (STDF) in cooperation with The Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB).</p></open-access></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer Nature Limited 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">The global reliance on non-renewable energy sources has led to significant environmental impacts, with the combustion of fossil fuels contributing to 90% of worldwide greenhouse gas emissions.

The utilization of solar ponds for wastewater treatment in Africa holds immense potential, as it intersects with the critical water, energy, and food sectors, as outlined in the NEXSUS frameworks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Addressing the increasing demand for these essential resources, while mitigating the intensifying effects of climate change present a significant challenge<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. The integration of solar ponds for wastewater treatment in Africa not only addresses the pressing need for clean water access but also aligns with the overarching goals of the NEXUS frameworks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, which aim to integrate these sectors in a cost-effective, efficient, and sustainable manner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Solar ponds, large saltwater lakes used to collect and store solar energy, have emerged as crucial renewable energy technology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Due to their simplicity, cost-effectiveness, and emission-free nature, these systems are attractive options for electricity production, particularly in Africa.. Beyond electricity, they are also used for wastewater treatment, aiding water purification and reducing pollution, which is vital in regions facing freshwater shortages, benefiting agriculture and the food supply chain. Site selection for solar pond development leverages remote sensing data to optimize land suitability, with Python playing a key role in this process. However, studies on solar pond site selection remain scarce. Solar ponds, reliant on solar radiation, are crucial in renewable energy as they provide a sustainable and clean energy source<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>.

Site selection is crucial for identifying suitable lands for solar pond development and integrating remote sensing environmental data. In this regard, Python software plays a pivotal role in the strategy for evaluating potential sites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, facilitating the realization of NESUS strategies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Despite the importance of this topic, literature on site selection for solar ponds at local or regional scales remains scarce.</p><p id="Par4">Solar ponds have been researched in various African countries, primarily to assess their efficiency for diverse applications. For instance, in Angola, Cardoso et al. conducted a thermal analysis of a 1-hectare solar pond, revealing significant energy production after two years of operation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Similarly, Rghif et al. explored heat and mass transfer in a solar pond in Morocco, demonstrating that adjustments to the Defour coefficient enhanced performance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>.

While numerous studies have addressed site selection for renewable energy plants, many methods, including the spherical fuzzy AHP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, introduce complexity and subjectivity that can hinder effective decision-making<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par7">This study presents a novel methodology utilizing Python programming to develop an AutoGIS algorithm for site selection across Africa. This approach incorporates over 18,000 data points, marking the first comprehensive analysis for the continent, as previous research focused on individual countries. By employing density-based clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN), we aim to identify optimal locations for solar pond development, addressing both wastewater treatment and renewable energy generation. This research aligns with the NEXUS framework, emphasizing the need to balance water and energy resources to meet Africa&#x02019;s growing demands sustainably.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par8">The geospatial dataset processing proceeded according to the flowchart illustrated in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, encompassing a five-step procedure. Initially, the data were sourced from the NASA Prediction of Worldwide Energy Resources (NASA PPOWER) website. Next, the data were transformed into shapefiles, aligning with the second step in the flowchart. Following this transformation, the shapefile was intersected with a downloaded shapefile that delineates the boundaries of Africa, which is represented in the third step of the flowchart.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Infographic diagram illustrating the 5-step process for site selection for solar pond development in Africa via Python software implemented in DBSCAN.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41598_2025_1778_Fig1_HTML" id="d33e280"/></fig></p><p id="Par9">Subsequently, a DBSCAN clustering analysis was conducted for site selection, effectively organizing land suitability into clusters, as indicated in the fourth step. This clustering process is crucial for understanding the relationships between different land areas. Finally, the areas for the coordinates within the selected suitable and highly suitable regions were computed, completing the fifth step of the flowchart. The data were then spatially reviewed, followed by cluster analysis using DBSCAN, which identified five main clusters that categorize the optimal locations for solar pond development. Ultimately, the coordinates for the areas deemed highly suitable for site selection were calculated in the area calculation section.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Data acquisition</title><p id="Par10">The remote sensing data were downloaded from the Power Project on the NASA website covering a period from 2000 to 2020. The spatial environmental data were obtained from the NASA website with a spatial resolution of 0.5 degrees. The dataset included solar radiation (direct normal radiation) in kW-hr/m<sup>2</sup>/day, temperature at 2&#x000a0;m in &#x000b0;C, wind speed at 10&#x000a0;m, cloud amount in percentage, clear-sky insolation clearness index (dimensionless), and precipitation in mm/day. Solar radiation, particularly direct normal radiation (DNR), is crucial for solar pond development, as it measures the solar energy reaching the Earth when the sun is directly overhead<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Temperature is also vital, as it influences the efficiency and performance of solar ponds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Wind speed is assessed to evaluate its potential impact on the stability of the infrastructure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Additionally, cloud cover and the clear-sky insolation clearness index (dimensionless) affect the solar radiation that reaches the surface<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, while precipitation provides insights into water balance and solar pond maintenance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. The entire dataset for Africa was transformed into a list of geometric points using the longitude and latitude columns, resulting in the creation of a GeoDataFrame with a specified coordinate reference system (EPSG:32,651). This data was then converted into an ESRI shapefile, facilitating effective storage and manipulation of geographic information. Shapefiles for all of Africa and each country were obtained from the GDAM maps and data website.</p><p id="Par11">To facilitate regional analysis and better capture geographic variability, countries were grouped into five distinct regions: North, East, West, Southern, and Central Africa. This regional discretization allows for targeted cluster analysis that accounts for the environmental and climatic differences across the continent. Shapefiles corresponding to each region were created by aggregating national shapefiles, and an intersection was performed between the environmental dataset and each regional boundary (as shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). This process ensured that clustering was performed within spatially and environmentally coherent zones, improving the interpretability and relevance of the analysis.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Overviews of the distribution of the downloaded datapoint from the NASA POWER website and five discrete regions of Africa (North Africa, Central Africa, East Africa, Southern Africa, and West Africa) in our gathered data.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41598_2025_1778_Fig2_HTML" id="d33e321"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>DBSCAN clustering</title><p id="Par12">In the process of selecting a site, the density-based spatial clustering of application with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm plays a crucial role<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. DBSCAN stands out from traditional clustering algorithms due to its flexibility in determining the number of clusters and its ability to identify outliers as noise rather than including them in a cluster<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Two key parameters, epsilon (&#x00190;) and the minimum points (MinPts), are fundamental to the application of DBSCAN. Epsilon represents the radius for searching for neighboring points, while MinPts determines the minimum points within the epsilon neighborhood of the core point as part of the cluster<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Core points are defined as those with at least MinPts within their epsilon neighborhood, representing regions of high density<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Before the site selection process, minimum points were set MinPts&#x02009;=&#x02009;D&#x02009;+&#x02009;1 where D is the number of features for each input combination. Where &#x00190; value was indicates by plotting the distances to each point&#x02019;s MinPts nearest neighbor, sorted in ascending order (k-distance plot). The &#x0201c;knee&#x0201d; or elbow in the plot, where the curve sharply increases, indicates the optimal &#x003b5; value. This is the point where noise starts, and clusters end. While epsilon value was then also altered to ensure obtain only 4 clusters. Choosing to limit the number of clusters to 4 allows for a smaller epsilon value, which helps minimize the inclusion of noise points as separate clusters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Table S1 show the epsilon values obtained from k-distance plot and the adapted &#x00190; for Africa and five reginal regions. This results in a cleaner clustering output that emphasizes the primary structures of the data. Additionally, restricting the number of clusters improves computational efficiency for subsequent analyses and visualizations. The sites were categorized based on their suitability, with the most suitable sites characterized by high DNR, moderate temperatures, and minimal impact from other environmental factors.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>The area calculations.</title><p id="Par13">Following the completion of the clustering analysis, the results were documented in an Excel spreadsheet, detailing the geospatial computations conducted using geographic coordinate data.

This approach involves identifying locations with high solar radiation, suitable temperature conditions, minimal environmental impact, and clear sky radiation. Other factors, such as temperature, wind speed, precipitation, and proximity to water resources, are also essential considerations. Direct normal radiation (DNR), which indirectly measures the portion of solar radiation reaching the Earth&#x02019;s surface, is influenced by factors such as water vapor, aerosols, and clouds. These considerations are integral to the successful establishment and operation of solar ponds. The spatial distribution of the environmental remote sensing data across the study area, as depicted in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, post intersection with the boundaries of Africa reveals notable patterns. In the northern region of Africa, particularly around the latitude of 10&#x000b0;N, solar radiation range from 5 to 7 Kw-hr/m<sup>2</sup>/day, mirroring a similar trend in the southern region at 15&#x000b0;S. The temperature distribution across 2 m has been relatively consistent at approximately 20&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C throughout Africa, except above 30&#x000b0;N and below 25&#x000b0;S, where the temperature ranges from 15&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C to 20&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C. The wind speed distribution over 2 m in m s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> indicates peak values exceeding 5 m s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> in the Horn of Africa, with values between 4 and 5 ms<sup>-1</sup> observed around a latitude of 15&#x000b0;N. In the region spanning from a latitude of 10&#x000b0;N to 25&#x000b0;S, the wind speed values fall below 3 ms<sup>-1</sup>, reaching approximately 1 ms<sup>-1</sup> around the equator. The spatial distribution of environmental data across Africa reveals favourable conditions for solar energy in the northern and southern latitudes (10&#x000b0;N to 15&#x000b0;S), wind energy in the Horn of Africa and regions around 15&#x000b0;N, and agricultural activities in moderate temperature zones (around 20&#x000b0;C), providing key insights for optimal site selection in renewable energy and agriculture<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Visual representations showcasing the distribution patterns of key environmental parameters across the African continent, such as direct normal radiation (DNR), temperature at a height of 2 m, wind speed at a height of 10 m, clear sky conditions, cloud cover, and precipitation.

Cloud cover, expressed as a percentage, exhibited values less than 30% in North Africa at approximately 15&#x000b0;N and approximately 40% in southern Africa below 15&#x000b0;S. In the region spanning from 10&#x000b0;N to 15&#x000b0;S, the cloud cover exceeds 60%. The spatial distribution of precipitation for Africa indicates zero values, excluding the region between 10&#x000b0;N and 15&#x000b0;S, where values range from 2 to 5 mm/day<sup>-1</sup>. This also reflected the increase in the epsilon value from 0.06 to 0.9, where the epsilon value indicates the radius of the neighbouring points, indicating the coherence of the points used to create the clusters.</p><p id="Par18">The DBSCAN clustering algorithm was applied to different input combinations of environmental remote sensing data (6 input combinations), as shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>. The first input combination started with the DNR, which has a high impact on the functionality of the solar pond. The DNR distribution data will help to determine the sunlight available for solar pond operation and energy storage. Then, for a cluster with an input combination, the temperature is considered in terms of the DNR and temperature. Temperatures have a greater impact DNR on the performance of solar ponds than does DNR. Temperature data are highly essential because they help in understanding the thermal characteristics of the site. Moreover, this approach is essential for evaluating ambient temperature conditions. The temperature data will help directly impact the heat exchange processes within solar ponds. Subsequently, the wind speed was included in the input combination for DBSCAN clustering for the site selection process. The wind speed data could be valuable for assessing local wind speed conditions. The wind speed data could help to understand the effect of convective heat loss from the solar pond surface. For Input combination 4, the clear Sky parameter was included in the previous inputs in the previous combination. The cloud amount parameter was included in input combination 5 for the application of the DBSCAN clustering algorithm. Clear sky radiation data are highly essential and are assessed based on various atmospheric parameters, including clear sky measurements and cloud amount measurements. The cloud amount usually negatively impacts the amount of solar radiation that reaches the Earth&#x02019;s surface. For the sixth input combination, the precipitation parameter was included to ensure the water supply and management of the solar ponds. The results for input combination 1 (DNR only) revealed the identification of four clusters, labeled "Noise," &#x0201c;High Suitable&#x0201d;, "Moderate Suitable," and "Low Suitable." This analysis evaluates the suitability of various site locations for solar pond development using DBSCAN clustering, with an epsilon value set at&#x000a0;0.06.

However, its effectiveness is somewhat limited due to the wide variability of the data, which can impact the clarity of integrating the information into the clustering analysis. Therefore, a more practical approach would be to apply this cluster analysis to less dense data points within smaller-scale areas, specifically in five distinct regions: North Africa, East Africa, West Africa, Central Africa, and Southern Africa. This targeted approach allows for a more focused and precise analysis of site selection processes.</p><p id="Par27">In the initial phase, North Africa, comprising seven countries, namely, Egypt, Sudan, Libya, Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco, and the Western Desert, was the focus of the study as shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>. The application of DBSCAN clustering was executed for this selected region, with various input combinations tested.

This finding suggested that the categorization of clusters remains unaffected by the inclusion of the clear sky percentage in the input combination.</p><p id="Par30">Considering the cloud cover in the fifth input combination, the analysis also yields 4 clusters, resulting in different outcomes for the clusters suitable for solar pond development.

The data reveal multipolygonal areas for &#x0201c;High Suitable&#x0201d; cluster have an area like before. Other cluster is termed as the &#x0201c;Moderate Suitable&#x0201d; cluster, and the &#x0201c;Low Suitable&#x0201d; cluster shares the same coordinates and area values. This phenomenon is attributed to the minimal influence of precipitation on the cluster analysis over North Africa, given the nearly zero values observed over a 20-year period.</p><p id="Par32">The results indicate an increase in epsilon values as indicated in Figure S3 and adapted to values in Table S1 as more parameters are considered in the input combinations. Specifically, the epsilon values increase from 0.048 when considering only DNR to 0.48 (a tenfold increase) when temperature is included in the input combination. This value remains consistent at 0.48 after considering the wind speed but increases to 1.78 (more than threefold) when the clear sky parameter is considered and to 1.8 when precipitation is factored in. These variations are reflected in significantly larger dimensions observed when the temperature parameter is included in the input combination than when considering only the DNR. This difference can be attributed to the weak correlation between DNR and temperature, as evidenced by the correlation value of 0.09 in Figure S2. In contrast, the suitable cluster shows a much larger increase when the wind speed is included, with values ten thousand times and one thousand times greater than those obtained for the second input combination. The results indicate that DBSCAN is influenced not only by the degree of correlation between parameters but also by other measures that exclude outliers in the data. Similar results are observed for the areas of suitable locations in the fourth input combination, reflecting an unchanged epsilon value, while a decrease is observed when cloud cover is factored into the fifth input combination. This trend continues in the sixth input combination, with minimal changes in the epsilon value.</p><p id="Par33">The differences in the application of DBSCAN clustering between a smaller dataset in North Africa and a larger dataset covering the entire continent of Africa are evident. The increased variability of the data across continents makes it challenging to expand the clusters into suitable ones, as it becomes difficult to assign more points within the epsilon value that share the same characteristics or have high correlation with neighboring points. This distinction became apparent when applying the clustering approach in North Africa, where more suitable areas were distinguished that did not appear when the application was performed across the entire African continent.</p><p id="Par34">Central Africa comprises 11 countries, namely, Angola, Burundi, Chad, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Cameroon, the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Republic of Congo, Rwanda, and S&#x000e3;o Tom&#x000e9; and Principe.

This change aligns with the higher correlation coefficient (0.1) between the DNR and temperature, as depicted in Figure S5, which is ten times greater than that obtained for the North Sea region. A slight increase in the epsilon value occurred when considering the wind speed parameter in the input combination, reaching a value of 0.68 with a correlation coefficient of 0.88 with the DNR.

Within the &#x0201c;Suitable&#x0201d; cluster, multipolygonal objects are situated within coordinates spanning from 48.25&#x000b0;E and 14.25&#x000b0;S to 48.75&#x000b0;E and 19.75&#x000b0;S in Madagascar; 35.25&#x000b0;E and 7.25&#x000b0;N to 35.75&#x000b0;E and 7.75&#x000b0;N in Ethiopia; and 29.75&#x000b0;E and 0.75&#x000b0;S to 31.75&#x000b0;E and 0.75&#x000b0;N in Uganda. The multipolygonal object spans from 29.25&#x000b0;E and 2.75&#x000b0;S to 30.75&#x000b0;E and 2.25&#x000b0;S in Rwanda, from 29.25&#x000b0;E and 2.75&#x000b0;S to 29.75&#x000b0;E and 3.75&#x000b0;S in Burundi, and from 30.75&#x000b0;E and 1.25&#x000b0;S to 35.75&#x000b0;E and 9.75&#x000b0;S in Tanzania, with an area value of 1.9&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>6</sup> hectares. Additionally, a cluster labeled &#x0201c;Moderate Suitable&#x0201d; occupies a region with coordinates of 43.75&#x000b0;E and 23.25&#x000b0;S to 43.75&#x000b0;E and 24.25&#x000b0;S in Madagascar, encompassing an area of 24.6&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>2</sup> hectares.

Following the application of the second set of inputs, four clusters were identified: "Noise," "High Suitable," "Moderate Suitable," and "Low Suitable." Among these, one cluster termed as &#x0201c;High Suitable&#x0201d; create a multipolygon with an area of 5.18&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>8</sup> hectares mainly in Tanzania, Mozambique and Zimbabwe. the &#x0201c;Moderate Suitable&#x0201d; cluster forms a multipolygonal object with coordinates spanning from 49.25&#x000b0;E and 14.25&#x000b0;S to 48.25&#x000b0;E and 19.25&#x000b0;S in Madagascar and from 29.75&#x000b0;E and 1.25&#x000b0;S to 29.75&#x000b0;E and 1.75&#x000b0;S in Uganda and Rwanda, covering an area of 6.3&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>7</sup> hectares. Additionally, the &#x0201c;Low Suitable&#x0201d; cluster encompasses an area with coordinates of 47.25&#x000b0;E and 20.25&#x000b0;S to 47.25&#x000b0;E and 19.25&#x000b0;S in Madagascar and from 35.75&#x000b0;E and 0.75&#x000b0;S to 36.25&#x000b0;E and 0.75&#x000b0;S in Kenya, with a total area of 8.6&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>6</sup> hectares. After the application of the subsequent third input combination, 4 clusters, as before, were obtained with an epsilon value of 0.6. One cluster termed as &#x0201c;High Suitable&#x0201d; create an area with a value of 5.82&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>8</sup> hectares primarily in Tanzania, Mozambique and Zimbabwe. The cluster termed &#x0201c;Moderate Suitable&#x0201d; has coordinates of 39.25&#x000b0;E and 10.75&#x000b0;N to 39.75&#x000b0;E and 6.75&#x000b0;S in Ethiopia.

The area of the multipolygon has a value of 6.2&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>6</sup> hectares. Similar results were achieved following the application of the subsequent fourth input combination. The inclusion of the clear sky parameter alongside DNR, temperature, and wind speed did not yield a significant impact. However, a reduction in the suitable area was observed upon factoring in the percentage of cloud cover. Specifically, a cluster termed as &#x0201c;High Suitable&#x0201d; create an area of 5.87&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>8</sup> hectares primarily in Tanzania, Mozambique and Zimbabwe. The other is the &#x0201c;Moderate Suitable&#x0201d; cluster exhibited an area of 2.5&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>6</sup> hectares, with the multipolygonal object spanning from 38.75&#x000b0;E and 6.25&#x000b0;N to 39.75&#x000b0;E and 6.75&#x000b0;N in Ethiopia and from 35.75&#x000b0;E and 0.25&#x000b0;S to 35.75&#x000b0;E and 0.75&#x000b0;S in Kenya.

Subsequently, upon considering precipitation in the sixth input combination, four clusters were identified. Notably, A cluster termed as &#x0201c;High Suitable&#x0201d; has an area of almost the same value as before also primarily in Tanzania, Mozambique and Zimbabwe. The &#x0201c;Moderate Suitable&#x0201d; cluster did not delineate any specific region, while the &#x0201c;Low Suitable&#x0201d; cluster delineated a region with an area of 2.4&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>6</sup> hectares, with coordinates ranging from 29.75&#x000b0;E and 1.25&#x000b0;S to 29.75&#x000b0;E and 1.75&#x000b0;S in Uganda and Rwanda, respectively.<fig id="Fig12"><label>Fig. 12</label><caption><p>Spatial distribution of the DBSCAN cluster outputs after the application of different combinations of environmental conditions in the East Africa region.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41598_2025_1778_Fig12_HTML" id="d33e673"/></fig><fig id="Fig13"><label>Fig. 13</label><caption><p>The area calculated in hectares for the highly suitable clusters for solar ponds site selection for countries in East Africa region for six input combinations.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41598_2025_1778_Fig13_HTML" id="d33e681"/></fig></p><p id="Par41">In the East Africa region, the epsilon values follow a similar trend to those observed in the district regions after the application of different parameters in the same order within the input combinations. Those values were shown in Figure S9 and altered as indicated in Table S1. An epsilon value of 0.08 was indicated after considering DNR in the input combinations, which increased fivefold to a value of 0.385 after including temperature in the input combination with a correlation coefficient of 0.07 with DNR. As in previous district regions, there was a slight increase in epsilon values after considering wind speed data, resulting in a value of 0.6, similar to that obtained after considering the dimensionless clear sky parameter, with correlation coefficients of 0.47 and 0.26 between wind speed and clear sky conditions with DNR, respectively as shown in Figure S8. Additionally, a threefold increase in the DNR yielded an epsilon value of 1.8 after considering the cloud cover parameter in the input combinations, with a negative correlation coefficient with DNR (&#x02212;&#x02009;0.86).

This resulted in a reduction in the suitable area by a factor of one thousand for the second input combination. Like in the previous African districts, there was a slight increase in the epsilon values when considering the wind speed parameter, with similar values obtained when considering the dimensionless clear sky parameter at 0.79. The suitable areas obtained after considering both parameters exhibited similar values, with similar correlation coefficients of 0.84 and 0.93 between the wind speed and clear-sky parameters with the DNR, respectively.

The suitable patterns obtained after applying DBSCAN clustering for the district regions differed from those observed across the entire continent. The focus on the district regions aimed to evaluate the dataset&#x02019;s variability for remotely sensed environmental data, which is critical for solar pond development. Similar trends were observed in the district African regions after considering DNR followed by temperature, resulting in an increase in the suitable area when wind speed was taken into account. However, across all the African districts, incorporating the dimensionless clear sky parameter did not alter the suitability of solar pond development sites. Conversely, the cloud cover percentage exhibited an increasing trend in terms of suitability for solar pond development sites. There was minimal variation when considering precipitation parameters, except in the central Africa region, which could be attributed to the distribution of zero values across the regions, except for Central Africa. Overall, these results underscore the significance of AutoGIS processing via the Python scripting language integrated with DBSCAN clustering for the site selection process, especially for large datasets such as the one we have for the African continent, comprising 18,000 data points across six remotely sensed environmental parameters.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par48">This study demonstrated the effective use of AutoGIS processing and DBSCAN clustering, supported by Python scripting, for identifying suitable sites for solar pond development across Africa using over 18,000 remotely sensed environmental data points. The analysis covered both the entire continent and its five subregions&#x02014;North, Central, East, Southern, and West Africa. While regional variability influenced the clustering results, consistent patterns in suitable site distribution and epsilon values were observed across the subregions. Among the environmental factors, temperature showed limited correlation with Direct Normal Radiation (DNR), often reducing the area deemed suitable for solar ponds. This highlights the importance of integrating multiple parameters to enhance the accuracy of site selection. The practical deployment of these algorithms through user-friendly software tools supports broader accessibility, enabling informed decision-making even by non-experts. The findings are particularly relevant for regions with limited freshwater access and constrained investment in wastewater infrastructure, positioning solar pond technology as a viable, low-cost alternative.
