Notably, the requirement for NSm is specific to the midgut; bypassing this barrier by experimental intrathoracic infection of the mosquito eliminates the necessity of NSm for virus spread in other tissues, including the salivary glands.

Some bunyaviruses have evolved to cycle between blood sucking arthropods and vertebrates, and they represent approximately half of the currently known arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses). Arboviral diseases pose significant threats to human and animal health worldwide, leading to substantial economic burdens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. With no vaccines available for most of these diseases, and limited effective vector control measures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, the growing impact of climate change will expand the reach of arboviral threats, amplifying disease control challenges<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Prioritizing research to understand factors facilitating arbovirus transmission and develop integrated control strategies is crucial for public health, as exemplified by the recent launch of the World Health Organization&#x02019;s Global Arbovirus Initiative<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Among arboviruses, vector-borne bunyaviruses (arbo-bunyaviruses) pose one of the greatest public health risks. For example, Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV, transmitted by ticks) and Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV, transmitted by mosquitoes), are included in the list of infectious diseases prioritised by the WHO for requiring further research and development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Although bunyaviruses have diverse host range and pathogenicity, they share key features including possessing a segmented and single-stranded RNA genome encoding a small number of proteins, a similar virion structure, viral replication in the cytoplasm, and assembly and budding at membranes of the Golgi complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. They possess a membrane envelope coated by glycoproteins and their genome, generally consisting of three segments, small (S), medium (M), and large (L), is wrapped up by the nucleocapsid protein N and interacts with the viral polymerase. The S segment encodes the N protein and in many cases a non-structural protein NSs, which modulates the interferon response of the mammalian host<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. The M segment encodes the glycoprotein precursor (GPC) that is co-translationally cleaved by host peptidases to yield the mature viral glycoproteins Gn and Gc, while the large (L) segment encodes the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase L. In some viruses from certain bunyavirus families (<italic>Peribunyaviridae</italic>, <italic>Nairoviridae</italic>, <italic>Phenuiviridae</italic> and <italic>Tospoviridae</italic>), the M segment also encodes a non-structural protein NSm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. While the role of the structural proteins and NSs is well known across bunyavirus families<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, no clear function for the NSm protein has been identified<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, with the exception of the thrip-transmitted plant virus Tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV, <italic>Tospoviridae</italic> family), where NSm acts as a movement protein involved in cell-to-cell transport of viral ribonucleoproteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">In Bunyamwera virus (BUNV, <italic>Peribunyaviridae</italic>), the prototype of bunyaviruses, NSm is a 15&#x02009;kDa type II integral membrane protein containing five domains, three hydrophobic domains (I, III, and V) and two non-hydrophobic domains (II and IV)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. The N-terminal domain I serves as NSm signal peptide and is cleaved during GPC processing. The C-terminal domain V serves as signal peptide for downstream Gc but remains integral to NSm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. In BUNV-infected mammalian cells, NSm is targeted to the Golgi complex and co-localizes with viral glycoproteins Gn and Gc. Since virus assembly and budding at the Golgi is one of the characteristics of bunyaviruses, it was suggested that NSm may be involved in virus assembly and morphogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. However, we have shown that, except for the N-terminal domain I, which serves as the NSm signal peptide and is required for BUNV morphogenesis, BUNV is able to tolerate deletions of all other domains (domains II to V), indicating that NSm is largely dispensable for virus replication in mammalian cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. This was further confirmed with several other bunyaviruses (Maguari virus, <italic>Peribunyaviridae</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>; Oropouche virus, <italic>Peribunyaviridae</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>; Schmallenberg virus, <italic>Peribunyaviridae</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>; RVFV, <italic>Phenuiviridae</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>; CCHFV, <italic>Nairoviridae</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>).</p><p id="Par6">Here we show that NSm is only present in bunyaviruses transmitted by arthropods. Since arboviruses circulate between a vertebrate host (or plants in some cases) and an arthropod vector, and no clear function of NSm has been described in vertebrates, we hypothesised that NSm has a specific role during the viral life cycle in the arthropod host. We investigated the role of NSm using both in vitro experiments in cell cultures and in vivo studies in the female mosquito. We provide several lines of evidence demonstrating that NSm is required for virus cell-to-cell spread in the midgut, and dissemination to secondary tissues in the mosquito. Our study reveals that NSm was acquired during the evolution of vector-borne bunyaviruses, and it is a critical determinant allowing virus transmission between vertebrate and arthropod hosts.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>NSm is only present in bunyaviruses transmitted by arthropods</title><p id="Par7">To gain insights into the function of NSm, we performed an <italic>in-silico</italic> analysis of the presence or absence of NSm across viruses from the <italic>Bunyavirales</italic> order. Interestingly, this revealed a strong correlation between the presence of NSm and bunyaviruses vectored by arthropods (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Indeed, NSm is present in arbo-bunyaviruses only and all bunyaviruses transmitted by arthropods encode an NSm protein, with a few exceptions in the <italic>Phenuiviridae</italic> family. All bunyaviruses which are not arboviruses do not encode NSm. As NSm is present in bunyaviruses belonging to only a few viral genera, and which are dispersed across phylogenetically distinct families<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, the &#x0201c;law of parsimony&#x0201d; supports a convergent evolution with independent and repeated acquisitions of NSm in bunyaviruses. To further infer the origin and evolution of NSm across bunyaviruses, we then blasted the BUNV NSm sequence to retrieve all homologous sequences and performed a phylogenetic analysis (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1a</xref>). While NSm from most of <italic>Peribunyaviridae</italic> could be retrieved and aligned (distance mean: 0.8539, minimum distance: 0.1502, maximum distance: 0.9396), NSm from other families, <italic>i.e</italic>., <italic>Nairoviridae</italic>, <italic>Phenuiviridae</italic> and <italic>Tospoviridae</italic>, could not be retrieved due to an absence of protein sequence similarity. This is also confirmed by the lack of similarity between the structure prediction of NSm from different families (BUNV, RVFV, CCHFV and TSWV), as shown Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1b</xref>. This supports a single ancestral acquisition of NSm within the <italic>Peribunyaviridae</italic>, followed by divergent evolution in each virus, and independent acquisitions of NSm &#x02013; likely different genes/sequences now all called NSm- by the different virus families.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Correlation between bunyaviruses vectored by arthropods and the presence of NSm.</title><p>Analysis of the presence (highlighted in blue) or absence (highlighted in red) of NSm across all families and genera within the <italic>Bunyavirales</italic> order.

As expected, we observed increased viral titres from 3 to 15 dpbm in both the midgut and body, with effective dissemination to the salivary glands between 3 and 15 dpbm in BUNV-wt infected mosquitoes. However, we could detect only very low levels of BUN-&#x00394;NSm in midguts at 3 dpbm and not at all at 15 days post-infection. Furthermore, we confirmed that no dissemination occurred at 3 and 15 dpbm since only one body sample was infected at 15 dpbm and no salivary glands were infected. Taken together, these results revealed the crucial role of BUNV NSm in vivo as the deletion of NSm alone was sufficient to nearly abolish midgut infection and dissemination in the <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> mosquito.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>NSm is not required for dissemination and transmission when bypassing the midgut</title><p id="Par11">Since the midgut is the first tissue to be infected by an arbovirus before disseminating to other tissues and considering that BUN-&#x00394;NSm was not able to infect the gut efficiently, we wondered whether the NSm requirement was specific to the midgut or generally required for infection of mosquito tissues. To assess this, we intrathoracically inoculated female mosquitoes with either BUNV-wt or BUN-&#x00394;NSm to overcome the midgut barrier (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). We sampled several whole mosquitoes minutes after injection to ensure that females from each group were inoculated with an equivalent number of viral particles (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3b</xref>). We collected midguts and salivary glands individually at 3- and 9-days post-injection (dpi) and subsequently measured virus titres (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). At both 3 and 9 dpi, we found that the viral titres in midguts from BUN-&#x00394;NSm injected mosquitoes were significantly lower compared to the BUNV-wt injected mosquitoes. However, we did not observe differences in the salivary glands at 3 and 9 dpi, indicating that both BUNV-wt and BUN-&#x00394;NSm equally disseminated to and infected the salivary glands, when bypassing the midgut barrier through intrathoracic inoculation. To unambiguously validate this observation and determine if the mosquitoes were able to transmit BUN-&#x00394;NSm virus, we repeated the injection experiments and measured the viral titres in individual salivary glands and in the mosquito saliva at 7 dpi as a proxy of transmission. Again, we confirmed that there was no significant difference in viral titres in the salivary glands (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>) with comparable production of infectious saliva in both BUNV-wt and BUN-&#x00394;NSm injected mosquitoes (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><title>Effect of NSm deletion on infection, dissemination and transmission following injection in <italic>Ae. aegypti.</italic></title><p><bold>a</bold> Experimental scheme for the analysis of BUNV-wt and BUN-&#x00394;NSm infection dynamics (Created in BioRender.

Interestingly, in contrast to virus titres, the levels of viral segment S levels were similar for both viruses at 3 and 24&#x02009;h, which suggests that viral RNA from initially ingested virions persists in the midgut for 24&#x02009;h post-blood meal, likely in the gut lumen while the blood is not yet fully digested. Between 24 and 48&#x02009;h, an eclipse phase was observed as BUNV S levels dropped for both BUNV-wt and BUN-&#x00394;NSm, albeit to significantly lower levels for BUN-&#x00394;NSm compared to BUNV-wt. However, BUNV-wt levels significantly increased between 48 and 72&#x02009;h pbm, exhibiting the post-eclipse pattern of RNA replication, whereas BUN-&#x00394;NSm levels continued to decline at 72&#x02009;h pbm. These results confirmed that BUN-&#x00394;NSm failed to efficiently infect the entire midgut tissue within 3 days post-infection as shown previously (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>).</p><p id="Par16">Next, we analysed the infection pattern in the midgut epithelium early after oral infection at 24, 48 and 72&#x02009;h pbm (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>). At 24&#x02009;h pbm, we detected N staining in individual cells throughout the midgut epithelium in both BUNV-wt and BUN-&#x00394;NSm infected mosquitoes, indicating that both viruses can efficiently enter midgut epithelial cells soon after feeding and suggesting that BUN-&#x00394;NSm infection is impaired after initial cell entry in the midgut. The dynamics of BUNV-wt and BUN-&#x00394;NSm infections were distinctly different over time. At 48&#x02009;h pbm, we detected N staining in numerous clusters of cells, or foci of infection, in the midgut of BUNV-wt infected mosquitoes, whereas staining was still confined to a few isolated midgut cells in BUN-&#x00394;NSm infected mosquitoes. At 72&#x02009;h pbm, the difference between the two viruses was markedly increased. In BUNV-wt infected mosquitoes, we detected N antigen in large foci that spread throughout the midgut, compared to those observed at 48&#x02009;h pbm. Higher magnification of an individual focus of infection showed a large cluster of cells (&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;100 cells) with intense N staining in the cytoplasm (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>, circle). By contrast, only a small number of individual midgut cells were positive for the viral N antigen at 72&#x02009;h pbm after BUN-&#x00394;NSm infection, showing that BUN-&#x00394;NSm stays confined in the initially infected cells and does not spread to neighbouring cells to form large foci. Altogether, our data indicated that the NSm deletion mutant was able to enter and infect midgut cells, but without NSm, the virus failed to spread from infected to uninfected cells and thus propagate in the midgut epithelium.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>In vivo expression of NSm in trans partially rescues BUN-&#x00394;NSm infection in the midgut</title><p id="Par17">To confirm that the impairment of BUN-&#x00394;NSm in the midgut was due to the absence of the NSm protein, we next tested if in vivo transfection of an expression vector for BUNV NSm could rescue mosquito infection following oral delivery of BUN-&#x00394;NSm (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>).

After an infectious blood meal, BUNV enters the midgut epithelium, and the infection spreads from primary infected cells to adjacent cells and then further progresses to form large clusters of infected cells, ultimately leading to virus dissemination to secondary target tissues. Over time, these infection foci became enlarged and were visualized in the entire midgut epithelium (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>), confirming previous observations with different arboviruses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>.

Taken together, we show that both Gc and NSm are detected at the cell surface. However, NSm is predominantly detected at the periphery of infection foci, suggesting that, unlike other viral proteins, NSm is expressed early and transiently during cell infection.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec11" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par23">The <italic>Bunyavirales</italic> order is a large taxonomic group of viruses which include important human, veterinary, and plant pathogens.

While all bunyaviruses possess a similar genome structure, viruses from some genera scattered in certain families also encode the non-structural NSm protein.</p><p id="Par24">Our analysis revealed that NSm is present in vector-borne bunyaviruses only. Several studies using bunyaviruses from different families have shown that NSm is largely dispensable for virus replication in mammalian cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. We showed that NSm is also not required for BUNV replication in mosquito cells in vitro, as described previously for Oropouche virus, another bunyavirus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, suggesting that NSm is not necessary for arbo-bunyavirus replication regardless of the host. However, we demonstrated that mosquitoes infected with BUN-&#x00394;NSm had significantly lower midgut infection rates and dissemination in secondary tissues was abolished compared to mosquitoes infected with the wild type virus.</p><p id="Par25">To successfully infect an arthropod vector, an arbovirus overcomes different midgut barriers. Initially, in the first few hours after the infectious blood meal, the virus invades and replicates in a few epithelial midgut cells. The virus then spreads from infected cells to uninfected ones within the midgut epithelium, before the virus finally escapes from the midgut<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. We showed that NSm is specifically required for virus cell-to-cell spread in the mosquito midgut and is therefore an essential determinant for successful infection and dissemination in the arthropod vector. When we infected mosquitoes by intrathoracic inoculation, thus bypassing the midgut barrier, both the NSm deletion mutant and wild type virus infected the same peripheral tissues and cell types. For example, both viruses efficiently infected hemocytes, as described previously for other arboviruses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>, as well as tracheae, the respiratory system of insects, and the muscle fibres surrounding the midgut<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Similarly, BUN-&#x00394;NSm could infect and replicate in salivary gland acinar cells and be released into the saliva. However, while BUNV-wt could infect the midgut epithelium from the basal side and form infection foci, BUN-&#x00394;NSm was unable to do so. The titres reached by BUN-&#x00394;NSm in the midgut were significantly reduced compared to those reached by wild type virus, with the absence of infection foci. Nonetheless, they were still higher than those reached after an infectious blood meal, as the mutant virus successfully infected tracheae and muscles surrounding the midgut.</p><p id="Par26">After a blood meal infection, we found that BUN-&#x00394;NSm can enter and replicate in a few cells scattered throughout the midgut. However, while BUNV-wt infection efficiently spread over time to form large infection foci within the gut epithelium, BUN-&#x00394;NSm remained confined to individual midgut cells and did not spread to adjacent cells. Importantly, we rescued this mutant phenotype in mosquitoes by expressing NSm in trans. Thus, our findings demonstrate that the NSm protein is involved in cell-to-cell spread specifically in the midgut and it is therefore a key viral determinant for successful infection of bunyaviruses transmitted via a blood meal. We also demonstrated that NSm is essential for bunyaviruses to escape from the midgut and disseminate to other tissues. How arboviruses escape from the midgut and bypass the midgut basal lamina (BL), whose pore sizes are significantly smaller than an arbovirus particle, is a long-standing question. Some evidence suggests that tracheoles penetrating the midgut BL may be actively infected by virions and provide a path for viruses to escape the midgut<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Other studies support the idea that passive viral escape may be facilitated due to extensive distension of the gut and transient BL &#x0201c;leakiness&#x0201d; after a blood meal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Initially, only a few midgut cells become infected, but with time, viruses spread to form foci, which may eventually overlap with sporadic BL micro perforations, allowing viruses to bypass the BL and further disseminate. Therefore, the absence of BUN-&#x00394;NSm dissemination could be due to a role of NSm in viral spreading from a midgut infected cell to a tracheole cell, similar to its function in cell-to-cell spread within the midgut epithelium. Alternatively, it could be an indirect consequence of the inability of the virus to form infection foci, decreasing the total number of infected cells and thus the chance for an infected cell to overlap with relatively few regions where the BL is compromised.</p><p id="Par27">Previous reports have shown that increasing the viral dose in an infectious blood meal could overcome the midgut barriers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. We found that higher BUN-&#x00394;NSm infectious titres in the blood meal increased the prevalence of infection as well as midgut viral titres. This is probably due to the greater number of individual cells initially infected in the midgut, and in accordance with a recent study showing that midgut viral titres shortly after invasion are strongly dose-dependent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. However, increased doses of BUN-&#x00394;NSm were not associated with viral spread to neighbouring cells or with dissemination from the midgut. Thus, the midgut cell-to-cell spread and escape barriers encountered by BUN-&#x00394;NSm are likely dose-independent. Dose-independent barriers are in general due to incompatibilities between the virus and tissue surface structures, preventing the virions from binding to and/or traversing tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Therefore, the NSm protein may be required to overcome a structural incompatibility between the virus and midgut cell surface, allowing the virus to spread within the midgut epithelium and disseminate.</p><p id="Par28">While no protein or mechanism involved in cell-to-cell spread of arboviruses in their mosquito hosts have been described, different strategies used by viruses to spread within an epithelium and egress from epithelial barriers have been characterised in other models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. In the thrip-transmitted plant bunyavirus TSWV (<italic>Tospoviridae</italic>), NSm acts as a plant movement protein, allowing cell-to-cell spread through junctions and long-distance movement of viral ribonucleoproteins (RNPs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. The expression of NSm in this case is early and transient in intercellular junctions of TSWV-infected tissues, coinciding with the development of systemic infection, while it drastically decreases during later infection stages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. TSWV NSm has been shown to localise in finger-like extensions of cultured insect and plant cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. In the midgut of BUNV-wt infected mosquitoes, we found that the NSm protein was expressed mainly at the periphery of infection foci. These data suggest an early and transient expression of NSm in infected cells and it is consistent with the role of NSm in virus spread within the midgut epithelium. In addition, NSm was localised at the cell membrane in the midgut, where cell junctions are located, and localised in finger-like extensions in mosquito cultured cells. The similar characteristics between TSWV NSm and BUNV NSm suggest that the latter facilitates virus cell-to-cell spread by a comparable mechanism to that of TSWV NSm.</p><p id="Par29">Interestingly, infection with Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) mutated for P78, a protein in which NSm remains fused to Gn, was also associated with reduced infection rates and dissemination in <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> mosquitoes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. Although no mechanism was identified, the mutant virus was also restricted to small areas in the midgut<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. Thus, the critical function of NSm in cell-to-cell spread may be a conserved feature of different bunyavirus families. Our analysis showed that NSm is present in bunyaviruses belonging to only a few viral genera and which are spread across phylogenetically distinct families supporting that NSm acquisition is the result of convergent evolution as these viruses were adapting to similar environments and selective pressures. Since NSm is present in arbo-bunyaviruses only, one of the possible explanations is that these viruses have acquired NSm to overcome the insect vector midgut barrier after oral infection. Remarkably, NSm is absent in insect-specific bunyaviruses. While arboviruses are acquired through a blood meal and need to move efficiently between cells in the midgut and then disseminate to other parts of the mosquito body, insect-specific viruses (ISVs) are differently acquired, such as by vertical or venereal transmission<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. Therefore, ISVs could have evolved different mechanisms suited to their acquisition modes where direct access to mosquito tissues, and their maintenance in mosquitoes, bypasses the midgut challenges faced by arboviruses, making the NSm protein unnecessary.</p><p id="Par30">Although there is a strong correlation between the presence of an NSm protein and arbo-bunyaviruses transmitted by insects, this correlation does not strictly extend to tick-borne bunyaviruses, <italic>e.g</italic>., <italic>Bandavirus</italic> and <italic>Banyangvirus</italic> genera. One plausible reason may be that these tick-borne viruses do not have to overcome similar midgut barriers in their tick hosts. The lack of comprehensive knowledge about how bunyaviruses infect and disseminate in ticks in vivo complicates the formulation of data-driven hypotheses to explain why insect-borne bunyaviruses evolved to possess NSm while some tick-borne bunyaviruses did not. However, several speculations can be proposed. For instance, tick-borne bunyaviruses may not require cell-to-cell spread in the tick gut for propagation and dissemination. Interestingly, while hematophagous insects digest blood in their gut lumen, in ticks, blood digestion occurs intracellularly. This intracellular absorption of blood - and thus virus particles - into gut cells could lead to a higher number of cells being initially infected, resulting in a productive gut infection without the need for viral cell-to-cell spread. Additionally, biological differences such as the prolonged tick blood-feeding process and significant, long-lasting gut distension may favour passive viral escape - prolonged BL &#x0201c;leakiness&#x0201d; - and explain why tick-borne viruses can disseminate without NSm.</p><p id="Par31">Since the role of NSm in cell-to-cell spread seems to be conserved across bunyavirus families, it would be interesting in a future study to test for complementation of BUN-&#x00394;NSm cell-to-cell spread using heterologous NSm proteins. Our protein sequence homology and phylogenetic analyses revealed that the presence of NSm in arbo-bunyaviruses is likely the result of independent ancestral acquisition of different genes, all presently called NSm, by the different virus families. Therefore, trans expression may work between viruses of the <italic>Peribunyaviridae</italic> family but may not work between bunyavirus families. Since different proteins can be involved in a same cell-to-cell spread mechanism and different cell-to-cell spread mechanisms exist<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>, a lack of rescue would not exclude that those different independently acquired genes still exert a similar function in cell-to-cell spread. Additional studies will be required to validate a conserved role of NSm in cell-to-cell spread after oral transmission, to characterise the exact cell-to-cell spread mechanism, and to understand why some tick-borne bunyaviruses do not encode NSm.</p><p id="Par32">Our findings fill a gap in our understanding of how some bunyaviruses evolved to be transmitted by blood sucking insects.
