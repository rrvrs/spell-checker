Despite substantial advancements in vaccine development, the continuous emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants, the variable immunogenicity of vaccines across different populations, and the rise of anti-vaccination movements have perpetuated the pandemic's burden. As of 2024, the pandemic has caused millions of deaths worldwide, with significant disparities in morbidity and mortality observed across regions. Understanding the disease's clinical course and identifying risk factors for severe outcomes remain paramount to improving patient management and effectively allocating healthcare resources.</p><p>One of the most critical aspects of COVID-19 care is predicting patient outcomes, particularly mortality, to guide clinical decisions and resource allocation. Several prognostic scores have been developed to estimate COVID-19 mortality. Among these, the 4C&#x000a0;(Coronavirus Clinical Characterisation Consortium) Mortality Score, developed in the United Kingdom, has demonstrated superior predictive accuracy in various settings [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. A recent meta-analysis involving 46,914 patients from multiple countries found that the 4C Mortality Score had the highest pooled discrimination for predicting mortality [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Similarly, a systematic review evaluating 1,522 studies and 109 prognostic scores highlighted the 4C Mortality Score as having the largest cohorts and the highest accuracy for mortality prediction [<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Despite these findings, the performance of prognostic scores is highly dependent on the population to which they are applied [<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Factors such as age distribution, prevalence of comorbidities, and healthcare system characteristics can significantly influence the accuracy and reliability of these scores. For instance, teaching hospitals in Brazil typically manage a higher proportion of elderly patients and those with multiple comorbidities compared to general hospitals, potentially impacting the applicability of the 4C Mortality Score in this context.</p><p>This study aims to address the gap in the literature by evaluating the accuracy of the 4C Mortality Score in predicting in-hospital mortality among COVID-19 patients admitted to a university teaching hospital in Brazil. By examining this score's performance in a high-risk population, we aim to provide evidence for its utility in similar healthcare settings, ultimately contributing to improved patient management during the ongoing pandemic.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>The study was observational, longitudinal, and retrospective. It was conducted in a 180-bed teaching university hospital in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The study included all COVID-19 patients aged 18 or older who were admitted and diagnosed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing of respiratory secretions and/or nasal specimens. Patients discharged in less than 24 hours after admission were excluded. This study was approved by the local ethics committee (approval number: CAAE 48321021.0.0000.5243) and was conducted during the first wave of COVID-19, from March to December 2020. We employed a convenience sampling method, including all eligible patients admitted during the study period.</p><p>Clinical, laboratory, and radiologic parameters were collected from the medical records from admission until death or discharge: hemoglobin, leukocytes, platelets, serum urea, creatinine, C-reactive protein (CRP), and D-dimer. The 4C Mortality Score was calculated considering age, sex, Charlson index, respiratory rate, peripheral oxygen saturation (room air), Glasgow Coma Scale, serum urea, and CRP level. The 4C Mortality Score is calculated based on these eight variables, each assigned a weighted score depending on its value or category (Appendix). The total score can range from 0 to 21 points, with higher scores indicating a greater risk of in-hospital mortality. Patients are stratified into four risk categories based on their total score: low risk (0-3 points, &#x0003c;2% mortality), intermediate risk (4-8 points, ~9% mortality), high risk (9-14 points, ~32% mortality), and very high risk (15-21 points, ~62% mortality), providing a clear framework to predict in-hospital mortality for COVID-19 patients [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The 4C Mortality Score is a risk stratification tool produced by the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium (ISARIC) 4C consortium [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. It is designed for use by clinicians, requiring only parameters commonly available at hospital presentation. While based on a UK cohort of patients, the score should not be adopted for routine clinical use in other settings until it has been appropriately validated.</p><p>Additionally, comorbidities, the need for mechanical ventilation, and the use of vasopressors were evaluated, and clinician-defined obesity was established as a comorbidity. Lung involvement in computed tomography (CT) was defined as severe when more than 51% of the pulmonary parenchyma was affected. The primary outcome was mortality, according to the 4C score reference.</p><p>The Shapiro-Wilk test was used to evaluate the distribution of data. Results are presented as the median and interquartile range for continuous variables and chi-square statistics for categorical variables. Participants were divided into two groups: discharged and deceased cases. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed to identify independent predictors for in-hospital mortality. Explanatory variables included in the multivariate Cox regression were those with a descriptive level lower than 0.20 (p &#x0003c; 0.20) in the bivariate analysis. The variable selection process was stepwise forward, at a significance level of 5%. The accuracy of the 4C Mortality Score was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC). Microsoft Excel&#x000a0;(Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, Washington) was used for the database, and R software (v.4.1.3, R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) was employed for statistical analysis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We included 208 patients admitted with COVID-19, of whom 111 (53%) were male, with a median age of 63 years.

Our study evaluated a simple and practical score, which can be calculated quickly upon admission with minimal laboratory resources and clinical information. Overall, the score performed well, even without tomography results, which may facilitate its application in hospitals and clinics without such technology.</p><p>Today, COVID-19 still poses a serious threat to public health, with millions of cases reported each year. The percentage of the population that has been vaccinated remains lower than desired. Consequently, many patients continue to present with severe forms of the disease, with clinical evolution resembling that observed during the first wave [<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. For this reason, it is important to have simple and validated tools to identify patients who may develop complications and require more intensive care.</p><p>Many scientists have evaluated mortality rates and risk factors in COVID-19 [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Known predictors of mortality among inpatients include age, obesity, cardiovascular disease, malignancy, inflammatory markers, and pulmonary involvement in CT. Our study demonstrated that hemoglobin levels and hemodynamic conditions are also significant factors to consider when estimating prognosis.</p><p>The 4C Mortality Score has been validated in different populations worldwide, with most studies showing good discrimination (AUC-ROC from 0.70 to 0.80) [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. One study also validated the score for newer COVID-19 variants, such as Omicron [<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Two previous studies validated the score in Brazil with similar findings, one of which was conducted in a teaching hospital [<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Two recent studies reported better accuracy for the 4C Mortality Score, consistent with our findings [<xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. This may be because our population included more severe cases of COVID-19. Additionally, our patients were older and had a higher incidence of cardiovascular disease and cancer.</p><p>Another possibility is that the teaching hospital where the aforementioned study was conducted operates under an &#x0201c;open doors&#x0201d; emergency policy [<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Any patient arriving at the hospital can be treated in the emergency room and admitted if necessary. By contrast, our hospital does not offer an "open doors" emergency service. Patient admission is regulated, with sicker patients transferred from other hospitals and emergency services. Additionally, patients with cardiovascular disease and malignancy in our metropolitan area are often referred to our hospital. These factors may account for the differences in populations and results observed in our studies.</p><p>Our study has some limitations. The sample size is relatively small, and data were collected from a single institution. However, it is important to note that our hospital serves as a reference for a large metropolitan area with 2 million inhabitants, and we were able to collect data from all patients admitted during the study period. Additionally, our population differs from those in studies conducted at other centers, as our prevalence of cardiovascular disease and malignancy is higher.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study evaluated the accuracy of the 4C Mortality Score in predicting outcomes among patients admitted with COVID-19 at a university teaching hospital. The 4C Mortality Score demonstrated excellent discriminatory ability in a population characterized by a higher prevalence of cardiovascular disease and malignancy. These findings underscore the potential utility of the 4C Mortality Score and support the need for future multicenter studies in comparable populations.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank Centro Integrado de Tradu&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o e Escrita (CITE/Universidade Federal Fluminense) for assistance with English language translation and developmental editing.</p></ack><fn-group content-type="conflict"><title>Disclosures</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Human subjects:</bold> Consent for treatment and open access publication was obtained or waived by all participants in this study.
