</self-uri><abstract><p>The purpose of this study was to analyze differences in muscle activation of the right upper limb and part of the trunk and differences in stroke performance of forehand receiving in male tennis players of different levels of performance at different serve speeds. Thirty male tennis players (no difference in age, height, weight) were divided into senior (AG, n=15) and intermediate (IG, n=15) groups to perform 6 forehands receive tests at 2 serve speeds: low-speed serve (130-140km/h), high-speed serve (160-170km/h). Muscle activity from the right of biceps brachii (BB), triceps brachii (TB), brachioradialis (BC), deltoid (DT), trapezius (TP), pectoralis major (PM), obliquus externus abdominis (OEA) and latissimus dorsi (LD) were recorded using surface electromyography during the concentric phase of the lift and expressed as a percentage of each muscle&#x02019;s maximal activity, recorded during a maximal isometric contraction. Returned speed and placement were recorded using a high-speed camera. The results showed that the AG had significantly lower muscle activity (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) in the backswing, impart, follow-through phases of the receive and more consistent dominant muscles in all phases, while the opposite was true for the IG. At both serve speeds, AG had significantly faster ball speeds (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) and higher placement scores (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) compared to IG. It is important to develop the athlete&#x02019;s receive action at lower muscle activation and higher joint kinetic energy, which may be an important way to improve receive performance in a short period.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The author(s) received no specific funding for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="2"/><table-count count="5"/><page-count count="12"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>This work was funded by Shanghai Key Lab of Human Performance (Shanghai University of Sport) (NO. 11DZ2261100 to ZYC).

With speeds over 200km/h and multiple serve trajectories, the serve-return player must react as quickly as possible. The effectiveness of the serve is directly dependent on the receiver&#x02019;s return technique. On hard courts, where serves are faster and more difficult to return [<xref rid="pone.0323646.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323646.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], however, since hard courts (about 40%) return more than red clay (about 30%) [<xref rid="pone.0323646.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], understanding its muscle activation properties can help to improve the performance of tennis players&#x02019; serve-receive returns.</p><p>The forehand serve-return is a complete power chain movement, Force production in tennis and other sports typically involves the transfer of ground reaction forces through the lower extremities and trunk to the upper extremities [<xref rid="pone.0323646.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], with the arm and wrist being the end links that accomplish the transfer of power [<xref rid="pone.0323646.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323646.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The mechanics of the forehand receive are similar to the forehand groundstroke, but due to the faster speed of the serve, the serve-returners required the stroke to be completed in a shorter period and the return speed is affected by the speed of the serve. Therefore, the receiving movement has some differences from the forehand groundstroke movement.</p><p>There are differences in muscle activation characteristics of athletes under different stroke conditions, for example: grip, stroke path, ball spin, and stroke technique [<xref rid="pone.0323646.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0323646.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In tennis strokes, trunk and upper limb muscle activation follow a proximal to distal progression, and studies have shown that the order of muscle activation is not related to the player&#x02019;s age or skill level. Rogowski concluded that with increasing racket mass, trunk and upper limb muscle temporal activation and deactivation do not change [<xref rid="pone.0323646.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323646.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], suggesting that the order of muscle activation in forehand stroke and racket weight are not the main factors affecting stroke effectiveness. In addition, a study analyzing each phase of the forehand stroke found that the activation levels of the major muscle groups of the shoulder and upper limb were lower during the backswing phase compared to the high level of activation during the stroke phase and the medium level of activation during the follow-through phase [<xref rid="pone.0323646.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323646.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. By analyzing the electromyographic activation characteristics of the receiving technique, it was possible to analyze the differences in the level of muscle activation during the different stroke phases.</p><p>In addition, proper receive movements are beneficial in preventing muscle injuries, and Aben et al. point out that most injuries in tennis players are caused by single-segment overuse, which leads to the loading of the leading muscle groups, and long-term training produces pathologic changes [<xref rid="pone.0323646.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In tennis, the elbow works as a connector in the kinetic chain, receiving energy and transmitting it to distant segments [<xref rid="pone.0323646.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. At different serve speeds, the receiving player&#x02019;s arm swings at different speeds, generating different pressures, the ability of the elbow and wrist joints to transmit and adjust forces may change, and the arm muscles may take on specific activity characteristics [<xref rid="pone.0323646.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Increasing the speed of movement also leads to premature activation of the active and antagonist muscles of the upper limb [<xref rid="pone.0323646.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323646.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Some studies have shown that elbow injuries are in the top three of tennis players&#x02019; injuries [<xref rid="pone.0323646.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], and one of the most commonly accepted theories about the elbow in tennis players is based on the stiffness of the skeletal muscle units and their repetitive overuse in tennis strokes. To date, there is no consensus on the leading etiology of elbow tendinopathy, although it has been suggested that it is multifactorial [<xref rid="pone.0323646.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and not gender-specific [<xref rid="pone.0323646.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>The forehand receive technique can be divided into various types of ways according to the compulsion degree of the receiving player from small to large, and the smash serve is the technique with a high use rate for the player to break the opponent&#x02019;s offense state [<xref rid="pone.0323646.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323646.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], the effectiveness of the service depends on how well the serve-return is done, therefore, the forehand smash receive was selected as the test technique in this study, excluding volley, slice. Based on the statistics of first and second-serve speeds of elite athletes, we set the slow-serve to 130&#x02013;140km/h, and the high-serve to 160&#x02013;170km/h [<xref rid="pone.0323646.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323646.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. A study was conducted on the statistics of serve placement of high-level tennis players who issued ACEs in matches [<xref rid="pone.0323646.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], this study found that serve placement closer to the sideline on the serving side was more conducive to creating an advantage on the next shot and executing the technical play, and it was found that the serve placement of high-level players was highly concentrated in T-type (near the centerline of the serve) or wide-type (near the singles sideline of the serve area). When serving placement closer to the sideline, the receiver is more adept at using a forehand receive to enhance the speed and return placement. The receivers were more likely to use forehand techniques to receive wide-type serves to improve the speed and landing of the return [<xref rid="pone.0323646.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323646.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The International Tennis Federation (ITF) and the State General Administration of Sport of China have developed the Provisional Determination of Sport Skill Levels [<xref rid="pone.0323646.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], the first serve placement is used as an indicator of the quality of the serve, and the highest score is achieved when the first placement is within 1m<sup>2</sup> of the effective area. Therefore, in this study, the serve placement was set as wide-type serves (<xref rid="pone.0323646.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). Understanding the similarities and differences in the muscle activation characteristics of forehand smashes received in high-level tennis players at different serve speeds is beneficial for improving the receive performance of the tennis player.</p><fig position="float" id="pone.0323646.g001"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0323646.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Serve-return Motion Capture setup diagram.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0323646.g001" position="float"/></fig><p>Currently, there is no EMG data on the muscle activation of the forehand serve using the forehand smash serve technique in athletes of different skill levels.

The Delsys-16 EMG system (Delsys Inc., Natick, MA, USA) was employed to collect the electromyographic data of participants forehand receive movement. The frequency was set at 2000 Hz for sampling. The muscle activation signals of the biceps brachii (BB), triceps brachii (TB), brachioradialis (BC), deltoid (DT), trapezius (TP), pectoralis major (PM), obliquus externus abdominis (OEA) and latissimus dorsi (LD) were recorded in both upper extremities.</p><p>The current serve machine cannot achieve the speed, ball placement, and spin of the player&#x02019;s serve. Therefore, in this study, we chose the player with the highest level among the participants to serve. To ensure the accuracy of serving speed and placement. Before the formal experiment, we trained the server several times in advance and used high-speed cameras to test the speed of each ball to improve the accuracy of the serve. In the formal experiment, we regarded the data that the serve speed meets the requirements as valid data, otherwise excluded. Therefore, two serve speeds can be minimally guaranteed, and it is reasonable to compare the differences in the players&#x02019; serve-receiving movements at the two serve speeds while ensuring that the serving conditions are consistent. The low-speed balls are kept between 130&#x02013;140km/h and high-speed balls are kept between 160&#x02013;170km/h. A wide-type placement field of 1m<sup>2</sup> in the right outer corner of the right serve was selected as the test area for this study (<xref rid="pone.0323646.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). A 1m bright-colored marking line is set parallel to the direction of motion of the serve, and a high-speed camera is placed perpendicular to the 1m marking line to record the serve&#x02019;s motion at 1000Hz.</p><p>The subject stood to receive a serve in the right zone of the tennis court. Participants use a customary grip and a forehand receive technique that requires participants to stroke the ball in a straight line to the same side of the court with maximum effort. A 1m brightly colored marker line was set up parallel to the direction of movement of the return and a high-speed camera was set up perpendicular to the 1m marker line to record the return&#x02019;s movement at 1000Hz to capture the speed and placement of the returned ball (<xref rid="pone.0323646.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>).</p><p>The racket movement process was recorded using a Casio (High-speed camera, Japan, 1000fps), and racket head speed was calculated using the Kinovea program. Participants all used the same racket (grip 41/4 inches and mass 300&#x02009;g; Pure Drive; Babolat Play, France) with a reflective marker attached to the tip to record racket kinematics. The formal experiment was initiated after participants were given time to familiarize themselves with the process and the environment, particularly the racket that was similar in mass and grip size to that typically used. Each athlete is tested with the new ODEA-passion (Zhejiang, China) ball.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Procedure</title><p>Participants avoided any strenuous exercise for 24 hours before the study. Players performed a 10-minute slow running session on the field wearing athletic clothing and tennis shoes. Jogging was followed by approximately 5 minutes of static stretching activities and 10 minutes of forehand stroke practice to ensure that each participant could perform to their best potential during the experiment.</p><p>In preparation for the experiment, the skin of the participants&#x02019; upper extremities was cleaned with alcohol before EMG electrodes were attached using sports foam and sticky tape. All of the sensor muscle placements were based on procedures outlined in Criswell [<xref rid="pone.0323646.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><p>For electromyographic data collection, the participant stood to receive a serve in the right zone of the tennis court. <xref rid="pone.0323646.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref> shows serve placement zones and return routes. Data were considered valid if both of the following conditions were met: 1) the serve ball speed was within the low/high-speed range and the placement was in bounds,2) the return direction was straight and the landing point was in bounds. Participants were tested with a low-speed serve followed by a high-speed serve, with three valid data collected at each serve speed and a 30-second rest period for each test, as individual fatigue could cause inaccuracies in data collection. We found that all participants used a closed stance for the received by observing the test video. The data collected only referred to the right of the trunk and arm.

AG&#x02019;s racket speed decreased under the fast serve, comparing the IG, AG&#x02019;s return speed was faster and the return landing point was closer to the baseline. At the same time, as the serve speed increased, AG&#x02019;s return speed and placement scoring tended to increase, while IG&#x02019;s return speed and landing point tended to decrease, and increasing the swing speed affected the speed of the ball. However, AG showed a decrease in racket speed and an increase in return speed at high serve speeds, and there was no significant difference in the time taken for the three-movement phases of the forehand return technique between the two groups of participants, suggesting that the rate of muscle activation may have an effect on the effectiveness of stroke during the stroke.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="pone.0323646.t002"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0323646.t002</object-id><label>Table 2</label><caption><title>Kinematic parameters of the racket tip.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="pone.0323646.t002" id="pone.0323646.t002g" position="float"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="3" colspan="1">Kinematics of the racket tip</th><th align="left" rowspan="3" colspan="1">Group</th><th align="left" colspan="5" rowspan="1">Lower-serve (Mean &#x000b1;SD)</th><th align="left" colspan="5" rowspan="1">Higher-serve (Mean &#x000b1;SD)</th></tr><tr><th align="left" rowspan="2" colspan="1">Variable</th><th align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Bias-corrected 95%CI</th><th align="left" rowspan="2" colspan="1">

serve speeds. At low serve speeds, AG had significantly lower normalized activation of TB, BC, DT, TP, OEA, and LD during the stroke phase compared to IG. At high serve speeds, the normalized activation of all eight muscles was lower in the stroke phase in AG than in IG, and TP and PM had more involvement in the stroke phase in AG at both serve speeds, whereas BC and TP had more involvement in IG at low serve speeds, and BC and PM had more involvement in IG at high serve speeds. The above results showed that AG&#x02019;s TP and PM are more involved during the stroke phase, and other muscles kept lower involvement, while the main force-generating muscle groups in IG were not constant, and the activation level of each muscle group tended to be the same.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="pone.0323646.t004"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0323646.t004</object-id><label>Table 4</label><caption><title>Normalized activation of right upper arm and trunk muscles in forehand receives at impact (% MVC).</title></caption><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="pone.0323646.t004" id="pone.0323646.t004g" position="float"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="3" colspan="1">Muscle</th><th align="left" rowspan="3" colspan="1">Group</th><th align="left" colspan="5" rowspan="1">Lower-serve receive</th><th align="left" colspan="5" rowspan="1">Higher-serve receive</th></tr><tr><th align="left" rowspan="2" colspan="1">Variable</th><th align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Bias-corrected 95%CI</th><th align="left" rowspan="2" colspan="1">

strategies and stroke performance of the right upper arm and trunk muscles of high-level and intermediate athletes using a forehand receive maneuver at two serve speeds. It was found that high-level athletes had better stroke performance (faster return speeds and higher return scores) and that their return speeds and placement scores tended to increase with faster serve speeds, whereas intermediate athletes showed a decreasing trend. In terms of muscle activation, high-level athletes showed low activation rates for all muscle groups and clear dominant muscles in all phases compared to intermediate-level athletes. Differences in muscle utilization between the two groups of athletes and the effect of the above differences on stroke performance are emphasized.</p><p>During the Backswing phase, the muscle activity characteristics of AG and IG at both serve speeds were more similar and in agreement with the results of the Abuwarda study [<xref rid="pone.0323646.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. It was observed that DT (10.38, 18.68%) and TP (13.14, 18.28%) of both groups of athletes showed higher muscle activity since the deltoid muscle produces the shoulder toward the spine by stretching and horizontal extension. Force of backward flexion, TP is responsible for bringing the scapula toward the spine, and the upper arm performs a backward flexion movement, indicating that, the leading movement is mainly accomplished by turning the shoulder and backward extension of the upper arm during the leading phase [<xref rid="pone.0323646.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Comparing the differences in muscle activity between the two groups of athletes, the overall muscle activity of the AG was low compared to the IG, with significant differences in BC, DT, and LD activity between the two groups. BC was responsible for the flexion and extension of the elbow joint, producing the force of forearm adduction and abduction. More consistent with the DT and TP roles, the LD was responsible for flexion and extension of the shoulder joint to accomplish the backswing of the upper arm. Based on the above results, it can be seen that in the Backswing phase, both groups of athletes, led through shoulder rotation and rapid backward extension of the upper arm to complete the backswing phase, while the IG showed more forearm abduction movements, which may increase the length of the backswing phase, affecting the preparation of the next phase of the movement.</p><p>During the Impact phase, there were differences in muscle activity characteristics between the two groups of athletes, with AG&#x02019;s muscle activities being more similar at both serve speeds, whereas IG&#x02019;s muscle activities were unstable at both serve speeds. The activity of each muscle was significantly lower in AG compared to IG. The highest TP (32.16, 32.27%) and PM (32.30, 31.22%) activity was observed for AG at both serve speeds and there was no difference in the amount of activity, with both TP and PM generating the force of shoulder forward flexion [<xref rid="pone.0323646.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. It shows that AG accomplishes forward stroke with TP and PM of the trunk as the dominant muscles. The muscle activity characteristics of IG are different from AG. It is observed that IG has the highest activity of BC (46.7%) and TP (47.31%) at low serve speed. When the incoming ball speed becomes faster, IG has the highest activity of BC (50.64%) and PM (54.36%). Both TP and PM generate forces of forward shoulder flexion, while BC is responsible for elbow flexion and extension and generates forces of forearm pronation, suggesting that the IG has more forearm action than the AG when striking the ball forward. More forearm action is likely to maintain wrist stability, which retains the stroke characteristics of a forehand groundstroke [<xref rid="pone.0323646.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The tennis forehand stroke is a bottom-up whipping action, with trunk force and acceleration of the upper limbs in all segments, which acts on the racket through the wrist joints [<xref rid="pone.0323646.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. This is consistent with our findings that the AG has a faster racket head speed. The IG increases the amount of forearm activity in the process, which interrupts the kinetic energy transmitted by the trunk and acts on the racket with reduced speed so that the IG return speed is lower as the speed of the serve increases. Differences in the activation of trunk flexors and extensors can appear as a tennis-specific power imbalance [<xref rid="pone.0323646.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Roetert believes that High-level tennis players have above-average trunk extensor strength [<xref rid="pone.0323646.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Consistently, AG has higher activation of the OEA at both serve speeds, suggesting that high-level tennis players are more adept at generating power through the trunk. In contrast, the faster the AG returns the ball with trunk power to achieve acceleration of the upper limbs. These results provide more information about muscle activation around the shoulder during the stroke phase, which may benefit researchers, coaches, and tennis players in preventing shoulder injuries and improving stroke performance.</p><p>During the Follow-through phase, the muscle activity levels of the two groups of athletes were characterized more similarly. It can be observed that DT (8.09, 12.51%) and TP (10.50, 13.9%) had greater activity in AG and IG at low high-speed serves, and DT (7.77, 11.69%) and TP (10.22, 12.30%) had greater activity in AG and IG at high-speed serves. The follow-through motion is generated by the inertia after a quick stroke, and the involvement of DT and TP is to stabilize the motion during the follow-through. Compared to the IG, the BC activity of the AG was significantly lower in the follow-through phase of the swing at both serve speeds, with the BC being responsible for elbow flexion and extension [<xref rid="pone.0323646.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], and the BC showed lower activity, suggesting that there was less pronation of the forearm in the AG.</p><p>There are some limitations in this study. First, the spin speed of the return was not tested in the test, although the focus of the study was on the EMG changes of the athletes&#x02019; receive movements under different serving conditions, the combination of the spin speed can be more objectively evaluated on the return; second, only male athletes were selected as the test subjects in the test, and due to the gender difference there will be the difference of strength and other physical conditions, the significant difference between the male and female athletes&#x02019; receive performances under the same serving conditions may be more than technical differences, which may cause ambiguous conclusions, and the receive performance of female athletes will be further investigated in future studies. Thirdly, high-speed serves lead to faster muscle fatigue, which in turn affects activation patterns or athletic performance. Due to the 3-minute interval between each set of serve tests, the fatigue effect was not tested in the present study, and subsequent studies should consider the effect of fatigue mechanisms on serves. Fourth, only the athlete&#x02019;s right trunk and arm muscles were selected for this study, muscle activation of the left upper limb and part of the trunk were excluded from the present analysis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec014"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study investigated the differences in activation of right trunk and upper limb muscle groups during forehand receive at two serve speeds in athletes of different levels. We found that, compared to IG, AG has a clear dominant muscle group at each stage, along with higher muscle group activation and significantly lower activation of other muscle groups. TP plays an important role in the backswing phase. TP and PM are the leading force-generating muscles in the stroke phase, while the activation of other muscles should be reduced. During the follow-through phase of the swing, DT and TP are the leading muscles in keeping the follow-through movement stable. Therefore, when the serve speed becomes faster, players keep their muscle activation lower before the stroke, facilitating smoother force transmission while preventing injuries. In the future, lower limb muscle groups, left side muscle groups, female participants, and ball rotation should be considered to fully explore the biomechanical characteristics of tennis forehand receive the technique.</p></sec><sec id="sec015" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material id="pone.0323646.s001" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>Original data.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0323646.s001.xlsx"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We want to thank all the participants and their coaches for their support in this study.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0323646.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Gillet</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Leroy</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Thouvarecq</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Stein</surname><given-names>J-F</given-names></name>. <article-title>A notational analysis of elite tennis serve and serve-return strategies on slow surface</article-title>. <source>J Strength Cond Res</source>. <year>2009</year>;<volume>23</volume>(<issue>2</issue>):<fpage>532</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>9</lpage>. <comment>doi: </comment><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1519/JSC.0b013e31818efe29</pub-id>

Lines 15-17: The abbreviations (AG, IG) are not explicitly stated in the body of the article and are recommended to be stated when they first appear. For example, "30 male tennis players (no difference in age, height, and weight) were divided into senior (AG, n=15) and intermediate (IG, n=15) groups......"</p><p>2. Lines 24-25: The "three phases" do not specify which phases (e.g. before, during, and after the shot) and it is recommended to add a clear definition.</p><p>Introduction:</p><p>1. Line 32: The current literature review on muscle activation research is relatively general, citing a wide range of studies (e.g., grip, path, rotation, etc.), and the authors can focus on the blank spots in the study of muscle activation in the return ball.</p><p>2. Lines 62-63: Errors in the text should be corrected promptly to ensure that all references are linked accurately.</p><p>Methods:</p><p>1. Lines 91-92: Specific information for statistical power analyses (e.g., effect size) can be added to demonstrate the adequacy of the sample size.</p><p>2. Lines 127-129: Although the options for wide-court zones and T-shaped/wide-court serves are mentioned, the rationale is brief. The author can provide more background information on how these settings simulate real-world match scenarios.</p><p>Lines 159-163: The EMG signal data processing needs to provide more details on the muscle activation solution is taken as a second-order differential equation? To provide more effective evidence, the authors may consider referring to the following relevant studies: Accurately and effectively predict the ACL force: Utilizing biomechanical landing pattern before and after-fatigue (<ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmpb.2023.107761);" ext-link-type="uri">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmpb.2023.107761);</ext-link> Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system model driven by the non-negative matrix factorization-extracted muscle synergy patterns to estimate lower limb joint movements (<ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmpb.2023.107848)" ext-link-type="uri">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmpb.2023.107848</ext-link>)</p><p>Results:</p><p>1. Lines 218-221: "TP and PM are the main muscle groups, and these are part of the discussion. The results section should be dominated by data presentations and avoid speculative or explanatory language.</p><p>Discussion:</p><p>1. Line 252: Check and fix reference errors.</p><p>2. Lines 310-311: The high-speed serve was studied to lead to faster muscle fatigue, which in turn affected activation patterns or athletic performance. If fatigue effects are not tested, their possible effects should be mentioned in the limitations.</p><p>Conclusion:</p><p>1. In the conclusion section, the practical application of the research and the future research direction can be explained more clearly.</p><p>Reviewer #2:&#x000a0;Dear Authors,</p><p>the Authors did a good job in writing a readable manuscript. This paper could be considered qualified to be published on &#x0201c;PlosOne&#x0201d; if the authors apply the modifications requested, "Major issues" are recommended. It is the reason why "Major revision" is my personal choice. I would be happy to review a revised version of this manuscript.</p><p>The aim of the submitted manuscript was to analyze differences in muscle activation of the right upper limb and part of the trunk and differences in stroke performance of forehand serve receiving in male tennis players of different levels of performance at different speed.</p><p>This paper could be considered qualified to be published if the authors apply the modifications requested.</p><p>While it is a very interesting topic, some suggestions for improving the paper are provided below:</p><p>&#x02022; The basic descriptive level adopted by author(s) does not seem compatible with interests of both researchers' biomechanical conceptual challenges and coaches' practical applications to training. The main concern refers to the weak/absent theoretical background; there is no perceivable research question or rationale for the study presented to readers.</p><p>Author(s) do not consider any specific difficulties or other aspects of performing these different types of tennis techniques to minimally justify the comparison; on the other hand, the use of the descriptive knowledge obtained from the observed differences was not discussed in terms of applications for athletes and coaches.</p><p>In short, the rationale for the study is unclear. The manuscript is limited to a biomechanical laboratory exercise to spatially and temporally describe the participants' movement.</p><p>&#x02022; It is important to include more information about the balls. It is not possible to totally exclude these information from the paper (brand, company, model, etc).</p><p>&#x02022; I think much of the Procedure section needs to be rewritten to better describe procedures. I would suggest dividing into subchapters (Examples: EMG, warm-up, set-up, etc.)</p><p>&#x02022; The following variables can&#x02019;t be totally excluded from the paper: number of repetitions, serve errors, serves in, let, etc.</p><p>&#x02022; Figure 1 shows the Serve-return Motion Capture setup diagram. Dimension/position of Serve placement area and dimension/position of the Serve placement area have to be justified by Authors. References about this setup need to be included to support this methodology.</p><p>&#x02022; Line 124. There is a typing error (Table tennis?)</p><p>&#x02022; Limitations: muscle activation of the left upper limb and part of the trunk were excluded from the present analysis</p><p>Finally, this manuscript could be considered qualified to be published if the authors apply the previous modifications, therefore &#x0201c;Major revision&#x0201d; is recommended.</p><p>**********</p><p>6.

Upon review, I noticed that the suggested references and additional review points have not been fully addressed. To ensure a more comprehensive discussion and strengthen the manuscript&#x02019;s contribution, I encourage you to carefully incorporate the recommended references and revisions. Addressing these points will improve the clarity and rigor of your study.</p><p>Please let me know if any clarification is needed. Looking forward to your updated submission.</p><p>Reviewer #3:&#x000a0;The study has significant flaws in experimental design, data collection, and analysis, compromising its validity and reliability. Using a manual serve instead of standardized equipment introduces subjectivity and reduces reproducibility. The reliance on a single high-speed camera limits accurate three-dimensional kinematic analysis, with no calibration or error analysis reported. EMG data processing lacks transparency, with incomplete details on noise filtering, baseline correction, and temporal characterization, resulting in a limited understanding of muscle synergy. Additionally, the absence of effect sizes and confidence intervals weakens the statistical analysis. To enhance scientific rigor, the authors should adopt standardized equipment, improve data collection methods, and ensure proper statistical reporting.</p><p>**********</p><p>7.
