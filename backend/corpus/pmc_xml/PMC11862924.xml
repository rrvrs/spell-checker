m<sup>6</sup>A plays a multifunctional role in physiological and
pathological processes, regulating all aspects of RNA metabolism and
function, including RNA splicing, translation, transportation, and
degradation. Accumulating evidence suggests that the YT521-B homology
domain family 2 (YTHDF2), one of the m<sup>6</sup>A &#x0201c;readers,&#x0201d;
is associated with various biological processes in cancers and noncancerous
disorders, impacting migration, invasion, metastasis, proliferation,
apoptosis, and cell cycle. Here, we describe our work in the identification
of a series of functionalized pyrazoles, such as CK-75, as new YTHDF2
inhibitors, which potentially bind to a small hydrophobic pocket on
the YTH domain. Cellular evaluations revealed that the small-molecule
YTHDF2 inhibitors induced cell cycle arrest, induced apoptosis, and
significantly inhibited the cell viability of cancer cells. Furthermore,
we evaluated the transcriptome-wide change in the global RNA-binding
protein and RNA-binding patterns of CK-75 via an enhanced cross-linking
and immunoprecipitation assay. Our work demonstrated the feasibility
of targeting the YTH domain of YTHDF2 with small molecules. The phenylpyrazoles
studied in this work provided a lead structure for the further development
of small molecules targeting YTHDF2 for both biological and therapeutic
applications.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>RNA m<sup>6</sup>A modification</kwd><kwd>RNA-binding

fields for biomedical research and drug discovery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref></sup> Among
the more than 150 chemical modifications identified on RNAs,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref></sup> the methylation on the <italic>N</italic>6 position
of adenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A) is the most abundant RNA modification
in mRNAs and long noncoding RNAs in eukaryotic cells. The m<sup>6</sup>A modification regulates the stability and translation efficiency
of mRNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref></sup> and is dynamically regulated by
the interplay among the m<sup>6</sup>A methyltransferases (writers,
such as METTL3 and METTL16),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref></sup> the demethylases
(erasers, such as FTO and ALKBH5),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref></sup> and
the recognition by the m<sup>6</sup>A-binding proteins (readers, such
as YTH domain-family proteins including YTHDF1&#x02013;3, YTHDC1, and
YTHDC2).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></sup> The reader proteins mediate multiple
effects on gene expression via selective binding to m<sup>6</sup>A
directly or indirectly, although the exact binding mechanism is unclear.
YTHDF2 is one of the first identified m<sup>6</sup>A reader proteins
and has been mainly studied for its function in affecting mRNA stability
(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>A).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></sup> The C-terminal YTH domain of YTHDF2 recognizes
and binds to m<sup>6</sup>A-modified mRNA substrates. The N-terminal
domain accelerates the degradation of target mRNAs via the recruitment
of other protein components.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></sup> YTHDF1 is
often associated with the promotion of translation of m<sup>6</sup>A-modified mRNAs in the cytoplasm. YTHDF1 and YTHDF3 are described
to synergistically accelerate the translation and decay of m<sup>6</sup>A-containing mRNAs together with YTHDF2.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref></sup> The
reported crystal structures of YTHDF1 and YTHDF2 bound with m<sup>6</sup>A-containing RNA indicated the shared structural basis for
YTHDF proteins&#x02019; binding to m<sup>6</sup>A.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref></sup> Studies have shown that YTHDF2 recruits the complex of
CCR4-NOT deadenylase to initiate deadenylation and decay of m<sup>6</sup>A-containing RNAs by interacting with the superfamily homology
domain of CNOT1, the scaffold protein of the CCR4-NOT deadenylase
complex (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>A).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></sup> Accumulating evidence indicated the therapeutic
potential of targeting m<sup>6</sup>A RNA-binding and -modifying proteins

focused on the m<sup>6</sup>A demethylase FTO.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref></sup> Recent progress in the field includes the identification

tumor types, and

YTHDF2&#x02019;s involvement in &#x0201c;spliceosome&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;RNA

to trigger apoptosis in triple-negative breast cancer cells and tumors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref></sup> Despite the established association with cancers,
targeting YTHDF2 remains a challenging task with few reported chemotypes.
Except for a few YTHDF2-binding small fragments,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref></sup> the only available small-molecule examples inhibiting YTHDF2
are the covalent nonselective inhibitor ebselen against YTHDF1&#x02013;3,
DC-Y13&#x02013;27 that disrupted the m<sup>6</sup>A&#x02013;YTHDF2 binding
with moderate micromolar inhibitory potency, and a series of adenosine
analogues that inhibited the five YTH-domain containing proteins (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>C).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref></sup> Small molecules with varied biological performance and new chemotypes
are thus highly desired to elucidate the involved m<sup>6</sup>A recognizing
mechanism and validate the anticancer strategy of targeting YTHDF2.
Herein, we report our discovery pipeline of assay establishment, in-house
screening, and the downstream hit-derived structural modifications,
which lead to the identification of a series of new noncovalent phenylpyrazoles
(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>D) that bound
to the YTH domain of YTHDF2, disrupted the interaction between YTHDF2
and m<sup>6</sup>A RNA, affected cellular RNA methylation levels,
induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, and inhibited the proliferation
of K562 cells that expressed YTHDF2.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>Pyrazole
CK-23 as the Initial YTHDF2 Hit</title><p>To initiate
the discovery of small-molecule modulators targeting YTHDF2, we first

the FAM-unlabeled m<sup>6</sup>A RNA probe showing an IC<sub>50</sub> of &#x0223c;115 nM, while another RNA probe without m<sup>6</sup>A modification showed no inhibitory activity (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/jacsau.4c00754/suppl_file/au4c00754_si_001.pdf">Figure S1</ext-link>).

of &#x0223c;15,000 synthetic small molecules. Considering the limited
chemotypes that have been associated with YTHDF2-targeting and to
ensure that we will not overlook potentially weak inhibitors with
new chemotypes, we performed an initial screening at a single concentration
of 30 &#x003bc;M, followed by concentration-dependent validation and
exclusion of compounds that showed significant autofluorescence. The
resulting list of promising hits of different scaffolds, among which
was 3-(4-(2-hydroxybenzoyl)-1<italic>H</italic>-pyrazol-1-yl)benzoic

A collection of 36 structural analogues featuring the phenylpyrazole

compound CK-94, which incorporated the phenylpyrazole core scaffold
of our in-house hit and the 3-amino-2-cyano-3-oxoprop-1-en-1-yl moiety
from DC-Y13&#x02013;27, only showed moderate inhibition (&#x0003c;30% inhibition

Since the
windows were similar between the treated and untreated eCLIPs, this
may indicate that a higher potency is needed to observe significant

that the additional windows observed in the CK-75 eCLIP suggested
a gain of function of CK-75 on YTHDF2; However, further experiments
are needed to determine whether this is due to the impact of CK-75
treatment or the inherent variability in RNA binding and eCLIP.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The m<sup>6</sup>A RNA-binding protein YTHDF2
is one of the m<sup>6</sup>A effector proteins that plays important
roles in epitranscriptomic
regulations. Whereas targeting YTHDF2 with small molecules holds great
therapeutic potential, few reports and very limited chemotypes are
currently available. In this study, we identified a series of phenylpyrazoles
as new YTHDF2-targeting inhibitors binding with the YTH domain via
a discovery pipeline that started with an in-house screening. Based
on the initial phenylpyrazole hit CK-23, we evaluated a collection
of 37 synthesized structural analogues, among which we identified
CK-75 that concentration-dependently inhibited the formation of the
YTHDF2&#x02013;m<sup>6</sup>A RNA complex in vitro and may bind to
YTHDF2 in K562 cells, as shown in a cellular thermal shift assay.
In addition to YTHDF2 inhibition, CK-75 induced cell cycle changes
in K562 with increased arrest at the G0/G1 phase, induced apoptosis
and inhibited colony formation, and showed moderate inhibitory activity
against cell proliferation. One limitation in the current study lies
in the lack of specificity assessment in YTHDF2-deficient cells, which
would be important to directly attribute that the observed cellular
effects are consequences of targeting YTHDF2. Such YTHDF-depleted
control would facilitate a clear interpretation of the inhibitors&#x02019;
mechanism action. In an eCLIP assay evaluating the RBP and RNA-binding
patterns, CK-75 did not lead to significant changes in the global
RBP-binding pattern in K562 cells, which indicated that YTHDF2 inhibitors
with more potent inhibitory activity are needed to validate whether
YTHDF2 inhibition would lead to changes at the transcriptomic level.
Although it is not yet clear whether YTHDF2 inhibition alone would
be a sufficient anticancer strategy, the phenylpyrazole inhibitors
discovered from this study can be useful to evaluate further application
in combination with other anticancer options<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref></sup> and for the elucidation of the regulatory mechanisms involved in

washed. A barcoded RNA adapter was ligated to the 3&#x02032; end (T4
RNA Ligase, NEB) after dephosphorylation with FastAP (Thermo Fisher)
and T4 PNK (NEB). To allow washing away of the unincorporated adapter,
on-bead ligations were performed in a high concentration of PEG8000.
Samples were then run on standard protein gels and transferred to
nitrocellulose membranes. Isolation of a region 75 kDa (&#x0223c;220
nucleotides of RNA) above the protein size and treatment with proteinase
K (NEB) was performed to isolate RNA, which was then reverse transcribed
with Superscript III (Invitrogen) and treated with ExoSAP-IT (Affymetrix)
to remove excess oligonucleotides. A second DNA adapter (containing
a random-mer of 10 (N10) random bases at the 5&#x02032; end) was then
ligated to the cDNA fragment 3&#x02032; end (T4 RNA Ligase, NEB), which
was performed at a high concentration of PEG8000 to improve ligation
efficiency and DMSO to decrease the inhibition of ligation due to
the secondary structure. Following cleanup (Dynabeads MyOne Silane,
