The drug release rate of Lir-MVLs was controlled by changing the ratio of SPC and DEPC with different phase transition temperatures (PTT, PTT<sub>SPC</sub> = &#x02212;20 &#x000b0;C, PTT<sub>DEPC</sub> = 13 &#x000b0;C). <bold>Results:</bold> As the SPC ratio increased, Lir-MVLs had more flexible lipid membranes, poorer structural stabilization, and fewer internal vesicles with larger particle sizes, contributing to faster release of Lir. After subcutaneous injection of Lir-MVLs, the blood glucose concentration (BGC) of db/db mice decreased to different levels. When the SPC-DEPC ratio was greater than 85:15, the drug release rate was too fast; the BGC remained below 16 mM for only 2&#x02013;4 days, while when the drug release rate was too slow, was the case when the SPC-DEPC ratio was less than 50:50, the BGC also remained below 16 mM for only 2&#x02013;3 days. However, when the SPC-DEPC ratio was 75:25, the BGC could be maintained below 16 mM for 8 days, indicating that the release properties of this ratio best met the pharmacological requirements of Lir. <bold>Conclusions:</bold> This study investigated the effects of phospholipids with different PTT on the release characteristics of Lir-MVLs, and provided ideas for the design of sustained-release peptide preparations.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>peptides</kwd><kwd>sustained release</kwd><kwd>multivesicular liposomes</kwd><kwd>liraglutide</kwd><kwd>type 2 diabetes mellitus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>Liaoning Provincial Industrial Technology Innovation Key Public Relations Program</funding-source><award-id>LN-GXT-210523000000-2023-09-17-1</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>This research was financially supported by Liaoning Provincial Industrial Technology Innovation Key Public Relations Program &#x0201c;Jiebangguashuai&#x0201d; (LN-GXT-210523000000-2023-09-17-1).</funding-statement></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-pharmaceutics-17-00203"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>The application of peptides in the treatment of various diseases is gradually gaining attention. For example, Glucagon-like peptide-1 is an endogenous enteric insulin that plays an important role in maintaining glucose stability in the body, and its analogs, such as Liraglutide (Lir) and Semaglutide (Sem), are used in the clinical treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus [<xref rid="B1-pharmaceutics-17-00203" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-pharmaceutics-17-00203" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Teriparatide and leucovorin have also been approved on the market for the anabolic treatment of osteoporosis and for the treatment of prostate cancer, respectively [<xref rid="B3-pharmaceutics-17-00203" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-pharmaceutics-17-00203" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Peptides are macromolecules with secondary or tertiary structures, which can rapidly and efficiently bind to receptors in vivo, granting them unique target specificity, potent effects, and low toxicity [<xref rid="B5-pharmaceutics-17-00203" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-pharmaceutics-17-00203" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In recent years, delivery systems for peptides such as microspheres based on polylactide-co-glycolide (PLGA) or polylactic acid [<xref rid="B7-pharmaceutics-17-00203" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], PEGylation [<xref rid="B8-pharmaceutics-17-00203" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], chitosan nanoparticles [<xref rid="B9-pharmaceutics-17-00203" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-pharmaceutics-17-00203" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], microneedle-mediated transdermal [<xref rid="B11-pharmaceutics-17-00203" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], and exosome nanovesicles [<xref rid="B12-pharmaceutics-17-00203" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] have been gradually developed to improves bioavailability.</p><p>The advanced structure of peptides is the basis for maintaining their pharmacological efficacy, but they are also highly susceptible to disruption by the physiological environment of the body, which contributes to their short biological half-life [<xref rid="B13-pharmaceutics-17-00203" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Therefore, peptide drugs typically require frequent administration, resulting in poor patient compliance. Thus, the development of sustained-release platforms for peptide drugs has strong market and clinical values. PLGA is currently the most widely used sustained-release peptide delivery platform due to its biocompatibility and biodegradability, but it is possible that the degradation of PLGA may lead to the production of lactic acid and glycolic acid, the excessive accumulation of which can lead to local pH variation and inflammation [<xref rid="B14-pharmaceutics-17-00203" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-pharmaceutics-17-00203" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Therefore, to avoid the above problems, phospholipid-based sustained-release delivery systems for peptides have been gradually developed [<xref rid="B16-pharmaceutics-17-00203" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-pharmaceutics-17-00203" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Phospholipids are biocompatible and safe, and their metabolites do not alter the physicochemical environment at the site of administration, making them highly suitable for the delivery of peptides that require long-term administration [<xref rid="B18-pharmaceutics-17-00203" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-pharmaceutics-17-00203" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-pharmaceutics-17-00203" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Moreover, phospholipids spontaneously form bilayers under certain conditions and can be prepared as long-lasting subunit formulations by the double-emulsification method.</p><p>The multivesicular liposomes (MVLs) phospholipids-based sustained-released drug-delivery system prepared by DepoFoam technology is shown in <xref rid="pharmaceutics-17-00203-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> [<xref rid="B21-pharmaceutics-17-00203" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The sphere is composed of numerous non-concentric aqueous chambers separated by a reticulated lipid membrane, with adjacent chambers sharing a common phospholipid bilayer, and the vesicles are tightly stacked to form a stable topological structure [<xref rid="B22-pharmaceutics-17-00203" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. MVLs are characterized by large aqueous chambers, a smooth slow-release performance, mild preparation conditions, excellent biocompatibility, and pH-neutral metabolites [<xref rid="B23-pharmaceutics-17-00203" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24-pharmaceutics-17-00203" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], making them suitable for encapsulating protein and peptide drugs [<xref rid="B25-pharmaceutics-17-00203" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-pharmaceutics-17-00203" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The rupture of the surrounding lipid membranes leads to the release of the drug only in the peripheral chambers, while the internal chambers are not affected, prolonging the release time of the aqueous chamber; this makes them a good reservoir for hydrophilic drugs, which are highly suitable for long-term treatment of peptides [<xref rid="B21-pharmaceutics-17-00203" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B27-pharmaceutics-17-00203" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28-pharmaceutics-17-00203" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B29-pharmaceutics-17-00203" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B30-pharmaceutics-17-00203" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Preparation of MVLs requires the use of amphiphilic phospholipids as the main membrane material that forms lipidic bilayer membranes. In the meantime, anionic-charged phospholipids are used to form metastable monolayers during preparation, and cholesterol provides fluidity and rigidity to the membrane. In contrast to other liposomes, neutral lipids are present at the junction of bilayers within vesicles, forming MVLs, which can maintain the structural stability of MVLs [<xref rid="B23-pharmaceutics-17-00203" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>The in vitro release mechanisms of MVLs generally occur through erosion and diffusion [<xref rid="B31-pharmaceutics-17-00203" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B32-pharmaceutics-17-00203" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B33-pharmaceutics-17-00203" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], and current studies on the release characteristics of MVLs have mainly focused on the neutral lipid [<xref rid="B34-pharmaceutics-17-00203" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], the inner aqueous phase [<xref rid="B35-pharmaceutics-17-00203" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], and particle size [<xref rid="B36-pharmaceutics-17-00203" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Phospholipids&#x02019; structure is diverse, with different phase transition temperatures (PTTs), endowing them with different flexibility and fluidity [<xref rid="B37-pharmaceutics-17-00203" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], which influences drug release behavior. Meanwhile, the vesicles formed by phospholipid membrane encapsulation are the basic drug release unit of MVLs; thus, the nature of the phospholipid membrane has a great influence on their drug release. We hypothesized that by using two mixed phospholipids with different PTTs as membrane materials and adjusting the ratio of them, the ability to regulate drug release more finely was achieved, thereby resulting in a MVLs delivery system with a sustained-release effect.</p><p>Therefore, in this paper, the effect of adjusting the ratio of mixed phospholipids on the slow-release properties of MVLs was investigated. Specifically, Lir and MVLs were utilized as the model drug and sustained-release carriers, respectively. A series of Lir-MVLs were prepared using different Soybean phospholipids (SPC, PTT = &#x02212;20 &#x000b0;C) and dierucoyl phosphatidylcholine (DEPC, PTT = 13 &#x000b0;C) ratios by the double-emulsification method. The lipid membrane fluidity, surface properties, and characterization of aqueous phase&#x02013;particle interfaces of Lir-MVLs based on mixed phospholipids were investigated by adjusting the proportion of SPC-DEPC in the formulation. By combining an in vitro release test and an in vivo hypoglycemic experiment, the relationship between the membrane structural features of Lir-MVLs and their release behavior was investigated in order to meet different clinical needs. In summary, we designed and prepared Lir-MVLs with good hypoglycemic effect and sustained-release performance, opening up a promising strategy for the design of an injectable sustained-release drug-delivery system in peptides.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-pharmaceutics-17-00203"><title>2.

The morphology of Lir-MVLs was observed under an optical microscope, as shown in <xref rid="app1-pharmaceutics-17-00203" ref-type="app">Figure S2</xref>, and it was seen that the Lir-MVLs were rounded and homogeneous in shape, without fragmentation or adhesion.

The detailed structure of MVLs can be seen in the DIC field of view, and the three-dimensional reconstruction showed the distribution of the lipid and aqueous phases of Lir-MVLs more intuitively, which was evidence of the structural formation of the MVLs.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot2-pharmaceutics-17-00203"><title>3.2. The Fluidity of Lipid Membranes</title><p>The membrane fluidity of MVLs is critical in modulating drug release [<xref rid="B41-pharmaceutics-17-00203" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The DSC results of Lir-MVLs with different proportions of SPC-DEPC are shown in <xref rid="pharmaceutics-17-00203-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> and <xref rid="app1-pharmaceutics-17-00203" ref-type="app">Figure S3</xref>. As the temperature increases, a heat absorption peak appears on the DSC curve, representing the transformation of the lipid bilayer from the gel phase to the liquid crystal phase. The heat absorption peak of the DSC thermogram of Lir-MVLs of pure DEPC appears at 13.76 &#x000b0;C. As the proportion of SPC in the Lir-MVLs increased, the PTT decreased, indicating that the fluidity of the lipid membranes increased, which predicted faster drug release.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot3-pharmaceutics-17-00203"><title>3.3. The Surface Morphology</title><p>The AFM images of Lir-MVLs with different SPC-DEPC ratios are shown in <xref rid="pharmaceutics-17-00203-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>. When the SPC-DEPC ratio was 85:15, the surfaces of the Lir-MVLs showed a large amount of crater-like damage, presumably caused by vesicle rupture, and the rest of the surface was smooth. This phenomenon was not observed on the surfaces of Lir-MVLs with SPC 75:25 DEPC, SPC 50:50 DEPC and SPC 25:75 DEPC, suggesting that the addition of SPC with lower PTT makes the surface of the Lir-MVLs more fragile and reduces their structural stability. It was also found that when the SPC-DEPC ratio was lower than 75:25, the proportion of SPC did not significantly change the surface morphology of the formulations. Therefore, it was speculated that 75:25 is the critical point of SPC-DEPC ratio, and the formulations with a proportion higher than this point would tend to release the drug more rapidly.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot4-pharmaceutics-17-00203"><title>3.4. Characterization of Aqueous Phase&#x02013;Particle Interfaces</title><p>As an emerging technology, micro-NMR has seen increasing use in recent years for the characterization of particle interfaces. Usually, a hydration layer is formed after the particles are dispersed in the dispersing medium, and the relaxation time of water protons in the hydration layer is lower than that of water molecules in the solution system. Therefore, this phenomenon can be used to investigate the properties of MVLs with W/O/W structures at the aqueous phase&#x02013;particle interface [<xref rid="B42-pharmaceutics-17-00203" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. For MVLs, the W/O/W structure results in two particle&#x02013;water interfaces in the system, namely the outer water phase&#x02013;particle interface and the inner water phase&#x02013;particle interface. Relaxation time is essentially a response to the number of hydrated layers at the interface. For the same concentration, smaller particle sizes will typically have more hydrated layers, resulting in shorter relaxation times. The particle size of the MVLs is concentrated at 20&#x02013;30 &#x003bc;m, and the particles settle overnight during the test so that they are closely stacked with each other, resulting in the formation of very few hydration layers at the particle interfaces in the external aqueous phase. The particle size variation in micron-sized MVLs has little effect on the relaxation time, but more on the volume and distribution of their internal chambers; that is, the number of hydration layers at the internal aqueous phase&#x02013;particle interface.</p><p>The results of the aqueous phase&#x02013;particle interface characterization are shown in <xref rid="pharmaceutics-17-00203-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref> and <xref rid="app1-pharmaceutics-17-00203" ref-type="app">Figure S4</xref>. The relaxation time T<sub>2</sub> = 2168.2 ms for the external aqueous phase and T<sub>2</sub> = 1100&#x02013;1250 ms for the Lir-MVLs suggested that more particle&#x02013;solvent interfaces were formed in the system. As shown in <xref rid="pharmaceutics-17-00203-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>, there was no significant change in the relaxation time as the SPC-DEPC ratio increased from 50:50 to 75:25, indicating that there was no significant change in the aqueous phase&#x02013;particle interfaces within the SPC-DEPC at this ratio. As the SPC-DEPC ratio increased from 25:75 to 50:50 and from 75:25 to 85:15, the relaxation time T<sub>2</sub> values of Lir-MVLs increased significantly, indicating that at this SPC-DEPC ratio, the number of internal aqueous phase&#x02013;particle interfaces decreased with the increase in the SPC ratio in the MVLs, which resulted in the formation of fewer internal vesicles with larger sizes. Large vesicles were more prone to rupture and tended to release the drug more quickly than small vesicles [<xref rid="B43-pharmaceutics-17-00203" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot5-pharmaceutics-17-00203"><title>3.5. In Vitro Release of Lir-MVLs Based on Mixed Phospholipids</title><p>The in vitro release behavior of MVLs is an important index for studying the drug release characteristics of sustained-release formulations, which can be used to understand the sustained-release duration, release rate, and drug release mechanism of the formulations. As can be seen in <xref rid="pharmaceutics-17-00203-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>, at 0&#x02013;48 h, the formulation with an SPC-DEPC ratio higher than or equal to 75:25 released more than 70% of the total amount of drugs. The whole release process curve was smooth without the emergence of the platform period, indicating that the drug was released continuously. While the formulations with an SPC-DEPC ratio that was less than or equal to 50:50 had a better sustained-release effect (only 25&#x02013;40% of the drug was released at 0&#x02013;48 h), the release curve showed an obvious plateau at 24&#x02013;48 h, during which the drug was essentially not released. The results showed that as the SPC ration increased, the release rate was accelerated, which was consistent with the lipid membrane features of the corresponding preparations. And when the SPC-DEPC ratio was less than or equal to 50:50, the phenomenon of delayed drug release occurred.</p><p>The in vitro release data were fitted to zero-order kinetics, first-order kinetics, and Higuchi and Korsmeyer&#x02013;Peppas equations. Lir-MVLs of pure SPC were consistent with first-order release; SPC 85:15 DEPC, SPC 75:25 DEPC, and SPC 50:50 DEPC were consistent with the Korsmeyer&#x02013;Peppas kinetic model; and SPC 25:75 DEPC was consistent with zero-level release. The fitting results are shown in <xref rid="app1-pharmaceutics-17-00203" ref-type="app">Tables S1&#x02013;S5</xref>. When the release data were consistent with the Korsmeyer&#x02013;Peppas equation, the drug release mechanism in the Korsmeyer&#x02013;Peppas equation predominantly exhibited diffusion for n &#x02264; 0.45, whereas for n &#x02265; 0.89 it predominantly showed signs of erosion, and in between, it included both diffusion and erosion. It could be seen that the release mechanisms of SPC 85:15 DEPC and SPC 50:50 DEPC were diffusion and erosion (n = 0.546, 0.545), whereas the main release mechanism of SPC 75:25 DEPC was diffusion (n = 0.370). The reason for this result was that when the SPC-DEPC ratio was 85:15, the lipid membrane was mobile, the structural stability was poorer, and the internal vesicles were larger and easily ruptured, and thus, the release mechanism tended to be a combination of diffusion and erosion. When the SPC-DEPC ratio was 75:25, the surface was more compact, the structure was more stable, and the lipid membrane fluidity was relatively favorable, resulting in a release mechanism that tended to be diffusion. When the SPC-DEPC ratio was 50:50, with the increase in the proportion of high PTT phospholipid DPEC, the structural stability improved, while the fluidity of the lipid membrane was further reduced, which caused the diffusion to be weakened, resulting in the drug release mechanism being more inclined toward a combination of diffusion and erosion. The above results suggested that different proportions of mixed phospholipids can alter the lipid membrane properties of MVLs, which can significantly modulate the drug release rate and release mechanism. As a complex formulation with multiple release units, after the rupture of the outer vesicles, the rest of the inner vesicles remain intact due to their special non-concentric honeycomb structure. Meanwhile, owing to the different diffusion distances between the outer and inner vesicles, the drug can show sequential diffusion release from the vesicles, which endows the MVLs with excellent sustained-release properties [<xref rid="B32-pharmaceutics-17-00203" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B33-pharmaceutics-17-00203" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B44-pharmaceutics-17-00203" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="B45-pharmaceutics-17-00203" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot6-pharmaceutics-17-00203"><title>3.6. Hypoglycemic Effect in db/db Diabetes Model Mice</title><p>Different ratios of SPC-DEPC modulated the properties of the lipid membranes of Lir-MVLs, which in turn exhibited different release characteristics.

Lir-MVLs with different SPC-DEPC ratios showed different degrees of long-lasting hypoglycemic effects compared to the saline and Lir-solution groups. As can be seen in <xref rid="pharmaceutics-17-00203-f007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>A, after subcutaneous injection of Lir-solution, with Lir-MVLs of pure SPC and SPC 85:15 DEPC, compared with the control group, the BGC of db/db mice was rapidly reduced to below 10 mM and recovered to above 16 mM on day 3, day 4, and day 5, respectively. As can be seen in <xref rid="pharmaceutics-17-00203-f007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>B, after subcutaneous injection of Lir-MVLs of SPC 75:25 DEPC, the BGC of mice decreased rapidly to below 10 mM and recovered to above 16 mM on day 9.

However, the BGC of these two groups showed a decreasing trend again after day 4 until day 10.</p><p>The above results indicate that when the SPC-DEPC ratio was more than and equal to 85:15, the sustained hypoglycemic effects were unsatisfactory due to their rapid drug release. While the SPC-DEPC ratio was less than 75:25, the BGC was unable to remain below 16 mM for more than 4 days, even though a certain hypoglycemic effect was exhibited for a prolonged period. Only Lir-MVLs of SPC 75:25 DEPC exhibited an effective long-lasting and stable hypoglycemic effect. The results of hypoglycemic experiments in db/db diabetes model mice have correlated well with in vitro release results. It is confirmed that by adjusting the mixed phospholipids proportions, the drug release could be more finely controlled to exert the expected therapeutic effect.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot7-pharmaceutics-17-00203"><title>3.7. The Retention of Lir-MVLs at the Local Injection Site in Mice</title><p>As shown in <xref rid="pharmaceutics-17-00203-f008" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref> and <xref rid="pharmaceutics-17-00203-f009" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref>, the retention times of Cy5-Lir-MVLs of SPC, SPC 85:15 DEPC, SPC 75:25 DEPC, SPC 50:50 DEPC, and SPC 25:75 DEPC in mice were 5 d, 6 d, 9 d, 20 d, and 16 d as the RFI decreased below 20%, respectively, and the retention time of SPC 50:50 DEPC was the longest. Local retention experiment results matched the in vitro release experiment and in vivo hypoglycemic experiment results. When the proportion of SPC-DEPC was greater than 75:25, the RFI decreased smoothly with time, suggesting that the release of Lir-MVLs was smooth at this time; however, the shorter retention led to a non-sustainable hypoglycemic effect. When the proportion of SPC-DEPC was less than 75:25, the RFI decreased by less than 5% on days 2&#x02013;4 and the curve showed an obvious plateau, indicating an inadequate drug release during this period, which matched the transient increase in blood glucose in db/db mice on days 2&#x02013;4. The longer retention time further confirms the slow release of the drug, resulting in an inadequate hypoglycemic effect. Only SPC 75:25 DEPC was at a suitable point. Considering these findings together, it is concluded that the mixed phospholipid ratio not only affected the local drug release rate of Lir-MVLs, but also had an obvious influence on the retention time at the local injection site, contributing to the sustained hypoglycemic effect.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot8-pharmaceutics-17-00203"><title>3.8.

To further validate the long-lasting and smooth postprandial blood glucose control effect of Lir-MVLs in healthy mice, and more accurately reflect the release process of the sustained and controlled release formulations in organisms, Lir-MVLs of SPC 75:25 DEPC was subsequently subjected to OGTT in healthy mice and in vivo pharmacokinetic study in rats.</p><p>OGTT can evaluate the ability of drugs to control postprandial blood glucose and improve the body&#x02019;s glucose tolerance [<xref rid="B46-pharmaceutics-17-00203" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].

After 120 min, the BGC of the mice in the Lir-MVLs group returned to basically normal levels, whereas those in the control group did not return to the initial BGC at 120 min on days 4 and 7, suggesting that repeated OGTT may damage the ability of mice to control blood glucose, while Lir-MVLs can effectively avoid this damage. Lir-MVLs of SPC 75:25 DEPC were able to control postprandial BGC at steady state on days 1,4, and 7, suggesting that the pharmacodynamic of Lir-MVLs of SPC 75:25 DEPC could be maintained for at least 7 days.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot9-pharmaceutics-17-00203"><title>3.9.

Conclusions</title><p>This study showed that the MVLs based on biocompatible phospholipids could sustain the delivery of peptides, and the release rate of MVLs could be regulated by the ratio of phospholipids with different PPTs. The EE of Lir-MVLs with different SPC-DEPC ratios was above 90%, and the particle size was around 30 &#x000b5;m. As the proportion of SPC (PPT = &#x02212;20 &#x000b0;C) increased, Lir-MVLs had more flexible lipid membranes, poorer structural stabilization, and fewer internal vesicles with larger particle sizes, leading to faster release and a shorter retention time. When the SPC-DEPC ratio was greater than 85:15, the drug release rate was too fast, so the sustained hypoglycemic effects were not effective. When the SPC-DEPC ratio was less than 50:50, the drug release rate was too slow to fully release the drug, resulting in an inability to achieve satisfactory hypoglycemic effects. Only when the SPC-DEPC ratio was 75:25 could the Lir-MVLs be released smoothly and slowly through a diffusion mechanism, which was able to maintain the BGC in db/db mice below 16 mM for 8 days, and control postprandial blood glucose in a steady state for 7 days with a relative bioavailability of 282.3%, indicating that the release properties of this ratio best met the pharmacological requirements of Lir. The present study achieved the goal of regulating the release characteristics by adjusting the types of phospholipids with different PTT in Lir-MVLs and obtained the expected sustained-release effect, which further meets practical clinical needs and provides a new theoretical basis and guidance for the design of injectable sustained-release peptide preparations.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank teachers of our laboratory for their excellent assistance.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclaimer/Publisher&#x02019;s Note:</bold> The statements, opinions and data contained in all publications are solely those of the individual author(s) and contributor(s) and not of MDPI and/or the editor(s).
