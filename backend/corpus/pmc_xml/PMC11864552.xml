</self-uri><abstract><p>Gap junctions allow the exchange of small molecules between cells. How this function could be used to promote cell growth is not yet fully understood. During <italic toggle="yes">Drosophila</italic> ovarian follicle development, germ cells, which are surrounded by epithelial somatic cells, undergo massive growth. We found that this growth depends on gap junctions between these cell populations, with a requirement for Innexin4 and Innexin2, in the germ cells and the somatic cells, respectively. Translatomic analyses revealed that somatic cells express enzymes and transporters involved in amino acid metabolism that are absent in germ cells. Among them, we identified a putative amino acid transporter required for germline growth. Its ectopic expression in the germline can partially compensate for its absence or the one of Innexin2 in somatic cells. Moreover, affecting either gap junctions or the import of some amino acids in somatic cells induces P-bodies in the germ cells, a feature usually associated with an arrest of translation. Finally, in somatic cells, innexin2 expression and gap junction assembly are regulated by the insulin receptor/PI3K kinase pathway, linking the growth of the two tissues. Overall, these results support the view that metabolic transfer through gap junction promotes cell growth and illustrate how such a mechanism can be integrated into a developmental program, coupling growth control by extrinsic systemic signals with the intrinsic coordination between cell populations.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>Gap junctions allow transfer of small molecules between cells, but it is unclear if cells can use this process to promote cell growth.

Each cells harbor a hemichannel made of six subunits, connexins in vertebrates and innexins in other animal phyla where gap junctions are found. These two protein families are very different in terms of primary sequence, but similar in terms of conformation [<xref rid="pbio.3003045.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pbio.3003045.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Hemichannels can be homomeric or heteromeric in composition and channels can be formed from two identical or different hemichannels, leading to a large range of channel combinations with different regulations or solute specificities. Gap junctions generally assemble in plaques that contain many channels and each channel allows the direct communication, and thus molecular flows, between the cytoplasm of two cells. However, due to the channel size and conformation, only passive transfer of small molecules and ions, up to approximatively 1&#x02009;kDa, including second messengers (e.g., inositol triphosphate and calcium) is allowed. Gap junction proteins also participate in other cellular mechanisms, such as cell migration [<xref rid="pbio.3003045.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3003045.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Moreover, many molecules that can diffuse through gap junctions are linked to energetic metabolism (e.g., glucose and pyruvate) and to anabolic metabolism (e.g., amino acids). However, despite many studies on these metabolite flows, their functional relevance has been elusive.</p><p>Such metabolite exchanges could promote cell growth. Available genetic data suggest that the growth of mammalian oocytes could be an illustration of such a mechanism. Indeed, mutation of connexin 37 (<italic toggle="yes">Cx37</italic>) in germ cells or of <italic toggle="yes">Cx43</italic> in somatic granulosa cells, which surround and are in contact with the oocyte, strongly impairs oocyte and follicle growth [<xref rid="pbio.3003045.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3003045.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Moreover, amino acid import and pyruvate production are more efficient in follicle cells, and granulosa cells are required for an effective uptake of some amino acids, including alanine and proline, by the oocyte [<xref rid="pbio.3003045.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pbio.3003045.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. These data suggest a potential metabolic flow towards the oocyte via the gap junctions. Nonetheless, it is not known: (i) to which extent this putative transfer of metabolites contributes to explain gap junction impact on oocyte growth; and (ii) whether such mechanism is coupled with follicle cell growth and more generally, is integrated in the genetic programme controlling follicle development.</p><p>A major feature of oocytes is their large size throughout animal evolution, despite important variation among species [<xref rid="pbio.3003045.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3003045.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Their size prefigures the early embryo size and their content will determine the early embryo development success rate and quality [<xref rid="pbio.3003045.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3003045.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Hence, oocyte growth is an essential step that requires robust underlying mechanisms [<xref rid="pbio.3003045.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3003045.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Oocyte development and growth usually occur in ovarian follicles where germ cells are surrounded by follicle cells (i.e., somatic epithelial cells). <italic toggle="yes">Drosophila</italic> oogenesis takes place in a structure called ovariole, in which follicles continuously arise and develop from the anterior to the posterior end. Each ovary is subdivided in about 16 ovarioles (<xref rid="pbio.3003045.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). Follicles bud from a structure called the germarium that contains germ cells and somatic stem cells. Follicle development is divided in 14 morphological stages during which the oocyte volume increases 1000 times in about 3 days before being fertilized and laid [<xref rid="pbio.3003045.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. At stage 1, a follicle contains a germline cyst of 16 interconnected cells: 15 nurse cells that will grow by endoreplication and 1 oocyte at the posterior end, blocked in early meiosis. Each germline cyst is encapsulated by the follicular epithelium that is initially composed of about 30 cells. These cells proliferate giving 800 cells at stage 6 and then they undergo endoreplication [<xref rid="pbio.3003045.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Both germ cell growth and follicle cell growth are cell autonomously sensitive to the usual growth systemic signals, such as the Insulin Receptor/Phosphatidylinositol 3 Kinase (InR/PI3K) and Target of Rapamycin (TOR) pathways [<xref rid="pbio.3003045.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3003045.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pbio.3003045.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. These pathways affect also non-cell autonomously the growth of the adjacent tissue in both direction: the soma influences germline growth and vice versa [<xref rid="pbio.3003045.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3003045.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pbio.3003045.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The most striking illustration of this reciprocal coordination is observed when <italic toggle="yes">Pten</italic>, a InR/PI3K repressor, is mutated in follicle somatic cells. The faster growth of these somatic cells induces the faster growth of the surrounded wild-type germ cells. Regulation of somatic cell growth by germline growth involves the Hippo pathway and its modulation by tension induced on the epithelium due to the germline cyst volume increase [<xref rid="pbio.3003045.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. However, it is not known how the follicle somatic cells control germ cell growth.</p><fig position="float" id="pbio.3003045.g001"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pbio.3003045.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Soma-germline gap junctions are required for germline growth.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Scheme of an ovariole, oriented from the anterior (A) to the posterior (P) end, as all the subsequent images.

Several innexins, including Inx2, are expressed in follicle cells and partially colocalize with or are juxtaposed to Inx4 [<xref rid="pbio.3003045.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3003045.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Inx4 is required for germ cell survival before follicle formation, and Inx2 is involved in the germline cyst encapsulation by follicle cells during follicle budding [<xref rid="pbio.3003045.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3003045.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3003045.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Inx2 and Inx4 are also required for morphogenetic events during oogenesis, such as the stretching of anterior follicle cells and the migration of border cells during stage 9 [<xref rid="pbio.3003045.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3003045.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Moreover, Inx4 and Inx2 form gap junctions in the testis where they are required at different steps of sperm development [<xref rid="pbio.3003045.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3003045.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3003045.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p><p>We found that Inx4/Inx2 gap junctions are required for female germline growth once follicles are formed. Moreover, follicle cells specifically express genes involved in amino acid biology, and the import of some amino acids in follicle cells is necessary for germline growth. This germline growth control by somatic follicle cells is linked to the formation of processing bodies (P-bodies) and can be partially bypassed by the direct expression of a putative amino acid transporter in the germline. Moreover, gap junction assembly is controlled by the InR/PI3K pathway, thus connecting growth coordination between these two cell types with systemic growth control.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Inx2 and Inx4 form gap junctions at the soma&#x02013;germline interface that are required for germline growth</title><p>As gap junctions are required for oocyte growth in mammals, we asked whether they could play a similar role in <italic toggle="yes">Drosophila</italic> oogenesis [<xref rid="pbio.3003045.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3003045.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Therefore, first, we characterized the gap junction composition and profile in somatic and germ cells, focusing on stages 1&#x02013;8 when follicle development is globally limited to growth without major morphogenetic changes. As previously described [<xref rid="pbio.3003045.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pbio.3003045.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], we detected Inx2 and Inx4 forming plaques at the interface between germ and somatic cells, these plaques often being larger in follicle anterior part. Inx2 also formed plaques on the lateral domain of follicle cells (<xref rid="pbio.3003045.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pbio.3003045.g001" ref-type="fig">1E</xref>). Inx2 expression and plaque size tended to increase as follicles developed (S1A Fig). However, plaques tended to disappear specifically from the oocyte cortex around stage 8 and were completely absent at this position from stage 9 onwards (S1B Fig). The cytoplasmic signal localization suggested that Inx2 and Inx4 were mainly expressed in the soma and germline, respectively. Accordingly, <italic toggle="yes">Inx2</italic> knockdown (<italic toggle="yes">Inx2</italic> RNAi) induction in somatic clones led to the cell-autonomous loss of Inx2 staining, whereas induction of <italic toggle="yes">Inx4</italic> knockdown (<italic toggle="yes">Inx4</italic> RNAi) in the germline led to the loss of Inx4 staining (<xref rid="pbio.3003045.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1F</xref>, <xref rid="pbio.3003045.g001" ref-type="fig">1G</xref>). Notably, we did not detect Inx4 at the contact of <italic toggle="yes">Inx2</italic> RNAi follicle cells, confirming published results (<xref rid="pbio.3003045.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1F</xref>&#x02034;) [<xref rid="pbio.3003045.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Similarly, when <italic toggle="yes">Inx4</italic> was knocked down in germline cysts, we did not detect Inx2 plaques at the germline contact, although Inx2 protein expression was increased in follicle cells and still localized at the lateral domain of the cells (<xref rid="pbio.3003045.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1G</xref>&#x02034;). This last observation could suggest a feedback mechanism between gap junction formation and Inx2 expression. Conversely, the loss of <italic toggle="yes">Inx2</italic> in the germline or <italic toggle="yes">Inx4</italic> in the soma did not induce visible defects (S1C, S1D Fig). Altogether, these data clearly established the presence of gap junction plaques composed of Inx4 in the germline and of Inx2 in follicle cells, and the Inx4-Inx2 interdependence for plaque assembly.</p><p>We then tested whether these gap junctions influenced germline growth by generating large <italic toggle="yes">Inx2</italic> mutant clones. In such conditions, we observed follicles that were smaller than the younger one at their anterior, a phenomenon never observed in the wild-type ovarioles. The quantification of the ratio between the volumes of the defective growth follicle and the follicle at its anterior confirmed these observations (<xref rid="pbio.3003045.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1H</xref>, <xref rid="pbio.3003045.g001" ref-type="fig">1I</xref>). We observed this phenotype with three different alleles, and only when all (or almost) epithelial cells of a follicle harbored the mutated <italic toggle="yes">Inx2</italic> while the anterior one was wild-type or contained a smaller percentage of mutant cells, whereas similar cases with control clones had no visible effect (S1E Fig). Constitutive <italic toggle="yes">Inx2</italic> RNAi in the somatic lineage completely blocked oogenesis and precluded follicle observations. Therefore, we added a constitutive <italic toggle="yes">Gal80</italic><sup><italic toggle="yes">ts</italic></sup> transgene to allow a temporal control of RNAi construct (18 &#x000b0;C then 48&#x02009;h at 30 &#x000b0;C). Inx2 knockdown induced by RNAi in follicle cells during 48&#x02009;h leads to a strong reduction of the proportion of Edu-positive germline cysts, indicating that the growth defect is associated with an effect on endoreplication (<xref rid="pbio.3003045.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1J</xref>). Because it is known that germline and somatic growth influence each other, we aimed to determine whether <italic toggle="yes">Inx2</italic> effect on germline growth was due to a cell-autonomous effect on somatic growth [<xref rid="pbio.3003045.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3003045.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3003045.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3003045.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. We analyzed follicle cell growth in smaller clones that do not induce germline defect to avoid feedback between tissues. In such mutant cells we did not observe any difference in cell size and in the proportion of cells in S phase (EDU-positive) between these populations, indicating that Inx2 did not influence somatic growth in a cell autonomous manner (<xref rid="pbio.3003045.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1K</xref>, <xref rid="pbio.3003045.g001" ref-type="fig">1L</xref>). Of notice, follicle cells express other innexins at their lateral domain, suggesting that functional gap junction in between follicle cell may still exist in absence of Inx2 and may mask a potential communication in between these cells influencing their growth [<xref rid="pbio.3003045.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Nonetheless, these results suggest that Inx2-dependent gap junctions are specifically required for germline growth. We could not confirm this hypothesis using germline null <italic toggle="yes">Inx4</italic> mutant clones because in these mutant germline cysts development is blocked very early in the germanium [<xref rid="pbio.3003045.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Therefore, we generated <italic toggle="yes">Inx4</italic> RNAi clones in the germline, directly detected by the absence of Inx4 expression (<xref rid="pbio.3003045.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1G</xref>). <italic toggle="yes">Inx4</italic> RNAi cysts were not larger than the younger wild-type follicle, indicating defective germline growth (<xref rid="pbio.3003045.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1G</xref>, <xref rid="pbio.3003045.g001" ref-type="fig">1M</xref>). Altogether, these data indicate that Inx2 and Inx4 form homomeric and heterotypic gap junctions between somatic and germ cells that are required for germ cell growth.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Genes implicated in amino acid metabolism are enriched in somatic follicular cells</title><p>Gap junction requirement for germ cell growth supports a model in which metabolites diffuse from follicle cells to germ cells. However, the direct identification of such metabolites is technically challenging. We hypothesized that if follicle cells produce or import metabolites not present in the germline, we might identify enzymes or transporters that are involved in this process and that are more expressed in follicle cells. To this aim, we performed translating ribosome affinity purification (TRAP), an approach that allows identifying the tissue-specific translatome. We used <italic toggle="yes">nanos:Gal4VP16</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">trafficjam:Gal4</italic> drivers to express a Green&#x000a0;Fluorescent&#x000a0;Protein-tagged ribosomal protein (UASp:RPL10a-GFP) specifically in the germline and in somatic cells, respectively (<xref rid="pbio.3003045.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>). Then, we immunoprecipitated the GFP-tagged polysomes and isolated and sequenced the associated mRNAs under translation. Our biological replicates were highly reproducible (<xref rid="pbio.3003045.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref> and S2A Fig). To extract genes with a specific or strongly enriched somatic expression, we used a fold-change of 5 between soma and germline as cut-off that gave a list of 811 genes (<xref rid="pbio.3003045.g002" ref-type="fig">Figs 2B</xref> and S2B). We then selected genes involved in small molecule metabolic processes, reducing the list to 52 genes. The whole ecdysone synthesis pathway (six genes), which is exclusively active in follicle cells, was enriched in follicle cells, thus validating our TRAP approach [<xref rid="pbio.3003045.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Moreover, six genes encoding enzymes involved in amino acid biosynthesis were strongly enriched in follicle cells (<xref rid="pbio.3003045.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>). By analyzing this gene&#x000a0;ontologyclass, we found that 29 enzymes were expressed in both cell types, but none was germline-specific (<xref rid="pbio.3003045.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>). Similarly, among the 60 amino acid transporters encoded by the fly genome, 21 were expressed in both tissues, 12 were specifically expressed in the soma, and none in the germline alone (<xref rid="pbio.3003045.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>, <xref rid="pbio.3003045.g002" ref-type="fig">2D</xref>). Interrogating the Fly Cell Atlas for the 18 genes involved in amino acid synthesis or transport and enriched in the soma in the TRAP experiments indicated that they were all detected in a higher proportion of &#x0201c;ovariole somatic cells&#x0201d; than &#x0201c;female germ cells&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pbio.3003045.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. It suggests that the differences observed in the translatomes of soma and germline are already true at the level of their transcriptomes. These data indicated that among the genes strongly enriched in follicle cells there is a strong bias for genes involved in amino acid synthesis or import.

Moreover, although all the available RNAi lines for these genes were tested, we could not exclude that some were not efficient enough.

A role in importing amino acids from the hemolymph would require a cell membrane localization, while some amino acid transporters are specific to some intracellular vesicular compartments. Therefore, to determine Coch protein localization, we generated a GFP knockin with the <italic toggle="yes">Minos</italic>-mediated integration cassette (MiMIC) system to insert in-frame an EGFP-encoding exon [<xref rid="pbio.3003045.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. This insertion was in the non-conserved N-terminal part common to five of the seven described <italic toggle="yes">coch</italic> isoforms. Importantly, it tags isoforms RA and RB that were expressed in follicle cells according to our TRAP mRNA sequence data. The line <italic toggle="yes">coch-GFP</italic> was homozygous viable and fertile without visible phenotype.

The GFP decorates the whole cortex of follicle cells, though appearing more enriched at the lateral and apical domains (<xref rid="pbio.3003045.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3H</xref>). Of notice, septate junctions are not mature from stage 1&#x02013;8, and the epithelium is therefore not impermeable, suggesting that solutes import via Coch can occur from any domain [<xref rid="pbio.3003045.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].

As it is located in the protein N-terminus, it should induce null mutation of the affected isoforms, which include the ones expressed in follicle cells. This allele was sublethal when homozygous or in trans with a deficiency covering the gene. In both cases, the ovaries of these flies were strongly atrophied, fitting with a role for this gene in follicle growth, though we could not detect a difference in the proportion of Edu-positive cysts (<xref rid="pbio.3003045.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figs S3B</xref>, <xref rid="pbio.3003045.g003" ref-type="fig">3C</xref>). Moreover, Replacing the STOP codon-containing exon with the GFP exon suppressed ovary growth defect. We generated mutant clones in the follicular epithelium. Analysis of small clones that did not cover the whole epithelium did not show any difference in cell size and proliferation, suggesting that follicle cell growth was not affected (<xref rid="pbio.3003045.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3K</xref>, <xref rid="pbio.3003045.g003" ref-type="fig">3L</xref>). Conversely, when the whole epithelium of a follicle was mutated, such follicles were smaller (or of the same size) than the younger ones (<xref rid="pbio.3003045.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3I</xref>, <xref rid="pbio.3003045.g003" ref-type="fig">3J</xref>).

To test this hypothesis, we combined the UAS/Gal4 system with the QUAS/QF system [<xref rid="pbio.3003045.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].

A Q<italic toggle="yes">UASp:GFP</italic> transgene driven by MatTub:QF was expressed once the germline cyst is formed in the germarium and in all the subsequent stages, starting slightly earlier than what described for MatTub:Gal4Vp16, indicating that both driver and QUASp promoter were functional (S4A Fig). Expression of the <italic toggle="yes">QUASp:coch</italic> transgene in the germline with the same driver (<italic toggle="yes">MatTub&#x0003e;coch</italic>) had a slight negative effect on ovary size (<xref rid="pbio.3003045.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pbio.3003045.g004" ref-type="fig">4C</xref>, <xref rid="pbio.3003045.g004" ref-type="fig">4F</xref>). However, when it was combined with somatic knockdown of coch (tj&#x0003e;cochRNAi), it rescued the effect of the latter on ovary size (<xref rid="pbio.3003045.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>, <xref rid="pbio.3003045.g004" ref-type="fig">4D</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pbio.3003045.g004" ref-type="fig">4F</xref>). Importantly, since MatTub:QF driver is expressed only from late stages of germarium, the observed rescue cannot be due to an effect during gonad development. However, such rescue is not quantitatively observed in the stage distribution, suggesting that the latter is less sensitive than ovary size to probe growth modification (S4B Fig). We also quantified egg laying in these different genetic backgrounds. This experiment confirmed both the slight deleterious effect of germline <italic toggle="yes">coch</italic> expression, but also its ability to rescue its knockdown in the follicle cells (<xref rid="pbio.3003045.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4G</xref>). Altogether, these genetic data demonstrated that the requirement of coch expression in follicular cells for germline growth can be partially compensated by its germline expression, suggesting a direct metabolic exchange between these cell types through the gap junctions.

Therefore, we set up a semi-automated method for their quantification by measuring the fluorescence fraction found in condensates in stage 9 nurse cells (<xref rid="pbio.3003045.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5C</xref>). P-body formation is usually induced by inhibitory phosphorylation of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 subunit alpha (eIF2&#x003b1;) on serine 51 (S51), an event also known to cause a translation arrest [<xref rid="pbio.3003045.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Overexpression in the germline of a transgene mimicking this phosphorylated form (eIF2&#x003b1;-S51D), but not wild-type eIF2&#x003b1;, strongly induced P-body formation, although we did not quantify them because these follicles never reached stage 9 (<xref rid="pbio.3003045.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5D</xref>, <xref rid="pbio.3003045.g005" ref-type="fig">5E</xref>).

As P-bodies potentially repress germline growth, we tested whether the absence of gap junctions between germ cells and follicle cells or defective amino acid import in the follicle cells could induce their formation.

P-bodies or stress granules formation in response to a lack of some amino acids can occur independently or dependently of eIF2&#x003b1; S51 phosphorylation. In the first case, which is not the most frequently described, it is associated with the repression of the TOR pathway [<xref rid="pbio.3003045.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].

These results strongly argued against the implication of GCN2 as a germ cell growth repressor when the availability of the amino acids provided by Coch is reduced. Thus, being independent of TOR and GCN2, the mechanism leading to P-bodies formation in the female germline seems unusual and will require further investigation.</p><p>Altogether these data indicate that although the two well-established pathways involved in amino acid sensing do not seem implicated, P-body formation acts as a metabolic stress sensor linked to the control of germ cell growth by gap junctions and the import of some amino acids in follicle cells.</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Gap junction assembly links intrinsic growth control and systemic control</title><p>Published data indicated that InR/PI3K or Tor pathway inhibition in follicle cells induces the formation of P-bodies in the germline [<xref rid="pbio.3003045.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].

Since somatic activity of the InR/PI3K pathway also strongly influences germline growth, we asked whether there was a link between the InR/PI3K pathway activity in follicle cells and their ability to transfer metabolites to the germline. Coch-GFP expression level and localization were similar in wild-type and in follicle cells with a PI3K gain of function or mutated for <italic toggle="yes">akt,</italic> suggesting no impact on this specific actor of amino acid import in follicle cells (<xref rid="pbio.3003045.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6A</xref>, <xref rid="pbio.3003045.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6B Fig</xref>).

These data indicated that Inx2 expression is sensitive to InR/PI3K pathway gain and loss of function. Moreover, we observed that Inx2 protein level was also sensitive to the loss but not the gain of function of the Tor pathway, suggesting that it is not equally controlled by all the pathways modulating cell growth (<xref rid="pbio.3003045.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6C</xref>, <xref rid="pbio.3003045.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6D Fig</xref>).

These observations supported a model in which the non-cell autonomous effect of the InR/PI3K pathway from somatic cells to germ cells is mediated by gap junctions. To test this hypothesis, we performed an epistasis experiment. As previously described [<xref rid="pbio.3003045.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], large <italic toggle="yes">Pten</italic> mutant clones in the follicular epithelium accelerated germline growth in a non-cell autonomous manner (<xref rid="pbio.3003045.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6G</xref>).

Thus, gap junctions are required for germline growth control via InR/PI3K activity in the follicular epithelium. We also tested whether <italic toggle="yes">Inx2</italic> overexpression could be sufficient to rescue the knockdown of the InR/PI3K pathway in the somatic cells.

Thus, the control of Inx2 expression is not sufficient to explain the non-cell-autonomous effect on germline growth of the InR/PI3K pathway in the follicle cells.

In accordance with this hypothesis, we identified a putative amino acid transporter, <italic toggle="yes">coch</italic>, specifically expressed in follicle cells and required for germline cell growth. Though a flux of amino acids from somatic cells to germ cells cannot be directly visualized, <italic toggle="yes">coch</italic> expression in the germline can partially bypass its silencing or the one of <italic toggle="yes">Inx2</italic> in the soma, suggesting a functional metabolic exchange between these cell types through gap junctions. Moreover, direct genetic induction of P-bodies in the germline is sufficient to block germline growth, and both defective gap junction or amino-acid import in somatic cells induces P-bodies in the germ cells, a feature usually associated with an arrest of translation. However, this effect is not mediated by GCN2 and it is therefore unclear by which mechanism P-bodies are induced in such a situation. Thus, the most plausible explanation for all our data is a model in which gap junctions allow the transfer from somatic cells to germ cells of metabolites, such as amino acids, that germ cells cannot directly produce or import, thereby promoting germ cell growth through translation control.</p><p>Inx2 and Inx4 have various functions during <italic toggle="yes">Drosophila</italic> oogenesis [<xref rid="pbio.3003045.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3003045.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3003045.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3003045.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. However, our data showing their involvement in germ cell growth can be more easily compared with gap junction role in mammal follicles where Cx37 is expressed in the oocyte and Cx43 in follicle cells [<xref rid="pbio.3003045.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3003045.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. This indicates that gap junction requirement for oocyte growth is a conserved feature throughout evolution. Gap junctions are present in most animal tissues and can directly connect different cell types, for instance, neurons and glial cells. Therefore, their involvement in growth control might be more general. We found that Inx2 expression and the subsequent formation of plaques were strongly regulated by the InR/PI3K pathway in a cell autonomous manner, providing an effective mechanism to link metabolic flow with growth systemic signals. Since InR/PI3K pathway activity in the follicle cells controls both somatic growth and germline growth ensuring their coordination, its impact on gap junctions likely participates in this coordination.</p><p>Our results also established that Coch, a putative amino acid transporter of the SLC36A family, must be expressed in somatic cells for germline growth. Amino acid availability and cell growth control are usually linked by the TOR pathway [<xref rid="pbio.3003045.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. However, this pathway is unlikely implicated in the mechanism described here. Indeed, first, when germline growth is blocked due to alteration of somatic cell growth upon loss of <italic toggle="yes">akt</italic>, which also regulates gap junction assembly, the TOR pathway is still active in the germline [<xref rid="pbio.3003045.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Moreover, overactivation of the TOR pathway in the germline in such conditions does not suppress growth inhibition. Finally, TOR inhibition in the <italic toggle="yes">Drosophila</italic> female germline does not induce P-body formation [<xref rid="pbio.3003045.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Therefore, we tested the involvement of the other well-described amino acid sensing pathway that relies on GCN2. Our results also excluded this mechanism to explain P-body formation and growth inhibition in the absence of proline import in somatic cells or of gap junctions. Therefore, more studies are needed to determine the precise mechanism underlying germline growth control.</p><p>Several arguments suggest that amino acids imported by Coch might just be the tip of the iceberg of the metabolic cooperativity between follicle cells and germ cells. <italic toggle="yes">Inx2</italic> mutant clones have a stronger impact on germline growth than <italic toggle="yes">coch</italic> mutant clones. Probably as a consequence of this difference of requirement, temporally controlled Inx2 knockdown induces an acute and strong arrest of germline growth, associated with a cell cycle arrest, while <italic toggle="yes">coch</italic> mutation has a milder effect that may lag each cell-cycle phase, but then do not significantly affect their respective proportion. In agreement with this idea, when somatic clones for <italic toggle="yes">coch</italic> induce smaller follicles, it is also associated with smaller nurse cell nuclei, which strongly suggests a delay in the cell progression through the rounds of endoreplication. Thus, it suggests that other metabolites from follicle cells also may promote germline growth. Accordingly, our translatome analysis showed that different genes involved in amino acid synthesis or import were specifically expressed in follicle cells, but none in germ cells. The absence of phenotype when these genes were knocked down, except <italic toggle="yes">coch</italic>, could be explained by multiple potential levels of redundancy among synthesis pathways, transporters, and synthesis and import. Nonetheless, detailed analysis of the genes overexpressed in follicle cells compared with germ cells suggest that several amino acids (e.g., proline, tryptophane, valine, tyrosine) could flow from the soma to the germline. Moreover, in the mouse, the alanine transporter SLC38A3 is strongly enriched in granulosa cells that are required for efficient alanine import in the oocyte [<xref rid="pbio.3003045.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Thus, altogether these data suggest that gap junction-dependent amino acid flow is not restricted to the amino acids imported via Coch. Besides, glucose intake and pyruvate production are more efficient in granulosa cells, suggesting that follicle cells could provide energetic molecules to the oocyte [<xref rid="pbio.3003045.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In line with this observation in mammals, TRAP data indicated that transporter for trehalose (tret1-1), the circulating sugar in insects, was expressed in somatic cells and not in the germline, whereas germline development is highly dependent on sugar and the pentose phosphate pathway [<xref rid="pbio.3003045.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Thus, a contribution of energetic metabolism in the soma&#x02013;germline cooperativity via gap junctions will be an interesting avenue for future investigations. Moreover, it has already been shown that calcium can be exchanged between germ cells and follicle cells by Inx2/Inx4 gap junctions, and a potential role in the control of germ cell growth of this ion that can act a second messenger cannot be currently excluded [<xref rid="pbio.3003045.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Finally, the fact that Inx2 expression in follicle cells is not sufficient to explain the non-cell-autonomous effect on germline growth of the InR/PI3K pathway in the follicle cells, strongly suggests that this pathway controls other genes involved in the exchanges between the two tissues.</p><p>One might ask what is the evolutive advantage of this metabolic cooperativity compared with direct import or synthesis in the germline. Three main hypotheses could be proposed. First, metabolites might not be able to directly reach oocyte membrane due to the presence of the follicular epithelium. However, in follicles from stage 1&#x02013;8, septate junctions are immature, and the epithelium is not impermeable [<xref rid="pbio.3003045.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Accordingly, our results showing a partial rescue of <italic toggle="yes">coch</italic> absence in the soma by its ectopic expression in the germline imply that its solutes can reach the oocyte. Second, female germ cells undergo massive growth and there is a non-linear relation between volume and cell surface increases. Consequently, surface exchange with the extracellular medium might not allow sufficient metabolic import and may require the support of follicle cells. This hypothesis was proposed to explain gap junction requirement for mammal oocyte growth [<xref rid="pbio.3003045.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. It could also explain why germline growth, but not somatic growth, is sensitive to the loss of <italic toggle="yes">coch</italic>, as follicular epithelium has a relatively constant height and thus increases much less in volume than the germline. However, in this case, both tissues should be able to import the required metabolites and our data does not support such a model because follicle cells expressed a whole set of anabolic enzymes and transporters that were not expressed in the germline. Alternatively, such a mechanism may provide a protective effect for the germline. It is well established that the cell metabolic activity can induce stress, with for instance, the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, the germline must be protected, especially its DNA content that is transmitted to the embryo. A recent study demonstrated that mammalian oocytes block ROS production by suppressing mitochondrial complex I [<xref rid="pbio.3003045.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Thus, a gap junction-mediated metabolic exchange might allow externalizing the stress-generating metabolic activity to follicle cells that will anyway die few days later. Notably, <italic toggle="yes">coch</italic> ectopic expression in germ cells had a slight but significant negative impact on ovary size and egg laying, suggesting that its presence in germ cells is detrimental for follicle development. Although, the exact reason for this deleterious effect is unknown, this observation fits with a model in which externalization of metabolic import and activity could facilitate proper oocyte development. However, Coch is a transporter, and not an enzyme, and thus, the protective effect might not be directly due to amino acid exclusion, but to one of the many possible downstream metabolic activities.</p><p>Altogether, our data indicate that gap junctions and a metabolic flow are essential for cell growth and that gap junction assembly can be modulated to adjust cell growth rate. Moreover, it suggests that amino acids, and potentially other metabolites, are important actors in this mechanism ending with the formation of P-bodies, opening a large field for investigation to obtain a comprehensive view of this metabolic cooperativity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec010"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec011"><title>Fly genetics and handling</title><p>All fly stocks used are detailed in <xref rid="pbio.3003045.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Table</xref>.

</p><p>Dear Dr Mirouse,</p><p>Thank you for submitting your manuscript entitled "Gap junction and amino acid import in somatic cells promote germ cell growth" for consideration as a Research Article by PLOS Biology.</p><p>Your manuscript has now been evaluated by the PLOS Biology editorial staff as well as by an academic editor with relevant expertise and I am writing to let you know that we would like to send your submission out for external peer review.</p><p>However, before we can send your manuscript to reviewers, we need you to complete your submission by providing the metadata that is required for full assessment. To this end, please login to Editorial Manager where you will find the paper in the 'Submissions Needing Revisions' folder on your homepage. Please click 'Revise Submission' from the Action Links and complete all additional questions in the submission questionnaire.</p><p>Once your full submission is complete, your paper will undergo a series of checks in preparation for peer review. After your manuscript has passed the checks it will be sent out for review. To provide the metadata for your submission, please Login to Editorial Manager (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.editorialmanager.com/pbiology" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.editorialmanager.com/pbiology</ext-link>) within two working days, i.e. by Feb 12 2024 11:59PM.</p><p>If your manuscript has been previously peer-reviewed at another journal, PLOS Biology is willing to work with those reviews in order to avoid re-starting the process. Submission of the previous reviews is entirely optional and our ability to use them effectively will depend on the willingness of the previous journal to confirm the content of the reports and share the reviewer identities. Please note that we reserve the right to invite additional reviewers if we consider that additional/independent reviewers are needed, although we aim to avoid this as far as possible.

</p><p>Dear Dr Mirouse,</p><p>Thank you for your patience while your manuscript entitled "Gap junction and amino acid import in somatic cells promote germ cell growth" was peer-reviewed at PLOS Biology. Please also accept my apologies for the delay in providing you with our decision. Your manuscript has been evaluated by the PLOS Biology editors, an Academic Editor with relevant expertise, and by three independent reviewers.</p><p>The reviews are attached below. As you will see, the reviewers find the conclusions potentially novel and interesting, but they also raise several concerns and suggest several experiments that should be performed to convincingly support the main conclusions. Reviewer 1 thinks that some of the claims should be toned down and that it would be nice to know what aspects of growth are affected in the germline (ie. endoreplication), among other issues. Reviewer 2 mentions that the experiment showing metabolic coupling between soma and germline should be improved and suggests several experiments to confirm the findings. Reviewer 3 believes you should confirm the model proposing that Inx2-Inx4 mediated amino acid exchange between somatic cells and germline cells supports oocyte growth, explore the role of calcium in the process and check if the structural component or channel function of the gap junction is responsible for the observed growth defect, among other issues.</p><p>Based on the comments and following discussion with the Academic Editor, it is clear that a substantial amount of work would be required to meet the criteria for publication in PLOS Biology. However, given our and the reviewer interest in your study, we would be open to inviting a comprehensive revision of the study that thoroughly addresses all the reviewers' comments. The only exception is that direct evidence for small molecule (aa) transfer is hard to validate, but at least we would like to see somewhat indirect evidence &#x02013; for example, Coch functioning in which cells, and leading to what phenotype, suggesting the 'most plausible explanation' as a model.</p><p>Given the extent of revision that would be needed, we cannot make a decision about publication until we have seen the revised manuscript and your response to the reviewers' comments. Your revised manuscript would need to be seen by the reviewers again, but please note that we would not engage them unless their main concerns have been addressed.</p><p>We appreciate that these requests represent a great deal of extra work, and we are willing to relax our standard revision time to allow you 6 months to revise your study. Please email us (plosbiology@plos.org) if you have any questions or concerns, or envision needing a (short) extension.</p><p>At this stage, your manuscript remains formally under active consideration at our journal; please notify us by email if you do not intend to submit a revision so that we may withdraw it.</p><p>**IMPORTANT - SUBMITTING YOUR REVISION**</p><p>Your revisions should address the specific points made by each reviewer.

Previous studies in the mouse showed that gap junctions between somatic granulosa cells and the oocyte are required for oocyte growth and that metabolic coupling between these cell types is required for oocyte growth. Growth of the somatic and germline cells within the Drosophila ovarian follicle is also coordinated as shown by this group and others. Gap junctions have been visualized between the somatic follicle cells and between follicle cells and the ooctye/nurse cell complex and, although not acknowledged here, have been shown to permit communication between the follicle cells (Ref 28). However, whether they also coordinate somatic and germline growth in the Drosophila ovary and what metabolites are transferred isn't known. Although visualizing metabolite transport is not feasible in this system, the authors use alternative and clever approaches to provide evidence that the Drosophila ovarian follicle cells influence germline growth and that they do this at least in part by supplying amino acids whose transporters are not expressed in the germline. The data are convincing and for the most part, the conclusions are well supported. As discussed below, the assertions that gap junctions coordinate growth and that gap junctions ultimately regulate translation in the germline are less convincing. The work is strong enough to rest on the data provided, so the authors simply need to temper these assertions.</p><p>The authors show that heteromeric gap junctions form between the somatic and germline cells in the Drosophila ovary whereas homomeric junctions form between follicle cells. Using RNAi and genetic mutations, the authors show convincingly that gap junctions are indeed required for germline growth, but not for follicle cell growth. The finding that they are not required for follicle cell growth indicates that they nonautonomously influence germline growth, not that they coordinate follicle cell and germline growth (see the first concern above).</p><p>To identify metabolic pathways that use these gap junctions, they cleverly isolate mRNAs that are preferentially translated in follicle cells over the germline using TRAP. The data revealed differential production of proteins involved in amino acid synthesis or import. Although there are multiple ways to interpret this result, the authors focus the remainder of the study trying to support the idea that amino acids may be taken up by follicle cells and transported to the germline through gap junctions. RNAi knockdown of one of the genes identified, CG43693 (now named coch), a member of the SLC36 family of amino acid transporters, produced an ovary growth defect and both RNA and protein expression appear specific to the follicle cells. The authors nicely combine the QUAS and UAS systems and show that ectopic expression of coch in the germline can compensate for knockdown in the follicle cells. This supports the idea that the germline requires the activity of coch and amino acid transport and because coch normally only functions in the follicle cells. Although it would be ideal to have more direct evidence, the authors argue reasonably that the data support direct metabolic exchange between somatic and germline cells.</p><p>In the remainder of the manuscript, the authors try to connect metabolic transport to the translational state of the oocyte, which I find to be much less convincing. It is clear that P bodies do form when gap junctions are eliminated or when coch is knocked down, but whether this relates to depletion of amino acids is not clear. Me31B containing P bodies form/enlarge under many different stress conditions and it seems more likely that they are a consequence of metabolic stress (from any one of many possible metabolites not considered here) rather than a specific mechanism to stop translation. Therefore, the statement that although the statement "P-body formation is linked to germ cell growth control by gap junctions and amino acid import in follicle cells" the authors should make it clear that P-body formation may be a downstream consequence rather than direct effector of this growth control.</p><p>Specific issues:</p><p>1) Why are the follicle cells unaffected in coch mutants or when gap junctions are disrupted throughout the epithelium (so there is no exchange between follicle cells)?</p><p>2) The authors refer to amino acid transport generically but with coch knockdown/mutation, only a small subset of amino acids is not transported. The authors should be careful about implying that all amino acid transport is blocked. Moreover, transport from hemolymph to the oocyte can occur directly up to stage 8, and the authors show that some transporters are expressed in the oocyte. Finally, the 5-fold enrichment threshold used to designate gene expression as specific to the follicle cells doesn't mean that there is no expression in the oocyte and without RNAi/knockdown experiments as performed for coch it is premature to conclude that there is no expression of a particular transporter in the germline.</p><p>3) It would be nice to know what aspects of growth are affected in the germline. Other effectors of growth like myc affect nurse cell endoreplication (doi: 10.1242/dev.00932). Effects endoreplication are relatively easy to assay.</p><p>4) Knockdown of other genes identified in the TRAP experiment did not result in phenotypes and the authors suggest that there may be multiple levels of redundancy. Do they have evidence that the RNAi actually worked?</p><p>5) Figure 3D and E - the resolution is too low in these figures. At the resolution shown, the RNA looks like it is cortical, which makes the result questionable.</p><p>6) For the genes whose translation is limited to the follicle cells, it would be interesting to know if they are only transcribed there and not in the nurse cells, or if their translation is controlled so that they are only translated in the follicle cells. Are there RNA seq data available that could be used to answer this?</p><p>7) The hierarchical clustering shown in Fig. S1 is not a good way to show reproducibility of results. A graph with Pearson correlation coefficients is preferable.</p><p>8) Some figures are labeled with CG43693 and some with coch (even before the name is defined). Best to be consistent throughout or to use CG43693 in the early figures and coch after the name is defined.</p><p>Rev. 2: Mayu Inaba &#x02013; note that this reviewer has signed her review</p><p>The article by Vachias et al demonstrates that gap junctions participate in metabolite transfer from somatic follicle cells to germline to support oogenesis. Using polysome-seq, which can reliably detect cell-type specific gene expression, authors identified an amino acid transporter, coch, specifically expressed in follicle cells but required for growth of germ cells. Coch knockdown phenotype in somatic FCs is rescued by ectopic expression of Coch in germline, supporting the proposed idea of metabolic exchange between these cell types. Overall, the authors perform well thought out experiments, which support a novel mechanism how somatic epithelia support oogenesis via sending amino acid through gap junctions. There are, however, some points to be consider worth revising for the overall improvement of this manuscript.</p><p>Major points:</p><p>1: As authors stated, metabolic coupling between soma and germline is solely supported by experiments shown in Fig4, in which they show coch expression in the germline can bypass its silencing in the soma. I feel this experiment needs to be done with better methods, such as checking frequency/distribution of stages of egg chambers.</p><p>2. Can inx4 RNAi in germline (or inx2 in soma) phenotypes be suppressed by expression of Coch in germline? I understand that there should be many other materials to be transferred through gap junctions, but I wonder if those amino acids could be essential for oogenesis, if so the rescue may occur even partially. On the other note, p-body formation seems to be a good lead-out and I wonder if authors can better quantify non-cell autonomy using this.</p><p>3. Can authors visualize inx2/4 patch in better resolution? In later vitelline membrane localize between germline and soma and I wonder if gap junctions are formed between microvilli.</p><p>4. The logic behind the experiments checking TOR and GCN2 function (Figure S5, line 256 to 270) is difficult to follow. It would be helpful for readers if authors can revise this portion. Especially, it is unclear why conclusion differ between previous studies and the current study.</p><p>5. Can inR effect or starvation on p body formation be cancelled by inx2 overexpression?</p><p>Minor points:</p><p>1. Quantification method of p-bodies are showing fluorescent intensity per detected p-body by taking minimum intensity of 1.75 compared with neighbouring pixels? If so, how authors quantified control?</p><p>2. fig 6D pattern of inx2 staining of surrounding wt FCs looks different from others.</p><p>Rev. 3:</p><p>The manuscript by Vachias et al have used the Drosophila oogenesis model to demonstrate that growth of the germline cells is dependent on the overlying somatic follicle cells. Employing classical genetics and by examining gap junction proteins, the authors claim that the communication through the gap junctions (Inx2 - Inx4) across soma and germline is critical for the growth of germ cells during oogenesis. In an effort to identify the nature of the molecule that may be passing through the Inx2-Inx4 heteromeric channel, the authors undertook a translatomic approach and narrowed down on a predicted amino acid transporter, CG43693. By depleting CG43693 function the authors claim that CG43693 is functioning in the follicle cells to support the germline growth. Finally by employing immunohistochemistry and epistasis experiments authors propose Inx2 functions down stream of Insulin signaling/ PI3K pathway in the follicle cells to facilitate germline growth. Overall the model proposed by the authors is quite novel but the primary claim needs further validation before it can be accepted. My comments are listed below.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>1. The genetic evidence provided here doesn't unequivocally support the proposed model that Inx2- Inx4 mediated amino acid exchange between somatic cells and germline cells supports oocyte growth. This needs to be demonstrated more convincingly.</p><p>2. The function of CG43693 gene needs to be validated before it can be accepted as an as an amino acid transporter in the proposed model.</p><p>3. The aspect that Inx2- Inx4 colocalization is dependent on each other in developing egg chambers is a repeat of what has been shown by Sahu et al in 2021. How does adding similar data help in Fig 1.</p><p>4. Figure 1G, L- Did the authors check the status of sub apical Inx2 in the follicle cells when Inx4 was depleted from the germline cells?</p><p>5. Since the distribution of CG43693 is mostly apical and lateral in the follicle cells, it is difficult for one to understand as to how the aminoacids are internalized in the follicle cells? One would presume that uptake of amino acid may be facilitated from the basal side which is exposed to outside.</p><p>6. Since Inx2-Inx4 heteromeric channels have been previously demonstrated (Sahu et al 2021) to mediate calcium flow between follicle cells and nurse cells, have the authors checked if the calcium could play a role in this process?</p><p>7. As Inx2 is known to physically associate with DE-Cadherin and Armadillo (Bauer et al 2006), it will be important for the authors to check if the structural component or channel function of the gap junction is responsible for the observed growth defect. It will be worth checking the localization of CG43693- GFP in the follicle cells in Inx2 and Inx4 depleted backgrounds.</p><p>8. The authors are assessing the overall size of the ovary as readout for the germline growth. Since the size of the ovary can also be regulated by the number of ovarioles, it would be best to verify the results at the level of egg chambers (stage distribution and size) (Fig 3A-B, Fig 4).</p><p>9. Did the authors try to rescue the germ line growth defect induced Inx2RNAi by over expressing coch in the germline itself? Something along the lines of Fig 4.</p><p>10. The nature of the P bodies observed is different when Inx2 is down regulated in the follicle cell (Fig 5F) compared when coch RNAi is overexpressed in the follicle cell (Fig 5H). In Fig 5F the P bodies are punctate while in Fig 5H it seems more filamentous. Did the authors evaluate the P bodies when Inx4 was depleted in the germline cells.</p><p>11. Have the authors attempted to rescue the effects of coch-RNAi by supplementing the ovaries under live culture conditions with amino acids?</p><p>Minor comments:</p><p>1. How was the follicle volume calculated? The Materials &#x00026; Methods section needs to be more elaborate.</p><p>2. How do the authors arrive at the statement that "Thus, both CG43693 tissue distribution and subcellular localization were in agreement with the hypothesis that it is implicated in the import of amino acids to promote follicle growth."</p><p>3. Could the TOR signaling in the follicle cells affect oocyte growth in the same ways as the authors observed for Inx2?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="pbio.3003045.r005"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pbio.3003045.r005</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response to Decision Letter 1</article-title></title-group><related-article ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.1371/journal.pbio.3003045" id="rel-obj005" related-article-type="editor-report"/><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>Submission Version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></front-stub><body><p>

My concerns still remain, as we still lack mechanistic insight as to how Inx2 is regulating oocyte growth. Given that their findings are novel in the context of the role of Inx2 and CG43693 in oocyte growth, but due to technical challenges, the authors are not able to support their hypothesis conclusively.

Though the authors attempted to rule out the structural role of Inx2 in oocyte growth, the results were negative (Response to point no 7 for R3). In light of this result, it is difficult to accept that the channel activity of the Inx2 in the follicle cell is indeed modulating the germline growth.</p><p>2. The implication of amino acid downstream of Inx2 in oocyte growth is still speculative.</p><p>3. The function of the CG43693 gene is being proposed based on deep phylogenetic exploration. As this gene is an important part of this model, it would have been best to demonstrate its function under in vitro or in vivo conditions.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="pbio.3003045.r007"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pbio.3003045.r007</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response to Decision Letter 2</article-title></title-group><related-article ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.1371/journal.pbio.3003045" id="rel-obj007" related-article-type="editor-report"/><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>Submission Version</meta-name><meta-value>3</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></front-stub><body><p>
