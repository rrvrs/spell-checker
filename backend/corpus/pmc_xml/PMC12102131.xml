The findings showed that CVC treatment did not significantly modify baseline oxidative stress levels in healthy rats but successfully alleviated ISO-induced oxidative damage by augmenting antioxidant enzyme activity and diminishing lipid peroxidation, as demonstrated by a reduction in MDA levels. These findings indicate that CVC can reinstate antioxidant capability and reduce oxidative damage. Concerning neuroinflammation, ISO therapy markedly increased the expression of pro-inflammatory markers, including TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-1&#x003b2;, c-Fos, BDNF, Nfl, and GFP, signifying a robust inflammatory and damage response. The injection of CVC following ISO exposure markedly decreased the expression of these markers, suggesting that CVC may exert a neuroprotective effect by regulating the inflammatory response and mitigating neuronal and glial damage. CVC demonstrated a notable protective effect on mitochondrial integrity, evidenced by the decreased mRNA expression of mitochondrial damage markers, including NSE, s100B, CALP1, and CALM1 in the CVC-treated groups, showing that CVC mitigates mitochondrial dysfunction. The analysis revealed no significant alterations in the expression levels of A&#x003b2;40, pTau181, and tTau across all groups, indicating that these biomarkers were not substantially influenced by CVC treatment under the study&#x02019;s conditions. However, &#x003b2;-amyloid accumulation varied significantly between groups, highlighting the need for further research to explore CVC&#x02019;s potential implications in amyloid-related diseases. These findings endorse CVC&#x02019;s neuroprotective efficacy and therapeutic potential in neurological disorders associated with oxidative stress, inflammation, and mitochondrial impairment.</p><sec><title>Graphical abstract</title><p id="Par2">

It is structurally analogous to adrenaline, a naturally occurring catecholamine in the body, and replicates many of its physiological actions. Adrenaline activates alpha-adrenergic receptors to elicit various biological responses, whereas ISO predominantly functions as a beta-adrenergic agonist, exerting its most significant effects on beta-1 and beta-2 adrenergic receptors, with a comparatively weak influence on alpha receptors (Kahn et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">1969</xref>). This selective action enables ISO to elicit specific effects, including elevated heart rate, bronchodilation, and vasodilation. These characteristics render ISO beneficial for treating ailments such as bradycardia and respiratory disorders like asthma. Owing to its structural and physiological parallels with adrenaline, ISO has emerged as a significant instrument in pharmacological research and the formulation of novel therapeutic techniques.</p><p id="Par4">High dosages of ISO can cause myocardial ischemia (Keihanian et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2021</xref>; Lan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2022</xref>). This ischemia arises from ISO&#x02019;s strong positive inotropic and positive chronotropic effects on the heart. These effects elevate myocardial oxygen demand, diminish diastolic filling pressure and coronary perfusion pressure, ultimately resulting in ischemic alterations in the myocardium. The resultant changes resemble those seen after a myocardial infarction in people (Tiwari et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2009</xref>). If myocardial ischemia persists for an extended period, it can lead to a reduced oxygen supply throughout the body, potentially causing brain damage due to insufficient oxygenation. However, there is limited information and clarity regarding the exact relationship between prolonged myocardial ischemia and its direct effects on the brain.</p><p id="Par5">Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is a type of brain injury caused by hypoxia and diminished cerebral blood flow, resulting in mortality and enduring neurological consequences (Dumbuya et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2021</xref>; Garcia-Alix et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2024</xref>). The manifestation of HIE is an ongoing process that results in neuronal cell death within hours following the first insult. In the initial phase, ischemia and hypoxia cause a depletion of cellular energy, leading to oxidative metabolic failure, accumulation of excitotoxic chemicals, cell death, intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload, and edema. The subsequent phase is the latent phase, during which the body reinstates respiration and cerebral circulation; nevertheless, this process results in reperfusion injury and oxidative stress. Neuroinflammation and mitochondrial malfunction arise during this period, activating pro-apoptotic signaling pathways (C&#x000e1;novas-Ahedo and Alonso-Alconada <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2019</xref>; Andelius et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2020</xref>; Ranjan and Gulati <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2023</xref>). This leads to secondary energy failure, termed delayed neuronal death, which exacerbates cell death, excitotoxicity, and the delayed maturation of oligodendrocytes. Chronic inflammation and epigenetic modifications may result in enduring cerebral damage, which can last for weeks, months, or even years, ultimately inflicting considerable detriment to the body. The pathogenesis of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) primarily encompasses mechanisms including hypoxia-ischemia, reperfusion injury, inflammation, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, excitotoxicity, ferroptosis, endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS), cellular swelling, impaired maturation, and apoptosis (Molloy et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2024</xref>).</p><p id="Par6">Since antiquity, plant-derived products and their derivatives have been esteemed as sources of medicinal substances. Currently, essential oils and extracts from diverse plant sources are being investigated for their potential as antioxidant agents. Thyme is a plant that has historically served as both a spice and a medicinal remedy. Carvacrol (CVC), a monoterpene phenol characterized by a structure including two connected isoprene units, was initially discovered in thyme and subsequently recognized in the essential oils of various other aromatic plants (Can Baser <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2008</xref>; Gandova et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2023</xref>; M&#x00105;czka et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2023</xref>; Chaachouay and Zidane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2024</xref>). Currently, CVC is extensively employed in the food and cosmetics sectors. Multiple studies have emphasized its antifungal, antibacterial, and antioxidant characteristics (Imran et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2022</xref>). Furthermore, CVC has several advantageous effects, such as antimutagenic, antigenotoxic, antispasmodic, angiogenic, antiparasitic, insecticidal, and antihepatotoxic properties. In addition to its many beneficial effects, CVC also possesses regenerative properties. Numerous studies have further supported its antioxidant activity. CVC is considered an effective antioxidant due to the presence of a hydroxyl group (OH-) in its chemical structure. When examining the relationship between thyme&#x02019;s antioxidant properties and its chemical compounds, it has been demonstrated that the antioxidant activity is directly related to the concentration of antioxidants present (Can Baser <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2008</xref>; Imran et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2022</xref>; Gandova et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2023</xref>; M&#x00105;czka et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2023</xref>; Chroho et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2024</xref>; Chaachouay and Zidane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2024</xref>). Research has also shown that CVC exerts neuroprotective effects in both mice and rats. The neuroprotective potential of CVC is primarily attributed to its ability to reduce lipid peroxidation and prevent cell death (Li et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2016</xref>; Dati et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2017</xref>; Cical&#x00103;u et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2021</xref>; Shah et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2024</xref>).</p><p id="Par7">The S100B protein is part of a multigenic family of low molecular weight (9&#x02013;13 kD) calcium-binding S100 proteins. S100B is predominantly found in glial cells of the central nervous system, particularly in astrocytes (Donato <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">1986</xref>; Heizmann et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2002</xref>). Enolases are glycolytic enzymes that exist as a sequence of dimeric isoenzymes composed of three immunologically different subunits: the &#x003b1;, &#x003b2;, and &#x003b3; chains. The isoforms &#x003b3; &#x003b3; and &#x003b1; &#x003b3; are confined to neurons, peripheral neuroendocrine tissue, and malignancies associated with the amine precursor uptake and degradation system (Cooper <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">1994</xref>). Calmodulin (CaM) is a versatile calcium ion sensor protein that mediates a significant portion of calcium signaling. CaM is a dumbbell-shaped protein with two structurally similar globular domains, each featuring a pair of EF-hand calcium-binding motifs, interconnected by an elongated flexible central helix (Ikura and Ames <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2006</xref>).</p><p id="Par8">In this study, we characterized the extent of brain damage induced by ISO administration, highlighting the underlying mechanisms of neuronal injury.

However, in the ISO +&#x02009;CVC50 group, neuronal damage in the cerebral cortex was markedly reduced, and a statistically significant improvement was observed compared to the ISO and ISO +&#x02009;CVC25 groups (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>e, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c; 0.05, Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).</p><p id="Par57">In the hippocampal CA3 region, a large number of Nissl bodies were evident in the cytoplasm of neurons within the polymorphic cell layer in the control and CVC50 groups (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>f and h). Conversely, the hippocampal CA3 region of rats treated with ISO showed pathological congestion, shrunken hyperchromatic pyknotic nuclei, and cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>i).

The findings offer significant insights into the preventive function of CVC against the detrimental effects of oxidative stress and cerebral damage. The results indicate that CVC significantly influences oxidative stress markers, neuroinflammatory pathways, mitochondrial damage, and particular brain injury markers, hence reinforcing its potential as a neuroprotective drug.</p><p id="Par60">Oxidative stress significantly contributes to cellular damage and is crucial in numerous neurological illnesses (Pizzino et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2017</xref>; Salim <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2017</xref>; Dash et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2024</xref>). This study&#x02019;s investigation of oxidative stress markers revealed that CVC administration did not significantly affect the baseline levels of antioxidant enzymes, including SOD, CAT, GSH, and GPx, in both the control and CVC-treated groups. This indicates that CVC, when given independently, does not disrupt normal antioxidant defense mechanisms in physiological settings. Nonetheless, under ISO-induced oxidative stress, a notable decrease in these antioxidant enzymes was recorded, alongside a substantial rise in MDA, a marker of lipid peroxidation. These findings align with prior research that emphasizes ISO&#x02019;s capacity to provoke oxidative stress, resulting in a compromised antioxidant defense mechanism and ensuing cellular damage (Sharma et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2023</xref>).</p><p id="Par61">Notably, in the CVC-treated groups after ISO delivery, the levels of SOD, CAT, GSH, and GPx were dramatically restored, indicating that CVC possesses a potent antioxidative action, presumably by augmenting the antioxidant defense system. Moreover, the noted reduction in MDA levels offers conclusive proof that CVC alleviates lipid peroxidation and oxidative damage. The findings highlight the therapeutic efficacy of CVC in mitigating oxidative damage, a characteristic of numerous neurodegenerative disorders. The restoration of antioxidant enzyme levels and the lowering of MDA levels indicate that CVC may be efficacious in mitigating oxidative stress-related disorders by enhancing cellular resilience and preventing additional damage.</p><p id="Par62">Neuroinflammation is a significant factor in neurological injury, especially as a reaction to oxidative stress (Adegbola et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2017</xref>; Giri et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2024</xref>; Suleiman Khoury et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2024</xref>; Mao et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2024</xref>). Our investigation demonstrated that ISO-induced damage resulted in a substantial increase in the expression levels of critical inflammatory and injury-related markers, including TNF-alpha, IL-1&#x003b2;, c-Fos, BDNF, Nfl, and GFP. These markers are acknowledged as biomarkers of neuroinflammation, neuronal activity, and damage (Culjak et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2021</xref>; Zhang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2024</xref>), with their increase signifying a robust inflammatory and injury response subsequent to ISO treatment. Elevated levels of TNF-alpha and IL-1&#x003b2; indicate a significant pro-inflammatory condition, although changes in c-Fos and BDNF signify the activation of neural plasticity and activity in response to injury.</p><p id="Par63">CVC injection after ISO exposure led to a notable decrease in the expression of these markers. The decrease in TNF-alpha and IL-1&#x003b2; indicates that CVC successfully mitigates the inflammatory response triggered by ISO. The downregulation of c-Fos and BDNF suggests that CVC may influence neuronal plasticity and activity, thereby reducing neuronal damage and facilitating recovery. Moreover, the reduced expression of Nfl and GFP, indicators of neuronal and glial damage, reinforces the neuroprotective properties of CVC. These results align with other research demonstrating the importance of neuroinflammation in the advancement of neurodegenerative disorders, and the outcomes of this study underscore CVC&#x02019;s potential in mitigating neuroinflammatory responses and safeguarding against neuronal damage (Zamanian et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2021</xref>; Azizi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2022</xref>).</p><p id="Par64">Mitochondrial malfunction is pivotal to several types of cellular damage and is significantly associated with neurodegenerative disorders (Hroudov&#x000e1; et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2014</xref>; Norat et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2020</xref>; Alqahtani et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2023</xref>; Zong et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2024</xref>). This work evaluated the mRNA expression levels of mitochondrial damage indicators (NSE, s100B, CALP1, and CALM1) to evaluate the effects of ISO-induced mitochondrial stress. As anticipated, ISO therapy resulted in a substantial elevation of mRNA levels for these markers, indicating that ISO promotes mitochondrial dysfunction and activates cellular damage pathways. This augmentation aligns with prior research emphasizing ISO&#x02019;s adverse impact on cellular integrity, particularly concerning mitochondrial impairment (Naaz et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2020</xref>; Qian et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2024</xref>).</p><p id="Par65">CVC treatment following ISO exposure led to a notable decrease in the expression levels of mitochondrial damage markers. This reduction suggests that CVC may confer a protective impact on mitochondrial function, presumably by mitigating the oxidative and cellular stress caused by ISO. The restoration of mitochondrial damage markers indicates that CVC may aid in maintaining mitochondrial integrity, potentially mitigating the advancement of mitochondrial dysfunction and associated cellular damage. These findings are significant, indicating that CVC may contribute to mitochondrial protection, a domain that requires more exploration due to its relevance in numerous neurodegenerative disorders.</p><p id="Par66">&#x003b2;-amyloid accumulation plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease (Solis et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2020</xref>; Celik Topkara et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2022</xref>; Caputo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2023</xref>; Tareen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2024</xref>). In this study, &#x003b2;-amyloid levels were significantly elevated in the ISO group, suggesting that ISO exposure may promote amyloid buildup. CVC treatment led to a marked reduction in &#x003b2;-amyloid levels, indicating its potential role in modulating amyloid metabolism. The observed decrease in &#x003b2;-amyloid accumulation suggests that CVC may counteract ISO-induced disruptions, thereby alleviating the amyloid burden. This finding points to a potential neuroprotective mechanism of CVC, which may involve regulating &#x003b2;-amyloid production, enhancing clearance, or preventing aggregation. However, given the complex interplay of amyloid metabolism, deposition, and clearance pathways, further studies are needed to elucidate the precise mechanisms through which CVC exerts its effects.</p><p id="Par67">This study evaluated the impact of CVC on specific markers often linked to neurodegenerative disorders, including Abeta40, pTau181, and tTau. These indicators are frequently raised in illnesses such as Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease and are routinely employed to evaluate neuronal damage and tauopathies (Delaby et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2022</xref>; Park et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2024</xref>). Nonetheless, this analysis revealed no statistically significant alterations in the expression levels of Abeta40, pTau181, and tTau across all experimental groups. This indicates that, within the experimental parameters and duration of the investigation, the concentrations of these particular biomarkers were not substantially influenced by ISO therapy or CVC administration. Considering that ISO is known to trigger various clinical processes, additional studies with prolonged exposure or varying experimental conditions are needed to elucidate the exact mechanisms underlying the absence of notable alterations in these markers.</p><p id="Par68">This study&#x02019;s findings illustrate the protective benefits of CVC, especially at elevated doses, against ISO-induced histopathological damage in the cerebral cortex and hippocampal CA3 region (Zare Mehrjerdi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2020</xref>). In the ISO group, considerable neuronal injury was noted, including necrosis, gliosis, and neuronophagia in the cerebral cortex, with congestion and necrotic alterations in the hippocampal CA3 area. These results align with the established neurotoxic effects of ISO, which provokes oxidative stress and inflammation, resulting in cellular damage (Khan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2024</xref>). CVC, a phenolic monoterpene known for its established antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, demonstrated the ability to alleviate these pathogenic alterations in a dose-dependent fashion. The ISO +&#x02009;CVC25 group had only moderate enhancement, but the ISO +&#x02009;CVC50 group displayed markedly decreased neuronal necrosis and enhanced histological integrity in both the cerebral cortex and hippocampal CA3 region. The decrease in neuronal damage indicates that CVC may have protective effects by mitigating ISO-induced oxidative stress and inflammation, as evidenced by prior research emphasizing its neuroprotective capabilities (Javed et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2023</xref>).</p><p id="Par69">The maintenance of Nissl bodies in hippocampal neurons and the decreased extent of eosinophilic necrosis in the cerebral cortex further highlight the effectiveness of CVC at elevated doses (Amooheydari et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2022</xref>). These findings correspond with previous studies highlighting CVC&#x02019;s significance in maintaining neuronal integrity and functionality under stress situations.</p><p id="Par70">The notable enhancement seen in the ISO +&#x02009;CVC50 group underscores the therapeutic efficacy of CVC in alleviating neurodegenerative mechanisms linked to oxidative and inflammatory injury. Additional research is necessary to investigate the fundamental molecular pathways and assess its enduring protective effects across various neurotoxic models.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par71">This study concludes that CVC exerts a protective effect against ISO-induced oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Findings suggest that CVC enhances antioxidant defenses, reduces inflammatory responses, and mitigates mitochondrial damage, potentially offering therapeutic benefits for conditions associated with oxidative and inflammatory stress. The impact of CVC on ISO-induced &#x003b2;-amyloid accumulation and key neurodegenerative biomarkers, such as A&#x003b2;40, pTau181, and tTau, remains unclear due to the complexity of amyloid and tau metabolism. While &#x003b2;-amyloid accumulation was significantly affected, these specific markers showed no notable changes, suggesting that further research is necessary to delineate CVC&#x02019;s precise role in amyloid metabolism and its implications for neurodegenerative diseases. Overall, these findings underscore CVC&#x02019;s potential as a neuroprotective agent and highlight the need for future studies with different time points and dosages to explore its broader therapeutic applications in neurodegenerative disorders.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.</p><p>
