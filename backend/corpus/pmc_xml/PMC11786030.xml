A significant challenge in lowering breast cancer death rates is multidrug resistance. This resistance arises through various mechanisms, such as heightened drug efflux, improved DNA repair, escape from senescence, epigenetic modifications, tumor heterogeneity, alterations in the tumor microenvironment (TME), and the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). These factors collectively make overcoming drug resistance particularly difficult. Therefore, in this study, we analyzed data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and identified a novel gene, galectin-8, which plays a critical regulatory role in breast cancer progression. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) further revealed that galectin-8 is involved in modulating drug resistance in breast cancer. To validate this finding, we conducted a mass assay comparing drug-resistant triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell lines with control groups. Our results demonstrated a significant increase in galectin-8 expression in the drug-resistant cells, with statistically significant differences observed. In addition, we found that reducing galectin-8 expression in drug-resistant cell lines not only reinstated the effectiveness of anticancer drugs but also suppressed tumor cell proliferation and migration. Therefore, our findings highlight the significant prognostic and therapeutic potential of galectin-8, emphasizing the importance of future research to explore targeted therapeutic strategies in breast cancer.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>galectin-8</kwd><kwd>breast cancer</kwd><kwd>drug resistant</kwd><kwd>prognosis</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed malignancy in women worldwide, and it remains the leading cause of cancer-related deaths. Globally, over 2 million women are diagnosed with breast cancer each year, with mortality primarily driven by the emergence of resistance to conventional treatments <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>. Despite advancements in therapeutic strategies such as surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and the development of targeted therapies, the success of these treatments is often limited by the development of multidrug resistance (MDR) <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>. MDR is a complex phenomenon that involves multiple mechanisms, including increased drug efflux through ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, enhanced DNA repair capacity, epigenetic alterations, and changes in the tumor microenvironment (TME), all of which contribute to the survival of cancer cells even in the presence of cytotoxic agents <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>. These resistance mechanisms are particularly problematic in aggressive subtypes of breast cancer, such as triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), which lacks expression of hormone receptors and HER2, making it more difficult to treat with conventional therapies <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>. As a result, overcoming MDR in breast cancer remains a critical challenge in improving patient outcomes.</p><p>One of the emerging factors implicated in tumor progression and resistance is galectin-8, a member of the galectin family of &#x003b2;-galactoside-binding proteins. Galectins are known to regulate a variety of biological processes, including cell adhesion, migration, immune response modulation, and apoptosis <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>. Galectin-8, in particular, has been shown to be overexpressed in several types of cancer, including breast cancer, and its presence is associated with poor clinical outcomes <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>. Studies have revealed that galectin-8 plays a crucial role in promoting tumor growth and metastasis by modulating the tumor microenvironment. Galectin-8 can facilitate immune evasion by recruiting immunosuppressive cells, such as myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and regulatory T cells (Tregs), while simultaneously reducing the infiltration and activity of cytotoxic CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>. This immune-suppressive environment allows cancer cells to evade immune surveillance and contributes to tumor progression. Additionally, galectin-8 is involved in the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a key process that enables cancer cells to acquire invasive and metastatic properties, as well as resistance to chemotherapy <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>. Given these roles, galectin-8 is thought to be a significant player in the development of drug resistance in breast cancer.</p><p>Given its multifaceted roles in promoting tumor progression and immune evasion, galectin-8 has emerged as a potential therapeutic target in breast cancer. However, the specific role of galectin-8 in the development of drug resistance remains poorly understood. In this study, we aim to explore the expression levels of galectin-8 in drug-resistant breast cancer cell lines and investigate its potential role in promoting the MDR phenotype. By elucidating the molecular mechanisms by which galectin-8 contributes to drug resistance, we hope to identify new therapeutic strategies that target galectin-8 to overcome resistance in breast cancer. This could ultimately lead to improved treatment outcomes for patients with breast cancer, particularly those with drug-resistant tumors <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>. Furthermore, the study will evaluate the potential of galectin-8 as a prognostic marker, offering insight into its utility in predicting treatment responses and guiding therapy decisions in breast cancer management.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Cell lines, cell culture conditions, and drugs</title><p>All the cell lines utilized in this study were sourced from the American Type Culture Collection.

The study aimed to compare LGALS8 expression between normal and cancerous tissues, assess promoter methylation levels, and evaluate its impact on patient survival. First, we analyzed LGALS8 RNA expression levels across normal and breast cancer tissues. The results indicated significantly higher galectin-8 expression in breast cancer tissues compared to normal tissues (Fig. <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A). Additionally, we assessed galectin-8 promoter methylation levels, where beta values ranging from 0 (unmethylated) to 1 (fully methylated) were used. Hyper-methylation was defined with beta values between 0.7 and 0.5, and hypo-methylation with values between 0.3 and 0.25 (PMID: 29027401, 23291739). This differential methylation may influence galectin-8 expression in breast cancer. At the protein level, galectin-8 expression was quantified using Z-values, representing standard deviations from the median across breast cancer samples. The log2 spectral count ratio values from the CPTAC were normalized within each sample profile and across samples. Analysis revealed that galectin-8 protein levels were notably elevated in breast cancer tissues, particularly in stage 2 and stage 3 (mid-to-late stage) breast cancer (Fig. <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B). This confirmed that galectin-8 protein levels were elevated in breast cancer tissues, further supporting its role in cancer progression. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis demonstrated a significant correlation between galectin-8 expression and overall survival (OS). Patients with higher galectin-8 expression showed notably shorter OS compared to those with lower expression levels (Fig. <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>C). This suggests that elevated galectin-8 expression is associated with poorer prognosis in breast cancer patients. Therefore, our findings underscore the potential significance of galectin-8 as a biomarker for breast cancer progression and prognosis. Its increased expression, coupled with promoter methylation changes, highlights its importance in aggressive tumor behavior and survival outcomes, making it a potential therapeutic target in breast cancer.</p></sec><sec><title>Gene set enrichment analysis for comparison of high and low expressed galectin-8 from TCGA breast cancer</title><p>The Gene ENrichment Identifier (GENI) platform was employed to compare gene expression profiles of high and low galectin-8 (LGALS8) expression groups, ranking them against known biological gene sets. This analysis was conducted using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to identify pathways influenced by galectin-8 expression and its potential role in breast cancer progression and therapy resistance. The dot plot analysis revealed several gene sets that were significantly upregulated and downregulated in the high galectin-8 expression group (Fig. <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A). On the Y-axis, the upregulated gene sets were primarily associated with oncogenic processes such as tumor invasion, metastasis, and immune suppression, while the downregulated gene sets were involved in normal cellular functions. This result suggests that elevated galectin-8 expression enhances pathways that promote breast cancer aggressiveness and downregulates mechanisms that maintain normal cellular activity. A correlation network was constructed to depict the relationships between these gene sets (Fig. <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B). The network showed strong connections among gene sets related to EMT, immune evasion, and therapy resistance. These interconnections indicate that galectin-8 plays a central role in linking processes that drive tumor invasiveness, suppress the immune response, and enable cancer cells to resist treatments. Interestingly, the basal-like subtype of breast cancer, which is known for its poor prognosis and lack of hormone receptors, was highly enriched in the high galectin-8 expression group (Fig. <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>C). This is a critical finding as the basal subtype is typically associated with higher rates of drug resistance and a more aggressive clinical course. The enrichment of basal subtype characteristics in the high galectin-8 expression group underscores the importance of galectin-8 in driving aggressive tumor behaviors. Additionally, GSEA analysis revealed that galectin-8 plays a pivotal role in mediating therapy resistance, particularly in the context of drug-resistant breast cancer subtypes, such as TNBC (Fig. <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>D). The enrichment of pathways related to drug resistance in the high galectin-8 expression group suggests that galectin-8 may contribute to resistance mechanisms, potentially by promoting cellular processes like enhanced drug efflux, DNA repair, and evasion of apoptosis. These findings highlight galectin-8 as a potential therapeutic target for overcoming drug resistance in breast cancer. Overall, this analysis emphasizes the critical role of galectin-8 in breast cancer progression, particularly in the aggressive basal-like subtype, and its involvement in driving both EMT and therapy resistance. Targeting galectin-8 could provide new therapeutic strategies to treat resistant forms of breast cancer, improving patient outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>The expression of galectin-8 in TNBC cell lines</title><p>To further investigate the role of galectin-8 in TNBC, we analyzed its expression in drug-resistant and normal cell lines. Mass spectrometry and Western blotting were employed to evaluate galectin-8 expression in TNBC models, comparing drug-resistant variants and non-tumorigenic mammary epithelial cells. Mass spectrometry analysis revealed that galectin-8 expression was significantly upregulated in the Tarceva-resistant MDA-MB-231 cells compared to the parental MDA-MB-231 cell line (Fig. <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A). The increase in galectin-8 expression in the drug-resistant cell line suggests that galectin-8 may contribute to therapy resistance mechanisms, potentially promoting cell survival and metastasis under treatment pressure. In addition, Western blot analysis was performed to assess galectin-8 expression across several TNBC cell lines and compared to the normal mammary epithelial cell line MCF10A (Fig. <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B). The results demonstrated elevated galectin-8 expression in TNBC cell lines compared to MCF10A, further supporting the hypothesis that galectin-8 plays a critical role in the progression and aggressiveness of TNBC. This increase in expression may also indicate the involvement of galectin-8 in facilitating drug resistance, making it a potential therapeutic target for TNBC treatment. These findings highlight the significant overexpression of galectin-8 in both drug-resistant and TNBC cells, suggesting that targeting galectin-8 could be a promising approach for overcoming resistance in TNBC and improving treatment outcomes for patients with aggressive breast cancer subtypes.</p></sec><sec><title>The expression of galectin-8 in TNBC-tarceva resistant cells</title><p>To further elucidate the role of galectin-8 in Tarceva-resistant TNBC cells, we examined its expression at both the protein and mRNA levels using Western blot and qPCR analyses. These techniques were applied to evaluate the changes in galectin-8 expression between parental and Tarceva-resistant TNBC cell lines. Western blot analysis was performed to compare galectin-8 protein levels between the parental MDA-MB-231 cells and the Tarceva-resistant variant (TR50) (Fig. <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A). The results showed a marked increase in galectin-8 expression in the Tarceva-resistant cells relative to the parental line, suggesting that galectin-8 may contribute to the resistance mechanism by modulating cellular processes associated with drug evasion. In addition, qPCR analysis was conducted to assess galectin-8 mRNA levels, further confirming the upregulation of this gene in Tarceva-resistant cells. This increase in mRNA levels is consistent with the observed rise in protein expression, indicating that the regulation of galectin-8 occurs at the transcriptional level as well. Similarly, we analyzed another TNBC cell line, BT-549, comparing the parental cells with the Tarceva-resistant TR50 variant (Fig. <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>B). Both Western blot and qPCR results revealed a significant upregulation of galectin-8 in the Tarceva-resistant BT-549 cells. These findings further support the hypothesis that galectin-8 plays a critical role in developing drug resistance in TNBC cells, as its expression is consistently elevated across different resistant cell lines. In summary, these results from both Western blot and qPCR demonstrate a consistent upregulation of galectin-8 in TNBC cells that have developed resistance to Tarceva, highlighting its potential as a key regulator of therapy resistance. Targeting galectin-8 may offer a novel therapeutic approach to overcoming drug resistance in TNBC.</p></sec><sec><title>Knockdown of galectin-8 decreases cell proliferation in tarceva-resistant TNBC cells</title><p>To investigate the role of galectin-8 in Tarceva-resistant TNBC cells, we performed knockdown experiments to assess its impact on cell proliferation and drug sensitivity. Using shRNA constructs targeting galectin-8, we successfully reduced its expression in Tarceva-resistant MDA-MB-231 and BT-549 cells. Our goal was to evaluate whether decreasing galectin-8 expression could suppress the proliferation of these resistant cancer cells and restore their sensitivity to Tarceva treatment. After confirming the effective knockdown of galectin-8 via qPCR and Western blot, we conducted cell proliferation assays. The results showed a significant reduction in cell proliferation in Tarceva-resistant MDA-MB-231 cells following galectin-8 knockdown (Fig. <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>A). This indicates that galectin-8 is essential for the proliferation of these drug-resistant cells. Similarly, in the Tarceva-resistant BT-549 cells, knockdown of galectin-8 also resulted in a marked decrease in cell proliferation, further supporting the critical role of galectin-8 in maintaining the growth and survival of Tarceva-resistant TNBC cells (Fig. <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>B). Additionally, an MTT assay was performed to examine the effect of different concentrations of Tarceva (5, 10, 25, and 50 &#x000b5;M) on MDA-MB-231, Tarceva-resistant MDA-MB-231TR cells, and galectin-8 knockdown MDA-MB-231TR cells. The cells were treated with Tarceva for 24 and 48 hours. At the 50 &#x000b5;M concentration of Tarceva, we observed that knockdown of galectin-8 in the MDA-MB-231TR cells led to the loss of drug resistance, with a significant decrease in cell viability (Fig. <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>C). This suggests that inhibiting galectin-8 restores the sensitivity of resistant cells to Tarceva treatment. These findings demonstrate that galectin-8 plays a key role in both the proliferation and drug resistance of TNBC cells. Targeting galectin-8 through knockdown or pharmacological inhibition not only reduces the proliferation of resistant cells but also restores their sensitivity to Tarceva, providing a potential therapeutic approach to overcoming drug resistance in TNBC.</p></sec><sec><title>Knockdown of galectin-8 influences cell migration in tarceva-resistant TNBC cells</title><p>To further investigate the role of galectin-8 in Tarceva-resistant TNBC cells, we assessed its impact on cell migration following galectin-8 knockdown. Two complementary assays, the Transwell assay and the IncuCyte assay, were used to evaluate changes in cell migration behavior. In the Transwell assay, we compared the migration capacity of galectin-8 knockdown Tarceva-resistant MDA-MB-231 cells with that of the control Tarceva-resistant cells. The results revealed a significant reduction in the migration of cells in which galectin-8 was silenced (Fig. <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>A). This suggests that galectin-8 plays a critical role in facilitating the migration of Tarceva-resistant TNBC cells, potentially contributing to their invasive potential. The IncuCyte assay further validated the effect of galectin-8 knockdown on cell migration. In this assay, real-time monitoring of cell movement showed that galectin-8 knockdown Tarceva-resistant cells exhibited a substantial decrease in migration speed and distance compared to the control cells (Fig. <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>B). This real-time analysis reinforces the finding that galectin-8 is a key driver of cell motility in drug-resistant TNBC cells. Together, these findings indicate that galectin-8 not only supports cell proliferation and therapy resistance in TNBC cells but also promotes their migratory and invasive capabilities. Targeting galectin-8 could provide a dual benefit by reducing both the proliferation and metastatic potential of drug-resistant TNBC cells.</p></sec><sec><title>The EMT marker expression after knockdown of galectin-8 in MDA-MB-231 resistant cells</title><p>To further investigate the effect of galectin-8 knockdown on EMT, we examined the expression of key EMT markers in Tarceva-resistant MDA-MB-231 cells. Both Western blot and PCR analyses were used to assess the changes in EMT-related proteins and transcription factors after galectin-8 knockdown. The Western blot analysis showed a significant increase in the epithelial marker E-cadherin following galectin-8 knockdown, indicating a shift towards an epithelial phenotype. At the same time, the expression of mesenchymal markers N-cadherin and vimentin was substantially reduced, suggesting a reversal of the EMT process (Fig. <xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>A). These changes indicate that knockdown of galectin-8 may inhibit the EMT process, which is often associated with decreased invasiveness and metastatic potential in cancer cells. In the PCR analysis, we focused on the expression of ZEB1 and ZEB2, two transcription factors known to regulate the EMT process. Knockdown of galectin-8 resulted in a marked reduction in the mRNA levels of both ZEB1 and ZEB2 (Fig. <xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>B), further supporting the notion that galectin-8 plays a role in driving the EMT program in Tarceva-resistant cells. These transcription factors are critical for maintaining the mesenchymal state, and their downregulation following galectin-8 knockdown suggests that galectin-8 is necessary for the sustained expression of these EMT drivers. Overall, these results demonstrate that galectin-8 is a key regulator of EMT in Tarceva-resistant MDA-MB-231 cells. By knocking down galectin-8, the expression of epithelial markers is increased while mesenchymal markers and EMT transcription factors (ZEB1, ZEB2) are downregulated, suggesting a potential therapeutic approach for reducing the metastatic behavior of resistant TNBC cells.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>TNBC remains one of the most aggressive and difficult-to-treat subtypes of breast cancer, largely due to the absence of hormone receptors and HER2 expression, which limits the use of targeted therapies. Patients with TNBC often rely on chemotherapy, but drug resistance frequently develops, leading to poor outcomes. The recurrence rates and limited therapeutic options make TNBC a significant clinical challenge. While immunotherapy has shown promise for some patients, resistance to systemic therapies continues to be a major hurdle, especially for those with more aggressive, drug-resistant forms of TNBC&#x0200b; <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>-<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>. In addition to its role in TNBC, galectin-8 has been implicated in other malignancies such as colorectal and ovarian cancers, where it contributes to immune evasion, tumor cell invasion, and metastasis. Studies have shown that galectin-8 promotes immune suppression by recruiting regulatory T cells (Tregs) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), reducing immune surveillance. These findings suggest that targeting galectin-8 could have therapeutic potential across multiple cancer types, making it a promising candidate for broader oncological treatment strategies <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>-<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>.</p><p>Our study provides novel insights into the role of galectin-8 in driving drug resistance, proliferation, and metastasis in TNBC. While previous studies have implicated galectins, particularly Galectin-3, in cancer progression and resistance <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, our findings highlight the specific role of galectin-8 in Tarceva-resistant TNBC cells. Although TNBC lacks HER2 expression, a subset of TNBC cases overexpresses EGFR, and targeting this pathway has shown potential in these subtypes. This justifies the use of Tarceva in our resistance model, as previous studies have demonstrated its efficacy in EGFR-positive TNBC cell lines. For example, Hicks <italic>et al.</italic> demonstrated that EGFR is overexpressed in certain TNBC subtypes, including those that develop brain metastases <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>. Additionally, Dent <italic>et al.</italic> highlighted the molecular heterogeneity of TNBC, noting that EGFR expression is present in a subset of patients, which supports the rationale for using EGFR-targeted therapies like Tarceva <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>. Elevated levels of galectin-8 were observed in Tarceva-resistant MDA-MB-231 and BT-549 cell lines, both at the mRNA and protein levels, which suggests that galectin-8 is a key player in promoting the aggressive behavior of these cells&#x0200b;.</p><p>The knockdown experiments revealed that reducing galectin-8 expression not only decreases cell proliferation but also restores sensitivity to Tarceva, particularly at higher concentrations. This suggests that galectin-8 could serve as a therapeutic target for reversing drug resistance in TNBC. In contrast to other galectins, such as Galectin-3, which have been studied in the context of various cancer subtypes, our findings underscore the unique importance of galectin-8 in regulating drug resistance mechanisms through its influence on cell survival pathways&#x0200b; <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>-<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>.</p><p>Studies have shown that high levels of E-cadherin, an epithelial marker, are correlated with better clinical outcomes in TNBC patients. Loss of E-cadherin expression is often associated with more aggressive and invasive tumor behavior, leading to a poorer prognosis. For example, research demonstrated that the absence of E-cadherin is significantly associated with reduced recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) in TNBC patients <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>. Restoration of E-cadherin expression, as observed following galectin-8 knockdown, may contribute to a less invasive phenotype and improve clinical outcomes in drug-resistant TNBC. Further supporting the role of galectin-8 in tumor progression, knockdown of galectin-8 also significantly reduced cell migration, as evidenced by both Transwell and IncuCyte assays. Additionally, our examination of EMT markers showed that galectin-8 knockdown leads to increased expression of E-cadherin (an epithelial marker) and decreased expression of mesenchymal markers, such as N-cadherin, vimentin, and the EMT transcription factors ZEB1 and ZEB2. This suggests that galectin-8 may play a critical role in maintaining the mesenchymal state of TNBC cells, contributing to their invasiveness and metastatic potential&#x0200b; <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>. To further explore the mechanisms by which galectin-8 modulates EMT in TNBC cells. Oyanadel <italic>et al.</italic> indicated that galectin-8 was shown to drive partial EMT through the activation of FAK/EGFR signaling pathways <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>. This mechanistic insight aligns with our observations in the current study, where knockdown of galectin-8 resulted in the reversal of EMT markers. While the development of galectin-8 inhibitors is still in its early stages, alternative therapeutic strategies could focus on combinatory treatments that target both galectin-8 and key pathways associated with EMT. For instance, simultaneous inhibition of galectin-8 and FAK/EGFR signaling could enhance therapeutic efficacy by reducing both drug resistance and metastatic potential. Although this study focuses on <italic>in vitro</italic> models, future investigations will aim to incorporate clinical data from drug-resistant TNBC patients to validate our <italic>in vitro</italic> findings on galectin-8 expression and its role in drug resistance.</p><p>Compared to previous studies focusing on other galectins, our work presents a novel perspective by demonstrating that targeting galectin-8 not only disrupts EMT but also reverses drug resistance in TNBC. This adds a new dimension to the growing body of research exploring galectins as therapeutic targets in cancer. Given the limited treatment options for TNBC, particularly for drug-resistant forms, our findings highlight the potential of galectin-8 as a novel therapeutic target.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, targeting galectin-8 represents a promising strategy for overcoming drug resistance and reducing metastasis in TNBC.
