Ischemic and hemorrhagic Stroke are associated with Spreading Depolarization (SD) waves in brain tissue, which propagate through the affected areas and cause a transient disruption of ionic homeostasis and neuronal function. This interaction highlights the complexity of the neurological consequences associated with SD. In this study, we investigated the occurrence of SDs following the occlusion of the superior sagittal sinus (SSS) in a gyrencephalic model, specifically swine. To instigate an occlusion, we surgically clipped the middle third of the SSS. The animals were grouped and monitored using one of three methods: electrocorticography (ECoG) alone, ECoG with intrinsic optical signal (IOS) imaging, or ECoG in conjunction with laser speckle contrast and oxygen imaging (LSCI). Post-mortem, the brains were analyzed using 2,3,5-triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining to check for venous infarction. Our results confirmed the spontaneous occurrence of SDs in the gyrencephalic swine brain after SSS occlusion, which was detectable via all monitoring methodologies. SD activity was most frequent in the first hour post-occlusion, subsequently diminishing. IOS imaging identified four unique hemodynamic responses, while TTC staining indicated no infarction. This research is the first to document SDs in the gyrencephalic swine brain following SSS occlusion, laying the groundwork for future investigations in both animal models and human clinical studies.</p><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12959-025-00689-w.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Cerebral venous occlusion</kwd><kwd>Electrocorticography (ECoG)</kwd><kwd>Intrinsic optical signal imaging (IOS)</kwd><kwd>Laser speckle contrast and oxygen imaging (LSCI)</kwd><kwd>Spreading depolarizations (SDs)</kwd><kwd>Superior sagittal sinus (SSS)</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Carl von Ossietzky Universit&#x000e4;t Oldenburg (3092)</institution></funding-source></award-group><open-access><p>Open Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL.</p></open-access></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par3">Cerebral venous occlusion may result from either venous thrombosis or neurosurgical interventions, presenting with a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations and outcomes. Nevertheless, the pathophysiology and management of this condition remain poorly understood. Cerebral sinus thrombosis represents 0.5-1% of all strokes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. It has an estimated incidence rate of 3&#x02013;4&#x000a0;million cases per year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], with the majority of affected individuals being young. In a subset of patients, venous stroke may be a potential consequence. Pregnancy, history of venous thrombosis, neoplasms, Beh&#x000e7;et&#x02019;s disease, factor V Leiden mutation, prothrombin gene mutation, as well as protein C and S deficiencies, have all been identified as potential risk factors for superior sagittal sinus thrombosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Postoperative cerebral venous infarction is less well-documented but it is estimated to occur in approximately 7% of patients following major cranial surgeries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Typical clinical symptoms include focal neurological deficits, signs, and symptoms of intracranial hypertension, seizure, and encephalopathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. These clinical consequences underscore the necessity for a comprehensive understanding of venous ischemia. Spreading depolarizations (SDs), one of the most fundamental pathophysiological mechanisms of both pannecrotic and selective neuronal lesion development after energy deprivation, have been shown to relate to lesion progression and poor clinical outcome in cerebrovascular diseases such as stroke, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and intracerebral hemorrhage. Experimentally they are more easily induced in lissencephalic brains than in gyrencephalic brains. SDs in lissencephalic brains, for example, can be induced by mechanical stimulation following scalp exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Lissencephalic brains exhibit reduced surface area, unequal proportions of matter, and distinctive pharmacodynamics that require the administration of significantly higher doses of SD-blocking drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In contrast, porcine brains, which are gyrencephalic in structure, are comparable to human brains. Previous experimental studies had shown similarities between the porcine brain and human recordings when studying SDs, including the types of hemodynamic responses, propagation patterns, and pharmacodynamics of SDs. Furthermore, SDs could be inhibited by drugs at doses equivalent to those used in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. To date, there is no direct evidence of the occurrence of SDs in the context of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. The occurrence of SDs in cerebral venous sinus thrombosis is highly likely due to the established association between SDs and other forms of cerebrovascular occlusion. However, there is a notable lack of understanding of the characteristics of SDs following venous occlusion. To address this knowledge gap, a comprehensive investigation of the mechanisms of SDs in venous occlusion models using electrocorticography (ECoG) and other advanced monitoring techniques is needed. In addition, a model that accurately reflects the structural and functional characteristics of the human cerebral cortex is essential for the study of SDs. The porcine brain, with its gyrencephalic structure, provides a closer approximation to the human brain than rodent models, particularly in the propagation of SDs across cortical regions. The present study aimed to advance our understanding of SDs in the context of cerebral venous occlusion, focusing on the characterization of the hemodynamic response by using intrinsic optical signal (IOS) imaging and laser speckle contrast imaging coupled with oxygenation assessment (LSCI) in a gyrencephalic model to characterize the hemodynamic response. Our approach was designed to provide new insights into the occurrence of SD after superior sagittal sinus (SSS) occlusion that can be translated to human pathology.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><p id="Par4">All experiments were performed in accordance with the German Animal Welfare Act (Tierschutzgesetz).

Animals were then intubated and mechanically ventilated under anesthesia. Maintenance of anesthesia included inhaled isoflurane (Isothesia<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) at 0.6&#x02013;1.0% and midazolam perfusion. A venous line was placed in the right ear vein. Peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) and heart rate (HR) were monitored from the left ear. After surgical exposure of the right femoral artery, a 4-Fr catheter was inserted to continuously monitor the mean arterial pressure (MAP) (Raumedic AG, Helmbrechts, Germany). Rectal temperature was continuously measured during the experiment using a temperature sensor. Cardiovascular and respiratory monitoring was performed as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].

For this purpose, the heads of animals were kept in a prone position, with the head firmly held in a custom-made stereotactic frame. The area of the craniotomy was marked on the scalp according to the following orientation marks: 1&#x000a0;cm posterior to the line of the eyes, 0.5&#x000a0;cm in medial direction of the orbits, and 0.5&#x000a0;cm frontal to the occipital protuberance. A midline skin incision was made, and the scalp was retracted. This was followed by bilateral burr holes over the parietal bones; thereafter the craniotomy was performed using a high-speed drill under cooling with saline solution. The bone flap was carefully removed. The dura mater was then incised bilaterally to reveal the hemispheres, finally the superior sagittal sinus was exposed. Two 5-contact ECoG strips (Ad-Tech Medical Instrument Corp., Racine, WI, USA) were positioned on both cerebral hemispheres for recording purposes. After one hour of baseline ECoG measurements, a surgical clip (Aesculap<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Yasargil&#x02019;s temporary clip, 7.0&#x000a0;mm, FT240T) was applied to the middle third of the SSS to induce occlusion in groups 2 and 3 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). The setups for IOS imaging and LSCI using the MoorO2Flo device were positioned over the cortical surface (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c and f). The exposed cortex was protected with a paraffin pool (1&#x02013;1.5&#x000a0;cm) to minimize light reflection and cover the entire cortex. The paraffin pool was refreshed, and new paraffin was added to maintain image acquisition quality. Occlusion was performed, as mentioned above, by clipping the middle third of the SSS. During the occlusion, real-time visual inspections of the SSS were performed to detect immediate thrombus formation. Imaging techniques, IOS and LSCI, were used to monitor the hemodynamic changes after clipping. This would allow us to track the hemodynamic changes after thrombosis or infarct progression and assess their impact on CBV and CBF. Additionally, we performed pathological post-mortem analysis as well as histological analysis of tissue samples to examine thrombus formation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Monitoring of spreading depolarization</title><p id="Par9"><italic>ECoG monitoring</italic>.

An elastic registration algorithm was performed to compensate for movement artifacts due to animal breathing, shivering, and brain pulsations. Data were excluded if there were strong movements that could not be compensated by our algorithm. Ten to fifteen regions of interest (ROIs) of approximately 5 pixels (0.03&#x02013;0.12 mm2) were distributed symmetrically in the left and right hemispheres. Because IOS enables the visualization of regional hemoglobin concertation changes in the cortical tissue, it was used as a surrogate of regional cerebral blood volume (CBV) changes (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>d and e). Thus, increases in IOS intensity will represent a decrease in hemoglobin tissue concentration (hypoperfusion or oligemic responses), while decreases in IOS intensity will represent an increase in hemoglobin concentration (hyperemic responses). Intensity profiles extracted from ROIs during SD were analyzed using custom-developed software based on ImageJ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. SD was identified as an intensity change or changes, expanding to at least two ROIs. Intensity changes could be simultaneously plotted and visualized in our software. SDs obtained from the IOS files were analyzed for incidence (SDs/h) and expansion, defined as the number of ROIs reached in which one SD is detected in the visible area, expressed in percentage (%). The morphology of each SDs was defined according to the amplitude fluctuations of the hyper- or hypo-intensity changes after an individual baseline was established. Differences in amplitude and duration of the hyperemic response between the first and last SDs detected were analyzed per ROI in all animals who presented a minimum of two SDs within the same hemisphere during the 9&#x000a0;h of recording time. However, it is essential to note that IOS imaging intensities can be influenced by various factors that cannot be fully eliminated without measuring additional wavelengths or using other technique modalities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p id="Par14"><italic>LSCI analysis</italic>.

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par36">This study demonstrates that SDs can occur following cerebral venous occlusion in the gyrencephalic brain. We observed that SDs can occur after clipping the middle third of the SSS in the swine brain. SDs were monitored using a combination of ECoG, IOS imaging, and LSCI, all well-established techniques for SD detection. Our findings showed that SDs occurred with the highest frequency during the first hour post-occlusion, with a gradual decline in incidence over time. Notably, no SDs were detected between the 4th and 6th hours post-occlusion. There was no difference in SD expansion or incidence between hemispheres. IOS imaging allowed us to distinguish different SD hemodynamic responses and components. Among the four identified types of hemodynamic responses, hyperemia was the most common. While the amplitude of this hyperemic response remained constant, its duration increased over time. LSCI provided valuable visualization of SD propagation, showing expansion from the parietal to the frontal regions, correlated with changes in CBF and oxygenation. Finally, post-mortem TTC staining revealed no evidence of thrombus formation or venous infarction during the monitoring period. Over the past twenty years, extensive literature substantiates the occurrence of SDs within the human cerebrum, implicating their significance in cerebrovascular pathologies. Numerous studies delineate a correlation between SD episodes and neuronal functional impairment, neurodegeneration, and suboptimal clinical outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Notably, the demonstration of SDs post-venous occlusion within a translational gyrencephalic model underscores their potential clinical significance. Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis is a rare type of stroke. Similarly, instances of postoperative venous occlusion can occur, and in certain cases, occlusion of the SSS may be necessary. In both scenarios, clinical manifestations differ from those typically observed in arterial strokes. Clinical presentations are heterogeneous, with a spectrum ranging from asymptomatic cases to transient neurological deficits, and in a subset, culminating in irreversible disability or mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. SDs may partially elucidate the transient neurological impairments observed in these cases. Notably, SSS occlusion frequently precipitates epileptogenic phenomena [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. While epileptic discharges have the propensity to trigger SDs, evidence suggests SDs concurrently possess an inhibitory effect on seizure propagation by hindering neuronal synchrony and interrupting epileptiform cascades [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. This dichotomy posits a potentially protective role for SDs in mitigating epileptiform propagation across cortical strata and stymying widespread seizure activity. Therefore, investigations using suitable translational models are indispensable to ascertain the precise clinical effects of SDs in the context of cerebral venous occlusive phenomena. Most of the experimental studies of venous occlusion have been carried out in rodents. However, the translation of findings from lissencephalic rodents to gyrencephalic human brains is complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Our choice of a swine model is justified by its closer resemblance to the human cerebrum. Translational swine models of experimental sinus occlusion using different techniques such as endovascular flow blockage, thrombin injection, distal thrombus formation, and photothrombosis have been previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. They report occlusion-dependent hemodynamic changes ranging from a well-tolerated partial thrombosis to a complete thrombosis, where no collateralization is possible, and successive infarct formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. In our model, with the exception of one animal, we did not observe an apparent hemodynamic and perfusion change in IOS imaging immediately after clipping. Neither were we able to document venous infarction development, at least during the monitoring time. This would speak in support of a well-tolerated occlusion with possible collateral out-flow development.</p><p id="Par37">Anatomical differences and changes of out-flow due to possible vein collateralization after the sinus occlusion might help to explain our present findings. Unlike humans, the venous system is configured differently in swine, which might account for the absence of venous infarction post-SSS occlusion attempts in previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Besides, in swine, the sagittal sinus communicates with the confluence sinus and transverse sinuses, with the system draining into the spinal epidural venous plexus. In comparison, in humans, the spinal venous plexus connects with the internal jugular vein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], and the occlusion of the first third of the SSS generally causes no clinical problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. However, the occlusion of the mid-SSS, as was done in the current study, or posterior third, is not recommended because of the high risk of ischemic complications. The anatomical differences in the gyrencephalic swine brain might help to elucidate why prior efforts at experimental production of venous infarction through SSS thrombosis have generally been unsuccessful. Two successful alternatives for inducing infarctions after cerebral thrombosis in swine are bilateral occlusion or massive injection of prothrombotic material into the jugular vein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] and the occlusion of two adjacent bridging veins to produce a focal venous infarction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. SDs can result from hypoxia and ischemia following arterial occlusion. After cerebral ischemia, SDs frequently occur experimentally and clinically, originating from compromised tissue in the ischemic penumbra [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>], triggered by fluctuations in metabolic supply [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. In rat retina, SDs have been successfully induced post-photothrombosis after occlusion of arterioles and venules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>], though arterial pathology may mask venous injury effects. SDs have also been observed following cerebral venous occlusions in lissencephalic mouse brains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>], and after cortical vein occlusion in rat brains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. However, the present study shows that SDs can be induced in the gyrencephalic brain following venous occlusion by clipping the middle third of the SSS. Unlike our arterial stroke model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], this study found fewer SDs and no infarction. SDs occurred primarily in the first experimental hour, while in the arterial model, SD incidence increased over time, often in clusters. The mean incidence was 6.4 SDs/h (&#x000b1;&#x02009;2.9) in the arterial model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], compared to 0.3 SDs/h (&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.7) after venous occlusion. These results highlight differences in SD dynamics between arterial and venous occlusion, suggesting venous occlusion leads to a different mechanism, possibly related to impaired venous drainage rather than severe ischemia.</p><p id="Par38">Physiologically, it is recognized that sinus thrombosis raises venous pressure, hindering CSF absorption, leading to cerebral edema and increased ICP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. We hypothesize that SSS occlusion causes reverse flow and vascular hypertension sufficient to induce SDs. While venous ischemia is a concern, our IOS findings suggest this is unlikely, as the lack of infarction and specific hemodynamic signatures do not match ischemic patterns. However, this cannot be fully excluded, and further studies are needed. In comparison to our normoxic and arterial ischemic swine models, we observed different hemodynamic SD responses in the IOS imaging, with less heterogeneity. This study identified four distinct SD morphologies, characterized primarily by peak hyperemia (component III), either alone or with late hyperemia (component IV). These differences are probably linked to tissue microenvironment variations, such as oxygenation, metabolic activity, and vascular tone, affecting how vascular compartments respond to SDs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. Venous occlusion resulted in predominantly hyperemic hemodynamic responses, likely driven by intravascular perfusion pressure, which influenced both the intensity and duration of these hyperemic phases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. In this case, we did not observe perfusion pressure changes after clipping, except in one animal. Although there is limited research on how perfusion pressure affects SDs, our findings are consistent with ischemia studies, which report oligemic responses in areas where cerebral perfusion is reduced and hyperemic responses where cerebral perfusion remains within normal ranges [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>], highlighting the critical role of vascular pressure in determining hemodynamic outcomes. Future research is essential to clarify how intravascular pressure variations affect SDs, aiding the development of targeted therapies. These studies could help reduce the impact of SDs in venous occlusion, improving clinical outcomes and advancing our understanding of cerebrovascular pathophysiology.</p><p id="Par39">Movement artifacts limited robust data extraction from LSCI, but the congruence between IOS and LSCI data strengthens our findings. The patterns of OxyHb and deOxyHb responses during SD suggest near-normal perfusion, supported by the observation that the oxygen supply-demand mismatch in brain tissue caused by SD did not manifest strong hypoperfusion or ischemic responses, which is a significant insight into the underlying mechanisms. In arterial ischemia, initial hypoperfusion (component II) and post-SD oligemia (component V) are linked to increased O<sub>2</sub> extraction and reduced O<sub>2</sub> saturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. However, in the SSS occlusion model, O<sub>2</sub> availability seemed adequately compensated, as indicated by predominant hyperemic reactions (components III and IV). This suggests SDs can occur without significant ischemia, contrasting typical arterial occlusion models where SDs are tied to ischemic conditions. Hyperemic responses in our model are likely associated with vascular collateralization, which maintained adequate oxygenation during SD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. To our knowledge, no prior studies in gyrencephalic brains have documented SDs in the absence of ischemia, chemical insult, or blood presence, underscoring the uniqueness of our approach. While minor red cell extravasation might be missed, our results suggest SDs can occur independently of these factors, providing new insights into SDs under altered cerebral venous drainage.</p><sec id="Sec19"><title>Study limitations</title><p id="Par40">While this study offers valuable insights, several limitations must be acknowledged. First, prospective longitudinal research is crucial to fully elucidate the sequence of pathophysiological events leading to SD following venous occlusion, as well as to establish a definitive link to venous infarction. In particular, due to ethical considerations, brain tissue from the swine models was collected at an early stage. This may have occurred before thrombosis or venous infarction had sufficient time to develop, limiting our ability to conclusively determine whether the model would have resulted in venous infarction at later time points. As a result, caution is advised when interpreting the potential of this model to induce venous infarction. Nevertheless, this study was exploratory in nature, focusing primarily on the immediate consequences of SSS occlusion and the occurrence of SD. Second, the clipping technique used, although effective for our study&#x02019;s aims, has certain inherent drawbacks. Specifically, it involves significant cortical exposure and manipulation of the dura mater, which may inadvertently compromise smaller bridging veins and disrupt glymphatic drainage. These factors may have influenced the results, introducing complexities in interpreting venous drainage pathways following occlusion. Third, another limitation is the absence of an untreated control group in this study. However, this limitation does not critically impact the primary objective, which was to explore the SD hemodynamic response after SSS occlusion. This decision was based on prior data from our group, which demonstrated that SDs do not occur spontaneously in well-perfused swine brains post-craniotomy in control groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In previous studies, SDs were only elicited after preconditioning with KCl [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. Additionally, the lack of SDs detected in ECoG and IOS imaging recordings prior to SSS occlusion further justifies the exclusion of an untreated control group. Therefore, the inclusion of a control group in this study would not have provided additional meaningful data. Thus, future studies with larger sample sizes, longitudinal follow-up, and the inclusion of control animals will be essential to validate these observations and further elucidate the pathophysiological mechanisms at play.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par41">Our investigation has elucidated, with unprecedented clarity, that SDs can arise spontaneously after occlusion of the SSS within the gyrencephalic porcine brain. Crucially, this phenomenon manifests independently of venous infarction, indicating a novel pathophysiological process. The implications of our findings are for extensive validation through additional research utilizing both in vivo animal models and rigorous clinical studies to enhance our understanding and inform therapeutic strategies for SSS occlusive disorders.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.</p><p>
