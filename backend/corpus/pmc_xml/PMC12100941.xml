The current lack of a standardized set of EPAs tailored to clinical microbiology creates a gap in assessing learner proficiency and educational outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Objectives</title><p id="Par2">This study aims to develop and validate a set of specific EPAs for clinical microbiology using a multi-step national expert consensus-building process.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par3">This study was conducted in Egypt, involving experts from various medical schools across the country. As the first step, a thorough literature review was undertaken to identify potential EPAs pertinent to clinical microbiology residency programs. Then, evaluation of EPAs for quality and structure using EQual rubric involved five experts in medical education and clinical microbiology, resulting in the confirmation of relevant EPAs. Subsequently, three rounds of the modified Delphi method were employed, engaging ten clinical microbiology experts from various medical schools. Simultaneously, content validity was assessed based on these ratings. Participants also determined the appropriate year of entrustment for each EPA item, and an 80% Validity index agreement threshold was calculated to ensure consensus among participant groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par4">The use of the literature review and initial expert evaluation using EQual rubric confirmed 39 out of the initially identified 43 EPAs. Following the modified Delphi method rounds, 16 EPAs gained acceptance, signifying their relevance and appropriateness for clinical microbiology residency training. These EPAs were categorized into key areas, including preanalytical testing and quality assurance, microbiological techniques and diagnostics, infection control and safety practices, clinical leadership and teamwork, research and development, and laboratory management and communication.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par5">This study developed 16 EPAs for clinical microbiology residency programs.

Rather than assessing individual skills, EPAs focus on whether trainees can be entrusted with specific professional activities that integrate multiple competencies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] The latest definition of EPA as rehearsed by Ten Cate in 2021 is an EPA is a unit of professional practice that can be fully entrusted to a trainee, once he or she has demonstrated the necessary competence to execute this activity unsupervised. EPAs have enabled the shift towards competency-based medical education (CBME) by providing a structured approach to evaluate whether trainees can perform integrated, authentic tasks independently, thereby bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The development of EPAs frameworks in health care professions has been extensive and varied across different specialties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. By defining specific activities that trainees must be able to perform independently, EPAs create a structured approach to assess and develop essential skills in real-world settings. This operationalization ensures that the training aligns closely with professional practice, facilitating a more effective transition from education to clinical responsibilities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. These frameworks ensure an authentic and systematic learning process by integrating competencies into practical, real-world settings. Accordingly, it guarantees that workplace learning, and assessment are not only comprehensive but also aligned with professional standards and expectations, leading to development of a more competent healthcare workforce [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">The validation process of EPAs framework for each specialty is a crucial step to guarantee that the EPAs thoroughly represent the authentic and relevant tasks required in that field. This process involves a rigorous assessment by stakeholders and subject matter experts using Ten Cate&#x02019;s published EPAs features and guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The main aim of validation process is to confirm that the EPAs are not only aligned with the specific competencies needed but also reflect the real-world duties and challenges managed by health care professionals in that specialty. There are several approaches outlined in the literature for validating EPAs among experts. These include expert meetings (both national and international), surveys, the Delphi procedure, the nominal group technique, and interviews [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par9">The Delphi procedure is one of the commonly used approaches for validating EPAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. A quick search in PubMed (July 2024) yields over 100 journal articles since 2013 with the word &#x0201c;(Entrustable Professional Activities) AND (Delphi) in their title or abstract, with a rapid increase since 2020. This method is widely recognized for its effectiveness in gathering expert opinions and establishing consensus on complex issues that benefit from collective subjective judgments rather than analytical solutions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The Delphi procedure allowed for engagement of a diverse group of experts without requiring in-person meetings, thereby facilitating participation from various geographical locations and healthcare settings. By ensuring anonymity throughout the Delphi process, it mitigated potential biases and encouraged experts to provide unbiased input without being influenced by other participants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Similar Delphi methodologies have been successfully employed to develop EPA frameworks in various health professions education programs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p id="Par10">Numerous EPAs frameworks have been developed across many medical specialties. However, as the adoption of EPAs has expanded, concerns about their quality, relevance, and applicability have also grown. Consequently, there is an urgent need to meticulously evaluate existing EPAs to ensure they meet the intended educational outcomes and maintain high standards of clinical training. This evaluation is critical not only for revising and refining EPAs but also for validating their effectiveness in fostering competent and dependable healthcare professionals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Tools such as the Quality of Entrustable Professional Activities (QUEPA) and the Queen&#x02019;s EPA Quality Rubric (EQual) have been developed to facilitate the systematic evaluation and refinement of EPAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The QUEPA tool includes 15 items with excellent reliability, categorized into four distinct factors: Realistic and Generalizable (6 items), Observable (3 items), Focused (3 items), and Multiple Competencies (3 items). The QUEPA tool has been criticized for not being completely aligned with the defining qualities of EPAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Moreover, it uses normative scales for each item without descriptive anchors. Also, it does not provide predefined cut scores for acceptability of an EPA&#x02019;s quality, restricting its utility and interpretation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The EQual rubric overcomes these critiques as it is criterion based and based on the defining features of EPAs as well as cutoff scores that were determined for each domain and the overall scores. It is composed of 14 questions which evaluates the 3 domains of EPAs: EPAs as discrete units of work; EPAs as entrustable, essential, and important tasks of the profession; and EPAs&#x02019; curricular role [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p id="Par11">Clinical microbiology residency training in Egypt is structured to equip future practitioners with the skills necessary to address complex microbiological challenges. Typically lasting three years, these programs combine theoretical knowledge with practical experience in university-affiliated hospitals and major teaching institutions. However, postgraduate curricula often lack standardization and do not comprehensively address the specific competencies required in this specialty Based on recent literature, there is a notable absence of EPAs tailored for clinical microbiology residency training. This gap highlights significant challenges faced by residency programs, including inadequate focus on critical areas such as diagnostic accuracy, infection control practices, and laboratory management skills. These deficiencies hinder residents&#x02019; preparedness to tackle complex healthcare issues, such as antimicrobial resistance and emerging infectious diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Therefore, our study objective is to establish EPAs specifically designed for clinical microbiology training by achieving consensus among clinical educators and experts in the field. These EPAs will be integrated into the residency curriculum to ensure comprehensive training and assessment of residents&#x02019; competencies. The developed EPAs framework will provide the necessary tools for clinical educators to effectively assess trainees&#x02019; readiness for independent practice. This initiative aims to enhance healthcare services by developing a competent workforce trained through a structured EPA approach.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Research design</title><p id="Par12">We used an exploratory sequential mixed methods design to develop and validate a set of EPAs for clinical microbiology residency training in Egypt. The aim was to establish a framework of EPAs that are relevant, clear, and aligned with the needs of local training programs. The study took place in Egypt from May through December 2023. The exploratory sequential mixed methods design was chosen to allow for a comprehensive approach, starting with qualitative exploration to identify relevant EPAs, followed by quantitative validation through a modified Delphi technique to achieve consensus among experts. This approach is particularly suitable when addressing complex educational interventions, where both expert opinion and structured evaluation are valuable.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Participants</title><p id="Par13">A purposive sampling approach was used to recruit clinical microbiology experts for the validation process. Experts were selected based on predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria to ensure a high level of expertise and relevance to the study objectives. Inclusion criteria required that candidates be clinical microbiologists with a minimum of five years of postgraduate experience, active involvement in residency training, and demonstrated contributions to the field through publications or presentations. Exclusion criteria included individuals holding administrative positions without current clinical practice involvement or those with postgraduate experience, less than 5 years. A total of 15 experts were initially invited by email to participate, with follow-up reminders sent over a period of 10 days. Ultimately, 10 experts (66.7% response rate) agreed to participate in the study, ensuring a diverse representation across various medical schools in Egypt.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Development and validation of EPAs (Phases 1&#x02013;3)</title><p id="Par14">The development and validation of the EPAs were conducted in three phases: [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] creation of a preliminary draft of EPAs, through a qualitative process involving a clinical microbiology task force, which reviewed existing literature and guidelines to identify core competencies; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] evaluation of EPAs using the EQual rubric, to assess their relevance, clarity, and specificity; and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] content validation using the Modified Delphi technique, which involved experts rating the importance and clarity of each EPA and specifying the year of entrustment.

</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Phase 1: creation of a preliminary draft of EPAs</title><p id="Par16">In the first phase of our study, a comprehensive literature review was conducted to inform the development of the EPAs. We searched major databases such as PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar for relevant studies and guidelines related to clinical microbiology competencies. Key resources were the competency-based postgraduate curriculum of microbiology departments, ACGME Program Requirements for Graduate Medical Education in Hematopathology, Entrustable Professional Activities for Pathology developed by The Royal College of Pathologists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>],.</p><p id="Par17">The development of the EPAs involved a combination of inductive and deductive approaches. Initially, a deductive approach was employed by analyzing existing frameworks and guidelines to identify core competencies in clinical microbiology. This involved systematically categorizing and synthesizing the information from these sources to create a preliminary list of EPAs. Subsequently, an inductive approach was applied through expert discussions. The task force (composed of 3 clinical microbiologists) was formed by inviting experts from various departments of clinical microbiology at public medical schools. These experts were chosen based on their academic and clinical experience in microbiology, as well as their involvement in residency training programs. The task force played a crucial role in developing the initial list of potential EPAs through a qualitative process involving literature review and expert judgments.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Phase 2: evaluation of EPAs using equal rubric</title><p id="Par18">The preliminary EPAs were evaluated by a panel of five experts (3 clinical microbiology and 2 medical education). The EQual rubric was used to assess the relevance, clarity, and specificity of each EPA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Each expert panel member utilized a separate Google Sheet to independently input their ratings for the EPAs. This approach allowed for individual assessments of relevance, clarity, and specificity without influence from other panellists. The Google Sheets were structured with predefined criteria and anchored Likert scales to standardize the evaluation process. After completing their evaluations, the individual scores were aggregated to derive an overall rating for each EPA. This method not only facilitated efficient data collection but also ensured transparency and anonymity in the evaluation process. The modified Angoff approach used by Taylor and colleagues to establish an overall cutoff score of 4.07 for the EQual rubric indicates that any EPA scoring below this threshold is considered insufficient in key domains and may require revision [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec107"><title>Phase 3: content validation using modified delphi technique</title><p id="Par19">We utilized a modified Delphi method to achieve consensus among clinical microbiology experts regarding the importance, clarity, and entrustment levels of the EPAs. This approach was chosen for its flexibility and ability to adapt to our study&#x02019;s specific needs, while maintaining the core principles of expert opinion and iterative refinement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Our modified Delphi process involved several key adjustments to the traditional method. First, we provided structured feedback to participants after each round, including aggregated results and qualitative comments. This allowed experts to reflect on the broader group&#x02019;s perspectives and adjust their ratings accordingly. Second, we limited the process to three rounds, which was sufficient to achieve stability in the ratings and consensus among experts. Finally, each round had focused objectives, such as rating importance and clarity in Round 1, determining entrustment years in Round 2, and finalizing agreement in Round 3. To ensure clarity and consistency throughout the study, we maintained the same numbering for EPAs across all Delphi rounds. This deliberate choice prevented any potential confusion that might arise from renumbering or reordering EPAs between rounds and facilitated tracking the evolution of each EPA throughout the process.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Round 1</title><p id="Par20">The expert panel composed of ten clinical microbiology experts rated the importance and clarity of each EPA using a 5-point Likert scale along with an open text box for comments. They rated the importance of each EPA using a Likert scale from 1 to 5 (1&#x02009;=&#x02009;none, 2&#x02009;=&#x02009;weak, 3&#x02009;=&#x02009;moderate, 4&#x02009;=&#x02009;high and 5&#x02009;=&#x02009;very high). They also rated the clarity of each EPA&#x02019;s description using a Likert scale from 1 to 5 (1&#x02009;=&#x02009;very poor, 2&#x02009;=&#x02009;poor, 3&#x02009;=&#x02009;neither bad nor good, 4&#x02009;=&#x02009;good, and 5&#x02009;=&#x02009;very good).

This allowed experts to reflect on their initial evaluations considering the broader group&#x02019;s input. Additionally, revised EPA descriptions were shared, incorporating any modifications based on Round 1 feedback. Experts were then asked to re-rate the importance and clarity of each EPA and assign the appropriate year of residency for entrustment without direct supervision.

For each round, we calculated the Content Validity Index (CVI) for each EPA by dividing the number of experts who rated an EPA with a score of 4 or 5 by the total number of experts participating in that round. A CVI of 0.8 or higher indicated sufficient content validity, while scores between 0.70 and 0.79 suggested that the item required revision, and scores below 0.70 indicated that the corresponding EPA should be eliminated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p><p id="Par24">Additionally, we calculated the mean ratings and standard deviations for each EPA based on expert evaluations to assess consensus and variability in scores.

Another example is the EPA &#x02212;&#x02009;35 that initially mentioned &#x02018;Compose a diagnostic report for clinical laboratory testing&#x02019;, was rephrased to &#x02018;Compose a diagnostic report for clinical laboratory testing requiring pathologist interpretation&#x02019;. This EPA emphasizes that diagnostic reports are not just technical documents, and they require the ability to convey information. EPA &#x02013; 36 Evaluate and report critical values in the clinical laboratory was rephrased to Identity, Evaluate, report, and communicate critical value and clinically urgent results. EPA &#x02013; 37 Optimize test utilization (AP/CP laboratory management) was rephrased to EPA37: Optimize test utilization in the Clinical Microbiology Laboratory. These changes resulted in the development of EPAs used in phase 3.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Phase 3 results: content validation using modified Delphi technique</title><p id="Par35">Total number of clinical microbiology experts were 10 experts.

Our study identified and validated 16 EPA items, addressing a critical gap in assessing residents&#x02019; proficiency and educational outcomes within clinical microbiology residency training. The validated EPAs not only provide a structured approach to clinical microbiology training but also offer a framework for improving educational outcomes. By focusing on essential activities that define the profession, these EPAs ensure that residents are equipped with the necessary competencies to excel in real-world clinical settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. For instance, the inclusion of EPAs related to antimicrobial stewardship and infection control highlights the importance of these skills in contemporary clinical practice.</p><p id="Par47">The initial list of 43 EPAs was refined to a final set of 16 through a rigorous evaluation process. Beyond the CVI scores, several factors influenced the elimination or modification of EPAs. Redundancy was a key consideration; if two EPAs covered similar competencies, the less specific or less critical one was removed to streamline the list and focus on essential activities. EPAs were modified if they lacked clarity or specificity. Feedback from the expert panel highlighted areas where descriptions needed refinement to ensure they were actionable and measurable. This process involved revising the language to make the EPAs more concise and relevant to real-world clinical practice. The modified Delphi process allowed for iterative feedback and consensus-building among experts. EPAs that did not align with the majority&#x02019;s expectations or were considered less critical were either modified or excluded. This ensured that the final set of EPAs reflected a broad consensus among clinical microbiology experts. Additionally, EPAs were evaluated based on their clinical relevance and feasibility in real-world settings. Those that were deemed impractical or not commonly encountered in clinical practice were either refined or removed.</p><p id="Par48">The use of a multi-step validation process to develop EPAs framework for a speciality is crucial for several reasons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Firstly, it enhances the content validity of the EPAs by triangulating diverse expert perspectives. As noted by Ten Cate et al. (2015), EPAs should be carefully designed to represent the essential activities that define a profession [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. By integrating a comprehensive literature review, EPAs evaluation by experts using the EQual rubric, and a modified Delphi method, our study ensures that the developed EPAs are both comprehensive and relevant to current practice. Secondly, the multi-step validation process allows for iterative refinement of the EPAs, addressing inconsistencies that may not be evident in a single-step validation process. This aligns with the recommendations of Touchie and Ten Cate (2016), who emphasize the importance of ongoing revision and improvement of EPAs to maintain their relevance and effectiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p><p id="Par49">The use of the EQual rubric in our validation process is significant. This tool, developed by Taylor et al. (2017), provides a structured framework for evaluating the quality of EPAs across multiple domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. By including this rubric, we ensured that our EPAs meet established quality criteria, enhancing their reliability and applicability. The EQual rubric has been increasingly adopted in various medical specialties for EPAs evaluation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Soran et al. (2020) used the EQual rubric to evaluate EPAs for internal medicine residency programs. Their study involved a multi-step process, initial EPA development through literature review and expert consensus, then evaluation of the developed EPAs using the EQual rubric by two study authors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p><p id="Par50">Our study used the modified Delphi method to enhance the construct validity of the EPAs by drawing on the collective expertise of field professionals. This consensus-building approach, as described by Hsu and Sandford (2007), is important in areas where professional judgment plays a significant role in defining professional skills [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Several studies reported the use of this method for development of EPAs frameworks either independently and in combination with other tools or methodologies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].</p><p id="Par51">As part of the validation process, we measured the inter-rater reliability as it is crucial to ensure highly consistent ratings. Intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) was calculated to measure consistency of experts&#x02019; ratings on the year of entrustment of each EPA and the importance of each EPA. Intraclass correlation coefficient with a 95% confidence interval of round 1 of modified Delphi was 0.83 (where values between 0.70 and 0.93 which signify excellent correlation) and round 2 of modified Delphi was 0.756 (where values between 0.570 and 0.892 signify excellent correlation) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Our findings are similar to many studies which reported ICC as a measure of reliability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].</p><p id="Par52">The distribution of EPAs across postgraduate years is crucial for ensuring that residents progressively develop the necessary competencies. Comparing this distribution with other clinical trainings, such as internal medicine or surgery, reveals both similarities and differences. For example, while all specialties require foundational competencies like patient assessment and management, clinical microbiology places a unique emphasis on laboratory diagnostics and antimicrobial therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. This comparison underscores the need for tailored EPA frameworks that reflect the specific demands of each specialty.</p><p id="Par53">Handling EPAs with low consensus among experts is crucial for ensuring that competency-based education frameworks remain effective and relevant. Differences in training environments or individual resident progress may contribute to variations in expert opinions regarding certain EPAs, influencing how competencies are perceived and assessed across different settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. EPAs with low consensus may require case-by-case entrustment decisions rather than inclusion in a standardized curriculum, allowing for flexibility and adaptation to specific learning contexts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. This approach highlights the importance of flexibility in curriculum design, as educational programs must adapt EPAs based on local training conditions and individual learner needs. Ensuring that EPAs are socially valid and accepted by stakeholders is also crucial, involving assessments of their perceived acceptability and importance among target populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>].</p><p id="Par54">The lower agreement scores for certain EPAs in our study highlight areas where expert opinions may vary due to differences in training environments or individual resident progress. This variability can be addressed by considering the role of elective EPAs, which are not universally required but can be offered to trainees who demonstrate advanced proficiency or special interests. Elective EPAs can include specialized procedures or skills that are not core to every graduate&#x02019;s training but are valuable for those pursuing specific career paths (e.g., rare procedures only performed in specialized centres). By incorporating elective EPAs into the curriculum, programs can accommodate to the diverse needs and interests of residents while maintaining a focus on core competencies. This approach requires flexibility in curriculum design, allowing for personalized learning pathways that accommodate both core and elective EPAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. However, implementing such flexibility may pose challenges in authorities with rigid training structures, underscoring the need for adaptable educational frameworks that balance core requirements with opportunities for specialized training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>].</p><p id="Par55">Implementing the EPA framework in clinical microbiology training requires careful consideration of practical applications. Medical educators can integrate these EPAs into curriculum design by mapping them onto specific learning objectives and assessment tools. For instance, EPAs related to laboratory diagnostics could be linked to hands-on training sessions and competency assessments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. In terms of alignment with existing competency frameworks, while our study did not specifically investigate frameworks in Egypt, the general approach to integrating EPAs into competency-based models can be applied. EPAs can be linked to broader competency domains and milestones, similar to how they are used in other specialties like emergency medicine and nursing education [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] As medical education in Egypt moves towards competency-based models, our EPAs could potentially align with such frameworks by focusing on essential professional activities that define clinical microbiology practice.</p><sec id="Sec17"><title>Limitations of the study</title><p id="Par56">The study relied on a small sample size of experts in medical education and clinical microbiology for the initial EPA evaluation and validation process. While this was sufficient for a national consensus within Egypt, it may limit the generalizability of the identified EPAs to other countries with different educational systems and training requirements. The practice of clinical microbiology varies across countries, which could impact the applicability of these EPAs in other contexts. The study did not apply the identified EPAs in real-world clinical microbiology residency programs, which limits the assessment of their practical applicability and effectiveness in evaluating learner proficiency and educational outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Future studies</title><p id="Par57">Future studies could focus on the practical implementation of the identified EPAs within clinical microbiology residency programs. This includes assessing how these EPAs are integrated into existing curricula and evaluating their impact on resident performance and educational outcomes. Also, gathering feedback from various stakeholders, including residents, faculty, and healthcare administrators, regarding the perceived value and challenges of the EPAs could inform future enhancements of the competency framework. Finally, future studies could work on creating standardized assessment tools specifically designed for evaluating resident performance in relation to the identified EPAs, ensuring consistency and reliability across different training institutions. By addressing these areas, future studies can contribute to refining the educational framework for clinical microbiology and enhance the training of future professionals in the field.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par58">This study provides a validated set of 16 EPA items for clinical microbiology residency programs, addressing a significant gap in competency-based education for this specialty. These EPAs represent a standardized framework for assessing resident proficiency and guiding curriculum development. Addressing the challenges associated with EPAs that have lower agreement scores will further refine the framework, making it more adaptable and effective in diverse educational settings. Additionally, incorporating feedback mechanisms allows for continuous refinement of the EPA framework based on learner outcomes and evolving clinical practices.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.</p><p>
