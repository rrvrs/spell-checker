We reported monthly rates of substance-related toxicity deaths and investigated the combination of substances most commonly involved in deaths.

Opioids were directly involved in the majority of deaths (84.1%; N&#x02009;=&#x02009;8,431), followed by stimulants (60.9%; N&#x02009;=&#x02009;6,108), alcohol (13.4%; N&#x02009;=&#x02009;1,346) and benzodiazepines (7.8%; N&#x02009;=&#x02009;782). In total, 56.9% (N&#x02009;=&#x02009;5,698) of deaths involved combinations of substances. Approximately one-fifth of individuals were treated in a hospital setting for a substance-related toxicity in the past year, with the majority being opioid-related (17.4%; N&#x02009;=&#x02009;1,748).

Further, over half of all deaths attributable to opioids over this period occurred among people aged 30&#x02013;49 years [<xref rid="pone.0324732.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Different factors have likely exacerbated the drug toxicity crisis over the past few years, including the increasing potency and volatility of the unregulated opioid drug supply (primarily composed of fentanyl and its analogues) and various societal changes which occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic reduced access to harm reduction programs, and increased anxiety and uncertainty resulting in changing patterns of substance use [<xref rid="pone.0324732.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0324732.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. While opioids have dominated the discussion around substance-related harms across Canada in recent years, there is an increasing emphasis on the harm attributed to other substances such as benzodiazepines, stimulants, and alcohol, either alone or in combination with opioids. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, a rise in alcohol consumption levels was recorded [<xref rid="pone.0324732.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], which coincided with a parallel increase in alcohol-related deaths resulting from both acute toxicities and longer term complications such as liver disease [<xref rid="pone.0324732.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324732.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Further, although toxicity deaths directly attributed to benzodiazepines alone are less commonly reported, evidence of the introduction of these substances (such as etizolam) within the unregulated drug supply over the past five years has raised concerns given the established risks of combined use of opioids and benzodiazepines [<xref rid="pone.0324732.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0324732.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>The rising prevalence of multiple substance use has been described as a &#x02018;fourth wave&#x02019; in the overdose crisis [<xref rid="pone.0324732.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], with data from Ontario showing that psychostimulants (such as cocaine and methamphetamine) contributed to 58.1% of opioid-related toxicity deaths in Ontario during the COVID-19 pandemic [<xref rid="pone.0324732.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The unintentional use of multiple substances may also occur when a person consumes a substance that has been mixed or cut with additional substances (such as fentanyl mixed with benzodiazepines) [<xref rid="pone.0324732.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. This is especially concerning given that opioids combined with benzodiazepines or alcohol can an increase the risk of respiratory depression and sedation, while the use of opioids and stimulants in combination is postulated to increase risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular strain, both resulting in a higher risk of substance-related toxicity and mortality [<xref rid="pone.0324732.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324732.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].

Similarly, over one-third of people had an outpatient physician visit related to a substance use disorder in the past year (excluding alcohol use disorder) (36.6%; N&#x02009;=&#x02009;3,671), with 5.4% (N&#x02009;=&#x02009;537) having an outpatient visit relating to alcohol use disorder.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="pone.0324732.t003"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0324732.t003</object-id><label>Table 3</label><caption><title> Previous healthcare encounters among individuals who died from a substance-related toxicity.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="pone.0324732.t003" id="pone.0324732.t003g" position="float"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">N (%)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Hospital treated substance-related toxicities</bold> (prior 1 year)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1,994 (19.9%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Opioid-related toxicities<sup>*</sup></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1,748 (17.4%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Stimulant-related toxicities<sup>*</sup></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">499 (5.0%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Benzodiazepine-related toxicities<sup>*</sup></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">204 (2.0%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Alcohol-related toxicities<sup>*</sup></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">103 (1.0%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Any healthcare encounter for substance use disorder</bold> (prior 5 years for hospital based and 1 year for outpatient diagnoses)*</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6,098 (60.9%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Hospital based encounters with substance use disorder diagnoses</bold> (any diagnosis type; prior 5 years)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4,670 (46.6%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Opioid use disorder</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2,323 (23.2%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Stimulant use disorder</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2,219 (22.1%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Benzodiazepine use disorder</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">252 (2.5%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Alcohol use disorder</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2,429 (24.2%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Hospital based encounters with substance use disorder diagnoses</bold> (most responsible diagnosis; prior 5 years)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3,516 (35.1%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Opioid use disorder</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1,518 (15.1%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Stimulant use disorder</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1,248 (12.5%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Benzodiazepine use disorder</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">141 (1.4%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Alcohol use disorder</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1,756 (17.5%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Outpatient Diagnoses</bold> (prior 1 year)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Alcohol use disorder outpatient diagnoses</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">537 (5.4%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Any other substance use disorder outpatient diagnoses</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3,671 (36.6%)</td></tr></tbody></table></alternatives><table-wrap-foot><fn id="t003fn001"><p>*Multiple substances may have contributed to death, therefore these groups are not mutually exclusive.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec013"><title>Discussion</title><p>Between January 2018 and June 2022, more than 10,000 accidental substance toxicity deaths were reported across Ontario, with the absolute number of deaths almost doubling between the first and last year of our study period. This is equivalent to approximately six deaths each day during this period due to substance-related toxicities across Ontario. Further, we found that the COVID-19 pandemic led to a significant temporary acceleration in rates of substance-related toxicity deaths. Specifically, there was a trend towards multiple substance involvement in deaths that was primarily driven by higher frequency of toxicities involving use of both opioids and stimulants, with deaths involving alcohol and benzodiazepines as direct contributors remaining less common. Overall, many individuals had visits related to substance use disorder in the five years prior to death and were treated in a hospital setting for a substance-related toxicity year prior to death. These prior encounters with the healthcare system represent missed windows of opportunity for healthcare professionals to engage and support people who use drugs [<xref rid="pone.0324732.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p><p>The initial increase in substance-related toxicity deaths we observed following the COVID-19 pandemic-related state of emergency may be attributable to widespread disruptions in access to healthcare services that occurred across Ontario early in the pandemic [<xref rid="pone.0324732.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324732.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Access to mental health-related services and harm reduction programs were particularly limited [<xref rid="pone.0324732.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0324732.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], as many in-person supports were paused, operated at reduced capacity or were temporarily closed. Furthermore, pandemic-related public health measures, such as lockdowns, physical distancing, and reduced social interactions, likely contributed to heightened isolation and stress, leading to changing patterns of substance use [<xref rid="pone.0324732.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324732.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. At the same time, changes in supply chains due to border closures may have resulted in a more volatile and unpredictable unregulated drug supply [<xref rid="pone.0324732.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], increasing the risk of fatal toxicities. Interestingly, we observed a reversal in this trend with a gradual decrease in substance toxicity deaths beginning in September 2020. This broadly aligns with the staged reversal of pandemic-related public health measures across some regions in Ontario [<xref rid="pone.0324732.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], and suggests that although significant increases in mortality occurred initially this was not sustained throughout the entirety of the pandemic. Future research is needed to understand how the combination of reduced healthcare access, and a more toxic drug supply contributed to the initial rise in toxicity deaths during the pandemic.</p><p>Our findings also contribute to the emerging body of literature highlighting that the use of multiple substances and the increasing adulteration of the unregulated opioid supply with non-opioid substances are resulting in increasing rates of harms related to substance use [<xref rid="pone.0324732.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324732.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. In particular, we found that opioids and stimulants combined made up the highest proportion of substance-related toxicity deaths, with the absolute number of deaths more than doubling over the study period. This aligns with trends reported across the US where deaths involving both cocaine and opioids increased 46.0% per year between 2014&#x02013;2017 [<xref rid="pone.0324732.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Similarly, a recent study in Quebec, Canada found that the proportion of opioid-related deaths involving cocaine increased from 24% to 51% between 2016 and 2021, with methamphetamine detected in 41% of deaths by 2021 [<xref rid="pone.0324732.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Qualitative evidence also indicates that people often use opioids in combination with stimulants to combat the sedating effects of the unregulated opioid supply as a means of staying alert [<xref rid="pone.0324732.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. However, suppressing the depressant effects of opioids with stimulants may lead to a false impression of tolerance and more frequent use of opioids, which can increase overdose risks [<xref rid="pone.0324732.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. This is especially concerning as traditional approaches for reversing opioid toxicities such as naloxone, do not reverse the effects of stimulants or other non-opioid sedatives (e.g., benzodiazepines). Furthermore, there are currently no pharmaceutical options accessible at the community level to reverse the effects of non-opioid substances [<xref rid="pone.0324732.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. This further reinforces the need for harm reduction strategies and treatment options to reflect the growing combinations of substances that people are exposed to. Harm reduction strategies may include the provision of oxygen during an overdose response, providing naloxone to individuals who primarily use stimulants as research shows these individuals may be more likely to witness overdoses[<xref rid="pone.0324732.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], and OAT programs which better address multiple risks including exposure to stimulants and management of benzodiazepine withdrawal.</p><p>Importantly, we also found that approximately one in five people had been treated for a non-fatal substance-related toxicity in the year before their death, with the majority of these incidents being opioid-related. This represents an increase from a previous study conducted in Ontario, which found that less than 10% of individuals who died from an opioid toxicity between 2015 and 2016 had a prior hospital-treated toxicity [<xref rid="pone.0324732.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Therefore, these hospital visits increasingly represent important opportunities to provide care to people who use substances, including treatment initiation for those with a substance use disorder diagnosis and coordination of connections with harm reduction, substance use treatment and primary care services upon discharge [<xref rid="pone.0324732.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. However, transitions in care between acute hospital care settings to community-based care can vary greatly [<xref rid="pone.0324732.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] given that people who use substances face additional barriers and stigma when accessing care in both settings [<xref rid="pone.0324732.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Prior research has found that only one in eighteen people (4.1%) were dispensed OAT within a week of discharge for a hospital treated opioid-related toxicity in Ontario [<xref rid="pone.0324732.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], despite current clinical guidelines recommending that OAT be offered to all patients with OUD when in hospital [<xref rid="pone.0324732.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. However, we also found that two in five substance-related toxicity deaths occurred among people without a recorded substance use disorder diagnosis, reinforcing that not all people at risk of harm from substance use have such a diagnosis, and therefore may not be eligible for treatment. As a result, heightened access to harm reduction programs and services that extend beyond treatment - such as supervised consumption sites and prescribed safer opioid supply programs - is needed to ensure widespread prevention efforts for accidental toxicities among all people at risk of these harms.</p><sec id="sec014"><title>Limitations</title><p>A strength of this study includes the use of a novel database to provide insights into the trends of substance-related toxicity deaths across Ontario. However, a few limitations warrant discussion. First, we excluded individuals who did not have a valid Ontario health card (approximately 7% of all deaths) to allow for linkage to healthcare records. Therefore, these analyses are an underestimate of the full burden of substance toxicity deaths in Ontario over the study period and the generalizability of our findings may be limited to people who are disconnected from the healthcare system. Second, we only included confirmed deaths where alcohol, stimulants, benzodiazepines, or opioids directly contributed to death. It is possible that suspected substance toxicity deaths may be later determined by the investigating coroner to be related to the above substances, and these were not included in this study. Data from the Chief Coroner of Ontario on drug toxicity deaths are received only for death investigations that are nearly complete and as such we anticipate the potential underestimation of death rates in our study is minimal. Third, there is no validated definition of substance use disorders using health administrative data. Therefore, we relied on hospital records over a five year period, and physician visits in the one year prior to death to identify people with a likely active substance use disorder at time of death. However, it is possible that misclassification exists in this definition. Fourth, we only include benzodiazepine toxicity deaths where a benzodiazepine was identified as a direct contributor to death. Because thresholds are not well established for benzodiazepine toxicity in post-mortem toxicology, our findings may not accurately reflect the presence of benzodiazepine detection in substance toxicity deaths, which has reached over 45% in other studies of opioid toxicity deaths in Ontario during the COVID-19 pandemic [<xref rid="pone.0324732.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Fifth, the use of seasonal differencing in our ARIMA model to achieve stationarity may complicate the interpretation of trend components, as it removes the seasonal pattern from the data. This can make it more difficult to distinguish between long-term trends and short-term fluctuations. Finally, our reliance on healthcare administrative data limited our ability to capture some pandemic-related factors such as stress, job loss, and housing instability, while the joinpoint model, though effective for detecting trend shifts, may miss gradual or complex changes and does not account for confounding variables. These limitations may affect the generalizability of our findings, as the observed trends may not reflect the experiences of people disproportionately impacted by the pandemic. Future research could benefit from integrating complementary data sources such as surveys or interviews to help capture broader social impacts.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec015"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The number of accidental substance toxicity deaths almost doubled between January 2018 and June 2022, highlighting the growing loss of life from substance-related toxicities across Ontario and the increasing involvement of multiple substances including both opioids and stimulants in these deaths. This continued to worsen following the declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic state of emergency, with a high frequency of hospital interactions observed prior to death. This suggests the need for improved coordination of care throughout the healthcare system to meet the complex needs of people who use drugs and the importance of enhanced access to mental health and harm reduction services in future public health crises.</p></sec><sec id="sec016" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material id="pone.0324732.s001" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Definitions of prior substance-related toxicities in the year prior to death, using emergency department (ED) visits or in-patient hospitalizations.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0324732.s001.docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pone.0324732.s002" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>Definitions of substance use disorders.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0324732.s002.docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pone.0324732.s003" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S3 Table</label><caption><title>Potential ARIMA model AIC and BIC values.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0324732.s003.docx"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to acknowledge that this study was guided by the input and shared expertise of the Ontario Drug Policy Research Network Lived Experience Advisory Group.
