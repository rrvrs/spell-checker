The U5MR is expressed per 1,000 live births. Saudi Arabia has made efforts to achieve the sustainable development goals (SDGs), for child mortality by 2030. Although Saudi Arabia has put in place initiatives to achieve the SDGs for child mortality by 2030, data on the success of these initiatives are lacking. The aim of this study was to investigate and compare U5MR trends and patterns in Saudi Arabia by decade and sex over a 50-year period (1973-2022).</p><p>Methods: Data on the U5MR in Saudi Arabia during 1973-2022 were extracted from the UNICEF database. The mean mortality rates every 10 years were calculated and then compared over decades between males and females using a chi-square test.

Saudi Arabia has achieved the SDG target 3.2 (ending preventable deaths of newborns and children under five years of age by 2030). Based on an analysis of the UNICEF data and a literature review, recommendations are proposed to achieve even greater reductions in the U5MR, especially in the neonatal and infant stages.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>newborn</kwd><kwd>saudi arabia</kwd><kwd>sex</kwd><kwd>under-five mortality rate</kwd><kwd>unicef</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The under-five mortality rate (U5MR) refers to the probability that a newborn would die before reaching exactly five years of age [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The U5MR is expressed per 1,000 live births [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. According to the United Nations Children&#x02019;s Fund (UNICEF), in 2022, 4.9 million children under the age of five years died worldwide, which translates to 13,400 deaths per day [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Globally, infectious diseases, including pneumonia, diarrhea, and malaria remain leading the causes of death in children under the age of five, along with preterm birth and intrapartum-related complications [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The U5MR is an indicator of child health, and a population's overall development and well-being [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Many studies have reported nutritional and healthcare factors that have a significant impact on under-five morbidity and mortality [<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>-<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. These factors include low birth weight (LBW), delayed initiation of breastfeeding, neonatal complications, maternal complications, and lack of access to healthcare services [<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>-<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. U5MR serves as a crucial indicator of child health and the effectiveness of the healthcare systems of a country. In Saudi Arabia, significant strides have been made to reduce U5MR over the past few decades, reflecting improvements in healthcare access and quality [<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>-<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. As of 2020, the U5MR in Saudi Arabia was reported at approximately 7.0 deaths per 1,000 live births, a considerable decline from 44.3 deaths per 1,000 live births in 1990 [<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. This decrease is indicative of successful health interventions, including enhanced maternal and child healthcare services, widespread immunization programs, and improved socioeconomic conditions [<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Although in Saudi Arabia, significant progress has been made in reducing U5MR over the past few decades [<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>-<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], the differences between genders were not explored. Some studies indicate that females face a higher risk of childhood mortality than males, particularly in nations where gender bias in healthcare services is documented [<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Conversely, other studies, such as those conducted in India, report that males have a higher risk of mortality [<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Addressing the gender-specific factors influencing U5MR is essential for developing targeted interventions aimed at further reducing child mortality in Saudi Arabia. In addition, understanding these dynamics will provide insights for healthcare policymakers and practitioners to implement effective strategies that ensure equitable health outcomes for all children, regardless of gender. Although previous studies have reported on under-five mortality in various Gulf countries [<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="REF14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], including Saudi Arabia [<xref rid="REF15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], at different times, none of these have analyzed trends in the U5MR rate over&#x000a0;decades. UNICEF data on U5MRs provide a reliable source of information on trends at the country level. Saudi Arabia is the largest Gulf country, consisting of 13 regions. Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia, has a population of 31.5 million, of whom the majority live in urban areas, with only 17% living in rural areas [<xref rid="REF16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the under-five population accounted for 3.2 million of the total population (i.e., one-third of the total population) [<xref rid="REF16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In addition, in Saudi Arabia, all births are registered [<xref rid="REF17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], which increases the reliability of UNICEF data regarding the health of under-five children. The aim of this study was to investigate U5MR trends and patterns in Saudi Arabia during a 50-year period (1973-2022) and to compare differences between the mortality rates of males and females during this period. Based on an analysis of the UNICEF data and a literature review, recommendations are proposed aimed at further improving under-five health in Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>UNICEF gathers data on U5MR in various countries, including Saudi Arabia, using various methodologies to ensure thorough and precise assessments.

This finding agrees with the regional contexts in Arab Gulf countries [<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]&#x000a0;and Saudi Arabia&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="REF21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Al-Mazrou et al. revealed a continuous and marked decline in infant and child mortality during 1994-2004. In their study, the infant mortality rate (the number of deaths of children under one year of age) declined from 22 per 1,000 live births in 1994 to 17 per 1,000 live births in 2004, and the U5MR declined from 34 to 22 per 1,000 live births during the same period&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].&#x000a0;The decline in the U5MR found in our study is in accordance with the global trend in U5MRs, which have fallen by more than 50% since 2000. According to UNICEF, this remarkable achievement has been driven mainly by sustained commitment by governments, organizations, local communities, healthcare workers, and families&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. This finding confirmed the achievement of Saudi Arabia of the proposed Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) target for child mortality, which aims to reduce the U5MR to at least 25 deaths per 1,000 live births. Likewise, Shawky&#x000a0;reported a decline in the infant mortality rate from&#x000a0;75 per 1,000 live births in 1978 to 23 per 1,000 live births in 1999 (a&#x000a0;declining rate of 69.3%)&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="REF22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In contrast to a child born in Australia and New Zealand, one born in sub-Saharan Africa is, on average, 18 times more likely to die before reaching the age of five years [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Several factors, such as improvements in education, socioeconomic status, and health services, may account for the remarkable decline in the U5MR in Saudi Arabia [<xref rid="REF20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].&#x000a0;In Zambia, Jacobs et al.&#x000a0;attributed a decline in the U5MR from 168 to 64 deaths per 1,000 live births between 2001 and 2018&#x000a0;to government policies aimed at combating socioeconomic inequalities, including inequalities relating to education and&#x000a0;urban-rural residence groups&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In Saudi Arabia, with the aim of further reducing neonatal, infant, and under-five mortality,&#x000a0;more healthcare workers were recruited to ensure high-quality care for mothers and children, especially in the early years. Today, 98.7% of births in Saudi Arabia&#x000a0;are&#x000a0;attended by healthcare workers [<xref rid="REF24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].&#x000a0;A similar healthcare initiative (i.e., expanding the healthcare workforce) has been successful in Bangladesh&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>Greater availability of healthcare workers could have contributed to the expansion of vaccine coverage in&#x000a0;Saudi Arabia. Therefore, the observed decline in the U5MR in the present study could be due to the greater immunization coverage&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].&#x000a0;For example, the expansion of rotavirus immunization programs globally resulted in a remarkable reduction in under-five mortality [<xref rid="REF26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].&#x000a0;Assuming global use of rotavirus vaccines and coverage equivalent to other co-administered vaccines,&#x000a0;Clark et al. concluded that they&#x000a0;could prevent 37% of under-five rotavirus-related deaths (1.2% of child mortality)&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].&#x000a0;In addition, the decline in the U5MR in Saudi Arabia could be due to improvements in water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) services [<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="REF21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="REF22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Salam and Al-Khraif attributed the remarkable decline in neonatal, infant, and U5MR since 1950 to a significant budget allocation and investment in health system building, including WASH, nutrition, and lifestyle modifications&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Previously, lack of access to adequate WASH services was the&#x000a0;main factor reported to be associated with infant mortality in Arab countries, including Saudi Arabia&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Recently, Gaffan et al. reported that the risk of under-five mortality was 11% higher for children living in households with poor or no sanitation facilities compared to those with basic sanitation services [<xref rid="REF27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>In this study, a decline in the U5MR was found in both males and females.&#x000a0;Some studies reported that females had a higher risk of childhood mortality than males, especially in&#x000a0;countries with evidence of gender bias in healthcare services&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However, in India, Pal et al. found that the risk of under-five mortality was higher among males than females&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The decline in the U5MR among both males and females in Saudi Arabia may point to equality in the provision of healthcare&#x000a0;to pregnant women and their children, regardless of the sex of the child.</p><p>Aiming to empower women, North African and Middle Eastern countries, including Saudi Arabia, have focused on access to education over the past few decades [<xref rid="REF24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].&#x000a0;As a result, there have been dramatic improvements in education for all, with several encouraging trends in the primary and secondary education of females&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Over the years, Saudi Arabia has taken essential steps in girls&#x02019; education, which might have&#x000a0;contributed to the decline in U5MR found in the present study.&#x000a0;In a recent survey, Hassan reported that maternal education had a positive impact on reducing under-five morbidity and mortality in&#x000a0;sub-Saharan Africa&#x000a0;by empowering mothers to make decisions regarding their health [<xref rid="REF29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. On the other hand, lack of maternal education has a&#x000a0;negative impact on child morbidity and mortality in many countries, including Saudi Arabia&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="REF30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>-<xref rid="REF32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In 1998, the male-to-female literacy ratio in Saudi Arabia was 80:60 (1.4)&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].&#x000a0;Since then, the&#x000a0;Saudi government has&#x000a0;put in place several initiatives aimed at improving the education of females&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. These include&#x000a0;increasing access to education among girls and reducing the gender gap at higher educational levels [<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].&#x000a0;A high maternal education level could contribute to a reduction in the U5MR in several ways. For example, it could lead to marriage at an older age, higher earning potential, and changes in residence preferences from rural to urban&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="REF30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Ahinkorah reported that children of mothers in sub-Saharan Africa whose first child was born when they were younger than 20 years were 11% more likely to die before the age of five years compared with their counterparts whose mothers&#x02019; first childbirth occurred at age &#x02265;20 years&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p><p>According to the WHO, common causes of under-five mortality in Saudi Arabia are prematurity (22%), congenital anomalies (14.2%), injuries (9.6%), and birth asphyxia/trauma (7.5%) [<xref rid="REF16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].&#x000a0;Although under-five mortality is not categorized by age in the UNICEF database, the WHO has estimated that neonatal deaths (i.e., mortality within the first 28 days) account for 54% of all under-five mortality&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In Saudi Arabia, Al-Abbas and Ahmed reported minimal changes in the&#x000a0;infant mortality rate between 2003 and 2014 [<xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In the same study, in 2015, the U5MR was 14.5 per 1,000, the&#x000a0;infant mortality rate was 12.5 per 1,000 live births, the&#x000a0;neonatal mortality rate was 7.9 per 1,000 live births, and the&#x000a0;maternal mortality rate was 12 per 100,000 live births. These figures indicate that additional efforts are needed to improve child health, especially&#x000a0;in the early stages (neonatal and infant). Such improvement cannot be achieved without more focus on maternal health, specifically the first 1,000 days of life&#x000a0;(i.e., nine months of pregnancy and the first two years of a child&#x02019;s life)&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p><p>The findings of this study have several implications for maternal and child health in Saudi Arabia. Our analysis of the trend in U5MR in Saudi Arabia revealed a remarkable decline during the study period. This success can encourage policymakers, healthcare workers, and the local communities to continue their efforts to further improve infants&#x02019; and children&#x02019;s health. The collective efforts of the government and the local communities have prevented millions of child deaths since 1973. However, a further decline in the U5MR can be achieved, and it is possible, especially for preventable child deaths.&#x000a0;Sharrow et al. predicted 48.1 million under-five deaths worldwide, especially during the neonatal period, between 2020 and 2030, if no further preventative actions were taken [<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].&#x000a0;As shown by a review of the literature, there is little&#x000a0;published research on the U5MR in Saudi Arabia, despite the remarkable progress that has been made in reducing the rate in recent years. Neonatal deaths account for more than half (54%) of under-five mortality worldwide&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].&#x000a0;There has been little change in the&#x000a0;infant mortality rate in Saudi Arabia&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].&#x000a0;Thus, more research is needed to explore the social determinants of under-five mortality, especially those related to maternal health. To reduce the U5MR further in Saudi Arabia, cost-effective interventions are needed that target subpopulations of children at higher risk, especially neonates and infants. Such interventions should be coordinated with United Nations (UN) agencies&#x000a0;like UNICEF.</p><p>The present study has some strengths. Reporting that Saudi Arabia has already achieved SDG Target 3.2 by reducing its U5MR&#x000a0;to 6.4 per 1,000 live births by 2022, which is significantly lower than the target of 25 per 1,000 live births. This achievement reflects the country's successful implementation of healthcare interventions, immunization programs, and improvements in socioeconomic conditions over the past five decades&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="REF21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="REF22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>The present study has some&#x000a0;limitations that need to be addressed in future research. First, the study relied on secondary data on the U5MR and did not include data on the child&#x02019;s age, place of residence (urban/rural), or cause of death.&#x000a0;For example, Al-Mazrou et al. observed regional variations in infant and child mortality in&#x000a0;rural areas and the southern region of Saudi Arabia, which might reflect differences in accessibility to maternal healthcare services and&#x000a0;socioeconomic factors [<xref rid="REF21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Al-Abbas and Ahmed&#x02019;s recommendations emphasized this observation: improving accessibility to healthcare services in rural areas and improving maternal education in Saudi Arabia&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In India, there is a rural-urban gap in under-five mortality, which may indicate that social and health policy changes are needed to reach rural children from poor families and uneducated mothers [<xref rid="REF33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. However, residency is unimportant when the child belongs to a high socioeconomic class and has an educated mother&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].&#x000a0;Second, the present study focused on under-five mortality rather than morbidity, a key factor in mortality.&#x000a0;These limitations can be overcome by synchronizing efforts to be more precise in future interventions and save budgets. Appropriate coordination between the Saudi Arabian government and UN agencies, such as UNICEF, will be fruitful (i.e., adding the missing data to the UNICEF tools to synchronize efforts).</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The analysis of U5MR trends over five decades in Saudi Arabia (1973-2022) revealed a remarkable decline in the rate among both males and females, with a U5MR of&#x000a0;149.1&#x000a0;per 1,000 live births in 1973 and 6.4 per 1,000 live births in 2022. Saudi Arabia had achieved the SDG target 3.2 related to under-five mortality.&#x000a0;Based on an analysis of the UNICEF data and a literature review, recommendations are proposed&#x000a0;to achieve further reductions in the U5MR, especially in the neonatal and infant stages.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The researchers would like to thank the Deanship of Graduate Studies and Scientific Research at Qassim University for financial support (QU-APC-2024)</p></ack><fn-group content-type="conflict"><title>Disclosures</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Human subjects:</bold> All authors have confirmed that this study did not involve human participants or tissue.</p><p><bold>Animal subjects:</bold> All authors have confirmed that this study did not involve animal subjects or tissue.</p><p><bold>Conflicts of interest:</bold> In compliance with the ICMJE uniform disclosure form, all authors declare the following:</p><p><bold>Payment/services info:</bold> All authors have declared that no financial support was received from any organization for the submitted work.</p><p><bold>Financial relationships:</bold> All authors have declared that they have no financial relationships at present or within the previous three years with any organizations that might have an interest in the submitted work.</p><p><bold>Other relationships:</bold> All authors have declared that there are no other relationships or activities that could appear to have influenced the submitted work.</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="other"><title>Author Contributions</title><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Concept and design:</bold>&#x000a0; Abdullah Al-Nafeesah</p><p><bold>Acquisition, analysis, or interpretation of data:</bold>&#x000a0; Abdullah Al-Nafeesah</p><p><bold>Drafting of the manuscript:</bold>&#x000a0; Abdullah Al-Nafeesah</p><p><bold>Critical review of the manuscript for important intellectual content:</bold>&#x000a0; Abdullah Al-Nafeesah</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="REF1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><article-title>Under Age 5 Mortality</article-title><source>Health at a Glance: Asia/Pacific </source><person-group>
