However, research on integrated organic nutrient management in multi-crop systems remains limited, especially concerning its impact on forage productivity and nutritive value. This study aims to investigate the effects of integrated organic nutrient amendments on the yield and quality of multi-crop system. Conducted during the period 2018 to 2021 using a randomized complete block design, the experiment encompassed seven treatments, each replicated three times. These treatments comprised of different combination of farmyard manure (FYM), Plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) and foliar spray of panchagavya for maize (M), berseem (B), and cowpea (C) and a treatment with recommended dose of fertilizers. The treatment includes T<sub>1</sub>: 100% RDN through FYM (M) - No application (B) - No application (C); T<sub>2</sub>: 50% RDN through FYM + PGPR + 3% foliar spray of panchagavya (M) &#x02013; PGPR + 3% foliar spray of panchagavya (B) &#x02013; PGPR + 3% foliar spray of panchagavya (C); T<sub>3</sub>: 75% RDN through FYM + PGPR (M) - PGPR (B)- PGPR (C); T<sub>4</sub>: 100% RDN through FYM + PGPR (M) - PGPR (B) - PGPR (C); T<sub>5</sub>: 75% RDN through FYM + PGPR + 3% foliar spray of panchagavya (M) &#x02013; PGPR + 3% foliar spray of panchagavya (B) &#x02013; PGPR + 3% foliar spray of panchagavya (C); T<sub>6</sub>: 100% RDN through FYM + PGPR + 3% foliar spray of panchagavya (M) &#x02013; PGPR + 3% foliar spray of panchagavya (B) &#x02013; PGPR + 3% foliar spray of panchagavya (C), and T<sub>7</sub>: 100% RDF (M)- 100% RDF (B)- 100% RDF (C). Research findings revealed that the T<sub>6</sub> treatment, involving T6: 100% RDN through FYM + PGPR + 3% foliar spray of panchagavya (M) &#x02013; PGPR + 3% foliar spray of panchagavya (B) &#x02013; PGPR + 3% foliar spray of panchagavya (C), yielded significant improvements in both green fodder of maize (35.4, 37.0, and 38.6 t ha<sup>-1</sup>), berseem (58.2, 60.0, and 60.6 t ha<sup>-1</sup>) and cowpea (25.7, 27.5, and 28.3 t ha<sup>-1</sup>) during 2018-19, 2019-20 and 2020-21, respectively. Furthermore, T<sub>6</sub> significantly enhanced forage quality, as evidenced by higher crude protein (6.4&#x02013;14.8%), ether extract (19.2&#x02013;40.1%), and total ash (6.5&#x02013;22.1%) contents, coupled with reductions in fiber components. These findings highlight the effectiveness of integrated organic nutrient amendments in enhancing both yield and quality, offering a sustainable strategy to improve livestock feed and promote environmentally friendly agricultural practices.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>farmyard manure</kwd><kwd>organic</kwd><kwd>panchagavya</kwd><kwd>PGPR</kwd><kwd>proximate analysis</kwd><kwd>quality</kwd><kwd>yield</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>The author(s) declare that no financial support was received for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="7"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="50"/><page-count count="13"/><word-count count="6910"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>section-in-acceptance</meta-name><meta-value>Plant Nutrition</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Increasing awareness of health and nutritional needs has led to a rising demand for organic milk, recognized for its health benefits. A significant challenge in meeting this demand is the limited availability of high-quality organic fodder (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Meena et&#x000a0;al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Vaarst et&#x000a0;al., 2019</xref>). Ensuring both high forage productivity and superior nutritive value is essential for supporting the organic livestock industry. Fodder quality, including aspects such as fiber content, protein levels, digestibility, and nutrient balance, plays a crucial role in supporting the nutritional needs of livestock and improving milk quality. However, current nutrient management practices often fall short in meeting these needs, impeding sustainability and profitability. While organic farming has a growing emphasis on sustainability, the quality of organic fodder is often compromised by insufficient nutrient management, particularly in terms of key elements that influence livestock health, like nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium levels. Adequate nutrient management is vital not only for yield improvement but also for enhancing the fodder&#x02019;s nutritional value (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Escribano, 2018</xref>; <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Timsina, 2018</xref>). This gap presents obstacles to both the sustainability and profitability of organic livestock farming, making it essential to address these challenges to support the burgeoning organic dairy industry (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Odhong et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Wolde and Tamir, 2016</xref>).</p><p>Maize, berseem, and cowpea are essential crops for food and fodder production, with varying production statuses depending on region and environmental conditions. Maize is one of the most widely grown cereal crops globally, primarily cultivated in North America, Latin America, Asia, and Africa, with significant production in the U.S., China, Brazil, and India. Berseem, a popular forage legume, is primarily grown in South Asia and the Mediterranean region, serving as both fodder and green manure. Cowpea, grown mainly in sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and parts of North America, is valued for its drought resilience and high-protein seeds. In the Indian subcontinent, maize, berseem, and cowpea are vital fodder crops that provide essential energy, protein, and carbohydrates necessary for livestock health. These crops are characterized by high nutritional value, contributing significantly to livestock productivity. While maize is nutrient-intensive and can deplete soil fertility (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Mathur et&#x000a0;al., 2023</xref>; <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Teressa et&#x000a0;al., 2024</xref>), berseem and cowpea contribute to soil health through nitrogen fixation and nutrient solubilization, improving soil fertility for subsequent crops (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Meena and Lal, 2018</xref>). These crops form a vital component of sustainable livestock feeding systems, enhancing productivity while promoting soil conservation (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Das et&#x000a0;al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Meena and Lal, 2018</xref>).</p><p>Organic amendments such as FYM, PGPR, and panchagavya hold immense potential for optimizing crop productivity and improving forage quality. These supplies essential nutrients like nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium in a slow-release form, fostering healthy plant growth (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Aytenew and Bore, 2020</xref>; <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Khayat, 2021</xref>). When combined with other organic inputs like green manure, compost, and biofertilizers, FYM improves nutrient diversity and soil fertility. Its role in promoting microbial activity and suppressing soil-borne diseases makes it crucial for sustainable fodder production (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Verma et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Bhunia et&#x000a0;al., 2021</xref>). Furthermore, studies have shown that the use of organic amendments significantly enhances crop growth and productivity, highlighting their importance for sustainable farming practices (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Salman et&#x000a0;al., 2023</xref>). Notably, PGPR play a critical role in enhancing nutrient availability by solubilizing phosphorus, fixing atmospheric nitrogen, and producing growth-promoting hormones, thus improving root development and nutrient uptake in crops like berseem and cowpea (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Sharma et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Mahmud et&#x000a0;al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Shah et&#x000a0;al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Ullah et&#x000a0;al., 2023</xref>). Additionally, Panchagavya, a traditional formulation composed of five cow-derived products - milk, curd, ghee, urine, and dung serves as a powerful bio-stimulant (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Kumar et&#x000a0;al., 2023</xref>). It promotes plant growth, enhances microbial activity in the soil, and boosts plant immunity (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Golakiya et&#x000a0;al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>We hypothesize that that the integrated application of FYM, PGPR, and Panchagavya can simultaneously enhance forage yield and quality in a multi-crop system comprising maize, berseem, and cowpea. The objective of this research is to develop and assess the effect of integrated organic nutrient management strategy aimed at producing high-quality organic fodder crops. By employing a combination of FYM, PGPR, and Panchagavya, this study seeks to enhance crop yields and improve forage quality. This research work aims to support sustainable agricultural practices, improve livestock productivity, and contribute to environmental conservation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="s2_1"><title>Experimental details</title><p>The investigation transpired at the experimental research farm situated in the Agronomy Section of the ICAR-National Dairy Research Institute, Karnal, Haryana, during the rainy, winter and summer season from 2018-2021. The soil of the experimental field (0-15 cm) was clay loam in texture with EC (0.23 dS m<sup>-1</sup>), pH (7.52), medium in SOC (0.601%) and medium in available potassium (190.2 kg ha<sup>-1</sup>), low in available N (188.4 kg ha<sup>-1</sup>) and high in available phosphorus (28.54 kg ha<sup>-1</sup>) with SOM content (1.03 &#x000b1; 0.01%). Before sowing the crop, pre-sowing irrigation was applied to bring the soil to its optimum moisture level. Subsequently, the land was cross-ploughed using a tractor-drawn disc harrow, followed by rotavator and planking to achieve a fine tilth suitable for seedbed preparation.

In treatment T<sub>7</sub>, 100 kg N: 60 kg P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>: 40 kg K<sub>2</sub>O, 20 kg N:60 kg P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>:40 kg K<sub>2</sub>O and 20 kg N:60 kg P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> were applied as recommended fertilizer doses for maize, berseem, and cowpea crops, respectively. The N in the control treatment was applied in two splits (50 kg N) at basal and after 30 days of sowing (DAS) in maize, while in berseem and cowpea, N was applied as basal dose only. Phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) were applied as basal doses for maize, berseem and cowpea crops. A PGPR formulation &#x0201c;NPK liquid biofertilizer&#x0201d; was obtained from Division of Microbiology, ICAR-Indian Agricultural Research Institute, New Delhi for seed inoculation in present study. This formulation is consisting of three different microbial strains namely <italic>Azotobacter chroococcum</italic> (N<sub>2</sub> fixing bacteria), <italic>Pseudomonas straita</italic> (P-solubilizing bacteria), and <italic>Bacillus decolorationis</italic> (K-solubilizing bacteria). Each bacterial strain contains 10<sup>9</sup> or greater CFU mL<sup>-1</sup> in formulation. FYM was applied as basal dose at the time of sowing in treatments T<sub>1</sub> to T<sub>6</sub> based on the N content as per the schedule, and seed treatment with PGPR solution was performed as per treatment details. The foliar spray of panchagavya was applied @ 3% (liquid formulation) at 30, 40, and 50 DAS. The mean concentration values of oxidizable organic carbon (%), total carbon (%), total N (%), total P (%), and total K (%) in FYM applied were 11.49, 21.37, 0.68, 0.45, and 0.90 respectively during three years of experimentation. The mean total N, P, and K nutrient concentration values of panchagavya applied as foliar spray were 0.65%, 0.10%, and 0.47%, respectively. For the fodder crops maize, berseem, and cowpea, the varieties J-1006, Mascavi, and C-152 were used in the experiment. These were sown at seed rates of 40 kg ha-&#x000b9;, 25 kg ha-&#x000b9;, and 40 kg ha-&#x000b9;, respectively. The single-cut maize variety J-1006 was sown during the rainy season, the multicut berseem variety &#x02018;Mascavi&#x02019; was sown in the winter season, and the single-cut cowpea variety C-152 was sown in the summer season. The spacing adopted for maize was 60 cm x 20 cm, while berseem was broadcast, and cowpea was planted at a spacing of 30 cm x 10 cm. A single hand weeding was conducted in the maize crop 20 days after sowing, while no weeding was performed in berseem and cowpea. To control insect pests in the fodder maize, Azadirachtin (1500 ppm) was applied at a concentration of 4 mL L<sup>-1</sup> of water. No insect damage was observed in the berseem and cowpea crops.</p></sec><sec id="s2_2"><title>Preparation and characterization of panchagavya</title><p>Panchagavya was prepared using five cow-derived products. The process involved combining 15 liters of cow urine, 10 kilograms of cow dung, 4 liters of cow milk, 4 kilograms of cow curd, and 1 kilogram of cow ghee in a plastic container. To this mixture, 2 dozen ripe bananas and 2 kilograms of jaggery, both chopped into small pieces, were added. Additionally, 500 grams of turmeric powder and 1 liter of coconut water (from 4 tender coconuts) were incorporated.</p><p>The mixture was thoroughly stirred and sealed in the plastic drum. It was agitated twice daily for 25 days to ensure proper fermentation. Once the preparation was complete, the solution was filtered using a white muslin cloth, with 8 liters of distilled water added during the process. This yielded approximately 18 liters of Panchagavya, which was stored in a dark, room-temperature environment. The composition of the prepared panchagavya includes total N (0.64%), total P (0.10%), total K (0.47%), zinc (1.05 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>), and iron (8.75 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>).</p></sec><sec id="s2_3"><title>Yield and proximate composition estimation</title><p>The crops fodder maize, berseem, and cowpea were manually harvested, and their fresh weights were recorded. These yields (measured in kg per plot) were then converted to tons per hectare. Representative samples from each plot were collected systematically and dried in a hot air oven at 60&#x000b0;C for 48 hours. After drying, the dry fodder yield was calculated in tons per hectare. Once desiccated, the samples were ground using a Wiley mill and passed through a 1 mm sieve, then stored in sealed polyethylene bags for further analysis. The analysis of the fodder&#x02019;s proximate composition, encompassing crude protein (CP), ether extract (EE), and total ash (TA), was conducted utilizing the <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">AOAC (2005)</xref> method.

In maize, T<sub>6</sub> exhibited superior green and dry fodder yields compared to the other treatments, particularly surpassing T<sub>2</sub>, which underscores the advantage of utilizing comprehensive organic amendments over lower input alternatives. The superior performance of T<sub>6</sub> in green and dry fodder yields can be attributed to the combined effects of FYM, PGPR, and panchagavya, which enhance nutrient availability, uptake, and overall plant growth. <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Kumar et&#x000a0;al.

Similar results were reported by <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Otieno et&#x000a0;al. (2021)</xref> for maize crop in the tropical climate of Kenya. The lowest yields in T<sub>2</sub> can be attributed to its insufficient nitrogen input and fewer organic amendments, limiting nutrient availability and plant growth potential. The lower yields in treatment T<sub>1</sub> compared to T<sub>6</sub> and T<sub>7</sub> may be attributed to the slower nutrient release from FYM in the maize crop during the rainy season, coupled with the absence of subsequent nutrient application in the berseem and cowpea crops during the winter and summer seasons, respectively. <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Mahmood et&#x000a0;al.

Among the organic amendments, T<sub>6</sub>, consistently exhibited superior quality across all three crops over the three-year period. T<sub>6</sub> significantly enhanced CP, EE, and TA content. This rise in proximate composition under T<sub>6</sub> may be attributed to integrated organic nutrient amendments that provides a balanced nutrient supply, promotes better nutrient uptake, and improves the overall health of the cropping system. <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Ngone et&#x000a0;al.

Similarly, findings were reported in <italic>Magnolia wufengensis</italic> by <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Deng et&#x000a0;al. (2019)</xref> in temperate regions of China. The enhanced proximate composition in treatment T<sub>7</sub> may be attrinuted to rapid nutrient release from inorganic fertilizers, facilitating immediate plant uptake. <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Anamayi et&#x000a0;al. (2016)</xref> reported that inorganic fertilizers application recorded higher levels of CP, EE and TA content in <italic>Moringa oleifera</italic> in Nigeria. In contrast, T<sub>2</sub> consistently exhibited the lowest values for all measured parameters, indicating that the reduced application of organic amendments resulted in nutrient deficiencies. These deficiencies limited the availability of essential minerals, fatty acids, and nitrogen, which in turn led to lower levels of CP, EE, and TA content. <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Nirere et&#x000a0;al.

The lower CP, EE, and TA content in T<sub>3</sub>, T<sub>4</sub>, and T<sub>5</sub> may be attributed to the lower nutrient application, as limited nutrient availability restricts the synthesis of proteins, lipids, and minerals, leading to decreased accumulation of these components in plant tissues. <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Mohan et&#x000a0;al. (2017)</xref> reported that low nutrient availability leads to reduced synthesis of ether extract and total ash content in teosinte.</p><p>This reduction in fiber content is particularly important as lower NDF and ADF levels are associated with improved digestibility and feed quality, which are crucial factors for livestock nutrition. The study provides valuable insights into the effects of integrated organic nutrient amendments that highlight the superior performance of treatment T<sub>6</sub>, in reducing the fiber fractions across all three crops over the three-year study period. The significant reduction in NDF, ADF, ADL, and AIA levels observed in treatment T<sub>6</sub> can be attributed to the combined application of 100% RDN through FYM, PGPR, and foliar panchagavya, which likely enhanced nutrient availability and improved nutrient uptake by the plants. This synergistic effect promotes more efficient plant metabolism, resulting in increased production of cell contents, such as proteins and sugars, while reducing the accumulation of structural carbohydrates and lignin, which contribute to higher fiber fractions. <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Kumar et&#x000a0;al. (2021a)</xref> reported that integrated application of nutrient through PGPR, FYM and foliar spray of panchagavya reduced the NDF, ADF, ADL and AIA content in oats by increasing the nutrient availability. Further, in present study, treatment T<sub>7</sub> recorded lower values of NDF, ADF, ADL and AIA content in all the three crops during first year compared to all the organic amendments but during second and third year of experimentation T<sub>6</sub> recorded significantly lower values of NDF, ADF, ADL and AIA. This can be attributed to treatment T<sub>7</sub> initially providing rapid nutrient release, promoting less fibrous tissue (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Xu et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>). Over time, however, prolonged use of T<sub>7</sub> depletes soil organic matter, reduces microbial activity, and creates nutrient imbalances, leading to higher NDF, ADF, ADL and AIA content (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Howe et&#x000a0;al., 2024</xref>). The higher NDF, ADF, ADL, and AIA content in T<sub>3</sub>, T<sub>4</sub>, and T<sub>5</sub> compared to T<sub>6</sub> and T<sub>7</sub> can be attributed to lower nutrient application. Insufficient nutrients hinder optimal plant growth, leading to more fibrous tissue and higher lignification (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Moore et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>). In contrast, treatment T<sub>2</sub>, which recorded the highest fiber fractions, may have provided a less efficient nutrient supply, leading to suboptimal nutrient uptake and less effective metabolic enhancement. Consequently, plants in T<sub>2</sub> likely produced more cell wall material, resulting in higher NDF, ADF, ADL, and AIA levels. Similar findings were reported by <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Kumari et&#x000a0;al. (2014)</xref> and <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Baljeet et&#x000a0;al. (2020)</xref>.</p><p>In addition to reducing fiber fractions, treatment T<sub>6</sub> also consistently produced lower values of NDIN, NDICP, ADIN, and ADICP across all three crops. The lower NDIN, NDICP, ADIN, and ADICP values in treatment T<sub>6</sub> across all crops can be attributed to the enhanced nutrient availability provided by organic amendments such as FYM, PGPR, and foliar panchagavya spray. These amendments likely facilitated better decomposition of organic matter and stimulated microbial activity in the soil, reducing nitrogen binding to indigestible fiber fractions like lignin and cellulose. Consequently, nitrogen became more digestible and available for plant uptake, improving its utilization by livestock and promoting nutrient cycling. These finds resonate with previous researchers <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Choudhary et&#x000a0;al. (2024b)</xref> and <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Thomas et&#x000a0;al. (2019)</xref>. In our study, treatment T<sub>7</sub> showed parity with T<sub>6</sub> in terms of NDIN, NDICP, ADIN, and ADICP content in different crops, which can be attributed to the initial nutrient boost from inorganic fertilizers. This facilitated faster plant growth and improved nitrogen assimilation, reducing nitrogen binding to fiber fractions like lignin and cellulose (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Talbot and Treseder, 2012</xref>). The increase in NDIN, NDICP, ADIN, and ADICP content in different crops in treatments T<sub>1</sub>, T<sub>3</sub>, T<sub>4</sub>, and T<sub>5</sub>, compared to T<sub>6</sub> and T<sub>7</sub>, may be attributed to limited nutrient availability from lower doses of organic nutrient amendments. This resulted in slower plant growth and inefficient nitrogen assimilation, leading to more nitrogen being bound to indigestible fiber fractions like lignin and cellulose, thereby increasing NDIN, NDICP, ADIN, and ADICP content. In contrast, T<sub>2</sub>, with lowest organic amendment levels experienced insufficient organic matter decomposition and limited nutrient release, resulting in higher NDIN, NDICP, ADIN, and ADICP values. Lower organic inputs may have hindered microbial activity, trapping nitrogen in indigestible fiber components, thus reducing its availability and overall feed quality. <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Johnson et&#x000a0;al. (2001)</xref> reported that lower application of nutrient results into increased values of NDIN, NDICP, ADIN, and ADICP in tropical grasses.</p><p>The PCA results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of organic amendments, such as FYM, PGPR, and foliar panchagavya, in improving the consistency of crop performance across maize, berseem, and cowpea. The dominant contribution of PC1, explaining over 98% of the variance in all three crops, highlights the stability of key parameters like ADF, ADICP, NDICP, and NDF across treatments and years. The tight clustering of these fiber-related traits near the origin suggests minimal variability in nutrient composition and fiber fractions, reflecting uniform responses to the organic treatments. Additionally, the overlapping ellipses representing different years further emphasize the consistent crop performance, with little interannual variation. These findings underscore the potential of organic nutrient management strategies in maintaining stable yields and quality. Notably, the T<sub>6</sub> treatment emerged as the most effective, consistently improving both yield and fiber content across all crops, supporting the sustainability of integrated organic approaches in enhancing productivity.</p><p>The findings from correlation matrix reveal a complex interaction between yield, protein, ether extract, and fiber content across maize, berseem, and cowpea crops, providing valuable insights for breeding strategies. Negative correlations between yield and fiber components (NDF, ADF, ADL) suggest that increasing yield may lead to reduced fiber content, which can enhance digestibility, particularly for livestock feed. Conversely, the positive correlations between yield, CP, and EE content indicate that crops with higher yields tend to have enhanced nutritional profiles, characterized by increased protein and ether extract content. However, the trade-off is evident, as higher fiber levels are associated with reduced protein and ether extract content, which could impact the crop&#x02019;s value in bioenergy or livestock feed applications requiring high fiber. The strong association between CP and EE content implies that increasing CP also enhances EE content, thus boosting the crop&#x02019;s overall nutritional quality. These insights underscore the importance of balancing yield with fiber and nutritional factors, enabling breeders to optimize crop varieties for specific agricultural and industrial needs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Integrated organic nutrient amendments are crucial for improving soil health, enhancing crop yield, and boosting the nutritional quality of crops in a sustainable, environmentally friendly way.
