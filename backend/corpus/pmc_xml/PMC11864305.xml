Previous studies have indicated that pollen exposure and pollen allergies may affect cognitive performance; however, this study has a significantly larger sample, 392 participants, and is the first to use up to 10 repeated measurements per participant to investigate the associations between pollen exposure on cognitive functioning. Our approach provides a more comprehensive understanding of the associations between ambient pollen exposure on cognition.</p></sec></boxed-text><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Allergic rhinoconjunctivitis triggered by pollen, hereafter referred to as pollen allergy, is an immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated immune response toward environmental pollen that causes inflammation of the nasal mucosa and conjunctiva.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Currently, an estimated 20% of the Swiss population experiences pollen allergies, a prevalence that has increased dramatically over the last 100 years.<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Typical symptoms include nasal and eye irritation and itchiness, nasal congestion, runny nose, and sneezing,<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> though memory troubles, difficulties with attention, and slowed processing are also often reported.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Previous studies have found that individuals experiencing pollen allergies may demonstrate increased errors, slowed psychomotor processing, longer reaction times, decreased learning performance, disrupted immediate and delayed memory, and changes in attentional resources.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> In addition to the personal frustration experienced with decreased cognitive functioning, this impairment can also affect an individual&#x02019;s productivity and success at school and work due to missing work days (absenteeism) and worsened performance on important tasks (presenteeism).<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup></p><p>The effects of pollen allergies on cognition might be mediated by changes in mood, the severity of allergic symptoms, or immune mediators involved in allergic reactions. Previous studies have demonstrated that the release of cytokines during allergic reactions may impact brain function, causing behavioral effects such as mood disruption, slowed psychomotor processing, and cognitive dysfunction.<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup></p><p>Overall, results from past studies assessing the associations between pollen allergies on cognition are inconsistent, as some studies have found strong indications of cognitive changes, such as slowed processing speed, increased response times, and impaired working memory,<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> while others have found mild to no effects.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Furthermore, the mechanisms for these cognitive changes vary, with some attributing the changes to mood and blood histamine concentration<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> and others to symptom severity.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Additionally, previous studies are also limited in their sample size and design, testing each participant once during and once outside of the pollen season, without considering ambient pollen concentration variations or severity of allergic symptoms.<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup></p><p>Over the last few decades, there have been shifts in the timing and duration of pollen seasons for several allergenic pollen types, including hazel, nettle, oak, and grasses. An increased intensity of pollen release was observed for hazel, birch, oak, beech, and nettle in Europe.<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Thus, it is increasingly important to understand the relationship between ambient pollen concentration and cognitive functioning. This project, part of a larger study called Effects of Pollen on Cardiorespiratory Health and Allergies (EPOCHAL), aims to understand the associations between ambient pollen concentration on cognitive performance. We aim to characterize the shape of the exposure-response curve between pollen concentration or severity of allergic symptoms and cognitive performance and identify whether differences in cognitive performance vary between participants who report experiencing allergic symptoms upon pollen exposure versus participants who do not.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>The design, rationale, and sample size calculations for the EPOCHAL study,<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> as well as first results on the influence of ambient pollen concentration on symptom severity<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> and blood pressure<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> have been previously published.

To calculate the IPE, the hourly mean ambient concentration of pollen types to which the participant was sensitized (confirmed via SPT) were summed for a specified time period before the cognitive assessments, as illustrated in Figure S.2; <ext-link xlink:href="http://links.lww.com/EE/A331" ext-link-type="uri">http://links.lww.com/EE/A331</ext-link>.<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> Analyses of variance were used to determine within- versus between-subject variability in IPE for each outcome. For sensitivity analyses, total pollen exposure, calculated by summing the pollen concentrations for each pollen type at a given time for all participants (regardless of sensitization), was related to measures of cognitive performance.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical models</title><p>A directed acyclic graph (Figure S.3; <ext-link xlink:href="http://links.lww.com/EE/A331" ext-link-type="uri">http://links.lww.com/EE/A331</ext-link>) illustrates how our model was derived. We fitted generalized additive mixed models (GAMMs) to relate cognitive assessment scores and reaction times to the average IPE over the 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 96, and 120 hours before the start of the cognitive assessments. We fit GAMMs because they can model nonlinear exposure-response relationships and account for the dependency of within-participant measurements. We employed the GAMM function from the mgcv package (version 1.9.0) in R (version 4.3.2) to fit all models<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> following Formula S.1; <ext-link xlink:href="http://links.lww.com/EE/A331" ext-link-type="uri">http://links.lww.com/EE/A331</ext-link>. For the models fitting reaction time as the outcome, we utilized the gamma family distribution with a log link function due to the data&#x02019;s positive, nonzero, right-skewed nature. We modeled the score performance data assuming normally distributed errors.</p><p>To account for individual baseline differences in the repeated measurement data, a random intercept was included for each participant. We accounted for the overall population learning effect using a penalized spline for assessment day. In addition, to account for potential personal differences in learning effects, we also included personal random slopes for the assessment day. To limit model complexity and degrees of freedom used, both random intercepts and random slopes were penalized, and their coefficients were &#x0201c;shrunk&#x0201d; toward the population average. This means that, in most cases, if a participant&#x02019;s personal ability or learning curve does not deviate much from the population mean, their individual effect is adjusted closer to the average.</p><p>Exposure to pollen (assessed as both IPE and total exposure) was modeled as a penalized smooth using thin plate regression splines to allow flexibility and thus nonlinearity in the modeled relationship between exposure and cognitive performance while preventing overfitting.<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> Additionally, we conducted residual autocorrelation checks using variograms to assess and address any potential temporal correlation in the residuals.</p><p>We also used penalized smooths to adjust for the environmental variables particulate matter with less than 10 &#x000b5;m in diameter (PM<sub>10</sub>), NO<sub>2</sub>, relative humidity, and temperature in the 96 hours before testing, consistent with previous publications.<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup></p><p>Each model was adjusted for personal characteristics, such as body mass index, age, sex, level of education, and allergic status, along with time-varying personal confounders like exercise and daily intake of caffeine, alcohol, and intake of medications known to have an effect (positive or negative) on cognition (Effectively, no participants took medications that were known to affect cognitive performance positively.). We also adjusted for the hour of the day the participant completed the assessment, whether it was a weekday or weekend, and whether it was early, mid, or late pollen season.</p><p>The Akaike Information Criterion was used to determine which exposure period best fit our models for each cognitive assessment and outcome type. To explore whether associations differed depending on allergic status, we included separate penalized smooth terms for the allergic versus nonallergic group.</p></sec><sec><title>Sensitivity analyses</title><p>We performed sensitivity analyses to assess whether our personal exposure metric, IPE, was more sensitive than total pollen exposure in discerning a relationship between pollen exposure and cognitive outcomes. We also sought to validate IPE against total pollen exposure, which does not account for individual sensitizations. Additionally, models with symptom severity scores as the main predictor were used to investigate whether allergic symptoms may be the mechanism linking pollen exposure to changes in cognitive performance, as some previous literature has suggested.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup></p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Study population</title><p>We recruited 410 participants, 14 of whom did not have a valid SPT and four who did not complete the minimum of three cognitive assessments.

However, allergic participants showed slightly slower average reaction times on a grammatical reasoning test at high pollen concentrations. This effect was smaller but still present when using total pollen exposure.</p><p>Minimal performance changes and stable reaction times are consistent with past literature, though the results from previous studies tend to vary in the size and consistency of their observed effect and concern different aspects of cognitive performance. For instance, Trikojat et al.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> observed that allergic patients demonstrated a significantly slower reaction time (120 milliseconds) on a test of dual task processing during the allergy season when compared with the nonallergy season, while Marshall et al.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> found a small increase in processing reaction time for allergic participants only under one testing condition, and for only one of the tests in their battery. Wilken et al.<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> reported that symptomatic individuals had slower response times when solving math calculations after exposure to ragweed pollen in a controlled setting; however, their performance accuracy did not change. Finally, Papapostolou et al.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> found a negative correlation between allergic symptom scores and reaction time for simple movement in allergic children, indicating that symptom severity may have a mediating effect on reaction time.</p><p>While processing speed and reaction times may be affected by allergic rhinitis and elevated pollen concentration for some cognitive domains, our study did not observe a clear difference in reaction time across all cognitive tests. Moreover, the difference we observed (a 1% increase, or approximately 36 milliseconds slower for allergic participants at 300 pollen/m<sup>3</sup>) was relatively small. This may reflect that the effect is not as strong as some previous literature indicates, or that slowed processing may occur in different cognitive domains than the verbal and visuospatial domains tested here.</p><p>In contrast to our results, previous studies reported worse performance on some memory tasks for allergic individuals. For example, Trikojat et al.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> noted difficulties with short-term verbal memory while experiencing allergic inflammation, and Marshall et al.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> reported that allergic participants performed worse during the allergy season on a test of verbal working memory (though they found no difference in performance on several other tasks in a battery of working memory tests). Papapostolou et al.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> found an increase in errors on a visual-spatial working memory task in allergic children during the allergy season compared with matched controls. Because our study used a different spatial memory test, the results are not directly comparable with each of the findings above.</p><p>Whereas Papapostolou et al.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> found that symptom severity was associated with worse performance, we did not find decreased performance or changes in reaction times related to symptom severity, except in the double trouble task, where there was a significant decrease in overall score performance associated with severe self-reported symptoms. This decrease was not observed at mild or moderate self-reported symptoms. However, due to the limited number of participants who reported severe nasal and ocular symptoms, we should be cautious about drawing firm conclusions regarding this association.</p><p>Several factors may explain our null results regarding overall cognitive performance. Online neuropsychological assessments, while increasingly used in research settings due to their efficiency, are not always a perfect substitute for traditional neuropsychological exams.<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> For example, they have been shown to be less reliable in capturing reaction times due to differences in social pressure and engagement, distracting testing environments, and differences in digital resources.<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> We attempted to mitigate these effects by asking participants to use consistent testing setups and avoid distractions.</p><p>Furthermore, many neuropsychological examinations were created with the intent of diagnosing neurological conditions and may be less sensitive to minor cognitive fluctuations observed in otherwise healthy adults caused by pollen exposure and allergic inflammation.<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> The high education level of our study population may also result in less fluctuation compared with a more representative sample, as education has been positively correlated with cognitive functioning.<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> This higher &#x0201c;cognitive reserve&#x0201d;<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> has been shown to act as a protective factor for cognitive functioning in cases of mild cognitive impairment,<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> Alzheimer&#x02019;s,<sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> multiple sclerosis<sup><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> and stroke events in young patients.<sup><xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup></p><p>A perception of cognitive performance diminution among adults with pollen allergy may also explain why this symptom is self-reported but not corroborated with objectively measured differences on cognitive tests. One study, which performed randomized, double-blind trials to assess the perception of cognitive performance versus objective performance in a population of healthy individuals, individuals with epilepsy, and individuals with Parkinson&#x02019;s disease, found that for each population, the subjects&#x02019; perception of their cognitive performance was highly correlated to their mood rather than their objective performance.<sup><xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> This may indicate that allergic individuals who report diminished cognitive capabilities while experiencing allergies may not be performing objectively worse but are rather experiencing perceptual differences in cognition related to mood. In support of this possibility, high pollen concentrations have been associated with worsening mood, and seasonal allergies have been associated with a higher risk of mood disorders.<sup><xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> The relationship between pollen exposure, mood, and cognition is speculative, and further research is needed to understand how, and if, these factors may be affecting each other.</p></sec><sec><title>Relevant exposure period</title><p>We did not identify a single consistent exposure averaging period as universally relevant for the four cognitive assessments, as the best-fitting exposure periods varied between 3 and 120 hours. This inconsistency likely reflects the absence of a strong relationship between pollen exposure and cognitive performance, reinforcing our null findings and suggesting there is no clear link between pollen concentration and the cognitive outcome metrics.</p></sec><sec><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>A key strength of this study is the use of hourly pollen measurements and repeated cognitive measurements over a 10-day period. This allowed for a more informative understanding of the participants&#x02019; daily cognitive fluctuations, as well as a possible exposure-response relationship between pollen concentration and cognitive performance. Previous studies<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> performed cognitive testing only once during and once outside of pollen season, which may have limited their ability to account for other time-varying confounders, including other air quality variables (PM<sub>10</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub>), fluctuating pollen concentration within the pollen season, and daily behavioral variations (caffeine, alcohol, exercise, and medication intake) which may affect cognitive performance.</p><p>In line with previous studies,<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> this study relied on SPT to assess allergy sensitization profiles for each participant. Uniquely to this study, we used these profiles to determine the IPE, thereby focusing on the personally relevant pollen exposure for each participant during their participation in the cognitive testing. This allowed for a more individualized exposure assessment, rather than considering total pollen exposure regardless of sensitization. This decision was made under the assumption that the inflammatory response is a part of the mechanism influencing cognition.<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Modeling an interaction with allergy status, as well as modeling both IPE and total pollen exposure, allowed us to asses and validate this novel exposure metric. Generally, we found null results regardless of the exposure metric, but the effect size for the difference in reaction times on the grammatical reasoning test was slightly larger using IPE rather than total pollen exposure.</p><p>Further, our IPE metric weights all seven pollen types equally as long as the individual demonstrates a sensitization on SPT, though it is possible that their symptomatic response following real-world exposure varies. Further, allergenicity can be affected by meteorological and environmental factors that vary in space and time, even when the pollen concentration is stable.<sup><xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup> Despite this, IPE has been shown to be predictive of symptoms and useful in assessing the associations between pollen with other biological processes (such as cardiovascular health), demonstrating its value as a proxy for assessing the associations with cognitive functioning.<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup></p><p>We used a single, centrally located pollen measurement station in Basel to collect pollen concentration data, which may not perfectly reflect the pollen exposure for each participant due to variations within the city, microclimates, and individual behavior. Study participants lived a median distance of 2.3 km (interquartile range: 1.1&#x02013;4.8 km) from the pollen trap, located centrally on the University hospital&#x02019;s rooftop. Due to the sparse distribution of routine pollen monitors, few studies have attempted to assess local, within-city pollen contrasts.<sup><xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup> While some spatial differences have been observed, pollen traps are generally considered to be regionally representative.<sup><xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup> Within Switzerland, we find typically high temporal correlations between daily pollen concentrations measured in Basel and in other nearby cities.<sup><xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup> While we considered possible distractions, physical activity, alcohol and coffee consumption, and medication intake, we could only assess a limited number of time-varying confounders daily. We did not assess the use of air purifiers, window opening, or other exposure-modifying behaviors. Although we assessed time spent outdoors, we did not ultimately include it in the model because of potentially opposing effects on individuals with and without pollen allergies. While time outdoors is generally beneficial for cognition,<sup><xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup> this may not be the case for allergic individuals, who may stay indoors on high-pollen days.</p><p>Finally, the study&#x02019;s volunteer-based population was highly educated, with 90% holding a Bachelor&#x02019;s degree or higher, which may affect cognitive performance trends and limit generalizability. However, repeated measurements allowed participants to act as their own controls, accounting for individual differences and providing a reliable assessment of exposure associations.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We did not find evidence that increased pollen exposure is associated with decreased performance on cognitive assessments. We did find an increase in reaction time for a verbal reasoning assessment for participants with pollen allergy at a high level of pollen exposure. As this effect was small, and limited to a single cognitive test, we cannot conclude that increased pollen exposure broadly affects reaction time across multiple cognitive domains. We observed worse performance on a test of response inhibition for individuals experiencing severe allergy symptoms, however, we did not observe a change in performance for individuals experiencing mild to moderate symptoms. Our findings suggest that there may not be a strong relationship between pollen exposure and cognitive performance when using online cognitive tests as objective performance indicators. This finding is corroborated by the inconsistency of results in the current literature. However, as cognitive issues are commonly reported as a symptom of pollen allergies, further exploration into the subjective perception of cognition, as well as studies using more comprehensive and sensitive cognitive test batteries, is warranted.</p></sec><sec sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest statement</title><p>The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest with regard to the content of this report.</p></sec><sec><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>We thank our study nurses and study assistants Alexandra Plattner, Marianne Rutschi, Claire Dexter, Judith Boegli, Jutta Gerber, Katharina M&#x000e4;der, Cornelia Mathis, Margarethe Wiedenmann, Luc Schuler, and Mauritz B&#x000fc;rgler for their efforts in recruitment, data collection, and logistical planning.
