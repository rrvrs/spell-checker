Online media is a key source of public information on road safety. Understanding how crashes are reported is crucial for detecting potential reporting biases and enhancing safety awareness. Hence, to address the issue of the lack of high-quality, media-reported fatal crash data, fatal crash reports were extracted for 2022&#x02013;2023 from The Times of India, a prominent Indian news outlet. The resulting dataset comprised 2898 fatal crashes, 6584 fatalities and 7812 injuries, including 16 detailed crash attributes. This dataset was developed using web scraping and natural language processing (NLP) techniques. Automated tools such as Selenium and BeautifulSoup were employed to extract raw data from the news source. NLP algorithms were then applied to identify key crash attributes, including crash date, location, vehicles involved and number of fatalities. This study provides a replicable framework for constructing robust datasets from media sources, enabling multidisciplinary research on transportation safety, media reporting and public perception of crashes. The dataset is expected to serve as a valuable resource for analysing how the media shapes road safety narratives and for investigations on identifying high-fatality crash locations.</p></abstract><kwd-group id="keys0001"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Road safety</kwd><kwd>Traffic crash fatalities</kwd><kwd>News reporting</kwd><kwd>Crash data</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p id="para0002">Specifications Table<table-wrap position="float" id="utbl0001"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Subject</td><td valign="top">Safety Research</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Specific subject area</td><td valign="top">Fatal Road Traffic Crashes, Automated Data Extraction, Natural Language Processing</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Type of data</td><td valign="top">Processed Tabular Crash Attributes Data<break/>Unprocessed Raw Road Traffic Crash Articles<break/>Data Analysis Python Code Files</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Data collection</td><td valign="top">Articles on fatal road traffic crashes (RTCs) published in The Times of India were collected using Python programming.

</p></sec><sec id="sec0003"><label>2</label><title>Background</title><p id="para0006">According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), millions of people die annually owing to road traffic crashes (RTCs), which are the 12<sup>th</sup> leading cause of death among adults and the leading cause among children and young adults aged 5&#x02013;29 years. Approximately two-thirds of these fatalities involve the working-age population (18&#x02013;59 years), resulting in considerable social and economic impacts [<xref rid="bib0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Low- and middle-income countries experience disproportionately high outcomes from RTCs, with fatality rates nearly three times higher than those in high-income countries. India has implemented several road safety initiatives, including amendments to the Motor Vehicles Act and increased funding for state-level safety programmes [<xref rid="bib0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Nonetheless, contrary to the WHO&#x02019;s Sustainable Development Goal of reducing road traffic fatalities by 50 % by 2030 [<xref rid="bib0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], India has witnessed a continued escalation in fatalities, with a compound annual growth rate of 1.7 % between 2018 and 2022 [<xref rid="bib0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. These statistics highlight the deeply ingrained nature of the road safety challenge in India and underscore the need for a comprehensive strategy to enhance public awareness. Effective public communication could augment support for more decisive policy interventions and safer behavioural norms, aligning the country with its sustainable development goals.</p><p id="para0007">Media serves as a primary source of public information and communication; therefore, understanding the link between media coverage and traffic safety awareness is critical. Research has shown that limited reporting of traffic crashes is associated with fewer policy reforms and that adequate media attention can enhance public support for road safety initiatives [<xref rid="bib0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Although the media plays an essential role in promoting road safety [<xref rid="bib0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], editorial decisions on which incidents to report often reflect organisational interests rather than public education goals [<xref rid="bib0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Disproportionate media coverage of crashes involving youngsters may lead to overestimations of youth fatalities, distorting public perception and behavioural responses towards actual crash trends and vulnerable populations [<xref rid="bib0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p id="para0008">Media reports inherently provide selective coverage of crashes, prioritising incidents perceived as newsworthy. Hence, systematic underreporting occurs, and the resulting datasets represent only a fraction of the actual fatal RTCs. This fundamental issue introduces biases and must be considered when interpreting the findings. Investigating the biases introduced by media reporting can, therefore, reveal key factors that influence public understanding of road safety. Nevertheless, the lack of comprehensive datasets on media-reported fatal RTCs limits researchers&#x02019; ability to explore such biases. This data article aims to bridge this gap and draw attention to an under-investigated yet impactful area of research&#x02014;the role of media in transportation system safety<italic>.</italic></p></sec><sec id="sec0004"><label>3</label><title>Data Description</title><p id="para0009">The data are present in the Mendeley Data Repository entitled &#x02018;Media-Reported Road Traffic Crash Data&#x02019; [<xref rid="bib0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].

Therefore, TOI was selected as the primary data source owing to its extensive national reach, substantial online readership, consistent digital archiving and the fact that it is published in a language widely understood by the population.</p></sec><sec id="sec0012"><label>4.4</label><title>Identification of keywords</title><p id="para0033">After identifying the data source, appropriate keywords for article retrieval were determined. This process began by estimating the total number of articles typically published on the TOI website in a month. The content was manually analysed for a randomly selected month&#x02014;June 2023&#x02014;to evaluate the proportion of articles related to RTCs and road safety. A total of 14,715 articles were published in this month, of which 423 (3 %) focused on RTCs or road safety.</p><p id="para0034">Of these 423 articles, 247 (58 %) specifically addressed fatal RTCs, 54 (12 %) concentrated on non-fatal RTCs, and the remaining 122 (29 %) covered general road safety topics. A term frequency analysis was subsequently performed on the titles of the 247 fatal RTC articles to identify commonly used keywords. The most frequently encountered terms were &#x02018;Road&#x02018;, &#x02018;Accident&#x02019;, &#x02018;Killed&#x02019;, &#x02018;Dead&#x02018;, &#x02018;Dies&#x02018; and &#x02018;Death&#x02018;. These keywords were then tested in various combinations to assess their retrieval effectiveness.</p><p id="para0035">This keyword set successfully retrieved 220 of the 247 fatal RTC articles, representing a retrieval accuracy of approximately 90 %. Given their high recall rate, these keywords were selected for automated data collection from the TOI website.</p></sec><sec id="sec0013"><label>4.5</label><title>Raw data extraction</title><p id="para0036">Python programming was used to automate data collection and filter out relevant crash attributes from the raw data, including the number of fatalities, injuries and crash location. To achieve this purpose, multiple Python packages were utilised to automate data collection. The following are some of the packages utilised:<list list-type="simple" id="celist0004"><list-item id="celistitem0013"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="para0037"><bold>Selenium:</bold> The Selenium Package was applied to automate data collection from web browsers. This package is a powerful tool for automating web browsers, permitting users to programmatically simulate interactions with webpages. Selenium allows users to automate tasks such as form submission, button clicks, navigation and more complex tasks, such as testing and web scraping, with browsers such as Google Chrome, Firefox and Safari [<xref rid="bib0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In our context, Selenium was used to open a web browser and access TOI webpages containing crash articles for a single day, collect all article-related data and then terminate the session to open a new one with the next day&#x02019;s articles.</p></list-item><list-item id="celistitem0014"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="para0038"><bold>BeautifulSoup:</bold> The BeautifulSoup Package is a tool for web scraping and parsing HTML and XML documents and webpages. This package efficiently navigates and modifies the content in webpages [<xref rid="bib0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In our context, BeautifulSoup was used to identify HTML tags of webpage containers that included article headings, publication dates and article content and subsequently transmit the information to a data frame storing raw data.</p></list-item><list-item id="celistitem0015"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="para0039"><bold>NLTK:</bold> The Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) is an open-source Python Package that performs natural language processing (NLP) tasks. This package provides a wide range of functions to work with English-language tasks, such as tokenisation, lemmatisation, part-of-speech tagging and named entity recognition [<xref rid="bib0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In our context, NLTK part-of-speech tagging and keyword recognition were used to identify crash attributes from the article content.</p></list-item><list-item id="celistitem0016"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="para0040"><bold>Pandas:</bold> The Pandas Package is a data analysis tool that can efficiently transform, clean and analyse numerical and textual data. This package is designed to manage missing data, edit and reorganise datasets and simplify data alignment and merging tasks. In our context, its data frame functionality was utilised to store the article title, date and content in a data frame when multiple days&#x02019; data were collected. It combined these into one-month data [<xref rid="bib0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p></list-item></list></p><p id="para0041">Using the identified keywords, relevant articles were filtered out from all articles published each day. <xref rid="fig0004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> illustrates a sample interface that filters articles based on keywords for a single day.<fig id="fig0004"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Raw data extraction interface of single-day fatal crash articles.</p></caption><alt-text id="alt0006">Fig. 4</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="gr4" id="celink0004"/></fig></p><p id="para0042">Subsequently, the process of raw data collection began, with Selenium automatically opening the URL of the first article, which was identified based on its title using BeautifulSoup&#x02019;s HTML container tags. The container tag of the article title was determined to be &#x02018;#storyBody &#x0003e; div &#x0003e; div.crmK8 &#x0003e; div &#x0003e; div &#x0003e; div &#x0003e; div &#x0003e; div &#x0003e; div:nth-child({i}) &#x0003e; a &#x0003e; div &#x0003e; div.fHv_i.o58kM &#x0003e; span&#x02018;.</p><p id="para0043">Here, &#x02018;i&#x02018; represents the serial number of the article title out of all the articles on the webpage. For instance, if there were six articles on a given day, each article title had the same container tag, differentiated by the &#x02018;i&#x02018;, whose value ranged from 1 to 6. Then, Selenium clicked on the hyperlink of the first news article on the webpage to land on the page containing its entire content, a sample of which is illustrated in <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>.<fig id="fig0005"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>Sample article content interface containing crash attribute details.</p></caption><alt-text id="alt0007">Fig. 5</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="gr5" id="celink0005"/></fig></p><p id="para0044">On this page, BeautifulSoup again extracted the article title using the HTML container tag &#x02018;div.NvaTO &#x0003e; div.cCU6C.innerbody &#x0003e; div.okf2Z &#x0003e; div.pZFl7 &#x0003e; h1 &#x0003e; span&#x02018; and the date using the tag &#x02018;div.NvaTO &#x0003e; div.cCU6C.innerbody &#x0003e; div.okf2Z &#x0003e; div.pZFl7 &#x0003e; div &#x0003e; div.xf8Pm.byline &#x0003e; span&#x02018;. The same container tags were used for all article titles and publication dates. However, different tags were used for extracting the content. A comprehensive list of 11 container tags was prepared, and BeautifulSoup was used to loop through it, matching the tags with the article content container and extracting the relevant information. One such sample article content container tag is &#x02018;/ html / body / div [2] / div / div [3] / div [3] / div [2] / div [1] / div [1] / div [5] / div [2] / div / div [2] / div [2]&#x02018;. Other container tags also exhibited the same structure; only the integer values in div[i] were in an unorganised sequence, containing any digit from 0 to 9. The code opened an article and then used BeautifulSoup to compare the listed container tags with those on the webpage. When a successful match was obtained, it retrieved and saved the textual content within these tags into a data frame. Selenium continued this process until each article&#x02019;s information was successfully extracted.</p><p id="para0045">Following the keyword identification process, data were curated daily for one month. Raw RTC articles were collected for each day and stored in separate CSV files, which were then aggregated to create a comprehensive monthly dataset. Nonetheless, some non-relevant articles were also captured during this process. These articles did not report on fatal RTCs, although they contained the selected keywords in their titles. Instead, many featured political statements or commentary on road safety, lacking substantive information about specific crash events.</p><p id="para0046">Such irrelevant articles were manually reviewed and removed from the dataset to ensure the quality of the data. This cleaning step was necessary to retain only those articles that reported actual fatal RTCs. The same procedure was followed for each month&#x02019;s data, resulting in the complete raw dataset, which is provided in the &#x02018;Raw Data&#x02018; folder.</p></sec><sec id="sec0014"><label>4.6</label><title>Crash attributes extraction</title><p id="para0047">This stage involved extracting detailed crash attributes from the monthly raw dataset. Of all the attributes, only the &#x02018;Article Date&#x02018; field was in a directly usable format. A unique identifier labelled &#x02018;Crash Number&#x02018; was assigned to each crash instance during the extraction process and did not require parsing from the article content. The &#x02018;Month&#x02018; attribute was derived from the &#x02018;Article Date&#x02018;, as the date string included the month name. The remaining attributes were extracted using rule-based NLP methods, guided by recurring patterns in article formatting. The content shown in <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> is used as a representative example to illustrate the process, as its structure is typical of most fatal RTC articles published by TOI.</p><p id="para0048">To extract the &#x02018;Crash Day&#x02018; attribute, a keyword search method was applied to detect the presence of weekday terms (e.g. Monday to Sunday) in the article text. For instance, in the sample article, the identified value was &#x02018;Thursday&#x02018;. This basic rule-based approach was effective owing to the frequent inclusion of the crash day in reporting. The HeidelTime Python package [<xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] was employed for &#x02018;Crash Date&#x02018; extraction using the article&#x02019;s publication date and the crash day as input parameters. HeidelTime interprets temporal expressions in context, allowing it to estimate the precise date of the crash. In the example, with an article date of 16 November 2024 and a reported crash day of Thursday, HeidelTime correctly inferred the crash date.</p><p id="para0049">The &#x02018;Location&#x02018; attribute was extracted via pattern recognition using keyword-based rules. Terms such as &#x02018;near,&#x02018; &#x02018;at&#x02018; and &#x02018;in&#x02018; were used to identify phrases likely to contain location names. Furthermore, a consistent pattern was observed, with the city name appearing at the beginning of TOI articles. These initial city mentions were also extracted to enhance location coverage. The algorithm searched for &#x02018;Road&#x02018; to capture road names and extracted the two preceding words as these typically denoted the road&#x02019;s name. Potential location candidates identified in the example article were &#x02018;Farrukhabad&#x02018;, &#x02018;Dhamganwa&#x02018;, &#x02018;Farrukhabad&#x02013;Kaimganj road&#x02018; and &#x02018;Kanpur&#x02018;. Of these, &#x02018;Dhamganwa&#x02018;, the one most relevant at the local crash level, was selected as the final &#x02018;Location&#x02018; attribute.</p><p id="para0050">Crash location names extracted from the article content were input into the Google Maps Geocoding API [<xref rid="bib0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] to obtain the corresponding geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude). Although this automated method was generally effective, it did not recognise certain location names mentioned in the articles. In such cases, a manual search was conducted using Google Maps [<xref rid="bib0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], which enabled the successful retrieval of coordinates. For instance, in the example case, this process yielded the coordinates (27.515, 79.405).</p><p id="para0051">To assign the &#x02018;Million-Plus City&#x02018; attribute, each crash location&#x02019;s coordinates were manually checked against the administrative boundaries of Indian cities with populations exceeding one million [<xref rid="bib0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The attribute was assigned as &#x02018;Nil&#x02019; if the coordinates fell outside any such boundary. In the example case, the location did not correspond to a million-plus city, so &#x02018;Nil&#x02018; was recorded. Similarly, the crash coordinates were used to identify the state in which the crash occurred. A manual verification process ensured that the &#x02018;State&#x02018; attribute was accurately assigned. In the given example, the crash occurred in the state of Uttar Pradesh.</p><p id="para0052">The &#x02018;Victim&#x02019;s Vehicle&#x02018; (Vehicle 1) and &#x02018;Striking Vehicle/Object&#x02018; (Vehicle 2) attributes were extracted using a rule-based keyword-matching algorithm tailored to the narrative structure of fatal RTC articles. This algorithm initially scanned the article content for the earliest mention of a vehicle from a predefined list and assigned it as Vehicle 1. This name was deleted from the text, and the search was repeated to identify a second vehicle, designated as Vehicle 2. In cases where both vehicles were of the same type, the second occurrence was not found, and Vehicle 2 was recorded as blank. This blank value implicitly indicated that both vehicles were of the same type. For example, in the sample case, Vehicle 1 would be recorded as &#x02018;Bike&#x02018; and Vehicle/Object 2 as &#x02018;Tractor&#x02013;Trolley&#x02018;.</p><p id="para0053">To extract the &#x02018;Killed&#x02018; and &#x02018;Injured&#x02018; attributes, a keyword search algorithm was applied to the article titles. Terms such as killed, died and dead were used to identify fatalities, whereas keywords such as injured and injury were used to detect non-fatal injuries. For each case, the algorithm extracted the numeral appearing up to two words before the keyword in the title. If no mention of injuries was found, the injured field was left blank. In the example case, the title contained &#x02018;3 killed&#x02018;, leading to a value of 3 for &#x02018;Killed&#x02018;, and as there was no reference to injuries, a value of 0 was recorded for &#x02018;Injured&#x02018;.</p><p id="para0054">The &#x02018;Age&#x02018; attribute of fatal crash victims was extracted using a pattern-based approach, following a standard formatting convention used in the articles. Usually, the victims&#x02019; ages are mentioned in parentheses immediately after their names. Hence, the algorithm scanned the article content for numeric values enclosed in parentheses and aggregated these values into the &#x02018;Age&#x02018; field. This attribute specifically captured the ages of individuals who died in the crash, as information regarding the ages of injured victims was typically absent. If, for example, four fatalities were reported in an article, the corresponding entry in the age field would ideally contain four distinct values separated by commas (e.g. &#x02018;24, 22, 20, 19&#x02018;). Nevertheless, owing to incomplete reporting, fewer age values may be recorded. In the example case, the extracted ages would be &#x02018;24, 22, 20&#x02018;.</p><p id="para0055">The &#x02018;Gender&#x02018; attribute was determined manually by analysing how victims were referenced in the article. Gender was inferred based on victim names as well as gendered pronouns and descriptors such as &#x02018;he&#x02018;, &#x02018;she&#x02018;, &#x02018;his&#x02018; and &#x02018;her&#x02019;. If all identified victims were male, the value &#x02018;Male&#x02018; was assigned, and if all were female, &#x02018;Female&#x02018; was recorded. If victims included individuals of both genders, the attribute was labelled &#x02018;Both&#x02018;. In rare cases where the article explicitly stated that the victim was transgender, the attribute was marked as &#x02018;Trans&#x02018;. In the example case, the victims were identified as male; therefore, &#x02018;Male&#x02018; would be assigned for the &#x02018;Gender&#x02018; attribute.</p><p id="para0056">The &#x02018;Road Type&#x02018; attribute was manually identified using Google Maps. Road classifications, such as national highways, state highways or other local roads, were determined by cross-referencing the crash location with the road labels on Google Maps. <xref rid="fig0006" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> illustrates the various road types designated on the platform. The identified road type was classified as &#x02018;OR&#x02018; (Other Roads) in the example case.<fig id="fig0006"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><p>Representation of different road types on google maps.</p></caption><alt-text id="alt0008">Fig. 6</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="gr6" id="celink0006"/></fig></p><p id="para0057">The &#x02018;Crash Type&#x02018; attribute was also manually extracted and supplemented with keyword-matching techniques. Specific terms within the article content, such as stationary, hit from behind, mowed down and similar expressions, were used to infer the nature of the collision. For example, the presence of the word stationary was interpreted as indicative of a &#x02018;Fixed Object Collision&#x02018;. However, each identified crash type was verified by manually reviewing the article context to ensure accuracy.</p></sec><sec id="sec0015"><label>4.7</label><title>Sanity checks and data validation</title><p id="para0058">Experts in the field scrutinised and verified the dataset to ensure its accuracy. Multiple checks were performed on crash attributes to determine their quality.</p><p id="para0059">Duplicate entries for a single crash were identified and eliminated to ensure that only unique entries were present in the crash attributes data. This process identified entries involving fatal crashes with identical victim vehicles, impacting vehicles, crash day and number of fatalities and subsequently highlighted such entries. A manual check was then performed to eliminate the duplicates. Duplicate entries could have been generated owing to multiple articles about the same crash being published on different days. Hence, the crash attribute data included only unique crashes.</p><p id="para0060">Moreover, the coordinates of the crash location, which could not be extracted using the API, were obtained using a zeroing-in process. This process initially identified the state name, then the district name, and finally, the exact location or road name to pinpoint the crash site. Similar to the data validation exercise by Sinha et al [<xref rid="bib0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], both authors performed this task independently and separately. The coordinates were subsequently matched to ensure consistency. This process ensured that the location coordinates were precise and reliable. Furthermore, the geocodes generated by the API were verified to confirm that their locations fell within the Indian boundary and the road section specified in the article. Hence, the dataset was checked for its quality and unbiasedness.</p><p id="para0061">Ultimately, to ensure data quality, the results of previous research studies were reviewed to determine whether they matched our dataset. Our crash dataset has 2898 fatal crashes with 6584 fatalities; hence, the fatal crash severity, i.e. the number of people killed per crash, is 2.27; however, as per government-released data, the fatal crash severity is only 1.08 [<xref rid="bib0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. This difference emphasises that fatal crashes with higher fatalities are prioritised in reporting. For instance, De Ceunynck et al. observed that mean fatalities in media-reported fatal crashes were 1.2, as opposed to 1 in the official database for such crashes [<xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In addition, crashes occurring on a weekend receive higher media coverage than those on a weekday, which is also reflected in our data, with &#x02018;Sunday&#x02018; and &#x02018;Saturday&#x02019; being the most common entries for the &#x02018;Crash Day&#x02018; variable. Ultimately, in terms of vehicle type involved in the crash, our data showed that &#x02018;Cars&#x02018;, &#x02018;Buses&#x02018; and &#x02018;Trucks&#x02018; had a disproportionately higher representation in media-reported fatal crashes compared with 'Pedestrians&#x02018;, &#x02018;Bicycles&#x02018; and &#x02018;Two-Wheelers&#x02018;. De Ceunynck et al. also observed that crashes involving buses and heavy goods vehicles have a five-fold and two-fold higher chance of being reported, respectively. In comparison, those involving powered two-wheelers (i.e. mopeds and motorcycles) have a significantly lower chance (i.e. one-fourth and half, respectively) of being reported. Crashes involving cyclists also have a lower probability of being reported. These checks and statistics highlight the rigorous processes adopted to verify data quality and the similarity of crash attributes in this dataset to those in others.</p></sec><sec id="sec0016"><label>4.8</label><title>The stepwise sequence to analyse the dataset</title><p id="para0062">To interact meaningfully with the dataset and fully leverage its potential, we recommend that readers follow the step-by-step procedure outlined below.</p><p id="para0063">Step 1: Using the &#x02018;Raw Data&#x02018; folder in the repository, read and understand how the media writes an article on RTCs, an example of which is provided in <xref rid="tbl0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>.

The first limitation concerns potential underreporting, a common issue in several RTC datasets [<xref rid="bib0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Media coverage inherently captures only a selective subset of road crashes, usually those with higher fatalities involving certain types of vehicles or those occurring under particular circumstances deemed newsworthy. Thus, this dataset does not reflect the complete spectrum of road traffic fatalities but highlights those selectively reported by the media.</p><p id="para0072">The second limitation stems from the dataset&#x02019;s reliance on a single media source (TOI). Although TOI enjoys broad national coverage and is highly representative at the macro level, it may not uniformly capture crash incidents across all regions of the country. Regional readership density, the availability of local reporters and the differences in urban vs rural coverage may affect the geographical distribution of reported crashes. Hence, the dataset may have limited representativeness for micro-level or region-specific analyses.</p><p id="para0073">Additional data sources, such as regional or vernacular-language news outlets, could be integrated to enhance the comprehensiveness and regional representation of future versions of this dataset.
