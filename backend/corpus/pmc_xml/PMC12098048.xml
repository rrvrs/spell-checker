This study aims to identify novel regulatory targets and signaling pathways that modulate the tumor microenvironment (TME) in HGSOC, focusing on the pleiotrophin (PTN) signaling pathway and syndecan 4 (SDC4) expression as potential biomarkers for prognosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Bioinformatics analysis was conducted on single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data (GSE146026) of HGSOC to investigate the TME. The data were subjected to unsupervised clustering to classify cell types within the TME, revealing eight distinct clusters representing various cell types. Cell-cell interactions were analyzed using the CellChat tool. Additionally, TCGA datasets were used to validate the expression of SDC4 and its association with clinical outcomes. The functional enrichment of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between high and low SDC4 expression groups was performed to uncover associated pathways. Experimental validation was carried out using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and Western blotting on ovarian cancer cell lines (OVCAR3 and SKOV3).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The unsupervised clustering analysis revealed eight major cell types: macrophages, fibroblasts, ovarian cancer cells, B cells, T cells, dendritic cells, and erythrocytes. CellChat analysis highlighted significant interactions between these cell types, suggesting a complex TME. Further exploration identified PTN signaling as a key regulator within the HGSOC TME. Validation using TCGA datasets revealed upregulation of SDC4 in ovarian cancer tissues, with high SDC4 expression correlating with shorter overall survival. DEGs between high and low SDC4 expression groups were linked to the PI3K-Akt and MAPK signaling pathways, cell junction organization, and focal adhesion. qRT-PCR validation confirmed a significant upregulation of SDC4 in OVCAR3 and SKOV3 ovarian cancer cell lines, with expression levels 3.8- to 4.2-fold higher than control cells (<italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.01), supporting the computational predictions.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study highlights the PTN signaling pathway as a potential therapeutic target in HGSOC and identifies SDC4 as a prognostic biomarker for&#x000a0;poor patient outcomes. Our findings offer new insights into the molecular&#x000a0;mechanisms governing the TME of HGSOC, although further investigation&#x000a0;is&#x000a0;needed to fully elucidate the functional role of SDC4 in ovarian cancer progression.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC)</kwd><kwd>tumor microenvironment (TME)</kwd><kwd>pleiotrophin (PTN) signaling</kwd><kwd>syndecan 4 (SDC4)</kwd><kwd>single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq)</kwd><kwd>experimental validation</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>The author(s) declare that financial support was received for the research and/or publication of this article.

The most common subtype of ovarian cancer is high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC), which accounts for about 80% of all ovarian cancer cases (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). As there is no obvious clinical symptoms during the early stage of HGSOC, more than 80% of patients with HGSOC were diagnosed at advanced stages (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). The patients with advanced-stage HGSOC had very poor survival outcomes, owing to the aggressiveness of this malignancy (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Though chemotherapy, surgical resection and/or immunotherapy have been suggested as the main treatments, the recurrent rate of HGSOC is very high, and those patients had an overall 5-year survival of about 30% (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Thus, exploring more effective therapies for patients with HGSOC is key for improved patient prognosis. HGSOC is characterized by two hallmarks. One is tumor heterogeneity, which is featured by the microenvironment of the tumor (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Another hallmark is the epithelial-mesenchymal transition process, which plays a key role in regulating metastasis and chemoresistance of the HGSOC (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Recently, studies have demonstrated that single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is very powerful in deciphering the tumor microenvironment (TME). For example, Deng et&#x000a0;al. performed scRNA-seq analyses of primary HGSOC (HG_P) samples, metastatic HGSOC (HG_M) samples, and endometrioid carcinomas (EC) samples. The study demonstrated that ERBB2 and HOXB-AS3 genes were more amplified in metastasis tumors than in primary tumors, and revealed the TME of metastatic HGSOC (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Xu et&#x000a0;al., performed scRNA sequencing analyses of the tumors of 7 treatment-na&#x000ef;ve patients with HGSOC at early or late stages and five age-matched non-malignant ovarian samples, and the results delineated an ecosystemic landscape of HGSOC at early or late stages with a focus on its heterogeneity with TME, and also identified a four-EMT gene model for prediction of HGSOC patient outcomes (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Nath et&#x000a0;al., profiled scRNA-seq transcriptomes of HGSOC tumors collected longitudinally during therapy, and revealed that HGSOC&#x000a0;was driven by three archetypal phenotypes, defined as oncogenic states that describe the majority of the transcriptome variation (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Recently, the data mining of scRNA-sequencing public data has been an important strategy for deciphering the TME&#x000a0;in various types of cancers including HGSOC. For instance, Want et&#x000a0;al., performed bioinformatics analysis of scRNA-seq data of HGSOC&#x000a0;from GEO and identified several key prognostic biomarkers for HGSOC based on the stemness (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). In this study, we performed bioinformatics analysis of scRNA-seq data&#x000a0;of high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) from the GEO&#x000a0;dataset (GSE146026). We analyzed cellular interactions within the TME of HGSOC to uncover key regulatory networks. Our analysis identified the pleiotrophin (PTN) signaling pathway&#x000a0;as&#x000a0;a significant network modulating the tumor cells of HGSOC. Furthermore, we discovered that syndecan 4 (SDC4) may&#x000a0;act as an&#x000a0;important modulator within the HGSOC TME.&#x000a0;To&#x000a0;validate these&#x000a0;findings, experimental validation was performed&#x000a0;using ovarian cancer cell lines (OVCAR3 and SKOV3), where quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) confirmed the upregulation of SDC4. Finally, the prognostic role of SDC4 in HGSOC was further evaluated using TCGA datasets, which demonstrated that high SDC4 expression is associated with poor patient prognosis in ovarian cancer.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Ethical approval was not required for this study as all experiments were conducted using standard, commercially available ovarian cancer cell lines OVCAR3 and SKOV3 and online data.

The sequencing data, generated using the 10X Genomics platform, were processed with the Seurat package (Version: 3.2.1) in R software (Version 3.6.3). Each sample dataset was integrated into the project, and quality control metrics, including mitochondrial gene expression percentage and unique molecular identifier (UMI) counts, were applied to filter out low-quality cells. Principal component analysis (PCA) was conducted to identify significant dimensions for clustering, followed by visualization using the t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE) method. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between cell clusters were determined using the &#x0201c;FindAllMarkers&#x0201d; function in Seurat, with thresholds of logFC &#x02265; 0.25, min.pct &#x02265; 0.25, and min.diff.pct &#x02265; 0.25.</p></sec><sec id="s2_2"><title>Cell-cell communication analysis</title><p>The R software package of CellChat (version 1.4.0) was used to infer and analyze intercellular cell-cell communication networks across all the cell types based on single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>).

The present study performed the bioinformatics analysis of scRNA-seq dataset (GSE146026) for HGSOC tissues. Our analysis identified 8 clusters of cells, with &#x0201c;macrophages&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;fibroblast&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;ovarian cancer&#x0201d; being the main cell types. The CellChat analysis revealed the close interaction between different cell types. Further analysis revealed that PTN signaling is a player in the regulation of HGSOC TME. By using TGCA datasets, we found that SDC4 was up-regulated in the ovarian cancer tissues and high expression of SDC4 in ovarian cancer tissues was associated with shorter overall survival of patients with ovarian cancer. The functional enrichment analysis of DEGs between high and low SDC4 expression groups revealed that the DEGs were associated with cell junction organization, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, MAPK signaling pathway and focal adhesion. Our analysis underpinned the important role of PTN signaling in the TME of HGSOC.</p><p>PTN is a heparin-binding growth factor that is highly expressed in certain solid cancers, such as in breast and lung cancers (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). PTN activates its cell surface receptors, regulating multiple functions including cell adhesion, cell migration, cell proliferation and cytoskeletal stability (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). The role of PTN signaling has been well-documented in tumor biology. Shi et&#x000a0;al., showed that tumor-associated macrophages secrete PTN to promote PTPRZ1 signaling in glioblastoma stem cells for tumor growth (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Feng et&#x000a0;al., demonstrated that lung cancer cell migration can be hampered via repressing growth factor PTN/RPTP &#x003b2;/&#x003b6; signaling by menin (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Activation of PTN signaling could promote perineural invasion in the pancreatic cancer (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Kong et&#x000a0;al., found that PTN was a potential colorectal cancer prognostic factor that promoted VEGF expression and induced angiogenesis in the colorectal cancer (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). In ovarian cancer studies, PTN was expressed, produced, and secreted in a panel of EOC cell lines. PTN levels in serous ovarian tumor tissues were on average 3.5-fold higher relative to normal tissue and PTN is detectable in serum samples of patients with EOC. The 3.8- to 4.2-fold increase in SDC4 expression was observed in ovarian cancer tissues compared to normal ovarian tissues, serving as the baseline for this comparison. These findings underpinned that PTN and its signaling components may be of significance in the pathogenesis of epithelial ovarian cancer (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). In our analysis, we revealed that PTN is one of major driven signaling pathway in ovarian cancer cells that affect the other cell types in the TME, suggesting the importance of PTN signaling in the TME of HGSOC. Among these genes from PTN signaling, we further explored the relationship between the expression of these genes and the overall survival of patients with ovarian cancer. We found that high expression of SDC4 was associated with shorter overall survival of patients with ovarian cancer. SDC4 is an important member of SDCs family. SDC4 core protein mainly contains extracellular domain, transmembrane (TM) domain, and cytoplasmic (CP) domain (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Extracellular domain allows SDC4 interactions with extracellular matrix proteins through its heparan sulfate (HS) chain and SDC4 core also engage in protein-protein interactions directly. Syndecan-4 (SDC4) functions as a major endogenous membrane-associated receptor and widely regulates cytoskeleton, cell adhesion, and cell migration in human tumorigenesis (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). For examples, Chen et&#x000a0;al., showed that SDC4 gene silencing could promote human papillary thyroid carcinoma cell apoptosis and inhibit epithelial mesenchymal transition via Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin pathway (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). High expression of SDC-4 was found to be related to clinicopathological features and poor prognosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). In ovarian cancer studies, Kim et&#x000a0;al., showed that CCL5, a chemotactic ligand, was enriched in immune cells (T cells and NK cells) and mediated ovarian cancer cell survival in the ascites, through SDC4. Moreover, SDC4 expression correlated with poor overall survival in ovarian cancer patients (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Given that high SDC4 expression correlates with poor prognosis, it may serve as a potential biomarker for patient stratification in HGSOC. Patients with elevated SDC4 expression could be prioritized for more aggressive therapeutic strategies, including closer monitoring or targeted interventions. Furthermore, as SDC4 is involved in cell adhesion and migration, it might serve as a therapeutic target in combination with existing treatments. Future studies should investigate whether SDC4 expression levels can predict response to chemotherapy or targeted therapies, further enhancing its clinical utility in personalized medicine. The qRT-PCR validation further corroborated our bioinformatics predictions, showing a significant upregulation of SDC4 expression in ovarian cancer cell lines, particularly in OVCAR3 and SKOV3, relative to control cells. These results provide experimental evidence supporting the association between SDC4 overexpression and the molecular mechanisms underlying ovarian cancer progression. Furthermore, our study suggests that SDC4 may contribute to the progression of HGSOC, possibly by modulating cell interactions within the TME. Despite the valuable insights provided by our bioinformatics and experimental validation, this study has some limitations. First, the scRNA-seq data used in the analysis were derived from a publicly available dataset, which may not fully represent the complexity of HGSOC across different patient cohorts. Additionally, while our findings indicate a correlation between SDC4 expression and prognosis, the functional validation of SDC4&#x02019;s role in HGSOC progression requires further <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> studies, such as knockdown or overeDEGs expression experiments, to establish a definitive causal relationship. These experiments could help determine whether SDC4 directly contributes to tumor growth, metastasis, or chemoresistance.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Present study underscores the critical role of PTN signaling in shaping the tumor microenvironment (TME) of high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC). Through comprehensive bioinformatics analysis, we identified PTN signaling as a key mediator of intercellular communication within the TME, influencing various cellular interactions that contribute to tumor progression. Notably, we observed that high expression of SDC4, a critical component of PTN signaling, is significantly associated with poor prognosis in ovarian cancer patients, highlighting its potential as a prognostic biomarker. Functional enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes between high and low SDC4 expression groups revealed pathways related to cell junction organization, PI3K-Akt signaling, MAPK signaling, and focal adhesion, suggesting that SDC4 may play a pivotal role in ovarian cancer cell adhesion, migration, and overall tumor progression. These findings provide valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms driving HGSOC and highlight potential therapeutic targets within the PTN-SDC4 signaling axis. However, further functional validation and clinical studies are required to establish the definitive role of SDC4 in HGSOC progression and its potential utility as a therapeutic target or prognostic marker.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s6"><title>Data availability statement</title><p>Thank you for the comment.
