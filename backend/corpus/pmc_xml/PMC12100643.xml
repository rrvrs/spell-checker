for ultraviolet light-induced free radical polymerizations. Traditionally,
polymerization is spatially controlled using top-down techniques such
as photomasks, which produce well-defined polymeric films. In contrast,
we present an alternative method for controlling polymerization by
employing supramolecular materials to localize the photoinitiator.
This approach uses benzophenone-functionalized dipeptides that are
specifically tuned to enable supramolecular gel noodle formation,
which act as structural templates. We show that polymerization of
acrylate monomers around the gel noodles can increase the Young&#x02019;s
modulus by up to 2 orders of magnitude and produce mechanically robust
structures that can be handled. The self-assembly of the supramolecular
photoinitiators is also explored using viscosity and SAXS measurements,
providing an understanding of why only <bold>4BPAcFF</bold> successfully
forms gel noodles. Our method offers a simple yet effective technique
for localizing polymerization, enabling fine-tuning of mechanical
properties and the fabrication of intricate designs such as hollow-core
structures.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical"><graphic xlink:href="am5c03506_0007.jpg" position="float"/></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc-graphic"><graphic xlink:href="am5c03506_0005.jpg" id="tgr1" position="float"/></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>materials chemistry</kwd><kwd>soft materials</kwd><kwd>supramolecular

in processes
such as ultraviolet-curing (UV-curing) of coatings, inks, and adhesives.<named-content content-type="bibref-group">
<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr"/>,<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr"/>
</named-content> Benzophenone absorbs UV light and undergoes a transition to an excited
state, leading to the formation of free radicals.<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr"/> These radicals can be used to initiate polymerization reactions
in acrylates and methacrylates, resulting in rapid curing when exposed
to UV light.<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr"/> As a photoinitiator, benzophenone
is particularly useful because it can be activated by a broad range
of UV wavelengths and can be combined with co-initiators, such as
amines, to enhance its efficiency.<named-content content-type="bibref-group">
<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr"/>,<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr"/>
</named-content> Its versatility
and strong absorption make it ideal for applications requiring quick,
controlled polymerization, such as in three-dimensional (3D) printing,
dental materials, and protective coatings.<named-content content-type="bibref-group">
<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02212;<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr" specific-use="suppress-in-print"/>
<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr"/>
</named-content>
</p><p>In many
cases, benzophenone and related photoinitiators are dissolved
or uniformly dispersed throughout the monomers to be polymerized.<named-content content-type="bibref-group">
<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr"/>,<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr"/>
</named-content> This leads to well-defined and uniform polymeric films. To spatially
resolve photopolymerization, a top-down approach is typically used,
employing a computer-controlled light source or photomask to ensure
that polymerization occurs only in unmasked areas.<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr"/> The photomask ensures that only selected areas undergo
polymerization, enabling the creation of fine, detailed structures
such as microcircuits or 3D patterns; however, this approach can be
limited by cost and setup complexity.<named-content content-type="bibref-group">

<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr"/>
</named-content>
</p><p>Another method
to achieve spatial resolution is to isolate the
benzophenone in specific regions. There are examples where benzophenone
has been immobilized on a surface to ensure that the photoinitiation
and polymerization occurs from this interface.<named-content content-type="bibref-group">

<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr"/>
</named-content> These surfaces can be flat or can be curved such as from textile
fibers. The benzophenone is typically covalently bound to the surface
in some way. As an extension to this, examples of initiators that
allow gradients to be prepared based on density have also been described.<named-content content-type="bibref-group">

<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr"/>
</named-content>
</p><p>As an alternative approach, here we describe the use of surfactant-like
aggregates with a benzophenone core as a means of localizing the photoactive
groups (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"/>
</xref>).
We use dipeptides functionalized at the <italic toggle="yes">N</italic>-terminus
with benzophenone. These molecules self-assemble in water to give
micellar aggregates. Judicious design enables the formation of worm-like
micellar aggregates with a suitable viscosity such that gel noodles
can be prepared on cross-linking under extrusion. By incorporating
the benzophenone component directly into the gel noodle, our system
expands the potential of gel noodles in biomedical applications, including
targeted drug delivery and cell manipulation. For instance, spatially
controlled radical generation without widespread damage has attracted
increasing interest in cancer treatments and cell tagging.<named-content content-type="bibref-group">
<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr"/>,<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr"/>
</named-content> These gel noodles can also be used as photoinitiators for polymerizations,
spatially locking the initiation sites and leading to localized polymerization
from the surface of the gel noodle. The gel noodle can be removed
after polymerization, allowing hollow-core structures to be formed
from the templates. This work offers a new method for spatially controlling
photopolymerization and opens new possibilities for fabricating microfluidic
devices that are compatible with cell culturing.<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr"/>

</named-content> In many cases, these aromatic groups are essentially
nonfunctional and act simply to provide hydrophobicity and &#x003c0;-interactions
to direct self-assembly. However, this does not have to be the case
and indeed a benzophenone-functionalized dipeptide has been shown
to be photoactive.<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr"/>
</p><p>Inspired by
this, we synthesized three benzophenone-diphenylalanine
conjugates: <bold>3BPAcFF</bold>, <bold>3BPFF</bold> and <bold>4BPAcFF</bold> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"/>
</xref>a). We varied
the position at which the diphenylalanine is attached to the benzophenone
as well as the linker between the benzophenone and dipeptide (see <ext-link xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsami.5c03506/suppl_file/am5c03506_si_001.pdf" ext-link-type="uri">Supporting Information</ext-link> for synthetic pathway
and characterization). In all cases, the <italic toggle="yes">C</italic>-terminus
is free, meaning that we can use pH to control the self-assembly.
To induce self-assembly, an aqueous dispersion at high pH (10.0 &#x000b1;

their absorption at both optically dilute (&#x0003c;0.01 mg mL<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>) and micellar concentrations (10 mg mL<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>), which
were used to form the gel noodles (discussed later, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"/>

slight bathochromic shift in peak absorption in the concentrated solution

remained evident, allowing us to use UV light to initiate polymerization
at micellar concentrations.</p><p>The micellar structures formed at

of <bold>3BPAcFF</bold> was very low, indicating a small presence
of persistent structures in this material. The SAXS data best fits
to a combined power law and cylinder model, with the cylinder component
needed to account for the slight bump in the data at 0.03 &#x000c5;<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>. This further implies a small concentration of wormlike
structures present in solution that do not interact by entangling
or forming bundles, which accounts for the low viscosity. In comparison,
more viscous solutions were formed by <bold>3BPFF</bold>, and shear-thinning
behavior was also observed, suggestive of the presence of more wormlike
micelles that align under flow. Indeed, the SAXS data are best fitted
using a hollow cylinder model, with a radius of 36.8 nm and a thickness
of 4.2 nm, representing long fibrillar micelles. These structures
were confirmed by the cryo-EM results (<ext-link xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsami.5c03506/suppl_file/am5c03506_si_001.pdf" ext-link-type="uri">Figure S2a</ext-link>), which show significantly larger tube-like structures
compared to <bold>3BPAcFF</bold> (<ext-link xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsami.5c03506/suppl_file/am5c03506_si_001.pdf" ext-link-type="uri">Figure S2b</ext-link>). <bold>4BPAcFF</bold> formed more viscous solutions, also accompanied
by shear-thinning behavior. In line with the viscosity data, the SAXS
data for <bold>4BPAcFF</bold> are best fitted to a combined power
law and cylinder model with a significant cylinder component arising
from the micellar structures. On top of this, there is a peak at a
Q value of 0.02 &#x000c5;<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>. Like related systems,<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr"/> this peak represents the correlation length
of the system, &#x003be;, as these systems are behaving as polyelectrolytes.
The peak position shows a concentration dependence (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"/>

</named-content> The cryo-EM images of <bold>4BPAcFF</bold> (<ext-link xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsami.5c03506/suppl_file/am5c03506_si_001.pdf" ext-link-type="uri">Figure S2c,d</ext-link>) show thin fibers of approximately
5 nm in diameter that tend to bundle, leading to the increased viscosity
of the sample and accounting for the cylindrical component observed
in the SAXS data. As each of the gelator solutions exhibited non-Newtonian,
shear-thinning behavior, the data were fitted using standard Carreau&#x02013;Yasuda
and Cross models (<ext-link xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsami.5c03506/suppl_file/am5c03506_si_001.pdf" ext-link-type="uri">Figure S4</ext-link>). <bold>3PBFF</bold> and <bold>4BPAcFF</bold> were best described by the Carreau&#x02013;Yasuda
model, with both residuals obeying normality. For <bold>3BPAcFF</bold>, the residual from the Cross model did not pass Shapiro&#x02013;Wilk
or Anderson&#x02013;Darling normality tests; however, the residuals
appeared approximately normal, the visual fit was good, and the resulting
rheological parameters were reasonable given that the sample showed
a very low viscosity. Together, this confirmed that altering the chemical
structure of the linker group between the benzophenone and the self-assembling
moiety led to distinct micellar architectures, which in turn, drove
the observed differences in viscosity.</p><p>We confirmed that each
of the gelators could produce self-supporting
bulk gels when triggered with calcium chloride (<ext-link xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsami.5c03506/suppl_file/am5c03506_si_001.pdf" ext-link-type="uri">Figure S5</ext-link>). However, our intention here was to prepare localized
photoinitiators. To prepare these, we used a technique developed by
Stupp&#x02019;s group, forming so-called supramolecular gel noodles.<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr"/> To form gel noodles, a viscous solution is required
which is extruded into a cross-linking bath, herein an aqueous calcium
chloride solution (0.5 M). We have previously described how this method
can be manipulated to form long (multimeter) gel noodles with controlled
diameters.<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr"/> Using this approach, unsurprisingly
considering the viscosity data described in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"/>
</xref>c, only <bold>4BPAcFF</bold> was found to
form well-defined gel noodles when extruded into a bath containing
the calcium salt cross-linker at a minimum concentration of 10 mg
mL<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"/>
</xref>a). <bold>3BPAcFF</bold> was found to give gel noodles that
were extremely fragile such that they were unable to be lifted from
the cross-linking bath. <bold>3BPFF</bold> did not produce gel noodles,
but produced randomly sized precipitates that did not interlock and
were also unable to be removed (<ext-link xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsami.5c03506/suppl_file/am5c03506_si_001.pdf" ext-link-type="uri">Figure S6</ext-link>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig3" fig-type="figure"><label>3</label><caption><p>

500 &#x003bc;m in diameter (as determined by the extrusion needle, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"/>
</xref>). Considering the
formation process, to assess if there was a general alignment along
the gel noodle backbone, the gel noodles were first viewed under a
microscope with polarized light (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"/>
</xref>a,b). At 10 mg mL<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>, the
gel noodles showed some birefringent behavior, indicating a degree
of alignment that is mimicked by the increased viscosity of <bold>4BPAcFF</bold>. However, increasing the concentration of the pregelation
solution to up 50 mg mL<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> did not result in any
significant changes in the microscope imaging (<ext-link xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsami.5c03506/suppl_file/am5c03506_si_001.pdf" ext-link-type="uri">Figure S7</ext-link>).</p><p>The mechanical properties of the <bold>4BPAcFF</bold> gel noodles
were then measured. To do this, we evaluated the Young&#x02019;s modulus
(E) of the gel noodles by nanoindentation.<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr"/> This allows us to quantify the local mechanical properties at micron
length scales. The Young&#x02019;s modulus is improved slightly as
the concentration of the <bold>4BPAcFF</bold> increased (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"/>
</xref>c, see <ext-link xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsami.5c03506/suppl_file/am5c03506_si_001.pdf" ext-link-type="uri">Table S3</ext-link> for <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>-values). We attempted
to strengthen the gel noodles by subjecting the high pH solutions
to heat&#x02013;cool cycles at 70 &#x000b0;C pregelation; this has been
shown to be effective for other bulk gel systems.<xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr"/> However, in this case, this provided minimal benefit to
the gel noodles in terms of their useability and mechanical strength.
We therefore focused on <bold>4BPAcFF</bold> at 10 mg mL<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>, the lowest concentration that can be easily manipulated by hand.
Additionally, gel noodles formed from <bold>4BPAcFF</bold> were found
to be stable, with no changes in appearance or mechanical properties
after aging for 7 days. Soaking the gel noodles in either the trigger
solution (aqueous calcium chloride, 0.5 M) or in water (to prevent
salt precipitation) had no visible effect (<ext-link xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsami.5c03506/suppl_file/am5c03506_si_001.pdf" ext-link-type="uri">Figure S8</ext-link>), and the Young&#x02019;s modulus remained unchanged (<ext-link xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsami.5c03506/suppl_file/am5c03506_si_001.pdf" ext-link-type="uri">Figure S9</ext-link>).</p><p>Next, we investigated the use
of <bold>4BPAcFF</bold> as a photoinitiator.
We selected a commercial 365 nm LED as our irradiation source, and
although the absorption of the gelator and micellar solutions was
relatively low at this wavelength, it was still sufficient to induce
polymerization.<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr"/> A mixture of <bold>4BPAcFF</bold>, a cross-linkable acrylate monomer [pentaerythritol tetraacrylate
(PETA); in a 1:4 ratio, respectively], and DMSO-<italic toggle="yes">d</italic>
<sub>6</sub> solvent was irradiated in an NMR tube. Visually, it
was clear that the polymerization proceeded after 5 min of irradiation,
with a change in appearance from transparent to translucent (<ext-link xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsami.5c03506/suppl_file/am5c03506_si_001.pdf" ext-link-type="uri">Figure S10</ext-link>). Both the gelator and PETA signals
broadened significantly (indicating successful polymerization), and
the ratio of terminal alkene groups was reduced by approximately 20-fold
after 30 min of irradiation. Additionally, we did not see any dimerization
of the benzophenone component or significant degradation after irradiation
in DMSO-<italic toggle="yes">d</italic>
<sub>6</sub>, or after irradiating a piece
of gel noodle for 1 h (and freeze-drying to allow for NMR, <ext-link xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsami.5c03506/suppl_file/am5c03506_si_001.pdf" ext-link-type="uri">Figure S11</ext-link>). Electron paramagnetic resonance
spectroscopy was used to confirm radical generation from the benzophenone
component (<ext-link xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsami.5c03506/suppl_file/am5c03506_si_001.pdf" ext-link-type="uri">Figure S12</ext-link>). Radical adducts
were observed in irradiated reaction mixtures containing spin trap
5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline <italic toggle="yes">N</italic>-oxide (DMPO). The hyperfine
values of the adducts (PETA: <italic toggle="yes">a</italic>
<sub>N</sub> = 14.1
G, <italic toggle="yes">a</italic>
<sub>H</sub> = 21.2 G and 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate
(HEA, discussed later): <italic toggle="yes">a</italic>
<sub>N</sub> = 14.5 G, <italic toggle="yes">a</italic>
<sub>H</sub> = 21.5 G) are consistent with trapping of
carbon-centered radicals.<xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr"/> Selective broadening
of the high field line suggests that the trapped radicals are macromolecules,
i.e., polymer chain radicals. This effect is observed for both monomers
but is significantly more pronounced for the cross-linkable PETA sample.
Finally, we compared the photopolymerization rates between PETA and
another water-soluble acrylate monomer, HEA, using <bold>4BPAcFF</bold> as a photoinitiator at 1 wt %. We attempted to use gel permeation
chromatography to describe the polymer materials; however, neither
were soluble in tetrahydrofuran or <italic toggle="yes">N</italic>,<italic toggle="yes">N</italic>-dimethylformaldehyde (instrument-compatible solvents), even at concentrations
less than 1 mg mL<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>. As an alternative, we used
Fourier-Transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) to monitor the reduction
of the double bond signal between 791&#x02013;834 cm<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>, following a previously described method (<ext-link xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsami.5c03506/suppl_file/am5c03506_si_001.pdf" ext-link-type="uri">Figure S13</ext-link>).<xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr"/> Both acrylate signals from
PETA and HEA decreased rapidly, taking approximately 30 and 70 s,
respectively, to reach over 90% conversion. These results were comparable
with other photoinitiators (average 80% in 20 s) based on benzophenone,
ketocoumarin, and thioxanthone moieties.<named-content content-type="bibref-group">

<xref rid="ref47" ref-type="bibr"/>
</named-content> With this confirmation that the
benzophenone component of <bold>4BPAcFF</bold> can still act as an
efficient photoinitiator, we then sought to combine the two techniques.</p><p>Localized polymerization was achieved using two distinct methods
(see <ext-link xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsami.5c03506/suppl_file/am5c03506_si_001.pdf" ext-link-type="uri">Figure S14</ext-link> for schematic). First,
the gel noodles were removed from the trigger medium and manually
cut and arranged into the desired shape (here, a rod). The gel noodle
template was then encased in the PETA monomer (solvent free), and
we found that its low polarity and hydrophobicity did not dissolve
the template. To ensure a self-supporting polymer was formed, we irradiated
the template/monomer mixture for either 2 or 4 h. The excess monomer,
gel noodle template, and loose polymer aggregates were washed away
with solvent (see Photopolymerization) leaving the templated polymer
(<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig"/>
</xref>a). Again,
we viewed the newly formed structures under the microscope and when
using polarized light. There was a distinct change in appearance from
translucent to opaque, and on average, the gel noodles shrank to approximately
300 &#x003bc;m after solvent washing. The average thickness of the structures
increased with irradiation time, reaching approximately 300, 360,
410, 450, 500, and 500 &#x003bc;m after 2 to 6 h, respectively, at which
point it appeared to plateau. There was no general alignment visible
in the cross-polarized light, however, the polymer structure was clearly
localized to only where the gel noodle was positioned. Most interestingly,
the Young&#x02019;s Modulus increased significantly from &#x02248;16
to &#x02248;240 kPa after 2 h, which continued to increase to &#x02248;1840
kPa after 4 h. This increase in stiffness can be ascribed to the cross-linked
coating gradually forming a shell around the template. Scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) showed that the surface of the 2 h polymer structure
was very rough and somewhat fibrous (<ext-link xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsami.5c03506/suppl_file/am5c03506_si_001.pdf" ext-link-type="uri">Figure S15a</ext-link>), which is consistent with the uncontrolled nature of the photopolymerization
on the surface of the gel noodle. However, in the 4 h polymer structure,
the surface roughness was reduced, and the overall structure appeared
to have a higher cross-linking density. This filling and smoothing
of the structure explain the increase in Young&#x02019;s modulus, as
the polymers became increasingly stiffer with increasing photopolymerization
time (<ext-link xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsami.5c03506/suppl_file/am5c03506_si_001.pdf" ext-link-type="uri">Figure S15b</ext-link>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig4" fig-type="figure"><label>4</label><caption><p>Supramolecular gel noodle

could still
be formed when the trigger solution was mixed with a water-soluble
acrylate monomer, 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate (HEA). This enabled formation
of the gel noodle template in a single step, eliminating the need
for manual templating afterward, and could potentially be compatible
with applications that can produce even more complex structures using
3D, gel-based, or rapid liquid printing. In a 1:4 ratio (monomer to
calcium chloride, by volume) the gel noodles were still strong enough
to be manually lifted from the solution, although they had to be polymerized
quickly, as the gel noodles would dissolve into randomly sized pieces
and could no longer be lifted after approximately 1 h. Additionally,
the polymerization speed needed to be increased to account for their
solubility in the mixture solution. Polymerization was achieved by
irradiating the gel noodle with 365 nm LEDs positioned above and below
the sample, at a closer distance to increase the flux to approximately
120 mW cm<sup>&#x02013;2</sup>. The newly templated polymers were softer
and more flexible, compared to the PETA polymers which were brittle
and more rigid. The gel noodles also typically swelled during the
polymerization process, producing less defined structures that did
not fully mimic the original gel noodle template (<ext-link xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsami.5c03506/suppl_file/am5c03506_si_001.pdf" ext-link-type="uri">Figure S16</ext-link>). We again viewed the structures under the microscope
using cross-polarized light, which only showed some birefringent behavior;
however, there was still a visible change from translucent to opaque.
After solvent washing, the gel noodles shrunk to around 200 &#x003bc;m,
but unlike the PETA structures, these could be reswollen to over 500
&#x003bc;m when sat in water (<ext-link xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsami.5c03506/suppl_file/am5c03506_si_001.pdf" ext-link-type="uri">Figure S16e,f</ext-link>), without losing their generalized &#x02018;rod-templated&#x02019;
shape. The mechanical strength of the gel noodles was also investigated
by measuring the Young&#x02019;s modulus by nanoindentation. This again
increased from the original gel noodle to &#x02248;25 kPa (from &#x02248;16
kPa) after 1 h of irradiation and continued to increase slightly to
&#x02248;29 kPa after 2 h, although this was within the experimental
error. These results were consistent with the use of the HEA monoacrylate
as the monomer, compared to the cross-linkable PETA, which produced
stiffer structures (combined nanoindentation data given in <ext-link xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsami.5c03506/suppl_file/am5c03506_si_001.pdf" ext-link-type="uri">Figure S17</ext-link>). The SEM images of the HEA-based
structures differed considerably from those of the PETA-based polymers
(<ext-link xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsami.5c03506/suppl_file/am5c03506_si_001.pdf" ext-link-type="uri">Figure S15c,d</ext-link>). Both the 1 and 2 h structures
appeared similarly smooth and uniform, aligning with the minimal increase
in the Young&#x02019;s modulus observed between samples, and the fact
that they were prepared in a mixture of trigger solution and monomer.
Photopolymerization occurs uniformly throughout the gel noodle template,
as the monomer is already dispersed within the structure. Altogether,
this demonstrates the ability to strengthen the functionalized gel
noodles through selective polymerization, enabling the tuning of mechanical
and physical properties.</p><p>Finally, we showcased how the gel noodles
can sculpt more intricate
shapes that localize the subsequent photopolymerization. To accommodate
heating effects from prolonged irradiation, the polymerization conditions
with the PETA monomer were slightly adjusted (see Photopolymerization).
The first structure was a bow-tie shape featuring an intersection,
where two pieces of gel noodle overlapped. After solvent washing,
the newly formed polymer was strong enough to be manually handled,
and when viewed under the microscope (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig"/>
</xref>e), it revealed the fusing of the intersection
into a single piece. A cross-section of the polymer at the edge of
the structure (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig"/>
</xref>f) appeared hollow, with only an outer shell of polymer remaining
in place of the gel noodle template. The approximate diameter of the
shell was 300 &#x003bc;m, which matched the diameter of the gel noodle
template in the top-down view seen in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig"/>
</xref>a and was consistent with the observed shrinkage
after solvent washing (from &#x02248;500 &#x003bc;m). Finally, we demonstrated
how a shape could be maintained by arranging the gel noodles into
a desired structure. The letters &#x02018;UofG&#x02019; were manually
arranged using a text template and retained their shape immediately
after irradiation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig"/>
</xref>g). Following solvent washing, the letters could be handled
and rearranged while maintaining their intended form (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig"/>
</xref>h).</p></sec><sec id="sec3"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, functionalized supramolecular
gel noodles can be
used as templates for spatially resolved photopolymerization. We have
shown that new photoinitiators can be produced and tailored to retain
the self-assembly gelation properties of micellar dipeptides. Furthermore,
by modifying the linker group between the benzophenone-based photoinitiator
component and the dipeptide component, the viscosity can be sufficiently
increased to enable supramolecular gel noodle formation. The gel noodles
are robust enough to be manually handled for pattern templating, and
their mechanical properties remain unaffected after annealing their
micellar solutions or aging up to 7 days. Photopolymerization of a
cross-linkable acrylate monomer around the shell of the gel noodle
can yield structures that are rigid and exhibit significantly increased
mechanical strength. Alternatively, monoacrylate monomers can be used
to produce softer yet still self-supporting structures that do not
dissolve in common organic solvents. Finally, we have also shown that
our system of templating can be used to create more structurally complex
materials. By tailoring the polymerization time to suit the monomer,
we can produce shapes containing details that are difficult to mimic
without complex instrumentation or experimental setups, such as hollow
tubes and sections that intersect.</p></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec4.1"><title>Materials and General Experimental</title><p>The reagents used,

of each gelator was weighted into a vial with a stirrer bar. The required
amount of DI water was added, followed by 1 equiv of 0.1 M sodium
hydroxide to give a final concentration of 5, 10, or 20 mg mL<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>. For example, to make 10 mL of <bold>4BPAcFF</bold> at 10 mg mL<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>: 100 mg of <bold>4BPAcFF</bold> was
weighed into a 14 mL glass vial (Sanco, T103/V3) with a magnetic stirrer
bar (8 mm &#x000d7; 1.5 mm). This was first diluted with 8.184 mL of
deionized water, followed by 1.816 mL of 0.1 M aqueous sodium hydroxide.
Vials were sealed and stirred at 1000 rpm for a minimum of 16 h. The
solutions were pH adjusted to 10.0 &#x000b1; 0.1 via the addition of
small aliquots (&#x02248;2 &#x003bc;L) of either aqueous hydrochloric
acid (1 M) or sodium hydroxide (1 M). During the pH adjustment, vials
were stirred after addition, and the more viscous samples (mainly <bold>4BPAcFF</bold>) were additionally mixed using a vortex mixer in 20

into a 7 mL Sterilin vial (Thermo Fisher, 129A). Over this, a 1.0
mL aqueous solution of calcium chloride is carefully added at a molar
ratio of 1:2 between the gelator and the calcium chloride. The vial
was left undisturbed to gel overnight (minimum of 16 h) before testing.
For the gel noodles, pH adjusted gelator solutions were taken up into
a 10 mL plastic syringe (BD Plastipak, 305959) connected to a 50 mm

0.1) prior to gel noodle formation and used for a maximum of 1 week.</p></sec><sec id="sec4.3"><title>Nanoindentation</title><p>Nanoindentation measurements were performed
using a Chiaro nanoindentation device (Optics11, NL) following a previously
described protocol at room temperature (approximately 22 &#x000b0;C).<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr"/> A probe of stiffness (<italic toggle="yes">k</italic>) 0.48
N&#x000b7;m<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> was used for the measurements, except
for the PETA polymerized for 4 h, for which the soft probe was found
to be unsuitable and a stiffer probe of <italic toggle="yes">k</italic> = 4.18
N&#x000b7;m<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> was used. The radius (<italic toggle="yes">R</italic>) of the spherical tip attached to the cantilever was 3 &#x003bc;m
for both probes. The nanoindenter was mounted on top of an inverted
Zeiss Axiovert 200 M microscope. Approximately 3 cm of a gel noodle
or polymerized material was cut with scissors and placed in a glass
Petri dish. A metal washer was kept on the top of the sample to prevent
movement. Deionized water was added to fully immerse the sample and
prevent drying. For the 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate (HEA) materials, the
resulting polymer would swell significantly upon immersing in water,
thus, measurements were carried out under the same conditions but
were immersed in ethanol. The Petri dish was placed on the microscope
stage, keeping the sample along the <italic toggle="yes">x</italic> direction.
At least two matrix scans were performed on each sample, and each
matrix scan consisted of 25 indentations. The spacing between subsequent
indentations was 6 &#x003bc;m. For data analysis, the forward segment
of the collected force&#x02013;displacement (<italic toggle="yes">F</italic>&#x02013;<italic toggle="yes">z</italic>) curves were analyzed using a custom open-source software.<xref rid="ref48" ref-type="bibr"/> The contact point was identified by a goodness
of fit algorithm<xref rid="ref48" ref-type="bibr"/> to convert <italic toggle="yes">F</italic>&#x02013;<italic toggle="yes">z</italic> curves into force&#x02013;indentation (<italic toggle="yes">F</italic>&#x02013;&#x003b4;) curves. The <italic toggle="yes">F</italic>&#x02013;&#x003b4;
curves were analyzed up to a maximum indentation of &#x003b4; = 1 &#x003bc;m
= 0.1<italic toggle="yes">R</italic>, which is indeed much smaller than the thickness
of the gel noodle, typically in the range of 100 &#x003bc;m. This regime
justifies fitting the data with the Hertz model for the indentation
of a rigid sphere over a half plane and ignoring any contribution
of the bottom rigid substrate. The average force&#x02013;indentation
curves can be viewed in Figure SX.</p></sec><sec id="sec4.4"><title>SAXS</title><p>Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) measurements
were performed at the Diamond Light Source, Didcot, U.K., at the I22
beamline under experiment number SM35286&#x02013;1. The beamline operated
at an energy of 12.4 keV and the detector distance was set to 9.750
m, allowing a final <italic toggle="yes">Q</italic> range of 0.0016 to 0.177 &#x000c5;<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>. Gelator solution samples were prepared as described
previously (at pH 10.0 &#x000b1; 0.1) and transferred into borosilicate
glass capillaries (1.55 mm internal diameter) using a 1 mL syringe
fitted with an 80 mm 21G needle. For all samples, 10 &#x000d7; 100 ms
frames were collected and averaged. The raw data was processed using
the Dawn Science software (version 2.27),<xref rid="ref48" ref-type="bibr"/> according to a standard I22 pipeline.<xref rid="ref49" ref-type="bibr"/> As part of the processing, the backgrounds were subtracted from
the raw two-dimensional (2D) SAXS data and a full azimuthal integration
was performed to reduce the data to an <italic toggle="yes">I</italic> vs <italic toggle="yes">q</italic> plot. The plots were then fitted to structural models
in the SasView software (version 5.0.4). For the data presented in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"/>
</xref>e, fitting the <italic toggle="yes">Q</italic> peaks was only possible using a structure factor relating
to hard spheres. As this was not representative of the micellar system
presented in this work, the data was instead fit to a cylinder model
and the peaks were used to investigate the correlation length of the
system.</p></sec><sec id="sec4.5"><title>Cryo-EM</title><p>Vitrification of the gelator samples for cryo-EM
was conducted by taking 3 &#x003bc;L gelator suspensions and applying
them on glow discharged lacey carbon grids. Excessive sample was blotted
away by blotting from both sides of the grid, leaving a thin film
of sample on the grid, which was plunge frozen in liquid ethane using
a Vitrobot Mark IV (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The <bold>4BPAcFF</bold> gelator solution (10 mg mL<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>; pH 10.0 &#x000b1; 0.1)
was required to be diluted 8&#x000d7; due to its high viscosity to ensure
it formed imageable ice. Cryo-EM images were collected on a 200 keV
electron microscope (Glacios, Thermo Fisher Scientific) with pixel
size of &#x02248;1.2 &#x000c5;.</p></sec><sec id="sec4.6"><title>Photopolymerization</title><p>For the PETA monomer photopolymerizations,
a piece of a gel noodle was cut to the required size and placed in
a dry Petri dish. The gel noodle was immersed in deionized water for
approximately 1 min, then the water decanted off. This process was
repeated three times to remove any excess trigger solution before
the gel noodle was transferred to a clean Petri dish and manually
arranged into the desired shape using tweezers. The gel noodle was
then immersed in the PETA monomer (no solvent), positioned under a
commercial 365 nm LED (LedEngin, 829&#x02013;0841) mounted to a heat
sink to give a power density of approximately 100 mW cm<sup>&#x02013;2</sup>, and irradiated for the specified time (as indicated or 6 h for
the complex shapes). For the HEA monomer photopolymerizations, as
the gel noodle was formed in the trigger medium:monomer mixture, the
gel noodle was cut and arranged into the desired shape within the
solution. The excess gel noodle was removed and the samples placed
under the LED that was brought closer to give a power density of approximately
120 mW cm<sup>&#x02013;2</sup> and irradiated for the specified time.
For all samples after irradiation, the excess solution/monomer was
removed by gently flowing acetone over the sample (with a wash bottle)
until only the polymer was evident in the Petri dish. This was then
immersed in acetone, covered with another Petri dish, and left to
wash overnight on an orbital shaker (Ika, VXR basic Vibrax, 100 rpm).
Finally, the solution was decanted off to give the polymer, which
could be removed by detaching from the Petri dish using tweezers.</p></sec><sec id="sec4.7"><title>Photopolymerization Rates</title><p>Fourier-Transform infrared
spectroscopy (FT-IR) was used to monitor the photopolymerizaiton.
A stock solution (<bold>4BPAcFF</bold>, 1 wt %; monomer, 200 mg; tetrahydrofuran,
2.0 mL) was dropped onto a transparent KBr salt IR window. A second
window was used to encase the liquid and the excess wiped away. The
double bond conversion (DC %) was compared by taking the ratio of
peak area of the peak between 791&#x02013;834 cm<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> at the specified times during 365 nm LED irradiation (&#x02248;100
mW cm<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>) following a previously reported method.<xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr"/>

a JEOL JES-X320 spectrometer in glass capillaries (0.8 mm ID). Typical
acquisition parameters: microwave power 1 mW, modulation frequency
100 kHz, modulation amplitude 1 G, time constant 0.03 s. Spin trap
5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-<italic toggle="yes">N</italic>-oxide (DMPO) was added
to reaction mixtures immediately prior to spectra acquisition to a
100 mM final concentration. For experiments with irradiation, the
365 nm LED was placed at the bottom of the EPR cavity &#x02248;4 cm
below the center of the cavity.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="sifile1" position="float" content-type="local-data"><media xlink:href="am5c03506_si_001.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="ACK-d14e885-autogenerated"><p>This work
