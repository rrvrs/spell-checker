Inappropriate prescribing is costly, exposes patients to unnecessary side-effects and drives population-level antimicrobial resistance, the prevalence and consequences of which are greatest in low- and middle-income countries. However, the implementation of interventions to improve the appropriateness of antimicrobial prescribing has been variable and requires further study.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">We propose a type III hybrid implementation/effectiveness interventional cohort trial in 35 ICUs in up to 11 low- and middle- income countries. The study intervention is a structured review of antimicrobial prescriptions as recommended by the World Health Organisation. Strategies to support stakeholder-led implementation include development of local protocols, registry-enabled audit and feedback, and education. Evaluation of implementation, and the determinants of its success, is informed by the RE-AIM framework and the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research respectively. The primary outcome is a composite measure of fidelity, reach and adoption. Secondary outcomes describe the effectiveness of the intervention on improving antimicrobial prescribing. Qualitative interviews will assess relevant implementation acceptability, adaptations and maintenance. A baseline survey will investigate ICU-level antimicrobial stewardship structures and processes.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">This study addresses global policy priorities by supporting implementation research of antimicrobial stewardship, and strengthening associated healthcare professional competencies. It does this in a setting where improvement is sorely needed: low- and middle- income country ICUs. The study will also describe the influence of pre-existing antimicrobial stewardship structures and processes on implementation and improve understanding about the efficacy of strategies to overcome barriers to implementation in these settings.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par4">This study protocol has been registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (ref NCT06666738) on 31 Oct 2004. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06666738?term=NCT06666738&#x00026;rank=1">https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06666738?term=NCT06666738&#x00026;rank=1</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s13012-024-01413-4.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Antimicrobial Stewardship</kwd><kwd>Antimicrobial Resistance</kwd><kwd>Implementation</kwd><kwd>Intensive Care</kwd><kwd>Critical Care</kwd><kwd>Low- and Middle- Income Countries</kwd><kwd>Quality Improvement</kwd><kwd>Audit &#x00026; Feedback</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><boxed-text><label>Contributions to the literature</label><p id="Par15">

An estimated 50% of ICU patients have diagnosed bacterial infections (of which many are hospital-acquired infections), many patients are admitted to the ICU having already received often more than one antimicrobial agent, and many others have septic shock where rapid administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics is both indicated and common [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. As a consequence of the acute illness of ICU patients, concomitant ICU therapies which suppress immunity and the high healthcare-worker to patient ratio risking cross infection, there is a high density of multi-drug-resistant organisms in ICU [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. These population, treatment process and environmental factors makes delivering appropriate antimicrobial therapy in ICU settings challenging. Approximately 40&#x02013;50% of ICU antimicrobial prescribing is &#x02018;inappropriate&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], and is associated with increased ICU mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The most common examples of antimicrobial inappropriateness include: overprescribing (antimicrobials prescribed which are not needed); unnecessary combination therapy; wrong antibiotic choice for documented indication; incorrect route of administration (e.g. parenteral instead of enteral); and duration of therapy longer than necessary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par22">The prevalence and consequences (both direct and indirect) of AMR are greatest in Low- and Middle- Income Countries (LMICs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Hospital acquired infections, especially with antimicrobial resistant organisms, are more common in LMIC ICUs, making the need for AMS even higher [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. These infections are a major drive of healthcare expenditure, both for providers and patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Drivers of inappropriate antimicrobial use in LMICs, many of which are also present in High Income Countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], include: more common use of open (or semi-closed) ICU designs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]; over the counter availability of antimicrobials; public expectations regarding escalation and duration of treatment; lack of diagnostic capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]; unrestricted and/or inconsistent access to antimicrobials; shortages in staffing/resources; reluctance to change prescribing behaviours; and exclusion of multidisciplinary team members from interventions and/or decision-making [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. These drivers manifest in clinical practice as increased use of broad spectrum antimicrobials, duplication of agents for the same indication, continuation of therapies in the absence of confirmed infection, and prolonged treatment durations or reluctance to cease therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].

In the ICU setting, both implementation and intervention effectiveness has been limited.

ICUs must appoint a named Champion in order to participate. A survey (Supplementary File 2) will be conducted to determine pre-existing AMS processes and current adoption of structured review activities. Pre-existing antimicrobial review processes are neither a requirement for an ICU to participate nor an exclusion criterion. Instead, parallel to the survey, pre-implementation patient-level data pertaining to current antimicrobial prescribing review practices will be measured during months 1&#x02013;2.

Therefore, we expect a median inclusion of 180 ICU patient encounters for each ICU during the 6-month period, (totalling approximately 6300 ICU encounters).</p><p id="Par33">Interviews with ICU Champions are described below.

Redundancy directly impacts antimicrobial resistance rates and escalates healthcare costs for patients, providers and payers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Structured prescribing reviews promote: focused antimicrobial agent choice in response to microbiological evidence; avoidance and/or de-escalation of antimicrobial prescriptions where patients are found to have non-infectious syndromes or colonisation; utilisation of enteral routes of administration where appropriate, and avoidance of duplication of prescriptions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Such interventions have appeal in the ICU setting where, in addition to patients with confirmed infection, many patients also present with acute inflammatory syndromes following surgery, injury, or in exacerbations of chronic disease, resulting in rapid commencement of antimicrobials. These prescriptions often occur prior to ICU admission, and once started, are difficult to de-escalate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The WHO toolkit for AMS in LMICs prioritises reducing unnecessary and redundant antimicrobial prescribing and consists of four key steps for review: choosing therapies to best suit indications; optimising routes of administration; limiting therapy duration; and documenting a planned stop date [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Conduct of review</title><p id="Par35">Participating ICU teams will be required to undertake a structured review of each antimicrobial prescription for all patients receiving antimicrobials. Reviewing prescriptions allows their appropriateness to be reconsidered in the context of emerging clinical and/or microbiological data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. The review should be completed within 48&#x000a0;h of a new prescription being commenced, or at ICU admission where pre-ICU antimicrobial prescriptions exist. The review will necessitate documentation of the four key steps as defined by the WHO: indication (in relation to pre-existing local guidelines), route (e.g. parenteral or enteral), expected duration of therapy and intended stop date (including escalation or de-escalation discussions). It will also necessitate documentation of any changes (or lack thereof) made to the prescription, including: the choice of drug, route of administration and duration of treatment. The reviewing ICU team will consider the choice of therapy in relation to the known or assumed indication, the dose in relation to local ICU antimicrobial guidelines, the route of administration, and whether escalation to parenteral, or de-escalation to enteral route (and related dosing and duration adjustments) are warranted. Given the rapidly changing clinical status of critically ill patients, and emerging clinical and/or microbiological data during the ICU stay, it is anticipated that patients may receive more than one review during their ICU encounter. ICUs&#x02019; existing antimicrobial guidelines for the management of infections in critically ill patients will be utilised.</p><p id="Par36">Who leads the review, which multidisciplinary members participate, when it occurs during the ICU working day and how frequently it occurs during a patient&#x02019;s admission will be for the ICU team to decide during the pre-implementation period. The ICU team, together with the Champion will be encouraged to align the intervention with their existing ICU structures (ward rounds, microbiology rounds, etc.), to maximise feasibility and minimise disruption to existing workflows. Given that patient management in the ICU is most commonly led by the consulting clinicians and decision-making often occurs during daily ward rounds, we anticipate that these existing structures will be used, so as to align with existing clinical roles and responsibilities, and to minimise additional workload. Champions will encourage ICU teams to include pharmacists and microbiologists in the review if these specialists are available as the attendance of these team members is associated with improved prescribing practices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. How and where the review decisions are documented, will be decided by the ICU team and where possible use existing documentation practices already operational in the ICU.

This additional E-CRF collection will be done by the RAs. Copies of existing antimicrobial guidelines will be requested prior to commencement of the study, and ICU stakeholders&#x02019; perspectives regarding the current guidelines, along with information on existing antimicrobial stewardship activities already present in the ICU captured during the site onboarding by Champions. Changes in guidelines made during the project will also be captured, and the current working version of the guidelines queried at each phase of the project.

We intend to interview all Champions during both phases but recruitment may cease if concurrent analysis indicates that theoretical saturation has been achieved. Interviews will be conducted remotely using the Zoom (Zoom Video Communications Inc, San Jose, CA, USA) conferencing application. A participant information sheet (Supplementary File 5) will be provided and verbal consent for participation sought (Supplementary File 6). In addition, Champions together with RAs will be requested to maintain an implementation log [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>], whereby adaptations, and observed barriers and facilitators to implementation will also be reported. These will be reviewed and thematically coded alongside the interview data.</p><p id="Par53">No site or follow-up visits by the project team are required, as the design of the project is such that ICU teams together with Champions have direct ownership at site level, and the project seeks to minimise additional burden of data collection for clinical staff. All patient level de-identified data will be submitted by collaborating CQRs using existing processes. All data will be inspected before analysis to rule out spurious values, and appropriate transformations implemented where necessary. Existing data quality measures already operational within the CQRs will be utilised to provide information on data availability and reduce erroneous or missed data.

Analysis of barriers and facilitators to implementation will be informed by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) framework [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. Transcripts of the interviews will be deductively analysed independently by two researchers (DW and AB) to identify the key concepts (themes) regarding acceptability and maintenance of implementation, along with barriers and facilitators to implementation. DW and AB have extensive experience of working in ICU clinically and as researchers internationally. Initially the text will be open-coded by reviewing all text line by line and then descriptive codes will be assigned to the words, sentences and paragraphs in the transcripts. At this stage of the analysis, lines in the transcripts will be linked and grouped as the first set of codes which relate to the current prescribing practices, the experiences of the ICU team, RA&#x02019;s and champions, along with adaptations made. Axial coding in the next step of the data reduction process will link the descriptive codes via repackaging and combine the data to identify categories that have similar characteristics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. After developing categories, the relationships between the categories will be explored to reveal higher level themes, and then where relevant to implementation of the intervention mapped to the CFIR framework [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. New themes, and contextual and team factors that emerge from the evaluation but do not fit the existing framework will also be reported.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec31"><title>Discussion and potential impact</title><p id="Par60">This study aims to deliver both local and generalised benefits. Locally, it will support implementation of a complex stewardship intervention in LMIC ICUs. By evaluating this process rigorously, it will build local capacity for further refinement and/or implementation of other complex interventions. If implementation is successful, and the intervention is effective, the project may deliver significant local benefits to ICUs including reducing costs, side-effects and antimicrobial resistance. Furthermore, implementation will be led by local stakeholders to give it the best chance of being sustainable beyond the duration of this study.</p><p id="Par61">The study will also generate new generalisable knowledge. Firstly, it will describe pre-existing antimicrobial stewardship structures and processes in LMIC ICUs, permitting the identification and prioritisation of subsequent research and or improvement projects. Secondly, it will improve understanding about the efficacy of the proposed multifaceted implementation strategies in these settings. Thirdly, it will characterise the effectiveness of a widely-proposed but variably-implemented intervention which may&#x000a0;deliver significant potential public health benefits.</p></sec><sec id="Sec32"><title>Limitations</title><p id="Par62">The sample of participating ICUs is not proposed to be representative of the health systems in which they are situated. However, the range of settings that these ICUs represent is also a strength of the study; by clearly describing these contexts we will provide case studies which future research can build upon. We propose to mitigate this limitation on generalisability by rigorously describing their baseline structures and processes so that readers can infer how the study findings will apply to their own settings. The implementation strategies (particularly audit and feedback) require external facilitation and resources, further limiting generalisability. The quasi-experimental study design limits the attribution of causality to the implementation strategies and/or intervention. Finally, we will not follow-up implementation beyond month 7, limiting our knowledge of the sustainability of implementation beyond stakeholders&#x02019; perceptions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec33" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>
