</self-uri><abstract><p>Soil steam disinfection (SSD) has emerged as a highly promising substitute for methyl bromide fumigation in the management of soil-borne pathogens, nematodes, and weed seeds. In the present study, an innovative steam boiler driven by Helmholtz-type pulse combustors was meticulously engineered to meet the requirements of SSD in horticultural greenhouses. The water within the boiler was partitioned into discrete zones, and a total of 80 temperature sensors were strategically positioned to precisely monitor the temperature fluctuations at specific locations. Leveraging the Natural Neighbor Interpolation method, a comprehensive model of the temperature field within the boiler was developed. The experimental findings demonstrated that at the initial stage, the temperature in the vicinity of the pulse combustors escalated rapidly, while the regions located farther away exhibited a relatively sluggish heating rate. As the heating process progressed, the area of high temperature expanded progressively. After 35 minutes of operation, the majority of the water within the boiler reached temperatures exceeding 89 &#x000b0;C, signifying the generation of saturated steam. Notably, distinct temperature gradients were discerned along different axes and planes, offering valuable insights for the structural optimization of the boiler. In comparison with other steam boiler models, the designed boiler boasted a relatively compact volume, a lightweight empty weight, and an impressively favorable fuel consumption rate per unit steam production, registering at 0.06867 L&#x000b7;kg&#x0207b;&#x000b9;. These results unequivocally highlight the potential of this boiler for efficient SSD applications, thus laying a solid foundation for further research and development in this field.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>the Natural Science Foundation of the Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions of China</institution>

Introduction</title><p>Soil steam disinfection (SSD) increases the soil temperature and kills harmful organisms through heat exchange between the steam (at a high temperature) and soil particles. SSD is the main method being developed to replace fumigation with methyl bromide for controlling or even eradicating soil-borne pathogens, nematodes, and weed seeds [<xref rid="pone.0319193.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0319193.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. SSD is fast and does not lead to residual effects [<xref rid="pone.0319193.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], particularly in deep soil, so the soil can be used as soon as it has cooled to the ambient temperature [<xref rid="pone.0319193.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. SSD was first developed by Frank in 1888 and was first commercialized by Rudd in 1893 [<xref rid="pone.0319193.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. SSD was used extensively in the 1960s. Since then, various SSD methods (e.g., sheet steaming and steaming using fixed tube pipes) have been developed and used in open fields and horticultural greenhouses [<xref rid="pone.0319193.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0319193.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Bitarafan et al. [<xref rid="pone.0319193.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] investigated thermal control of barnyardgrass seeds using a prototype stationary soil steaming device. Seed germination was decreased by 50% when a maximum soil temperature of 62&#x02013;68 &#x000b0;C was reached and by 90% when a maximum soil temperature of 76&#x02013;86 &#x000b0;C was reached. Miller et al. [<xref rid="pone.0319193.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] found that soil or sand from the surface to deeper layers was heated more thoroughly and rapidly when steam was applied while the soil or sand was being mixed than when steam was applied to the surface of unmixed (i.e., stationary) soil or sand. Raffaelli et al. [<xref rid="pone.0319193.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] designed and used a prototype band-steaming machine. A maximum soil temperature of 63 &#x000b0;C at 25&#x02009;mm deep was achieved with CaO prior to sowing the crop. Fennimore et al. [<xref rid="pone.0319193.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] found that steam treatment then adding mustard seed meal (a fertilizer and source of additional organic matter) markedly improved strawberry yields and controlled weeds and pathogens. Kim et al. [<xref rid="pone.0319193.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] also used mustard seed meal to decrease the microsclerotia density in <italic toggle="yes">Verticillium dahliae</italic>, the propagule density in <italic toggle="yes">Pythium ultimum</italic>, and the cumulative weed density.</p><p>Identifying a suitable source of steam is the main problem needing to be solved when developing a SSD method. Research is currently being performed around the world to improve the effects of SSD and decrease energy consumption, but few of them proceed from the steam boiler. Commercial steam boilers were used directly in some studies [<xref rid="pone.0319193.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0319193.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], but there are some problems with such boilers, particularly related to the boilers being heavy and very large. These problems are particularly important when SSD equipment is used in a horticultural greenhouse because of the lack of space. In the study presented here, we designed a steam boiler to supply steam for SSD in horticultural greenhouses. The water in the steam boiler was heated by Helmholtz-type pulse combustors rather than coal, electricity, or diesel. Pulse combustion is a burning process in which some parameters can be changed over time, such as the temperature, pressure [<xref rid="pone.0319193.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. More efficient combustion and lower emissions (by mass fraction) can be achieved in pulse combustion through combustion with acoustic fluctuations than through normal combustion. Acoustic fluctuations increase turbulence and can therefore improve heat and mass transfer by up to a factor of five compared with stationary gas flow [<xref rid="pone.0319193.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0319193.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Acoustic excitation increases temperature fluctuations and therefore increases the heat transfer rate without increasing the mean temperature, meaning NO emissions by mass fraction are not increased [<xref rid="pone.0319193.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>Pulse combustion was first described by Lord Rayleigh and was used in many applications (e.g., German V-1 &#x0201c;buzz bombs&#x0201d; used in World War II) in the 20th century [<xref rid="pone.0319193.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0319193.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Pulse combustion applications can be divided into two general types, systems using thermal pulse combustors as efficient heaters and systems using the pulsating high flow-velocity inside or outside the pulse combustor to improve processes such as drying [<xref rid="pone.0319193.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0319193.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and calcining [<xref rid="pone.0319193.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0319193.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In this study, a pulse combustion-based steam boiler was meticulously designed to capitalize on the enhanced heat transfer efficiency characteristic of pulse combustion. The water within the steam boiler was segmented into discrete regions, and the temperatures at multiple specific points were accurately measured and determined. Subsequently, the temperature field within the steam boiler was mathematically modeled employing the Natural Neighbor Interpolation method. By doing so, the process of water temperature elevation was precisely identified, thereby furnishing crucial data essential for optimizing the structural configuration of the system and augmenting the steam boiler efficiency.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>2. Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>2.1. Principles of a steam boiler</title><p>A steam boiler containing pulse combustors, a water inlet, a steam outlet, and a tank body, as shown in <xref rid="pone.0319193.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1a</xref> [<xref rid="pone.0319193.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], was designed and manufactured. Each pulse combustor comprised an air inlet, a fuel inlet, a spark plug, a combustion chamber, a tail pipe, a decoupling chamber, and a tail gas outlet. An adjustable carburetor was employed to regulate the flow rates of air and fuel. The fuel utilized in this study was gasoline. During the combustion process, the peak temperature of the tail gas within the combustion chamber and tail pipe could ascend to several thousand degrees Celsius. Consequently, the combustion chamber, tail pipe, and decoupling chamber were submerged in water, with only the air inlet, fuel inlet, and tail gas outlet remaining exposed outside the tank body. Water entered through the inlet located at the bottom of the tank, while steam exited via the outlet at the top. The tail pipe was designed as a triple-helical configuration (<xref rid="pone.0319193.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1b</xref>) to augment the heat transfer area and mitigate deformation induced by elevated temperatures. Four pulse combustors were incorporated into the system to deliver the requisite power.

Temperature measuring method.</title><p>The temperature of the water contained within the tank body exhibited a continuous upward trend. However, it was infeasible to monitor the water temperature at every single point throughout all time intervals. The optimal approach for gauging the temperature within the system entailed continuously measuring the temperature at the maximum number of accessible points and subsequently deducing the temperature variations at each of these points via a data processing algorithm. To actualize this methodology, a total of 80 temperature sensors were deployed to record the fluctuations in water temperature at 80 discrete locations within the tank body. Given that each individual intelligent inspection device was only capable of concurrently measuring temperatures at a maximum of 31 points, three such intelligent inspection devices were incorporated into the setup. The specific locations of these measuring points are elaborated in the following section.</p><p>The irregular structure of the pulse combustor causes the internal water areas in the steam boiler to be complex. We therefore divided the water from the combustion chamber inlet end to the tail pipe outlet into four parts, as shown in <xref rid="pone.0319193.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2a</xref>. In the z direction, the water area was divided into sections AB, BC, CD, and DE. Section AB was the combustion chamber, section BC was the part between the combustion chamber and the tailpipe, section CD was the spiral part of the tail pipe, and section DE was the part between the tail pipe and the decoupling chamber. Temperature sensors were placed on the intermediate planes perpendicular to the z-axis, i.e. the a&#x02013;a plane, b&#x02013;b plane, and e&#x02013;e plane from section AB, section BC, and section DE, respectively. Section CD was long, so it was divided into three equal parts to give a c&#x02013;c plane and d&#x02013;d plane, on which temperature sensors were placed, to improve the measuring point distribution. Five sections in a three-dimensional state are shown in <xref rid="pone.0319193.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2b</xref>.</p><fig position="float" id="pone.0319193.g002"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0319193.g002</object-id><label>Fig 2</label><caption><title>Water area sections.</title><p>(a) Five cross-sections in a planar state.

Some of the water areas were close to or at boiling point. However, the water far from the pulse combustors had not markedly changed temperature. There was a marked temperature gradient in the water area.</p><p>At 10&#x02009;min, the area of high-temperature water was larger in the c&#x02013;c and d&#x02013;d planes than in other planes because of the large heat transfer area of the tail pipe.

At the start, the temperature at each point was relatively low (~20 &#x000b0;C), but by 35&#x02009;min the temperatures at all points had reached 100 &#x000b0;C. After examining the temperature distribution at each point at each time using the dotted line shown in <xref rid="pone.0319193.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref> as the boundary, the points were divided into three areas along the y-axis moving in the positive direction. These areas were labeled Area 1, Area 2, and Area 3.</p><p>Area 1 was at the bottom of the steam boiler. During heating, the temperature gradient was stronger in Area 1 than the other areas. The temperature gradient was strongest at 30&#x02009;min. The maximum temperature in Area 1 was 95.6 &#x000b0;C, the minimum temperature was 34.3 &#x000b0;C, and the temperature difference was 61.3 &#x000b0;C. There was a temperature distribution peak near y =&#x02009; &#x02212;&#x02009;220&#x02009;cm. The temperature distribution along the y-axis in the positive direction first increased and then decreased. The changes were most clear at 5&#x02009;min, when the amplitude was 12.3 &#x000b0;C. Over time, the changes gradually weakened and the amplitude was ~0 &#x000b0;C at 30&#x02009;min. This would mainly have been because pulse combustors no. 3 and 4 were near y = &#x02212;220&#x02009;cm. Convective heat transfer to the water between these pulse combustors would have been relatively intense and the water temperature would have increased faster in this area than above and below the area. This would have resulted in there being a peak in the temperature distribution near y = &#x02212;220&#x02009;cm.</p><p>Area 2 was in the middle of the steam boiler. The temperature distribution in Area 2 changed gently at all times. The temperature gradually but not strongly increased along the y-axis in the positive direction. The maximum increase was 6.1 &#x000b0;C at 15&#x02009;min. The main reason for this would have been that the area was far from the four pulse combustors. During heating, heat would have been transferred to Area 2 mainly through natural convection. The heat transfer intensity at each point was not strong, and the differences between the heat transfer intensities at the different points were not marked. The temperature therefore changed relatively gently.</p><p>Area 3 was at the top of the steam boiler. The temperature distribution was more complex in Area 3 than the other areas. From the bottom of Area 3 along the y-axis in the positive direction, the temperature distribution first gradually increased and reached a maximum near y = 115&#x02009;cm, then started to decrease and reached a minimum near y = 225&#x02009;cm, and then started to increase again. The maximum temperature change occurred at 15&#x02009;min, when the amplitude was 13.0 &#x000b0;C. The maximum value was the same as for Area 1. This would have been because pulse combustors no. 1 and 2 were near y = 115&#x02009;cm. Convective heat transfer would have been stronger for the water in this area than above and below the area, so the temperature increased rapidly. The reason for the minimum value is shown in <xref rid="pone.0319193.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8</xref> focusing on the water flow distribution in the area y &#x0003e; 0. During the heating of the steam generator, heat transfer to the internal water would mainly have been through natural convection. Water in different locations would have been at different temperatures and therefore would have had different densities, meaning some areas would have been buoyant relative to other areas. The hotter water would have flowed upward and the cooler water would have flowed downward. The water temperature above pulse combustors no. 1 and 2 would have increased rapidly, causing the water to flow upward and then disperse left and right after reaching the water surface. The two flow branches would have met, merged, and move downward in the middle of the water surface. The water temperature between pulse combustors no. 1 and 2 was relatively high, resulting in vertical upward movement of water and convergence with downward water flow near the water surface, forming a mixing region. The intersection area would have been where the water arrived latest, so the temperature there increased slowly and the water temperature in that area was lower than in the upper and lower areas, resulting in the appearance of an upper temperature distribution minimum.</p><fig position="float" id="pone.0319193.g008"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0319193.g008</object-id><label>Fig 8</label><caption><title>Water flow distribution.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0319193.g008" position="float"/></fig><p>It can also be seen from <xref rid="pone.0319193.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref> that the area inside the steam boiler in which the water temperature increased slowest was at the bottom of the tank body.

This would mainly have been because the steam boiler was symmetrical. The temperature at each point on the straight line increased gradually over time. The outer wall of the combustion chamber of each pulse combustor was at a high temperature, so the temperature of the water area near the outer wall of the combustion chamber reached the corresponding saturation temperature at 5&#x02009;min and the temperature gradually decreased in the direction away from the combustion chamber, giving an M-shaped distribution. At 5&#x02009;min, the strongest temperature gradient was along the straight line. The water temperature near the outer wall of each combustion chamber was 100 &#x000b0;C but the water temperature near the inner wall of the steam generator was still the same as the initial temperature (~20 &#x000b0;C), meaning the temperature difference was 80 &#x000b0;C. Over time, the temperature gradient along the straight line became weaker, and by 35&#x02009;min the temperature difference was 0 &#x000b0;C.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec011"><title>4. Discussion</title><p>Pulse combustion, a promising variant of combustion, is characterized by its non-stationary nature and pulsating behaviour, distinguishing it from conventional combustion methods. In recent years, it has garnered significant attention from researchers [<xref rid="pone.0319193.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0319193.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. During the pulse combustion process, there are two fundamental excitation processes involved: under certain conditions, combustion can trigger acoustic pulsations within the burner; conversely, these acoustic pulsations can in turn alter the characteristics of combustion. Pulse combustion is formed by the positive mutual feedback of these two excitation processes under specific circumstances. It is precisely this special mutual feedback in pulse combustion that can significantly reduce the thickness of the heat transfer boundary layer. Meanwhile, it greatly enhances the processes of heat transfer, mass transfer, and momentum transfer between particles as well as between particles and gas flow within the combustion chamber and the tailpipe. Consequently, the pulsating burner possesses unparalleled advantages compared to conventional stable burners.

Pulse combustion generally exhibits much higher combustion intensity (up to 50,000 kW&#x000b7;m<sup>&#x02212;</sup>&#x000b3;) and combustion efficiency (up to 99%) compared to steady combustion (100&#x02013;1,000 kW&#x000b7;m<sup>&#x02212;</sup>&#x000b3; and 80&#x02013;96%, respectively). Additionally, due to the weakening effect of pulse combustion on the heat transfer boundary layer, it demonstrates a superior heat transfer coefficient (up to 500 W&#x000b7;m<sup>&#x02212;</sup>&#x000b2;&#x000b7;K<sup>&#x02212;</sup>&#x000b9;), enhancing its ability to transfer heat more efficiently. The excess air coefficient for pulse combustion is slightly lower, indicating a more optimal air-fuel ratio. Furthermore, pulse combustion results in lower CO emissions (0&#x02013;1%) and significantly reduced NOx emissions (20&#x02013;70 mg&#x000b7;m<sup>&#x02212;</sup>&#x000b3;) compared to steady combustion, making it more environmentally friendly. However, due to the mutual excitation between acoustics and combustion process required for pulse combustion, it generates higher noise levels (up to 130 dB), which may limit its application in noise-sensitive environments.</p><p>Although pulse combustion has the advantages mentioned above compared with the conventional steady combustion, it also has obvious disadvantages. Besides the high noise level described in <xref rid="pone.0319193.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, it also has extremely high requirements for working conditions. For a pulse combustor to achieve pulse combustion, the acoustic conditions must be coupled with the heating conditions so that the gas flow inside the pulsating burner can oscillate. The acoustic conditions refer to the combustion chamber (with volume V) and the nozzle (with length L and inner diameter d) of certain dimensional parameters, while the heating conditions refer to the combustible mixture formed by a certain amount of fuel (Q1) and air (Q2). Since many working mechanisms of pulse combustion remain unclear to date, a certain acoustic structure has a specific acoustic resonant frequency, but it may not necessarily match the heating conditions or even form an effective coupling with any heating conditions, that is, the pulse combustion oscillation relationship cannot be formed. Therefore, only the acoustic conditions of certain specific structural dimensions can match the heating conditions within a certain range to produce a coupling effect, that is, the gas flow inside the pulsating burner works at a certain coupling oscillation frequency (<italic toggle="yes">f</italic>). When the coupling relationship exists, not only changing the dimensional parameters V, L, and d in the acoustic conditions will change the oscillation frequency (<italic toggle="yes">f</italic>), but also changing Q1 and/or Q2 in the heating conditions while keeping the acoustic conditions unchanged will change the coupling relationship, that is, change the oscillation frequency (<italic toggle="yes">f</italic>) and form a new pulsating oscillation system [<xref rid="pone.0319193.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].</p><p>Therefore, for a pulse combustor, the current biggest challenge is how to design the structural dimensions with a stable working frequency based on its working environment (such as in air or in water, because this involves heat exchange and heating conditions). Unfortunately, there are currently no mature theoretical formulas available for calculation, and most of the structural design research is carried out using the trial-and-error method. That is, a series of structural dimensions are designed to see which one has a stable working frequency under specific working conditions.</p><p><xref rid="pone.0319193.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> presents a comprehensive comparison of several steam boiler models, including those from the United States, Germany and this study. The parameters considered are crucial for evaluating the performance and characteristics of these devices. There is a positive correlation between parameters such as fuel consumption, steam production, empty weight, power and the dimension. That is, the larger the dimension, the greater the values of fuel consumption, steam production, empty weight, and power. For example, the S-2000 model has the largest product dimension, and correspondingly, it also has the largest fuel consumption, steam production, empty weight, and power. The steam boiler designed in this study has a volume dimension larger than only the SF-11 model and smaller than all other models. It also has the lightest empty weight, which implies that it can hold a greater amount of water. Compared with the SF-11 model, it has a lower power and steam production, but at the same time, its fuel consumption is also lower than that of the SF-11 model.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="pone.0319193.t004"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0319193.t004</object-id><label>Table 4</label><caption><title>Comparison of several steam boiler models.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="pone.0319193.t004" id="pone.0319193.t004g" position="float"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Model</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Dimension:length (m)&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;breadth (m)&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;height (m)</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Fuel consumption (L&#x000b7;h<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>)</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Steam production (kg&#x000b7;h<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>)</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Empty weight (kg)</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Power (kW)</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Product origin</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Affiliation company</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic toggle="yes">FCR</italic>(L&#x000b7;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">

Conclusion</title><p>This research was dedicated to the design and in-depth analysis of a steam boiler that employs Helmholtz-type pulse combustors for soil steam disinfection (SSD) within horticultural greenhouses. The scope of this work encompassed a meticulous engineering design process of the boiler, integrating multiple pulse combustors and a carefully configured water flow and heat transfer system. To comprehensively investigate the temperature field evolution within the boiler, an elaborate experimental setup was established, which incorporated 80 precisely positioned temperature sensors. Subsequently, the Natural Neighbor Interpolation method was applied to model and analyze the collected data.</p><p>This research has yielded several significant achievements. Initially, we successfully elucidated the dynamic characteristics of the heating process. It was observed that in the early stages of operation, the temperature in the proximity of the pulse combustors exhibited a rapid increase, while regions situated at a greater distance from the heat source demonstrated a relatively slower heating rate. After 35 minutes of operation, the majority of the water within the boiler attained temperatures exceeding 89 &#x000b0;C, indicating the efficient generation of saturated steam. Moreover, the identification of temperature gradients along various axes and planes furnished critical insights for potential structural optimization of the boiler. Secondly, in comparison with existing steam boiler models, the boiler designed in this study exhibited a relatively compact volume and a lightweight empty weight. Notably, it demonstrated a highly competitive fuel consumption rate per unit steam production, registering at 0.06867 L&#x000b7;kg<sup>&#x02212;</sup>&#x000b9;, thereby highlighting its enhanced energy efficiency.</p><p>This work makes a substantial contribution to the field of SSD by introducing a novel boiler design with improved performance attributes. Future research endeavors will be predicated on these findings, aiming to further optimize the design of the pulse combustor and to explore the long-term performance and practical application potential of the boiler in a diverse range of horticultural scenarios.</p></sec><sec id="sec013" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material

</p><p>Response to Reviewers</p><p>Journal Requirements:</p><p>1. I have made formatting changes to the manuscript according to the PLOS ONE's style requirements.</p><p>2. About &#x0201c;Financial Disclosure&#x0201d;, I would like to change it to the following content:</p><p>This paper is funded by the Natural Science Foundation of the Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions of China (No. 22KJB210014), the Start-up Fund for New Talented Researchers of Nanjing Vocational University of Industry Technology (No. YK-19-04-03). The funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.</p><p>3.I have removed all the funding information in the Acknowledgments Section of my manuscript. I would like to update my Funding Statement as follows: &#x0201c;the Natural Science Foundation of the Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions of China (No. 22KJB210014), the Start-up Fund for New Talented Researchers of Nanjing Vocational University of Industry Technology (No. YK-19-04-03)&#x0201d;.</p><p>4.With sincere dedication and anticipation for this resubmission, I would like to further explain an issue regarding the Data Availability Statement. Initially, I made a minor mistake as I did not fully comprehend its specific requirements. In the current submission, not all raw data were included. However, I have now packaged all the necessary raw data into a compressed file and uploaded it as Supporting Information files. This way, it should provide full access to the underlying data for those who may need it to reproduce or further explore my research findings.</p><p>5.I have updated my ORCID iD in the "Update my Information" as required.</p><p>6.This requirements is the same as the 5th.</p><p>I have updated my ORCID iD in the "Update my Information" as required.</p><p>Review Comments to the Author:</p><p>Reviewer #1</p><p>1. The grammar and content of the abstract have been improved, with a focus on the goal and the research content of this article. The revised abstract is as follows:</p><p>Soil steam disinfection (SSD) has emerged as a highly promising substitute for methyl bromide fumigation in the management of soil-borne pathogens, nematodes, and weed seeds. In the present study, an innovative steam boiler driven by Helmholtz-type pulse combustors was meticulously engineered to meet the requirements of SSD in horticultural greenhouses. The water within the boiler was partitioned into discrete zones, and a total of 80 temperature sensors were strategically positioned to precisely monitor the temperature fluctuations at specific locations. Leveraging the Natural Neighbor Interpolation method, a comprehensive model of the temperature field within the boiler was developed. The experimental findings demonstrated that at the initial stage, the temperature in the vicinity of the pulse combustors escalated rapidly, while the regions located farther away exhibited a relatively sluggish heating rate. As the heating process progressed, the area of high temperature expanded progressively. After 35 minutes of operation, the majority of the water within the boiler reached temperatures exceeding 89 &#x000b0;C, signifying the generation of saturated steam. Notably, distinct temperature gradients were discerned along different axes and planes, offering valuable insights for the structural optimization of the boiler. In comparison with other steam boiler models, the designed boiler boasted a relatively compact volume, a lightweight empty weight, and an impressively favorable fuel consumption rate per unit steam production, registering at 0.06867 L&#x000b7;kg&#x0207b;&#x000b9;. These results unequivocally highlight the potential of this boiler for efficient SSD applications, thus laying a solid foundation for further research and development in this field.</p><p>2.About the writing and grammar, I have taken several meticulous steps. Firstly, I consulted with colleagues proficient in English writing, incorporating their suggestions to further polish the language. They carefully combed through the entire text, rectifying grammar errors, enhancing sentence structures, and ensuring coherence and flow throughout the paper. Secondly, I myself reread and revised the manuscript multiple times, paying close attention to word choice, punctuation, and overall readability. Through these combined efforts, I am confident that the current version of the manuscript exhibits a significantly improved standard of writing and grammar, making it more accessible and engaging for readers. I truly hope that these enhancements meet your expectations and contribute to the overall quality of the paper. Specific modifications can be found in the resubmitted version.</p><p>3.About the conclusion, I am truly grateful for the insightful comment regarding the improvement of the conclusion. I fully acknowledge the importance of presenting the scope of work and achievements in a more lucid and comprehensive manner, and I have made substantial revisions accordingly. I have rewritten the conclusion section to replace the previous bullet-point style. Instead, I now provide a cohesive and continuous narrative that elaborates on the overall scope of my research. I believe that this new version of the conclusion effectively conveys the essence of my research and hope it aligns with your expectations.</p><p>4.About references, I scoured through the latest publications in our field. I carefully selected the most pertinent and high-impact new articles, such as reference [4][36][37][40]. These newly added references have been integrated into the &#x0201c;Reference&#x0201d; section, supplementing and enriching the existing ones.</p><p>For instance, reference [40] published in 2024 expounds on the working principle of the Helmholtz-type pulsating combustor. It comprehensively reviews the current research and development trends of pulsating combustors and further summarizes its application in the field of pest control.</p><p>By doing so, I believe the reference section now reflects the most current state of knowledge in the area, providing readers with a more comprehensive and contemporary view of the subject matter.</p><p>5. I have adjusted the font settings for all figure and table captions to ensure they are visibly smaller than the main text of the article, as per the recommended standard. Specific modifications can be found in the resubmitted version.</p><p>6.About the style and format of the references, a reference management tool, EndNote, was used. Also, the &#x0201c;Plos&#x0201d; style file was used to assist me with the formatting of your references. I meticulously examined each reference within the manuscript. I made adjustments to the font, size, indentation, and alignment to precisely match the prescribed style. I also paid special attention to the citation style, correcting any discrepancies in the use of superscripts, parentheses, or numbered citations. Additionally, I double-checked for any potential errors or omissions, such as incorrect page numbers. Through these works, I am confident that the references now adhere strictly to the journal's style and format, enhancing the overall professionalism and readability of the manuscript.</p><p>Reviewer #2</p><p>1.I am very grateful for your astute observation and valuable suggestion regarding the comparison of pulse burner boilers with other types of boilers. You are right that adding such a detailed comparison would significantly enhance the informativeness and practical value of the manuscript. In response to this comment, I have conducted further research and analysis.</p><p>Firstly, the technical parameters between pulse combustion and conventional steady combustion were compared. The detailed parameter analysis can be found in the discussion section of the draft.</p><p>Secondly, in the discussion section, the technical parameters of the pulse burner boilers designed in this paper and those of other steady-state combustion steam boilers were also added. The compared products are from countries such as Germany and the United States. The specific parameters for comparison include product dimensions, fuel consumption, steam production, empty weight, power, FCR (the fuel consumption rate per unit steam production) and so on. From the Table 4 in the manuscript, we can say that the boiler in this study exhibits relatively favorable FCR performance compared to several other models, suggesting that it has a relatively efficient conversion of fuel to steam.</p><p>I believe that this addition not only strengthens my key claim about the advantages of pulse burner boilers but also provides readers with practical and actionable information that can be useful in real-world applications.</p><p>2. Pule combustion, as a unique unsteady combustion technology, exhibits special advantages in applications requiring intense heat and mass transfer due to the rapid reciprocating characteristics of its combustion exhaust gases. Specific application scenarios include the following:</p><p>(1) Material drying</p><p>Niu Haixia[1] took a study about mass transfer between materials and unsteady airflow from a Helmholtz type combustor. During the drying process, the dried material is placed inside the Tail pipe II.</p><p>(2) Pest control</p><p>During the working process of the pulse combustor, when the pressure inside the combustion chamber is greater than the atmospheric pressure, the pressure guiding pipe will introduce the high pressure into the medicine tank and open the medicine switch. Then, under pressure, the liquid medicine will flow from the medicine nozzle to the tailpipe. The high-temperature and high-speed exhaust gas discharged by the pulse combustor during its operation will cause the liquid medicine flowing into the tailpipe to crack, break up and evaporate into droplets.</p><p>(3)Steam boiler</p><p>Pulse combustors boilers have the potential to offer advantages in various water vapor applications beyond soil steam disinfection. In the food processing industry, for example, the unique temperature characteristics and high heat transfer efficiency of pulse combustors boilers could be utilized in processes such as pasteurization and sterilization. The rapid and precise temperature control achievable with these boilers may enhance the quality and safety of food products. Additionally, in the textile manufacturing sector, they could be employed for fabric dyeing and finishing operations, where controlled steam application is crucial for achieving consistent and high-quality results.</p><p>3.I would like to express my sincere gratitude for your valuable suggestion regarding the disadvantages of pulse combustors in comparison with other types. In response to this comment, I have made the following additions and improvements in the manuscript.</p><p>I have now included a detailed discussion on the drawbacks of pulse combustors. Firstly, it is noted that due to the unique mutual excitation mechanism between acoustics and the combustion process essential for pulse combustion, it generates relatively high noise levels, which can reach up to 130 dB. This significant noise emission may indeed pose limitations in noise-sensitive applications such as in certain indoor or residential settings where quiet operation is crucial.</p><p>Secondly, I have elaborated on the highly demanding working conditions required by pulse combustors. The need for precise coupling between acoustic conditions (determined by the specific dimensions of the combustion chamber and nozzle) and heating conditions (dictated by the fuel and air mixture) presents a major challenge. Given the current state of knowledge where many working mechanisms of pulse combustion remain elusive, achieving the right match between these conditions is often difficult. Even with a specific acoustic structure having its own resonant frequency, there is no guarantee of compatibility with the heating conditions, and in many cases, an effective coupling cannot be established, thereby preventing the onset of stable pulse combustion.</p><p>Furthermore, I have also addressed the current difficulties in designing pulse combustors. The absence of established theoretical formulas for calculating the optimal structural dimensions based on different working environments (such as in air or water) forces researchers to rely on the trial-and-error approach. This involves designing multiple sets of structural dimensions and testing them to identify the ones that can achieve a stable working frequency under specific conditions.</p><p>Specific modifications can be found in the &#x0201c;Discussion&#x0201d; section.</p><p>4. In response to your suggestions, Table.4 was added in &#x0201c;Discussion&#x0201d; section. The product dimensions, fuel consumption, steam production, empty weight, power, and FCR (the fuel consumption rate per unit steam production) of the boiler in this study, were compared with those of other boilers with the form of a table.</p><p>5. I sincerely appreciate your astute observation and the opportunity to clarify the methodology employed in the temperature field simulation. The temperature field simulation is carried out according to the following procedure:</p><p>(1) Temperature Data Collection</p><p>Temperature data were collected through 80 temperature measurement points during the process from the startup of the boiler until all the temperature measurement points reached 100 &#x000b0;C.</p><p>(2) Temperature Data Selection</p><p>Temperature data at eight specific moments (At the start, at 5th min, at 10th min, at 15th min, at 20th min, at 25th min, at 30th min, and at 35th min) from five cross-sections (a&#x02013;a plane, b&#x02013;b plane, c&#x02013;c plane, d&#x02013;d plane and e&#x02013;e plane) were selected as the known conditions for the temperature field simulation, just like pi (i = 1,2,&#x02026;&#x02026;6) shown in Figure 5 in the manuscript. These data can be found in the file named &#x0201c;temperature raw data.xlsx&#x0201d;.</p><p>(3) Temperature Field Simulation</p><p>Equation (4) was converted into a program that can be run in MATLAB software.

Subsequently, Figure 6 in the manuscript can be obtained. The calculation results can be found in the file named &#x0201c;a-a plane.xlsx&#x0201d;</p><p>6.There is indeed a relationship between pulse combustion efficiency and pulse frequency. Let's assume that when the pulse frequency increases, the number of combustion events completed within a unit time also increases, and the number of times the combustion exhaust gas travels back and forth in the tailpipe also increases. This facilitates the timely expulsion of the exhaust gas from the previous combustion, providing sufficient combustion space for the new fuel-air mixture and ensuring that the new round of combustion is completer and more thorough, thereby improving the overall combustion efficiency.</p><p>In addition to the combustion efficiency increasing with the increase of the pulse frequency, the heat transfer efficiency also rises. This can be analyzed from the concept of the temperature boundary layer.</p><p>When a fluid with a temperature of t&#x0221e; flows over a wall surface with a wall temperature of tw (t&#x0221e;&#x0ff1e;tw), due to the influence of heat exchange, there will be an obvious change in temperature within the thin fluid layer close to the wall surface. Its characteristics are that on the wall surface, where y=0, t= tw, and at the position of the thin layer, that is, on the temperature boundary layer, where, y=&#x003b4;t&#x0ff0c;t= t&#x0221e;. We call this thin fluid layer where the temperature changes significantly the temperature boundary layer.</p><p>The temperature boundary layer has the following characteristics: (1) The thickness &#x003b4;t of the temperature boundary layer is much smaller than the characteristic dimension of the object; (2) The temperature changes drastically along the thickness (y) direction within the boundary layer.</p><p>Due to the pulsation effect, the combustion exhaust gas repeatedly moves forward and backward in the tailpipe, which greatly reduces the originally stable boundary layer thickness &#x003b4;t, allowing more heat to approach the wall surface (y=0) and enhancing the heat transfer process. The higher the pulse frequency is, the stronger the weakening effect on the temperature boundary layer is, and therefore, the higher the heat transfer efficiency is.</p><p>7.
