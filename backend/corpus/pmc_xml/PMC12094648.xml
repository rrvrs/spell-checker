They are characterized by emotional or behavioral disturbances that significantly affect a child&#x02019;s ability to learn and function at school, home, or social settings. It is estimated that 17% of adolescents are suffering from mental disorders (Castelpietra et al., <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>). The amount of adolescents with mental disorders has only been increasing over the past years and is one of the main health challenges for society (Lebrun-Harris, Ghandour, Kogan, &#x00026; Warren, <xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>). An important objective to improve health outcomes is to prevent the development of disease. However, preventive psychiatry has had little impact so far as preventive programs only have small effects (Fusar&#x02010;Poli et al., <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>; Werner-Seidler et al., <xref rid="r39" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>). This calls for the personalization of preventative interventions which requires the identification of individuals that are at risk for the development of these disorders.</p><p>Meta-analyses have identified multiple risk factors for the development of mental health problems. Those factors each only confer a small risk at the population level and can therefore not predict the development of individuals (Kim et al., <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Pedersen et al., <xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">2023</xref>). Machine learning has been increasingly used to develop predictive models for a variety of mental disorders. By combining multiple risk factors in a multivariate manner, machine learning algorithms can identify patterns that can be used to predict the likelihood of developing that disorder in individuals. For example, demographic data can be used to predict the development of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (Garcia-Argibay et al., <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">2023</xref>), while personality traits and imaging data can predict the development of anxiety disorders (Chavanne et al., <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>). However the majority of studies are limited to one particular disorder, have been conducted in at-risk samples, and/or have only modest predictive capacity (Chan et al., <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">2023</xref>; Senior, Fanshawe, Fazel, &#x00026; Fazel, <xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>; Whelan et al., <xref rid="r40" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). The factors underlying the development of different mental health problems therefore remain unclear. Such information could enable personalized prevention strategies to mitigate the mental health burden among youth.</p><p>For the current study, we used data from the largest longitudinal neuroimaging study in youth, the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study (Jernigan, Brown, &#x00026; Dowling, <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). We selected individuals who were healthy at baseline and developed various clinically relevant mental health problems during the 2-year follow-up period. The identification of individuals was based on parental report of emotional and behavioral problems using a standard questionnaire (Child Behavior Checklist [CBCL 6&#x02013;18]) to identify six different categories of disorders in accordance with the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders 5 (DSM-5): ADHD problems, anxiety problems, conduct problems, depressive problems, oppositional defiant problems, and somatic problems (Achenbach, <xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). We extracted demographic, symptom, and neuroimaging data at baseline and applied machine learning methods to (1) predict the development of each of these mental health problems on the individual level at follow-up using unimodal and multimodal data, and (2) identify the most informative variables in the prediction models.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec6"><title>Methods</title><sec sec-type="other" id="sec7"><title>Participants</title><p>We selected participants from the ABCD study using DSM-oriented scales from the CBCL, defining individuals with a t-score &#x0003c;65 at baseline and every follow-up as controls, while those with a t-score &#x0003c;65 at baseline and &#x02265;65 at 1- or 2-year follow-up were categorized into clinical groups. The CBCL is constructed to identify abnormal behavior and has a one-tailed distribution, where 65 is the lenient criterion to identify abnormal behavior that has a better balance between sensitivity and specificity than the strict 70 criterion when compared with clinical interview (Krol, De Bruyn, Coolen, &#x00026; van Aarle, <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). We identified 454 individuals with ADHD problems, 652 with anxiety problems, 403 with conduct disorder problems, 757 with depressive problems, 434 with oppositional defiant problems, 983 with somatic problems, and 4842 controls. For the first cohort, we only selected participants with usable MRI data, and excluded participants with a psychiatric history at baseline (defined as having ever received mental health or substance abuse services), resulting in 170 participants with ADHD problems, 281 with anxiety problems, 164 with conduct problems, 336 with depressive problems, 171 with oppositional defiant problems, 521 with somatic problems, and 3004 controls (<xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Finally, we matched groups on age, sex, IQ, and education level of their parents to obtain six matched and balanced control groups (168 ADHD vs. 168 controls, 275 anxiety problems vs. 275 controls, 163 conduct problems vs. 163 controls, 331 depressive problems vs. 331 controls, 168 oppositional defiant problems vs. 168 controls, 513 somatic problems vs. 513 controls). When we built the models, we replaced missing demographic and symptom values using the mean of these features for train set and test set separately to avoid data leakage. Missing MRI data were not imputed as these data generally missing on the whole (i.e. MRI was not measured). Therefore, we included participants without usable MRI data in a second cohort as a second independent test set for models that did not include MRI.

For ADHD, neurocognition, handedness, screen time, parental monitoring, school involvement, and socioeconomic disadvantage contributed meaningfully to prediction (van Lieshout et al., <xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Weigard et al., <xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>). Irregularities in sleeping schedules and family environment in childhood were associated with depression and anxiety disorders (Ho et al., <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>; Ong, Wickramaratne, Tang, &#x00026; Weissman, <xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Wang, Tian, Guo, &#x00026; Huebner, <xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Besides, family history and sleep quality were considered important risk factors for depression symptoms (Ho et al., <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>).

The first cohort consisted of participants for whom neuroimaging data were available. We used 70% of the total data for training (i.e. tuning hyperparameter and validation) and the remaining 30% for testing (first test set). This train/test ratio ensured sufficient data for testing with the number of participants per group, as test variability is large for small samples (Flint et al., <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>). The second cohort consisted of participants for whom no neuroimaging data were available, who were all included in a second test set based on a model that did not include imaging features (N: ADHD&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;110, anxiety problems&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;138, conduct problems&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;92, depressive problems&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;160, oppositional defiant problems&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;84, somatic problems&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;231, and control&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;3036).

SHAP was used as a substitute for feature importance permutation to alleviate the computational workload and was used to explain the results and analyze feature importance for each model. For this procedure, we used SHAP to obtain the most informative features from XGBoost tree-based models and then included these features into the random forest model as described. We utilized the Scikit-learn package in Python and used a 5-fold cross-validation grid search to select the best parameters and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) as the performance measure of this model on test sets. Performance was evaluated using AUC on the test set (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). AUC between 0.7 and 0.8 was considered acceptable, AUC between 0.8 and 0.9 as excellent, and AUC&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;0.9 as outstanding (Hosmer, Lemeshow, &#x00026; Sturdivant, <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>).<fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>(a) Flowchart for the selection of research participants from the ABCD study.

Inspection of the confusion matrix (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4a</xref>) indicated that the model mainly misclassified participants who are part of the cluster of internalizing problems (anxiety problems, depressive problems, and somatic problems) and between participants who are part of the cluster of externalizing problems (ADHD, conduct problems, and oppositional defiant problems) (Lahey et al., <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>).<fig position="float" id="fig4"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>(a) The confusion matrix for the multiclass classification using CBCL data, illustrating misclassification of individuals within externalizing (ADHD, conduct problems, oppositional defiant problems) and internalizing (anxiety problems, depressive problems, somatic problems) problems; (b) ROC curve for predicting the development of internalizing or externalizing problems (AUC&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.79).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="S003329172500087X_fig4" position="float"/></fig></p><p>To evaluate whether a model predicting the development of internalizing versus externalizing problems would perform better, we merged internalizing problems (anxiety problems, depressive problems, and somatic problems) and externalizing problems (ADHD, conduct problems, and oppositional defiant problems), and excluded participants with both an internalizing and externalizing problem.

Separate classifications for internalizing problems (N&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;2333) versus controls (N&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;1642) yielded an AUC of 0.87 and for externalizing problems (N&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;1220) versus controls (N&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;781) an AUC of 0.93 (Supplementary <uri xlink:href="http://doi.org/10.1017/S003329172500087X">Figures&#x000a0;S8&#x02013;S10</uri>). These results indicate that individuals from the internalizing, as well as externalizing problem groups can be better distinguished from individuals in the control group than individuals with later internalizing and externalizing problems can be distinguished from each other.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec16"><title>Discussion</title><p>The results from this study show that the development of various mental health problems can be predicted in a large community sample of youth. Accurate models can be obtained with a standard clinical questionnaire (CBCL; AUCs between 0.71 and 0.87) and all features combined, but not with neuroimaging data only (AUCs &#x0003c; 0.6). Although it was not possible to differentiate between the development of specific mental health problems, the differentiation between internalizing and externalizing problems was acceptable (AUC&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.79). The results were replicated in a second test set (AUCs &#x0003e;0.78), illustrating the robustness of the models. Together, these results demonstrate that subclinical symptoms are highly predictive for the development of later psychopathology and can differentiate between internalizing and externalizing problems. In contrast, neuroimaging features had little predictive value, indicating that variability in brain development is not informative at this age when brain development is at a turning point (Giedd et al., <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>).</p><p>We used SHAP feature selection to minimize the number of features to obtain good predictions. SHAP feature selection indicated that 10&#x02013;29 items of the 119-item CBCL were selected for the predictive models. A simple summation of these items was sufficient to obtain good predictions, and the <uri xlink:href="http://doi.org/10.1017/S003329172500087X">supplementary&#x000a0;tables</uri> reflecting the sensitivity/specificity tradeoffs could be used to optimize the decision criterion. There was little overlap between items that are part of the original CBCL subscales and our predictive models. This indicates that there is no straightforward relationship between diagnostic symptoms (used in CBCL subscales) and prognostic markers (identified by our models). Instead, the predictive models rely on a broader set of behavioral features that extend beyond traditional diagnostic criteria.</p><p>Additionally, some predictive items were shared across symptom domains, reflecting the presence of overlapping behavioral markers and supporting the concept of comorbidity. This finding aligns with the broader discussion on comorbidity and is consistent with recent evidence suggesting shared underlying mechanisms across psychiatric disorders (Xie et al., <xref rid="r41" ref-type="bibr">2023</xref>). These results emphasize the importance of considering both domain-specific and transdiagnostic markers when predicting symptom trajectories.</p><p>The CBCL was developed as a diagnostic scale, and there are only a few studies that used it to predict the onset of mental health problems. One study reported that the child behavior checklist-dysregulation profile (CBCL-DP) can predict high scores on DSM-5 personality traits 4 years later (De Caluw&#x000e9;, Decuyper, &#x00026; De Clercq, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). And the internalizing broad-band scale of CBCL can predict subsequent agoraphobia, anxiety disorder, and social phobia, while the externalizing broad-band scale can predict major depression and disruptive behavior disorders in at-risk children (Petty et al., <xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). However, the number of cases was small, limiting the robustness of the findings, which may explain the unexpected predictivity of externalizing scales for depression. Besides the CBCL, other studies have used other questionnaires or electronic health care records to predict the development of mental health problems but with limited success (Rahman et al., <xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Our predictive models show that SHAP-selected CBCL items are able to predict mental health problems well in 1&#x02013;2 years, suggesting that parent reports of mental health symptoms are a useful screening tool.</p><p>Although the CBCL models could predict mental health status at 1&#x02013;2&#x000a0;year follow-up, multi-label predictive models did not perform that well (accuracy&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;24%) at distinguishing between different mental health problems. The confusion matrix indicated that the model mixed up different mental health problems that are known to cluster into internalizing and externalizing problems (Laceulle, Vollebergh, &#x00026; Ormel, <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). All internalizing problems had a high probability of being classified as somatic problems, while externalizing problems were more likely to be classified as ADHD and oppositional defiant problems. This could also be the result from our inability to exclude cases with disease comorbidity, as that would have reduced the sample size too much. This result reflects the comorbid nature of psychiatric disorders; depression, anxiety disorders, and somatic symptoms are correlated and often co-occur (Lallukka et al., <xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Likewise, oppositional defiant disorder and conduct disorder are comorbid with ADHD, and oppositional defiant disorder is a predictor of conduct disorder onset (Burke, Rowe, &#x00026; Boylan, <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Noordermeer et al., <xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). A model to distinguish between internalizing and externalizing problems showed acceptable discrimination. This implies that CBCL scores cannot only predict the development of specific mental health problems but that it can distinguish between the developments of internalizing or externalizing problems. However, the models performed better at distinguishing each clinical group from controls than at differentiating between internalizing and externalizing problems. This suggests that there is also symptom comorbidity between these problem domains. Symptom comorbidity may even be stronger than suggested by this result, as we excluded participants with both internalizing and externalizing problems beforehand. Thus while individuals who only develop internalizing or externalizing problems can be accurately distinguished, these problem domains also have inherent comorbidity within certain individuals.</p><p>When using other known risk factors reported previously in the literature, we found that sleep and family status were relatively important features for all predictive models. This is consistent with the results of previous studies using other clinical data, which identified that sleep quality, family history, and family environment were risk factors for the development of psychiatric disorders (Liu et al., <xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Maniruzzaman, Shin, &#x00026; Hasan, <xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>). Although the model using CBCL outperformed the model using known risk factors, we chose to perform our follow-up analyses with this routinely used and well-validated instrument.</p><p>While CBCL items had high predictive value on their own, the neuroimaging measures only contributed to the prediction in combination with other features. This indicates that there may be an intricate interaction between the brain and behavior in predicting later problems. However, machine learning algorithms typically only select the most relevant features to optimize the prediction, which therefore does not provide information about their necessity. And vice versa, features that were not selected by the algorithm may just have been redundant and still relevant. The unimodal analysis showed CBCL items were sufficient while neuroimaging was not. One possibility for the limited contribution of neuroimaging is that the association between the brain and behavior is weak and its reliability poor (Liu, Abdellaoui, Verweij, &#x00026; van Wingen, <xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">2023</xref>). However, multivariate models can improve the predictive value of neuroimaging measures (Spisak, Bingel, &#x00026; Wager, <xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">2023</xref>), and previous studies have already demonstrated that neuroimaging can predict anxiety and depression in older children (Chavanne et al., <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">2023</xref>; Toenders et al., <xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>). We therefore speculate that variability in brain structure and function in 9- to 10-year-old children may be more indicative of their current neurodevelopmental phase than related to their propensity to develop mental health problems.</p><p>Interestingly, the accuracy from our predictive models is higher than the accuracy of the CBCL for diagnosing DSM disorders as defined by clinical interviews (Krol et al., <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). As the CBCL is used in clinical practice, this suggests that our CBCL-based predictive models may also be useful for patient care. Our instrument may help in identifying individuals at risk for developing clinically relevant mental health problems. These children may subsequently receive preventative interventions. These interventions are typically administered to entire schools or are targeted to children with the most symptoms. Targeted prevention is more successful, though the effect sizes are still small (Werner-Seidler et al., <xref rid="r39" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>). Personalizing prevention to individuals at risk may improve the preventative effect of these interventions.</p><p>Our findings also reveal notable differences in algorithm performance between models that include all features and models that include only CBCL items. For models including all features, the performance of different algorithms varied substantially. Logistic Regression consistently demonstrated robust results comparable to Random Forest, while SVM and MLP showed lower performance, particularly for domains such as Conduct Problems and Anxiety Problems. The lower performance may be attributed to the different data types included in these models. This may reflect challenges in effectively integrating and utilizing these diverse feature types.</p><p>In contrast, for models that included only CBCL items, all algorithms exhibited stable and competitive performance, with results comparable to Random Forest across all domains. This consistency highlights the robustness and predictive value of the CBCL features selected for these models. It suggests that the CBCL items we selected from SHAP are strongly associated with these mental health problems, enabling reliable predictions regardless of the algorithm used. While imaging and other data types may add complexity and variability to the models, CBCL-based models demonstrate that carefully selected features from a single modality can provide stable and interpretable predictions. This reinforces the utility of CBCL items as reliable predictors for mental health problems, even across different machine learning algorithms.</p><p>The current study is made possible by the large ABCD cohort study with repeated follow-up, which enabled the identification of sufficient children who were healthy at baseline and had clinically relevant mental health problems at follow-up. However, the use of this cohort comes with its limitations. First, it is not known whether the results from North American children can be generalized to children in other countries. Second, the children were between 9 and 10&#x000a0;years at baseline, and it is not clear whether similar predictions can be made for younger and older children. Third, the follow-up period was at the time of investigation restricted to 2 years. Children that did not yet develop clinically relevant problems may do so when they get older, which may also influence the predictive accuracy of our models. The ABCD cohort includes a 10-year follow-up, and models can be retrained for different ages and follow-up ranges once those data become available. Fourth, no self-reported symptom questionnaires across all psychiatric domains were available, as the CBCL only includes this for older children. Self-ratings may provide more insight into internalizing symptoms, and the results may therefore be inherently biased toward externalizing symptoms. Fifth, the limited performance of predictive models based on neuroimaging data could be related to the specific neuroimaging features that are present within the ABCD, as well as the arguably suboptimal modeling compared with behavioral data. Advanced metrics combined with more sophisticated algorithms such as deep learning could uncover more predictive information in future studies.</p><p>In conclusion, our results show that our learning-based models based on the CBCL can predict the development of various mental health problems in independent hold-out samples. The availability of accurate predictive models may enable screening and personalized prevention for at-risk children already before their symptoms require professional help. Furthermore, the identification of the most predictive features may provide clues for optimizing those prevention programs. Together, this will hopefully reduce the number of children who develop mental health problems.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec20"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material id="sm01" position="float" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Hou et al. supplementary material</title><p>Hou et al. supplementary material</p></caption><media xlink:href="S003329172500087Xsup001.docx" id="d67e755" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This project was supported by a Chinese Scholarship Council scholarship awarded to YH.</p><p>Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study (<uri xlink:href="https://abcdstudy.org">https://abcdstudy.org</uri>), held in the NIMH Data Archive (NDA).

The ABCD Study adheres to ethical standards and guidelines for research involving human subjects. Before participation, informed consent was obtained from all participants and their legal guardians. This process ensured that participants were fully aware of the study&#x02019;s aims, procedures, potential risks, and benefits. All data used in this analysis were de-identified to maintain participant confidentiality and privacy. The ethical approvals for the ABCD Study are provided by Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) at each participating site.
