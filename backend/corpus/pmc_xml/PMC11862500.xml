Cancer causes an impact in the face of its news, whether due to feelings of anguish, stress and suffering due to the presence of the disease, which can be shared between patients, family members and loved ones. The news regarding the diagnosis generates, in addition to the psychological impact, financial difficulties, as the patient himself can often be responsible for a large part of the family income. Other complications are the difficulties in understanding the disease by the family members and/or the patient, denial of the disease in order to spare the patient from suffering and other loved ones, family conflicts related to the need to adapt to the new routine of daily life that the family should carry out aiming at the well-being of the patient and his treatment.</p></sec><sec id="sec7209"><title>Objectives</title><p>To evaluate the psychological impact and interpersonal relationships in patients with breast cancer treated in the city of Presidente PrudenteSP by a support association.</p></sec><sec id="sec7210"><title>Methods</title><p>This is an observational, quantitative, analytical and cross-sectional study, in which 200 patients with malignant breast cancer will be invited.</p></sec><sec id="sec7211"><title>Results</title><p>
