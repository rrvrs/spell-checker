We calculated person-years from the inclusion until diagnosis of psychiatric disorder of interest, death, emigration or December 31, 2019, whichever occurred first. Combining sex (female, male), education (low, medium, high) and immigration status (first- or second-generation immigrant, native), we created a variable with 18 strata.

Globally, 14.6% of the years lived with disability and 4.9% of the disability-adjusted life years were attributable to these disorders in 2019 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The corresponding figures for Sweden were 16.1% and 7.9%, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Psychiatric disorders accounted for 53% and 42% of all sick leave cases among females and males, respectively, in Sweden in 2019 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. A recent study reported rising age- and sex-standardized prevalence of psychiatric disorders in the Stockholm Region, Sweden, during 2007&#x02013;2017 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Globally, while the crude burden of psychiatric disorders has increased over recent decades, the age-standardized burden has generally been stable/decreasing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">Inequalities in incidence and prevalence of psychiatric disorders by sociodemographic factors such as age, sex, race, socioeconomic status, migration, and place of residence are well-studied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. A few studies have also explored sociodemographic variations in temporal changes in incidence and prevalence of these disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. However, these studies focused either on a single sociodemographic factor or explored several sociodemographic factors independently, overlooking the fact that sociodemographic factors are interdependent, mutually constitutive, and reinforce one another [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Therefore, there is a lack of research on potential sociodemographic inequalities in temporal trends of psychiatric disorders at intersections of multiple sociodemographic factors. This study aims to address this knowledge gap by exploring the temporal changes in the incidence of major psychiatric disorders at intersections of sex, education, and immigration status using high-quality longitudinal population-based register data from Sweden.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Data sources</title><p id="Par8">This was an observational population register-based open cohort study in Sweden. We obtained pseudonymized individual-level register data on birthyear, sex, date of death, highest educational attainment, and country of birth from Statistics Sweden. We retrieved data on all outpatient specialist and inpatient care from 2001 to 2019 from the National Patient Register (NPR) administered by the National Board of Health and Welfare [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The NPR contains the diagnostic codes according to the International Classification of Diseases 10 (ICD-10) system assigned by healthcare professionals at the time of the healthcare consultation. Data on familial linkage were obtained from the Multi-Generation Register [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Residents in Sweden receive a unique personal identity number (PIN) at birth or the time of immigration which was used to link their data across registers and over time. Statistics Sweden replaced all PINs with unique study numbers before delivering the data for this research.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study population</title><p id="Par9">The study population included all individuals born between January 1, 1958, and December 31, 1994, and resided in Sweden at any point between January 1, 2004 and December 31, 2019. While we have data on the individuals born after the year 1994, we only included individual aged 25&#x02009;+&#x02009;years to minimize the risk of misclassification for educational attainment. This means that the study sample covers the ages 25&#x02013;61 years. We also excluded those with a previous diagnosis of the psychiatric disorder under investigation during 2001&#x02013;2003. This was applied to mitigate the possibility of including prevalent cases. Moreover, individuals with missing information on own or parents&#x02019; country of birth and immigrants with missing migration date were excluded.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Outcomes and follow-up</title><p id="Par10">We identified persons with a first psychiatric disorder diagnosis registered in the NPR as a principal diagnosis. The following psychiatric disorders were separately investigated: substance use disorders (ICD-10 codes: F10&#x02013;F19), schizophrenia and acute and transient psychotic disorders (ICD-10 codes: F20, F23), depressive disorders (ICD-10 codes: F32-F33), anxiety disorders (ICD-10 codes: F40-F41, F43), personality disorders (ICD-10 codes: F60, F63, F68), autism spectrum and other pervasive developmental disorders (ICD-10 code: F84), and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and conduct disorders (ICD-10 codes: F90, F91). Each individual was followed from age 25 years, the date of immigration to Sweden or January 1, 2004 (whichever occurred last) until the first registration of the psychiatric disorder under investigation in the NPR, death, emigration from Sweden or December 31, 2019 (whichever occurred first).</p></sec><sec id="Sec55"><title>Sociodemographic strata</title><p id="Par11">We included sex (female, male), education attainment (low: &#x0003c;10 years, medium: 10&#x02013;12 years, and high: 13&#x02009;+&#x02009;years) and immigration background (first-generation immigrants, second-generation immigrants, and native) as sociodemographic factors. First-generation immigrants were defined as those born abroad, the second-generation immigrants were individuals born in Sweden with at least one parent born abroad, and native were born in Sweden to two parents born in Sweden. Educational attainment was measured at the year of inclusion in the study. Using the possible unique combinations of these factors, we created 18 sociodemographic strata (18&#x02009;=&#x02009;2&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;3&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;3).</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Data analysis</title><p id="Par12">For each sociodemographic stratum, we calculated the annual incidence rates as the number of new cases of the psychiatric disorder under investigation in each calendar year divided by the number of person-years of observation in that year. We also computed an overall incidence rate as the number of new cases of the psychiatric disorder under investigation during 2004&#x02013;2019 divided by the total number of person-years during this period. We then estimated age-standardized incidence rates (ASIRs) using single age groups (25, 26, 27,&#x02026;, 45, 46+) by means of direct standardization using the population of Sweden in the year 2010 as standard.</p><p id="Par13">We used joinpoint regression to investigate temporal trends in ASIRs for each sociodemographic stratum using the Joinpoint Regression Program version 5.0.2 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://surveillance.cancer.gov/joinpoint/">https://surveillance.cancer.gov/joinpoint/</ext-link>). Given 16 data points (2004&#x02013;2019) in our study, a maximum of 2 joinpoints and 3 trend segments were allowed. We set the minimum number as 3 observations per segment. Joinpoint regression, also known as change point regression or segmented regression, is a statistical method to identify change points in time series data (i.e. time points where model parameters change) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. It assumes that data points can be divided into segments, each with its own linear trend. It begins with estimating a model with 0 joinpoints (i.e. a straight line) and then tests whether adding more joinpoints results in improvements in the model fit. The optimal number of joinpoints (0&#x02013;2) was selected based on data-driven weighted Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC). After selecting the optimal number of joinpoints, an annual percentage change for each segment was estimated. The weighted average of these annual percentage changes was then computed as the average annual percent change (AAPC) to summarize the trend for the whole period. Data visualizations were implemented in Stata v.18.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Sensitivity analyses</title><p id="Par14">We conducted two sensitivity analyses to account for the possible changes in the population composition over time. First, since our cohort was 25&#x02013;46 years at the year 2004 (i.e. the starting year of the follow up), we conducted an analysis only in this specific age group to keep the cohort comparable throughout the follow up. Second, we conducted a closed cohort study, that is only individuals 25&#x02013;46 years old at the year 2004 were included and followed.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Results</title><p id="Par15">A total of 5,051,875 individuals aged 25&#x02013;61 years were included (48.9% females) and were followed for &#x02248;&#x02009;56&#x02013;58&#x000a0;million person-years. During the follow up, 296,427 incident cases of anxiety disorders, followed by 195,136 incident cases of depressive disorders and 113,364 incident cases of substance use disorders were registered in the NPR among the study population (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The proportion of individuals with an incident psychiatric disorder during follow up ranged from 0.4% for pervasive developmental disorders to 5.9% for anxiety disorder, corresponding to overall incidence rates of 3.2 and 53.8 per 10,000 person-years, respectively. Anxiety disorders had the highest overall age-standardized incidence rates (ASIRs) across all sociodemographic strata (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Depressive disorders had the second highest ASIRs across all strata except in second-generation immigrant males with low/medium education and native males with low education where substance use disorders had the second highest ASIRs.</p><p id="Par16">

For most studied psychiatric disorders, we observed stable or decreasing trends in age-standardized incidence rates, with important differences across sociodemographic strata defined by sex, education and immigration background. Specifically, first-generation immigrants generally experienced more favourable changes, and this was more pronounced among those with low educational attainment.</p><p id="Par31">Previous research reported mixed findings on temporal trends of the incidence of psychiatric disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. For example, two recent studies reported stable trends in crude incidence rates of registered common psychiatric disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and generalised anxiety and depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] in the UK, while increasing trends in crude and age-standardized rates of psychiatric disorders have been reported in Denmark [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] over recent decades. On the other hand, several studies documented stable or decreasing trends in age-standardized incidence rates of psychiatric disorders, especially using the estimates from Global Burden of Disease Study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Differences in healthcare systems, underlying population, diagnosis coding practices (e.g. ICD version), time periods, methodology (e.g. age-standardization), data source (e.g. register, surveys), and level of care (i.e. primary vs. secondary care) might partially explain these mixed findings. It should also be noted that we only included treated psychiatric disorders while some of previous studies included both treated and untreated (e.g. measured using patient-reported outcomes) psychiatric disorders. These differences also highlight the difficulties in cross-study comparisons of incidence rates and their changes over time.</p><p id="Par32">The observed changes in the incidence of diagnosed psychiatric disorders among young and middle-aged adults in the present study might reflect (i) true changes in the underlying mental health conditions, (ii) changes in the management of psychiatric symptoms at health care settings, including primary care (iii) changes in help-seeking behaviours, (iv) changes in medical technology and knowledge, (v) changes in stigmatisation and awareness, and/or (vi) changes in diagnostic criteria and coding practices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Specifically, given that our data source didn&#x02019;t cover primary care data, improvements in the management of psychiatric disorders at primary care and a shift toward delivery and receiving care at primary care settings would result in declining trends in receiving care at a secondary care setting. On the other hand, advances in diagnostic technology and greater medical knowledge can lead to better detection of psychiatric disorders that were previously neglected or missed (e.g. ADHD and autism).The increasing trends in ADHD and conduct disorders as well as autism in the adult population in the current study is in line with recent studies from Denmark [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], the UK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] and the US [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. These rising trends might be due to increased awareness, changes in recordings (e.g. lower symptom thresholds for a clinical diagnosis), and changes in perception of these disorders persisting beyond childhood and adolescence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p id="Par33">However, our results suggest important variations in temporal trends across sociodemographic strata which cannot be captured by exploring overall trends. Previous studies also documented variations in temporal trends of psychiatric disorders incidence rates by sociodemographic factors such as sex, age, and race [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. For example, exploring age differences generally suggested more pronounced temporal changes in the incidence of psychiatric disorders among younger than older individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. However, these studies treated sociodemographic factors independently which can mask important variations within a population. For instance, Chung et al. reported racial variations in temporal trends of ADHD incidence in the US which resulted in a narrowing racial difference between whites and other races over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. In the present study, however, we observed that the changes in native-immigrant gaps over time varied across sexes and educational groups. For example, while native-immigrant gaps in the incidence of anxiety disorders narrowed among males with low education, it widened among females with low education. Therefore, our results provide a more detailed mapping of sociodemographic differences in the temporal trends of psychiatric disorders incidence compared with common unidimensional analyses focusing on a single sociodemographic factor. The observed sociodemographic disparities in temporal changes of diagnosed psychiatric disorders incidence might reflect sociodemographic differences in epidemiologic and clinical profile of these disorders, prevalence of psychiatric disorders&#x02019; risk factors including genetic predisposition, access to healthcare, and cultural differences which can influence health-seeking behaviours and coding practices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p id="Par34">Our results suggested that first-generation immigrants generally experienced more favourable changes (i.e. more decreases or less increases) in age-standardized incidence rates compared with second-generation immigrants and natives. Moreover, for most psychiatric disorders included in the present study, first-generation immigrants also had lower overall incidence rates during 2004&#x02013;2019. However, these disparities in overall incidence and temporal changes were more pronounced among people with low level of education in both sexes. While not a universal phenomenon, several previous studies also reported lower risks of many psychiatric disorders among first-generation immigrants than second-generation immigrants and natives in Sweden and other countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. We speculate that lower incidence rates and more favourable changes among first-generation immigrants might be partially explained by the &#x0201c;healthy immigrant effect&#x0201d; suggesting that foreign-born individuals tend to be healthier with better coping skills and higher resilience compared with the native-born population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. A recent study among individuals aged 18&#x02013;47 years in Sweden documented a &#x0201c;healthy immigrant effect&#x0201d; for psychiatric disorders diagnosed in outpatient specialist and inpatient care among Western but not non-Western migrants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Our findings might also reflect cultural and language barriers in the use of psychiatric care services among first-generation immigrants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. This explanation is further supported by more pronounced differences among those with low educational attainment who might encounter more cultural, and language barriers compared with their counterparts with higher education. Moreover, increased availability and accessibility of digital care allowing receiving remote consultations from their home country might have also contributed to more favourable changes among first-generation immigrants. While unlikely, the possibility of a more pronounced shift toward the use of primary care among the first-generation immigrants compared with second-generation immigrants and natives cannot be fully ruled out given the lack of data on primary care in the present study. However, this cannot explain the observed differences for more severe psychiatric disorders such as psychosis and schizophrenia which are mainly managed in specialist care. Another possible explanation is the &#x0201c;salmon bias&#x0201d; hypothesis which states that certain immigrant population tend to return to their country of origin when they become seriously ill [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. However, this hypothesis has been challenged in a recent study in Sweden, even though there was evidence of a partial &#x0201c;salmon bias&#x0201d; effect for immigrants from the Horn of Africa, the Rest of Africa, the Middle East and Eastern Europe and Russia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. These results may suggest a need of revising Sweden&#x02019;s integration policies and call for increased intersectional awareness in public health policymaking. They can also be used to guide targeted mental health interventions towards the most vulnerable groups, especially second-generation immigrants with low educational attainment.</p><p id="Par35">The use of nationwide high quality longitudinal register data with minimal recall and selection biases as well as employing an intersectional perspective to explore temporal changes are the main strength of the present study. However, our findings should be interpreted in light of several limitations. While the NPR is a valid and reliable data source [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], it is still prone to misdiagnosis and coding errors and possible sociodemographic variations in these errors can bias our estimates. The lack of data on primary care consultations implies that our results are an underestimate of the psychiatric disorders incidence in Sweden. We also lack data on incidence among those born prior to the year 1958 and hence the results are not generalizable to older cohorts. To avoid low statistical power, we did not consider the specific country of origin and time since immigration when identifying first- and second-generation immigrants. However, we expect variations in temporal changes within these subgroups which should be considered when interpreting the findings. A similar caution applies to age groups, that is there can be variations in temporal changes across age groups which is not captured by age-standardized rates. As this is a descriptive epidemiological study, all potential explanations of possible mechanisms are therefore speculative.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par36">This nationwide study suggested a generally stable or declining trends in age-standardized incidence rates of several psychiatric disorders diagnosed in outpatient specialist and inpatient care among young and middle aged adults in Sweden during 2004&#x02013;2019. The study revealed important sociodemographic disparities in these temporal changes. Specifically, first-generation immigrants generally experienced more favourable changes than second-generation immigrants and natives with more pronounced disparities among those with low education. To provide a more comprehensive picture of psychiatric disorder incidence in the country, future studies could explore temporal changes in psychiatric disorders diagnosed in primary care settings.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.</p><p>
