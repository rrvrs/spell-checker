Surprisingly, all mutants exhibited similar expressions and functionality to the wild-type F protein. All F p27 glycomutants induced neutralizing antibodies and lowered lung viral loads after an RSV challenge in a mouse model.

Introduction</title><p>Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of acute lower respiratory tract infections (ALRIs) worldwide, including bronchiolitis and pneumonia, among children below the age of five. In immunocompromised adults and the elderly, RSV infections also form a significant problem, with RSV being the second most important viral cause of significant respiratory disease in adulthood [<xref rid="B1-viruses-16-01848" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-viruses-16-01848" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. It is estimated that there are 33 million cases with 3.4 million hospitalizations and up to 150,000 deaths globally each year [<xref rid="B3-viruses-16-01848" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Current treatment options remain restricted to supportive care, despite the high medical and societal burden. Palivizumab (Synagis<sup>&#x000ae;,</sup>AstraZeneca, Cambridge, United Kingdom), a humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) for passive immunization of high-risk infants which targets the fusion (F) protein, has been the only FDA-approved immunoprophylaxis for a long time [<xref rid="B4-viruses-16-01848" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Recently, nirsevimab (Beyfortus<sup>TM</sup>, Sanofi, Paris, France and AstraZeneca, Cambridge, United Kingdom), a new long-acting mAb which can be used in all children up to 12 months old for prevention of RSV during their first season and high-risk infants during their second season, has been registered for use in the European Union and the UK and will be available in a single-shot regimen as of next winter (2024&#x02013;2025) [<xref rid="B5-viruses-16-01848" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The vaccine landscape has also undergone significant changes in the last few years. A growing number of RSV vaccine candidates are at different stages of development targeting different populations (elderly, pregnant women and children). This has resulted in FDA approval for three vaccines, namely Pfizer&#x02019;s Abrysvo, GSK&#x02019;s Arexvy and Moderna&#x02019;s mResvia [<xref rid="B5-viruses-16-01848" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-viruses-16-01848" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-viruses-16-01848" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. All of these vaccines are based on the stabilized prefusion F protein. However, developing vaccines for children remains a significant challenge.</p><p>RSV is a non-segmented, negative sense, single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the genus <italic toggle="yes">Orthopneumovirus</italic> in the family Pneumoviridae [<xref rid="B8-viruses-16-01848" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Its genome is approximately 15.2 kb large and encodes 11 proteins, 3 of which are displayed on the viral envelope: the attachment (G) protein, the F protein and the small hydrophobic (SH) protein [<xref rid="B2-viruses-16-01848" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B9-viruses-16-01848" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The RSV F protein is responsible for fusion of the viral envelope with the cellular membrane and is essential for viral entry, spread and replication [<xref rid="B9-viruses-16-01848" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-viruses-16-01848" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. It is a major target for neutralizing antibodies [<xref rid="B11-viruses-16-01848" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-viruses-16-01848" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and is the most conserved RSV envelope protein with amino acid (aa) sequence identities of 90% or higher [<xref rid="B9-viruses-16-01848" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>The RSV F protein is a type I glycoprotein which is initially transcribed as an inactive precursor (F0) and post-translationally modified by furin cleavage into disulfide-linked subunits F1 (50 kDa) and F2 (20 kDa) with removal of a 27 aa peptide (p27), resulting in the mature and biologically active F protein [<xref rid="B13-viruses-16-01848" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-viruses-16-01848" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. This active F protein exists in the prefusion conformation, which readily rearranges in the post-fusion conformation upon fusion. RSV F is co- and post-translationally modified by the attachment of N-linked glycans to asparagine (N) residues within a consensus sequence (N-X-S/T) [<xref rid="B15-viruses-16-01848" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-viruses-16-01848" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-viruses-16-01848" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Depending on the strain, five or six potential N-glycosylation sites are present, of which two are located in the F2 subunit (N27 and N70), two or three additional sites are located in the intervening peptide p27 (N116, N120 and N126), and only one site is present in the F1 subunit (N500) [<xref rid="B18-viruses-16-01848" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>N-glycosylation of glycoproteins is an important post-translational modification which is involved in several processes determining their structure and activity and plays a role in proper folding and subsequent trafficking of the protein [<xref rid="B19-viruses-16-01848" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-viruses-16-01848" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Furthermore, N-glycans can influence translocation to the cell surface and interaction with host cells [<xref rid="B19-viruses-16-01848" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. For example, for RSV, it was demonstrated that the N-glycan positioned at N500 at the RSV F protein is important for fusion activity, and the syncytial size and frequency significantly reduce upon removal of this N-glycan [<xref rid="B21-viruses-16-01848" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-viruses-16-01848" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-viruses-16-01848" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In addition, N-glycans can influence the immunogenicity of viral proteins by shielding antigenic sites on the proteins, thereby affecting the recognition of antibodies, as was demonstrated for human influenza A virus hemagglutinin [<xref rid="B24-viruses-16-01848" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Furthermore, immunization of mice with specific bovine RSV glycomutants elicited higher neutralizing antibody titers compared with the wild-type (WT) F protein [<xref rid="B25-viruses-16-01848" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>Previous work from our group demonstrated enhanced antibody responses when BALB/c mice were immunized with human RSV F DNA glycomutant constructs, especially after an RSV challenge. In these constructs, the N-glycans at positions N27, N70, N116, N126 and N500 were deleted by replacing asparagine (N) codons (AAT/AAC) at the N-glycosylation sites with glutamine (Q) codons (CAA/CAG), thus changing the consensus sequence N-X-S/T into Q-X-S/T, resulting in single (N27Q, N70Q, N116Q, N126Q and N500Q), triple (N27-70-500Q) and quintuple (N27-70-116-126-500Q) glycomutants. Surprisingly, the highest antibody responses were elicited in the mice immunized with the F DNA construct that lacks the N-glycan sequon for N116, which is present in the p27 peptide and therefore was assumed to be absent from the mature F protein [<xref rid="B22-viruses-16-01848" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>In our previous work, only conserved N-glycosylation sites N116 and N126 in p27 were studied. However, an extra glycosylation site (N120) can be present in the p27 peptide, depending on the strain [<xref rid="B18-viruses-16-01848" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In this study, a comprehensive analysis is performed by investigating the antibody responses elicited by glycomutants within the p27 peptide, including single (N116Q, N120Q and N126Q), double (N116-120Q, N116-126Q and N120-126Q) and triple (N116-120-126Q) F p27 glycomutants. This comprises all possible combinations, and these are used to evaluate the effect of the loss of these N-glycans on cell surface expression, fusogenicity and immunogenicity, with the latter being studied through intramuscular immunization of BALB/c mice with plasmids encoding the F p27 glycomutants. A subsequent challenge with RSV A2-line19F allowed evaluation of the potential priming via DNA immunization and the protective effect of the elicited immune responses. Finally, the cross-neutralization capacities of these elicited immune responses were evaluated.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-viruses-16-01848"><title>2. Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2dot1-viruses-16-01848"><title>2.1. Cells, Virus and Antibodies</title><p>The BSR T7/5 cells were a kind gift from K.K Conzelmann (Max-von-Pettenhofer-Institut, Munich, Germany) and were grown in Glasgow&#x02019;s minimal essential medium (GMEM) supplemented with 10% heath-inactivated fetal bovine serum (iFBS) and 2% minimal essential amino acids (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).</p><p>RSV reference strains A2 and B1 and clinical RSV isolates A2000/3-4 and A1998/3-2 were obtained from the Biodefense and Emerging Infections Research Resources Repository (BEI resources, Manassas, VA, USA), propagated in a human epithelial cell line (HEp-2) obtained from ATCC and grown in Dulbecco&#x02019;s modified Eagle medium (DMEM, Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 10% iFBS. RSV cDNA-containing BAC pSynkRSV-line19F was obtained from M.L. Moore (Emory University School Of Medicine, Atlanta, GA, USA) and recovered as described before to obtain strain RSV A2-K-line19F (RSV A2l19F) [<xref rid="B26-viruses-16-01848" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>Palivizumab leftovers were provided by the Paediatrics Department of the Antwerp University Hospital (Professor Verhulst). Goat anti-RSV (Virostat, Westbrook, ME, USA) and RSV reference antiserum (BEI resources) were used as polyclonal antibodies. The corresponding secondary antibodies were obtained from Thermo Fisher Scientific and included Alexa Fluor (AF) 488 goat anti-human IgG, horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated goat anti-mouse and goat anti-human IgG (Thermo Fisher Scientific).</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-viruses-16-01848"><title>2.2. Construction and Expression of Recombinant RSV F Proteins</title><p>The RSV F glycosylation constructs were acquired as described before [<xref rid="B22-viruses-16-01848" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Briefly, N codons (AAT/AAC) at positions N116, N120 and N126, all situated in p27, were changed into Q codons (CAA/CAG), thereby converting N-glycosylation consensus sequence N-X-S/T into Q-X-S/T. Q is considered a good substitute for N since the side chains of Q are quite similar to those of N. Seven RSV F constructs were generated (F N116Q, F N120Q, F N126Q, F N116-120Q, F N116-126Q, F N120-126Q and F N116-120-126Q), with F WT serving as a control. Synthesis of these constructs was performed by Genscript and delivered in pUC57 simple form. Excision of the DNA from the vector was performed using appropriate restriction enzymes (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA). The excised DNA was ligated into a pCAXL mammalian expression plasmid by using T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs). DNA sequencing confirmed the sequences of the recombinant RSV F proteins (VIB Genetic Service Facility, University of Antwerp). In order to express the recombinant F proteins, BSR T7/5 cells were transfected with the resulting plasmid DNA using ViaFect<sup>TM</sup> Transfection Reagent (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). Briefly, the BSR T7/5 cells were seeded to reach approximately 75% confluency at the time of transfection. A 3:1 ratio of transfection reagent to plasmid DNA was used, with the result being diluted in Opti-MEM (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Transfection complexes were added to the cells in GMEM 10% iFBS after an incubation period of 20 min. The cells were then incubated at 37 &#x000b0;C for 24 h before further processing.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3-viruses-16-01848"><title>2.3. Immunofluorescence Analysis of Surface Expression</title><p>Plasmid DNA encoding WT F or F p27 glycomutant proteins was transfected into the BSR T7/5 cells as explained earlier, and RSV F surface expression was evaluated via confocal microscopy, measuring the fluorescence intensities. Transfected cells on coverslips in 24 well plates were incubated with polyclonal anti-RSV goat serum for 1 h at 4 &#x000b0;C. Afterward, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PF), and goat anti-human IgG conjugated with AF488 was used to visualize the surface-expressed RSV F proteins through confocal microscopy (Leica SP8, Bethesda, MD, USA).</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot4-viruses-16-01848"><title>2.4.

After 36 h of incubation, the cells were fixed with 4% PF followed by immunofluorescence staining with palivizumab and AF488-conjugated goat anti-human IgG. The nuclei were stained with DAPI. Cells were considered syncytia when containing more than 2 nuclei. Both the syncytium frequency and mean syncytium size were determined through manual counting.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot5-viruses-16-01848"><title>2.5. Immunization of Mice with Plasmid DNA</title><p>A total of 54 female 7&#x02013;8 week-old BALB/c mice (Janvier Laboratories, Le Genest-Saint-Isle, France) were randomly allocated to 9 individually ventilated cages with 6 animals each.

Discussion</title><p>Although RSV was discovered in 1956, the social and medical burden remains substantial. Vaccine development has primarily focused on the RSV F protein [<xref rid="B5-viruses-16-01848" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B28-viruses-16-01848" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. F is highly conserved and a major target for neutralizing antibodies. Therefore, it is the major focus in vaccine research [<xref rid="B11-viruses-16-01848" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-viruses-16-01848" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Depending on the strain, five or six N-glycosylation sites with the consensus sequence N-X-T/S are present on the RSV F protein [<xref rid="B18-viruses-16-01848" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B29-viruses-16-01848" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. At least five of these N-glycosylation sites are conserved among RSV isolates, which is suggestive of a role in the structure, function or antigenicity of the protein [<xref rid="B15-viruses-16-01848" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B21-viruses-16-01848" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B30-viruses-16-01848" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B31-viruses-16-01848" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Similarly, the presence of 2&#x02013;3 glycans on p27, a peptide which is assumed to be removed during maturation of the protein, is surprising.</p><p>Previous work from our group investigated the roles of five N-glycans located at positions N27, N70, N116, N126 and N500 in cell surface expression, fusogenicity, antigenicity and immunogenicity [<xref rid="B22-viruses-16-01848" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B31-viruses-16-01848" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Surprisingly, the highest antibody responses were elicited in the mice immunized with the F DNA construct lacking the N-glycan sequon for N116, which is present in the p27 peptide and is generally assumed to be absent from the mature F protein [<xref rid="B22-viruses-16-01848" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>Here, we conducted a more detailed study in which the three N-glycosylation sites in the p27 peptide of the RSV F protein of strain line 19 were abolished by N to Q codon changes, resulting in single (N116Q, N120Q and N126Q), double (N116-120Q, N116-126Q and N120-126Q) and triple (N116-120-126Q) mutants [<xref rid="B22-viruses-16-01848" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Also, higher antibody responses were observed for N116Q in this study, though they did not differ significantly from the other F p27 glycomutants or WT F.</p><p>For a long time, it was accepted that the peptide p27 is absent from the mature F protein, because of the double furin cleavage upon expression is considered essential to allow transport of the F protein to the cell surface [<xref rid="B13-viruses-16-01848" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Therefore, p27 was considered not to be exposed to the immune system and not a target for neutralizing antibodies targeting viral particles [<xref rid="B32-viruses-16-01848" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. However, published data on when p27 is fully removed from F are conflicting [<xref rid="B18-viruses-16-01848" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. While some considered p27 removal essential for monomers to associate into the compact trimer [<xref rid="B33-viruses-16-01848" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], other data suggest a partial cleavage of the mature RSV F protein in which trimer formation precedes the second cleavage and removal of the p27 peptide. In this case, the first cleavage happens during transport to the cell surface followed by a second cleavage event that occurs at a later stage, possibly during virus entry, most likely by a furin-like enzyme. This would mean that p27 can be present on the virion surface and the surface of the infected cells, thereby being exposed to immune recognition [<xref rid="B14-viruses-16-01848" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B34-viruses-16-01848" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Indeed, an immunodominant epitope in F p27 was identified in young children and some studies show that p27 specific antibodies are present in some populations, but to what extent this plays a role in protection is not clear [<xref rid="B35-viruses-16-01848" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="B36-viruses-16-01848" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="B37-viruses-16-01848" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p><p>Variations in N-glycosylation could lead to differences in F protein processing [<xref rid="B19-viruses-16-01848" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-viruses-16-01848" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Since N-glycosylation can play a role in proper protein folding, the surface expression of F p27 glycomutants was determined. All F p27 glycomutants were expressed at the cell surface after transfection of BSR T7/5 cells, suggesting that deletion of N-glycans in p27 does not critically affect protein conformation or processing. Next, the fusion activity of F p27 glycomutants was studied. In contrast to what was already demonstrated for the N500 glycomutant by Zimmer et al. and also confirmed by our group, all F p27 glycomutants induced fusion, with minor differences compared with the F WT, except for the triple F p27 glycomutant, which induced significantly smaller syncytia. All F p27 glycomutants induced syncytia of six or more nuclei, indicating that N-glycans at the respective positions are not a requirement for fusion activity [<xref rid="B21-viruses-16-01848" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B23-viruses-16-01848" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. No significant differences were seen in the fusion frequency when comparing the single, double and triple F p27 glycomutants to the F WT, suggesting that changes in the N-glycans in p27 do not affect the fusion mechanism.</p><p>Another well-known role of viral glycans is their glycan shielding ability [<xref rid="B24-viruses-16-01848" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B38-viruses-16-01848" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="B39-viruses-16-01848" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="B40-viruses-16-01848" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="B41-viruses-16-01848" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. P27 glycans could mask antigenic sites, thereby altering the antibody response. Lee et al. (2022) demonstrated that two peptides (aa 101&#x02013;121 and 110&#x02013;136) spanning the p27 domain controlled viral loads with a significantly reduced lung histopathology, demonstrating a potential role for p27 in protective immunity [<xref rid="B34-viruses-16-01848" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In this study, after immunization of BALB/c mice with the different F p27 glycomutants, no significant differences were observed in the total and neutralizing antibody titers. However, following a challenge with RSV A2L19F, all antibody titers increased, revealing more variability between the RSV F p27 glycomutants, though these differences remained non-significant. Together with an increase in the neutralizing antibody titers, a decrease in the viral RNA loads for all F p27 glycomutants was observed. In line with our previously published data on N116 [<xref rid="B22-viruses-16-01848" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], F N116Q demonstrated strong performance in both neutralizing antibody titers and reducing viral loads post challenge, though this was non-significant. A possible explanation for this observation is that removal of N-glycans exposes new neutralizing epitopes or may increase access to existing epitopes [<xref rid="B42-viruses-16-01848" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. It is plausible that N-glycans in the p27 region might reduce glycan masking and therefore expose otherwise less prominent epitopes. Alternatively, glycan consensus sequences can also be part of an antigenic site [<xref rid="B43-viruses-16-01848" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Since p27 is only 27 aa large, all three positions for N-glycosylation are within a short distance from the furin cleavage sites (site I, RARR<sub>109</sub>, and site II, KKRKRR<sub>136</sub>) [<xref rid="B13-viruses-16-01848" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], and the presence or absence of bulky, branched N-glycans may affect the accessibility of furin enzymes, potentially affecting cleavage efficiency. This in turn could increase the exposure of strongly neutralizing epitopes at sites V and &#x000d8; [<xref rid="B33-viruses-16-01848" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B44-viruses-16-01848" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Most likely, such effects would not be all or nothing, which may explain the variability in the obtained results. An important limitation of this study is the lack of detailed biochemical characterization of both WT F and p27 glycomutant F. Assessing the precise structural features of the N-glycans, including their structure and site occupancy, would offer valuable insights, as variations in N-glycan occupancy could explain the discrepancies observed in the results.</p><p>RSV can be divided into two subgroups, RSV A and RSV B, which are further divided into lineages [<xref rid="B45-viruses-16-01848" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. RSV A and B co-circulate during the RSV season, with one subtype predominating [<xref rid="B46-viruses-16-01848" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="B47-viruses-16-01848" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. In this study, we evaluated the cross-neutralization capacities of the serum collected from mice immunized with F p27 glycomutants and challenged by RSV A2-K-line19F. Three RSV A isolates and one RSV B isolate were used to evaluate the breadth of protection. Sera from all mice succeeded in neutralizing the different RSV isolates, indicating that the antibodies elicited by F p27 glycomutant immunization recognize the different RSV strains. This is of importance, considering the co-circulation of different genotypes. Remarkably, the neutralizing antibody titers were lower for RSV B. This was also observed in a recent study on human adult serum [<xref rid="B37-viruses-16-01848" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. A possible explanation might lie in the different antigenicity between RSV A and RSV B. Although the main sequence differences are in the G protein, the F protein also contains significant variation in the sequence between RSV A and RSV B [<xref rid="B48-viruses-16-01848" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="B49-viruses-16-01848" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. It is important to note that for the construction of F p27 glycomutants, the backbone of RSV A2 line19 was used, which might have influenced the recognition of RSV B strains by antibodies.</p><p>Although several vaccines targeting the F protein locked in the prefusion conformation have been accepted, our knowledge about the structure of the F protein is still incomplete [<xref rid="B50-viruses-16-01848" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. It is not fully understood where and if p27 is completely excised or what the role of p27 is in protective immunity. It is clear that p27 is not fully removed in some conditions and that p27 may be important for immunogenicity of the F protein and possibly protective immunity [<xref rid="B36-viruses-16-01848" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="B37-viruses-16-01848" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. It has also been demonstrated that p27 cleavage is dependent on the cell line and RSV subtype used, which might be explained by different expression levels of furin-like proteases, or the involvement of other prohormone convertases [<xref rid="B51-viruses-16-01848" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. With regard to the N-glycans which remain conserved at p27, this study demonstrated that removal of the conserved N-glycans positioned at p27 did not result in obvious alterations in F protein folding, expression or functionality in vitro. As was suggested in our previous work [<xref rid="B22-viruses-16-01848" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], N-glycans located at the p27 peptide might modulate immune responses. In these in vivo experiments, subtle differences were observed between the different F p27 glycomutants and the F WT. However, even the removal of three N-glycans located within p27 did not significantly alter the immune response in the mice. Since no remarkable differences were observed in this study, it remains unclear what the role of these p27-N-glycans in RSV F biology is, but the fact that they were conserved strongly favors a critical role. Future studies should focus on exploring the biochemical properties of p27 glycomutants, as it remains uncertain whether the glycans are indeed present in WT F and p27 glycomutants, given that these are theoretical glycosylation sites. Conducting glycan profiling will be essential to enhance our understanding of the glycans which are actually present. This information could provide valuable insights into the role of these glycans in RSV F biology and their potential impact on immune responses. Possibly, these glycans may only be of importance for natural infection in humans via mechanisms which cannot be recapitulated with in vitro experiments or in mice.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank Pim-Bart Feijens for his assistance with the mice experiments and K.K.
