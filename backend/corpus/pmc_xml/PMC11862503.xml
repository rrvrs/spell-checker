Polypharmacy may be rational with clear indications and benefits, but it becomes irrational when better alternatives are available. This irrational polypharmacy is associated with poorer clinical and economic outcomes, including a higher mortality rate. Antipsychotic polypharmacy in elderly patients with schizophrenia is not well-studied and, therefore, is not generally recommended. Long-term antipsychotic use in patients with dementia has also been linked to a higher mortality rate. PIMs, representing a greater risk than benefit, are prevalent in mental health institutions at all healthcare levels, with a prevalence ranging from 40% to 60%. Antipsychotics, along with benzodiazepines, are among the most commonly included in PIMs and polypharmacy in these institutions. Moreover, antipsychotics are frequently implicated in potential severe drug-drug interactions in elderly patients with mental disorders, particularly with antibiotics and antiarrhythmics.</p><p>Unfortunately, the existing treatment guidelines and meta-analyses mostly do not cover these aspects, which represent a gap between the &#x02018;real clinical&#x02019; pharmacology and treatment guidelines. The speaker will summarize the medication-related problems in this population and present practical recommendations for daily clinical practice.</p></sec><sec id="sec9618"><title>Disclosure of Interest</title><p>None Declared</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="1"/></counts></article-meta></front></article>
