In this study, nine hand surgeons and six orthopedic surgeons were included in expert group E and novice group N, respectively. An eye tracker and surface electromyography were used.

However, the acquisition and transfer of microsurgical skills largely depend on experience. Their opportunities to acquire skills are limited compared to athletes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Appropriate education and training are essential for acquiring skills in microsurgery, as with other surgical procedures. Microsurgical techniques, which are widely used to reattach amputated limbs and various skin flaps, involve vascular anastomoses and nerve sutures in the extremities; these are often less than 1&#x000a0;mm in diameter and require the use of an operating microscope. In general, learning surgical techniques involves apprenticeship. However, in cases of finger amputation and severe limb trauma&#x02014;where microsurgery is essential&#x02014;the target tissue can be soft and deformed, making it difficult to quantify. Additionally, the timing for these surgeries is often urgent, precluding the use of various simulation technologies and intraoperative navigation that are becoming more common in other surgical training contexts.</p><p id="Par3">Recently, various simulation and augmented reality (AR) technologies have been enhancing the efficiency of learning common surgical procedures. In Europe, microscopes that incorporate these technologies are available, although they are not yet widespread.</p><p id="Par4">In daily activities like walking or reaching, it is possible to respond unconsciously to slight environmental changes or uncertainties. A seminal experiment highlighting this unconscious adaptation involves the treadmill walking test in decerebrated cats<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. These animals were shown to maintain locomotion on a treadmill and adjust their gait patterns according to the treadmill&#x02019;s speed, illustrating an implicit adaptive response to environmental dynamics. Furthermore, the anticipatory nature of motion control plays a pivotal role in unconscious adaptation. Experimental<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> and theoretical<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> evidence suggests that human movements are fine-tuned to align with environmental conditions prior to the conscious recognition of such changes. This principle of unconscious movement adaptation has been applied to the control of arm prostheses, enhancing their effective use in real-world settings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Surgical experience involves the unconscious processing of surgical procedures. And surgeons must be acutely aware of their fingertips, the tips of their instruments, and even the surgical site itself. &#x0201c;Responsiveness&#x0201d; to unquantifiable uncertainties, which involves unconscious processing, is essential. This research was initiated based on the premise that it might be possible to visualize this phenomenon.</p><p id="Par5">The gaze analysis technique used in this study is non-invasive. It has started to be applied across various fields because it can reflect subtle unconscious changes in brain activity through the analysis of eye movement patterns, their distribution, and pupil diameter changes. There are reports suggesting that gaze analysis is beneficial for understanding decision-making processes in the manufacturing and distribution sectors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. In the medical field, numerous studies have utilized this method in laparoscopic surgery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, indicating its reliability as quantitative and objective data. This method may also enhance surgical training to improve performance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. There is a common saying that &#x0201c;the eyes are as expressive as the mouth,&#x0201d; suggesting that by observing eye movements, one can understand latent cognitive behaviors not expressed in words. Eye movements are indicative of brain function, and it has been reported that saccade movements can help detect diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">As for electromyograms, the use of surface electromyograms allows non-invasive and continuous data collection. The experimental results demonstrated a positive correlation between manipulation performance and maneuvering experience<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Additionally, this method helps to depict unconscious cognitive behavioral models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><p id="Par7">Groups E and N required average suture times of 15&#x000a0;min and 17&#x000a0;min, respectively. Four patients in group N failed to suture six stitches within 20&#x000a0;min. Furthermore, the mean times for a single-stitch suture were 2.5&#x000a0;min for group E and 4.1&#x000a0;min for group N; this difference was not statistically significant (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.05).</p><p id="Par8">A heat map of the distribution of eye gazing is presented in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.</p><p id="Par9">

The gaze of group N (left column, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) was broadly distributed, possibly because the participants spent time looking at their hands. A comparison of this heatmap with color-weighted averages revealed that the area of the N group (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01) was predominantly larger than that of the E group.</p><p id="Par11">Graphs of the pupil diameter are shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>. The pupil diameter transition for each phase in groups E and N showed a line that was reproducible over several phases.

Group E did not waste much time (see lower panel of Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Furthermore, the left hand barely moved, while the right hand moved to tie the thread. The tying thread of group N was located far. Hence, group N showed common movement for picking up the tying thread. The trajectory of the right hand was not stable, and the left hand pulling the thread also moved significantly.</p><p id="Par16">We marked the red dots as the centers of gravity of the gaze; we also marked each hand movement for one suture. Furthermore, we calculated the distance between each point and the center of gravity. Additionally, we determined the variance. The standard deviations of group E were smaller than those of group N, especially for gaze.</p><p id="Par17">

</p><p id="Par18">The SSI was close to one in the expert group, and the same muscle synergy was used to generate the movement with six sutures.

The time required for training for safety quality checks in corporate manufacturing lines and construction sites can be significantly reduced by providing feedback on eye movement results<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. In the field of medicine, compared to novices, skilled operators perform tasks during head and neck 3D endoscopic surgery within a narrower range of starting times and places, possibly because the conversion of interpretation from 2D to 3D is empirically unnecessary for skilled operators<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par20">Several studies on gaze analysis in the field of laparoscopy have also been reported, with some reporting that evaluations using gaze analysis are more sensitive to expertise.</p><p id="Par21">Variations in pupil diameter and workload have also been reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Our experiment showed that both groups, E and N, had increased pupil diameters in the two needle and ligature tasks, indicating the involvement of stress in that task. However, stress does exist even when the subjects concentrate on the task. The smaller fluctuations in pupil diameter of Group N than those of Group E during the task suggests that Group N constantly felt stress throughout the test and could not concentrate, when necessary, whereas Group E had a moderate level of stress and could concentrate sufficiently.</p><p id="Par22">Several studies have examined the relationship between hand motions and skills in laparoscopy and arthroscopy. Yamamoto et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> used a 3D position tracker to acquire the arthroscopic motion in skilled and unskilled elbow arthroscopists and found that the amount of rotation in the y-axis direction was predominantly greater in skilled operators than in unskilled operators. In addition, Ignacio et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> showed validity in assessing proficiency in laparoscopic surgery with the time, distance, and depth of movement of manipulating instruments. Furthermore, Grober et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> studied hand motion distance with sensors on hands in microscopic techniques; they reported that this distance was objective and sensitive.</p><p id="Par23">However, the hand barely moves in microsurgery; hence, the dependence is often on the movement of the fingertips. This study manually extracted and analyzed the coordinates from recorded gaze videos owing to the lack of sensor or image recognition software to capture minute movements of the fingertips and the tips of the forceps.</p><p id="Par24">The predominance of a larger gaze distribution area of group N suggests a more focused approach of group E.</p><p id="Par25">Changes in pupillary diameter showed the presence of a workload during needle movement and ligation. The work stress of group E increased gradually, whereas group N remained stressed throughout the task.</p><p id="Par26">The forceps and eye movements during ligature demonstrated that group E showed fewer hand and eye movements centered on the knot where the gaze was focused. We believe that group E included experiential anticipatory movements.</p><p id="Par27">The long movement distance of the forceps in group N may be a point to consider during training, where trainees can be instructing to be mindful of a compact movement in the next action of picking up the thread.</p><p id="Par28">In surface myoelectricity, from the results of the SSI, it was found that experts with an SSI close to one generate similar movements using the same muscle synergy every time. As experts are already aware of the needle movement during the suture procedure &#x0201c;advance,&#x0201d; they can reduce the dimensionality of the difference in the situation and environment and can respond to it &#x0201c;unconsciously.&#x0201d; Novices use completely different muscle synergies to generate similar movements each time; hence, it is thought that beginners may have not yet learned how to move needles, and that they respond to differences in situations and environments through &#x0201c;conscious&#x0201d; thinking.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title> Methods</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Participants</title><p id="Par29">The procedures of this study were carried out in accordance with approved guidelines.

We employed an external video microscope (MM51/YOH, Mitaka Kohki Co., Ltd.) for heads-up surgery along with a Tobii Glass 2 eye tracker (Tobii Technology, Inc.) to record eye gaze and pupil diameter. Postures were captured from three directions using three video cameras (HC-WX1M/WZX1M, Panasonic).
