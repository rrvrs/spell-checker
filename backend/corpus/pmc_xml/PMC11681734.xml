We compared transcriptomes of resting and LPS-exposed blood from six LPS-sensitive species (rabbit, pig, sheep, cow, chimpanzee, human) and four LPS-resilient species (mice, rats, baboon, rhesus), as well as plasma proteomes and lipidomes. Unexpectedly, at baseline, sensitive species already had enhanced expression of LPS-responsive genes relative to resilient species. After LPS stimulation, maximally different genes in resilient species included genes that detoxify LPS, diminish bacterial growth, discriminate sepsis from SIRS, and play roles in autophagy and apoptosis. The findings reveal the molecular landscape of species differences in inflammation. This may inform better selection of species for pre-clinical models and could lead to new therapeutic strategies that mimic mechanisms in inflammation-resilient species to limit inflammation without causing immunosuppression.</p><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s10020-024-01052-x.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Inflammation</kwd><kwd>Animal models</kwd><kwd>Genomic response</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000185</institution-id><institution>Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>15-21-THoR-FP-007</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000015</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Energy</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIGMS GM103493</award-id><award-id>P51-OD011133</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100014224</institution-id><institution>Open Medicine Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research 2024</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par20">For decades, bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS, endotoxin) has been injected into different species to induce and study inflammatory responses that are intended to mimic human inflammation. Although there are substantial differences in preparations and administration<bold>,</bold> the bioactive moiety of LPS (lipid A) is generally conserved, so that it is possible to rank the sensitivity of species to LPS (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A). These data indicate that species differ over a hundred thousand-fold in sensitivity to LPS. Rodents and some non-human primates used in many disease models are very resilient to LPS and require over a milligram LPS/kg to induce pathology. In contrast, humans fall on the end of extreme sensitivity. Most studies in humans have utilized a standardized reference endotoxin prepared by the FDA and administered to volunteers at a dose of 2&#x02013;4&#x000a0;ng LPS/kg, which causes predictable flu-like symptoms, fever and cytokine release (Lowry <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2005</xref>) Two documented cases of endotoxin injected into humans at higher doses (27&#x000a0;ng/kg and 17&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g/kg), caused shock and required intensive care support (Sauter and Wolfensberger <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">1980</xref>; Taveira da Silva et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">1993</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.1</label><caption><p>Rationale of study. <bold>A</bold> Lethal doses of LPS in different species.

Wherever possible, studies using a range of doses of <italic>E. coli</italic> LPS injected as a single bolus are reported. Resilient species, defined here as those that survive a dose of 1&#x000a0;mg/kg body weight (dashed line), are indicated with red background; sensitive species are indicated with a blue background. References are given in Table S2. <bold>B</bold> Outline of study. Whole blood from 4&#x02013;5 individuals of 4 resilient species (mouse, rat, rhesus, and baboon, indicated in red) and 6 sensitive species (rabbit, pig, cow, sheep, chimp, human, indicated in blue) was incubated ex vivo with 0, 10, 100, or 1000&#x000a0;ng/mL <italic>E. coli</italic> LPS for 2, 6, or 24&#x000a0;h followed by leukocyte mRNA. sequencing. MS/MS analysis of lipids and proteins was performed on plasma without ex vivo stimulation. In each case, data from blood of resilient species was compared to that from sensitive species</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10020_2024_1052_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p id="Par21">While this extreme sensitivity of humans to inflammation may be an advantage to protect against live infectious challenges, it likely comes at a higher cost of secondary tissue damage (Read et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2008</xref>; Medzhitov et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2012</xref>; R&#x000e5;berg et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2007</xref>; Ayres et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2008</xref>; Jamieson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2013</xref>) than for species that are more resilient. Ironically, a large segment of our pharmacopoeia consists of drugs designed to block innate inflammation, all which have the side effect of increased risk of infection. The mechanisms that some species utilize to minimize agonist-induced innate inflammation while apparently at the same time avoiding immunosuppression are poorly understood.</p><p id="Par22">To better understand how different species respond to the same agonist challenge we compared the proteomics, HDL proteomics, and lipidomics of plasma and the transcriptomics of leukocytes in the whole blood of 10 species that vary widely in sensitivity to in vivo LPS challenge. We used carefully controlled and standardized protocols to collect the plasma and the whole blood of 5 mice, rats, rhesus monkeys, baboons, rabbits, pigs, cows, sheep, chimpanzees, and humans into heparinized tubes containing no or varied doses of LPS. Plasma and leukocytes were harvested at 2, 6, and 24&#x000a0;h and analyzed for protein or lipid and mRNA (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B). For the purpose of analysis, we divided species into two groups: those &#x0201c;resilient&#x0201d; to LPS (in vivo sensitivity of&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;1&#x000a0;mg/kg: mouse, rat, rhesus, baboon) and those &#x0201c;sensitive&#x0201d; to LPS (rabbits, pigs, cows, sheep, chimpanzees, and humans) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A). The terminology for underlying resilience to LPS challenge between species is not precise (Read et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2008</xref>). Baseline resilience to LPS differs from the resilient state induced by prior LPS challenge as well as from the ability to limit the damage caused by a given live microbial burden, both of which have been previously defined as tolerance (Read et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2008</xref>; Medzhitov et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2012</xref>; R&#x000e5;berg et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2007</xref>; Ayres et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2008</xref>; Jamieson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2013</xref>; Cavaillon and Adib-Conquy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2006</xref>). We use &#x0201c;sensitivity&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;resilience&#x0201d; as the terminology for this article (Warren et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><p id="Par23">Animal details are summarized in Table S1.</p><p id="Par24">Non-human primates: Blood samples from chimpanzees, baboons and rhesus macaques were obtained from the colony at the Southwest National Primate Research Center (SNPRC) at Texas Biomedical Research Institute.

All protocols were approved by the institutional IACUC (protocols 1508 PC CJ MM SB and 525 PT). Animals were selected to be of approximately the same age and were na&#x000ef;ve with regard to experimental procedures. Rhesus macaques were sourced from the SNPRC specific pathogen free colony and were negative for Herpes B Virus, Simian immunodeficiency virus, Simian Betaretrovirus (SRV), Simian T-Cell Lymphotrophic Virus. Animals were group housed in outdoor housing except during recovery from procedures, and animals were sedated prior to obtaining blood samples. Chimpanzee samples were obtained prior to the ban on chimpanzee research.

Briefly, a linear model was used to fit the data, where the sensitive or resistant groups were fixed effects, and individuals of each species were considered as random effects, using the blocking factor/random effect function in Limma.

Of these, 1,222 were expressed at higher levels and 1790 at lower levels in sensitive species than in resilient species (Data S3). We used Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (Qiagen, Inc) to identify upstream regulators that could mediate this difference (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B). Strikingly, the most significantly enriched factor with a positive activation z-score was LPS, suggesting that the gene expression profile of resting leukocytes from sensitive animals resembles that of cells that have already been stimulated with LPS when compared to resting leukocytes from resilient animals. The next highest modifiers with a positive activation Z score were IFN&#x003b3;, Oncostatin M (OSM), TNF and Stat3, which are all potent mediators of inflammation and immunity. The most enriched modifier with a negative z-score, indicating those agents predicted to reduce genes leading to a sensitive gene profile, was dexamethasone, a potent anti-inflammatory agent. The next most enriched regulators are also linked to inflammation: torin-1 is an inducer of autophagy, which antagonizes inflammation (Deretic and Levine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2018</xref>), and RUNX1, which regulates TLR and NF-&#x003ba;B signaling (Bellissimo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2020</xref>). These findings suggest that leukocytes in the blood of sensitive animals such as humans have a gene expression pattern consistent with an inflammatory state when compared with leukocytes from resilient animals, even in the absence of stimulation.

LPS is also a major driver of inflammation in Gram-negative bacterial infections. We hypothesized that there exists a hierarchy of sensitivity to LPS-induced inflammation in different species and that this difference is reflected in blood plasma or leukocyte gene expression. Our findings suggest that information relating to LPS sensitivity of species is contained in circulating blood leukocytes. We found that: 1. species shown in the literature to be sensitive to LPS have an extensive gene activation pattern in whole blood that is suggestive of LPS stimulation at rest (in the absence of LPS stimulation) when compared to the resilient species, and 2. After LPS stimulation, the gene response that most differs between sensitive and resilient species are a relatively small number of genes that are relevant to LPS detoxification, TLR response, bacterial control, and apoptosis. We speculate that the results reflect different paradigms that have evolved to handle microbial exposure, with sensitive species having constitutively active genes at baseline that are prepared to handle infection at the cost of more potentially damaging inflammation, and resilient species activating certain genes after LPS stimulation that can act to limit the damage associated with LPS and inflammation compared to sensitive species.</p><p id="Par49">It is unclear if the classification of the species that we utilized with respect to their sensitivity to LPS is specific to LPS alone or may also apply to other inflammatory stimuli. This question is important given the large numbers of infectious and non-infectious situations in which inflammation is part of a disease process and because LPS is often used as a stimulant to model inflammation beyond Gram-negative infection. There are no other pro-inflammatory agonists reported in the literature that have been administered in sufficient numbers to permit a similar comparison based upon in vivo sensitivity. In humans, the in vivo transcriptomic response to LPS is similar in many ways to that induced by trauma or burns (Seok et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2013</xref>). The baseline data most likely reflects genes poised to influence the underlying physiological responses to LPS that are sometimes seen minutes after exposure. Stringent analysis of the genes which differ at baseline between sensitive and resistant species revealed numerous genes involved in inflammation, including IRAK4 which was constitutively expressed in the sensitive species relative to the resistant species and which is an important non-specific central mediator of TLR and IL1 stimulation. We did not find obvious baseline genes that were specific to LPS. While the top hit in the pathway analysis was for LPS, most of the other identified pathways (such as interferon gamma) were non-specific.</p><p id="Par50">In contrast to the baseline results, stringent analysis of genes that were maximally increased or decreased with no overlapping between the two groups two or six hours after LPS stimulation resulted in a list of genes which were mostly increased in the resilient species and which are known to be important in either LPS detoxification or clearance, inflammation, and apoptosis. There was a striking difference in directionality between the genes that had maximum differences between two groups at baseline and after LPS stimulation. Baseline genes that most differed between the two groups were almost exclusively increased in the sensitive group, whereas genes that most differed after LPS stimulation were mostly increased in the resilient group. The factors leading to the physiological responses at different times after LPS stimulation are complex, and it is unclear if these genes or their gene products directly mediate or compensate for pathological inflammation.</p><p id="Par51">Immune cells are conditioned by exposure to the surrounding plasma (Warren et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2010</xref>), and LPS is rapidly detoxified by binding to HDL (Tanaka et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2020</xref>), raising the possibility that non-cellular blood components might be related to the species differences in LPS. However, while analysis of the resting plasma proteome, HDL proteome, and lipidome revealed that there were substantial differences between the ten species, we were unable to detect differences between the sensitive and resilient groups that would provide a clear and unifying explanation for the difference in LPS sensitivity in the different species.</p><p id="Par52">There are limitations to our study. The ordering of the sensitivity to the species is based on studies using LPS from different strains of bacteria and different outcome measurements which could have introduced artifacts in the species grouping of responses to LPS. Although minimized as much as possible, there were some differences in the age, sex, prior pathogen exposure and sedation type between the species in these earlier reports as well as in our study. Transcriptomes of all species were related to the human transcriptome. While this was necessary for allowing cross-species comparisons, it can distort the apparent expression of particular genes where there is not 1:1 conservation between species pairs, for example where no ortholog has been identified in a particular species, or where a single human gene is represented by multiple orthologs in another species, or vice versa. The species have differing numbers and proportions of types of leukocytes in their whole blood, so that the studies reflect the net sum of all gene responses in the blood. Although the percentages did not correlate with the species grouping, specific conclusions could be confounded by different cells playing a role in the underlying mechanisms. In addition, our results reflect ex vivo stimulation in the blood compartment only, which does not necessarily reflect results from different tissues. For technical reasons and to ensure that all results between species were strictly comparable, our earliest time point was at two hours. It is possible that stresses to the cells during sample collection, incubation, and erythrocyte lysis could have altered the response even in the absence of LPS. The lack of detection of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF in samples in which there was no LPS added is reassuring in this regard. Our analyses of pathways were performed using a program that is based upon prior published gene associations to analyze gene pathways. By design the results of these and similar programs include literature biases that populate the medical and research literature. Regardless of these limitations, our data support the hypothesis that species can be characterized by those that respond with high sensitivity and those that are relatively resilient (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A) and indicate that information relating to this division is present in blood leukocytes.</p><p id="Par53">To our knowledge, this work represents the first approach to systematically compare the proteomics, lipidomics and transcriptomics between species that are sensitive or resilient to LPS. Humans are at the most sensitive end of the range of species to LPS challenge. The evolutionary advantage for this is not clear, especially considering that many non-human primates are highly resilient, and that their innate immune baseline state does not seem to be associated with any obvious disadvantage. There are however several important implications. First, if innate inflammation is essential for immune defense but at a potential cost of increased inflammatory secondary tissue damage, one might expect humans to be more resilient to infections but also more likely to have inflammatory consequences such as worse symptoms or secondary damage during infection than more resilient species. Second, the results suggest that the choice of a species to mimic any individual inflammatory disease in humans might be improved by tailoring the species to one that mimics humans in relevant disease specific genes. Our data could be used to choose a species in which to model drugs that have a specific gene target (by matching responses with the human response for that gene). Third, it may be possible to utilize these data as a means of discovering new drug targets or as the basis of a new approach to therapeutic modulation of immunity by inducing a state similar to those in resilient species in order to temporarily suppress damaging inflammation during infection or other damaging pro-inflammatory conditions while minimizing immunosuppression.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>
