Our previous study demonstrated that egg exosome-derived miRNAs may play a key role in modulating embryonic oxidation-reduction process, whereas the exact function and mechanism were still poorly understood. The present study aimed to investigate the roles of egg exosome miRNAs in maintaining dynamic equilibrium of free radicals and peroxide agents in embryonic liver, as well as demonstrate the specific mechanism using oxidative stress-challenged hepatocytes.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par2">Compared to 36-week-old breeding hens, decreased hatchability and increased embryonic mortality were observed in 65-week-old breeding hens. Meanwhile, the older group showed the increased MDA levels and decreased SOD and GSH-Px activities in embryonic liver, muscle and serum. Embryonic mortality was significantly positively correlated with MDA level and negatively correlated with GSH-Px activity in embryonic liver. In addition, 363 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in embryonic liver, 13 differentially expressed miRNAs (DE-miRNAs) were identified in egg exosomes. These DEGs and DE-miRNAs were involved in oxidoreductase activity, glutathione metabolic process, MAPK signaling pathway, apoptosis and autophagy. miRNA-mRNA network analysis further found that DEGs targeted by DE-miRNAs were mainly enriched in programmed cell death, such as apoptosis and autophagy. Wherein, <italic>MAPK10</italic> with highest MCC and AUC values was significantly related to GSH-Px activity and MDA level, and served as the target gene of miR-145-5p based on dual luciferase reporter experiment and correlation analysis. Bioinformatics analysis found that miR-145-5p/<italic>MAPK10</italic> axis might alleviate peroxide generation and apoptosis. In primary hepatocytes of chick embryos, miR-145-5p transfection significantly reversed H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced mitochondrial ROS increase, <italic>MAPK10</italic>, <italic>BAX</italic> and <italic>CASP3</italic> overexpression and excessive apoptosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par3">Exosome miR-145-5p in eggs could target <italic>MAPK10</italic> and decrease mitochondrial ROS, attenuating oxidative damage and apoptosis in hepatocytes of chick embryos.

It was found that the increased embryonic malformation and mortality could be attributed to the exacerbated oxidative damage of chick embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Embryonic redox homeostasis and development are closely related to biomolecules from maternal sources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Pro-oxidative molecules in aged breeding hens would be easily transferred into fertile eggs aggravating embryonic oxidative damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Hence, exploring effects and mechanisms of key biomolecules in eggs to embryonic oxidative damage are of great significance for increasing the hatching performance of aged breeding hens.</p><p id="Par16">Exosomes are crucial mediators transmitting communication signals of the embryonic-maternal cross-talk, and contain many genetic molecules that play key roles in fetal development, physiological and pathological process, like miRNAs and mRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Recently, exosome miRNAs derived from amniotic fluid were demonstrated to take a significant role in maintaining redox homeostasis and attenuating inflammatory responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Administration of exosome miR-17-3p from amniotic fluid depressed reactive oxygen species (ROS) contents and increased GSH-Px activity in serum, thus alleviating inflammatory reaction of mice during oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In poultry, it was found that egg exosome miRNAs could participate in oxidation&#x02013;reduction processes, implying their roles in maintaining dynamic balance of ROS in chick embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. However, these exosome miRNAs may play opposite roles in regulating oxidative stress, for example, some miRNAs could alleviate oxidative stress-induced apoptosis, while others could exacerbate ROS generation and cellular structure damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Actually, exosomal miRNA profiles and function are attributed to the physiological state of parental cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Senescence or oxidative stress could significantly alter miRNA profiles in exosomes, leading to oxidative imbalance of recipient cells like endogenous anti-oxidant system destruction and ROS accumulation, and even promoting apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Changes of miRNAs profiles have also been identified in reproductive system of aged hens, in which many miRNAs could increase H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Biomolecules in reproductive system of laying hens could be transferred into fertile eggs, participating in embryonic oxidation&#x02013;reduction balance and development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Thus, it could be speculated that egg exosome miRNAs in aged breeding hens might exacerbate embryonic oxidative damage. Significantly, effects of miRNAs are attributed to their target genes and corresponding cascade reactions including autophagy, apoptosis, glutathione metabolism and oxidoreductase activity pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. However, it is still unclear the regulative effects of exosome miRNAs in redox balance of chick embryos.</p><p id="Par17">This study aimed to investigate the potential mechanism of peroxide accumulation in embryonic liver of aged breeding hens from the perspective of exosome miRNAs. Correlation analysis and random forest model revealed the relationship between endogenous antioxidant activities, peroxide agent levels and DEGs abundance in embryonic liver. Then, exosome DE-miRNAs, miRNA-mRNA networks and corresponding signaling pathways were disclosed based on high throughput sequencing analysis. Effects and regulative mechanism of candidate miR-145-5p/<italic>MAPK10</italic> axis in oxidative damage were investigated using H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-challenged primary hepatocytes of chick embryos. Our findings would shed light on mechanism that exosome miRNAs regulate liver oxidative damage of chick embryos, which provide theoretical basis and guidance for maintaining embryonic redox homeostasis by improving maternal physiological status through nutritional or genetic modifications.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Incubation of egg</title><p id="Par18">A total of 528 fertilized eggs from the 36-week and the 65-week Hy-Line Brown hens were obtained from Ningxia Xiaoming Group Co., Ltd.

Notably, <italic>MAPK10</italic>, up-regulated in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-stimulated hepatocytes and negatively regulated by miR-145-5p, was demonstrated as the direct target of miR-145-5p, based on correlation analysis, bioinformatics prediction and dual-luciferase reporter assay. <italic>MAPK10</italic> is the member of JNK subgroup of the mitogen-activated protein kinase, which has been demonstrated to be the critical integration point for multiple signaling pathways and play key roles in diversified physiological processes such as apoptosis and proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. It was found that <italic>MAPK10</italic> up-regulation could activate transcription factors such as c-Jun and c-Fos, promoting Bax and Caspase-3 expression as well as inhibiting Bcl-2 expression, and in turn exerting pro apoptosis by a series of cascade reactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. In mice, the down-regulation or deficiency of <italic>MAPK10</italic> resulted in the decreased Caspase-3 and Bax expression, attenuating cell apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. In the present study, apoptotic index as well as <italic>CASP3</italic> and <italic>BAX</italic> levels showed a significantly positive correlation with <italic>MAPK10</italic> expression and noticeably negative correlation with miR-145-5p expression. Hence, these findings indicated that miR-145-5p could target <italic>MAPK10</italic> to inhibit <italic>BAX</italic> and <italic>CASP3</italic> expression, alleviating H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-challenged apoptosis in chicken embryonic hepatocytes. ROS, primarily produced in mitochondria, are critical signaling molecule that maintain redox balance and act as key regulators of oxidative damage and cellular apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. Overload of mitoROS could injure mitochondrial biomolecules and destroy mitochondrial structure and function, activating Bax/Caspase-3 axis to promote apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. When escaping into cytoplasm, mitoROS would activate p53 and JNK signaling pathways further elevating Bax and Caspase-3 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. In the current study, our results showed that miR-145-5p transfection inhibited H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-stimulated mitoROS increases. Meanwhile, mitoROS levels were critically positively related to <italic>MAPK10</italic>, <italic>BAX</italic> and <italic>CASP3</italic> expression. It was prompted that miR-145-5p could target <italic>MAPK10</italic> to hinder mitoROS accumulation, attenuating H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced hepatocyte apoptosis in chick embryos. Collectively, these findings might provide a potential target for attenuating oxidative damage of chicken embryonic liver.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par43">In conclusion, egg exosome miRNAs could exacerbate oxidative damage in embryonic liver, contributing to the increased embryonic mortality in aged breeding hens. miRNA-mRNA network analysis revealed the potential roles of miR-145-5p/<italic>MAPK10</italic> axis in alleviating embryonic hepatocyte apoptosis and peroxide accumulation. Furthermore, we found that miR-145-5p could target <italic>MAPK10</italic> and inhibit mitoROS accumulation, attenuating H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced hepatocyte apoptosis in chick embryos. These findings reveal a novel target alleviating oxidative damage of embryonic hepatocytes, which provide theoretical basis and guidance for supporting fetal health and development by improving maternal physiological status through nutritional or genetic modifications.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>
