However, the underlying mechanism remains incompletely understood. Herein, we demonstrate that RAB33A promoted metastasis by enhancing RhoC accumulation and that higher RAB33A expression predicted poorer prognosis in patients with cervical cancer. Mechanistically, RhoC typically degraded via canonical autophagy due to the binding of two LIR motifs (LC3 interaction region) in RhoC to LC3; however, RAB33A induced non-canonical autophagy, resulting in RhoC stabilization, which facilitated pseudopodia formation and consequently cervical cancer metastasis. The fusion of RAB33A-induced autophagosomes with lysosomes was impaired, as RAB33A inactivated RAB7 by interacting with TBC1D2A, a GTPase-activating protein that targets RAB7. Our findings reveal a pivotal role of the RAB33A-RhoC axis in cervical cancer metastasis, indicating that RhoC inhibitors may be beneficial for treating cervical cancer patients with high levels of RAB33A.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Macroautophagy</kwd><kwd>RHO signalling</kwd><kwd>Cervical cancer</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China (National Science Foundation of China)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>32370835</award-id><award-id>82303011</award-id><award-id>82030090</award-id><award-id>82341015</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Huo</surname><given-names>Lanqing</given-names></name><name><surname>Kang</surname><given-names>Tiebang</given-names></name><name><surname>Gao</surname><given-names>Ying</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100003999</institution-id><institution>Science Fund for Creative Research Groups (Fund for Creative Research Groups)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>82321003</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kang</surname><given-names>Tiebang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>National Key R&#x00026;D Program of China(2021YFA1300601),and the Cancer Innovative Research Program of Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center (PT22272101).</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Associazione Differenziamento e Morte Cellulare ADMC 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Cervical cancer is one of the most common gynecological malignancies, with approximately 600,000 new cases and 340,000 cervical cancer-related deaths worldwide each year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Although a treatment strategy based on concurrent chemoradiotherapy has improved local control and survival metrics, the prognosis of patients with cervical cancer remains poor; the 5-year mortality rate remains above 35%, and for patients with advanced-stage disease, this rate increases to nearly 50% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Notably, the primary obstacle to the effective management of cervical cancer is its distant metastasis, highlighting the urgent need for innovative strategies to overcome this challenge.</p><p id="Par3">The Rho subfamily, which includes RhoA, RhoB, and RhoC, plays a pivotal role in tumor metastasis by cycling between their activated (GTP-bound) and inactivated (GDP-bound) forms to modulate cytoskeletal activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Similarly, members of the Rab GTPase family, which localize to distinct subcellular compartments, orchestrate specific vesicular transport pathways to contribute to cancer metastasis by regulating multiple cellular processes, such as cytoskeletal dynamics, cell motility, and extracellular matrix remodeling. For instance, Rab31 promotes metastasis in gastric adenocarcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]; moreover, Rab22a-NeoFs increases RhoA-GTP by binding to SmgGDS-607, which is a GTP-GDP exchange factor for RhoA, thereby promoting osteosarcoma metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. On the other hand, members of the Rab GTPase family are also involved in the formation of autophagosomes, and this process is mainly regulated by the autophagy-related genes(ATG), especially ATG12, ATG5, and LC3-II complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Under normal conditions, canonical autophagosomes generally fuse with lysosomes to degrade damaged organelles, protein aggregates, and intracellular pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Non-canonical autophagy (NCA) typically proceeds without the involvement of certain ATG genes but effectively recruits LC3 molecules to diverse vacuoles, as exemplified by LC3-associated phagocytosis (LAP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], LC3-associated endocytosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], and entosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Notably, xenophagy and LAP, which are distinct autophagic processes, have been demonstrated to phagocytose invading pathogens and subsequently degrade them through lysosomal fusion, and these processes occur in an LC3-dependent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. However, disruptions in this balance can result in the accumulation of non-degradative autophagic vacuoles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], in which autophagosome&#x02013;lysosome fusion is compromised or lysosomal degradation becomes inefficient. The resulting accumulation of damaged cellular factors potentially leads to disease onset and progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Autophagy can facilitate cancer cell resistance to factors such as nutrient scarcity and hypoxia, which are prevalent in the tumor milieu, but aberrant autophagy might induce tumor cell apoptosis and/or metastasis, providing potential therapeutic opportunities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The multifaceted role of autophagy in oncogenesis, especially in cervical cancer, may lead to the development of new treatment strategies.</p><p id="Par4">In this report, we demonstrated that the binding of RhoC to LC3 occurs via its LIR motif, and this interaction leads to its degradation via the canonical autophagic lysosomal pathway normally. However, RAB33A inactivates RAB7, thereby inducing non-canonical autophagy to promote the accumulation of the RhoC protein, which in turn induces pseudopodia formation to promote cervical cancer metastasis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Cell culture</title><p id="Par5">The human HeLa, SiHa, and HEK-293T cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC).

As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>, RhoC is degraded via canonical autophagy in nonmetastatic cervical cancer cells, and this process depends on two LIR motifs in RhoC. Conversely, in highly metastatic cervical cancer cells, RAB33A is overexpressed and induces non-canonical autophagy, recruiting TBC1D2A to inactivate RAB7, thereby inhibiting the fusion of RAB33A-induced autophagosomes with lysosomes. Consequently, in this case, RhoC accumulates through a noncanonical autophagy pathway, resulting in an increase in the formation of both linear and lamellar pseudopods, which in turn enhances cell migration, invasion, and metastasis. Our findings reveal the crucial role of the RAB33A-RhoC axis in cervical cancer metastasis and indicate that Rho inhibitors, such as fasudil hydrochloride, may benefit a subset of cervical cancer patients.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><title>The proposed model for the RAB33A-RhoC axis in the metastasis of cervical cancer.</title><p>In cervical cancer cells, RAB33A induces the formation of non-canonical autophagosomes and inhibits the fusion of autophagosomes and lysosomes by inactivating RAB7. This enables the accumulation of RhoC, which is degraded through the autophagy-lysosome pathway within the cell. The excess RhoC is transported to the cell membrane, altering cell morphology and promoting metastasis.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41419_2025_7455_Fig6_HTML" id="d33e1084"/></fig></p><p id="Par36">Given that Rho family members play crucial roles in metastasis, regulating the stability of these proteins is of paramount importance. For instance, the endolysosomal catabolism of RhoB depends on its C-terminal configuration and lipidic alterations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], whereas RhoA undergoes ubiquitin&#x02012;proteasome degradation, which is regulated by the SCF (FBXL19) E3 ligase and Erk2-mediated phosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. In this report, we showed that RhoC is degraded by an autophagic pathway via its interaction with LC3 through two LIR motifs. Interestingly, the LIR motif is also present in both the RhoA and RhoB proteins, and their levels were modestly increased by RAB33A overexpression in cervical cancer cells. These findings suggest that RhoA and RhoB may similarly undergo degradation via autophagy.</p><p id="Par37">The formation of autophagosomes occurs through both canonical and non-canonical pathways. Canonical autophagy involves the participation of all ATGs, whereas non-canonical autophagy does not require the hierarchical involvement of ATGs, particularly BECN1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. The primary phospholipid component in canonical autophagosomes is PI3P [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], whereas the phospholipid composition of non-canonical autophagosomes varies. For example, in RAB22A-induced non-canonical autophagosomes, the predominant phospholipid is PI4P, and such autophagosomes fuse with early endosomes to form Rafeesomes, whose inner vesicles become extracellular vesicles as R-EV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. RAB33A-induced non-canonical autophagosomes, whose specific phospholipid components are being explored in our laboratory, do not fuse with lysosomes, and we hypothesize that these autophagosomes may fuse with the cell membrane, as the amount of active RhoC localized to the membrane is increased by RAB33A overexpression in cells.</p><p id="Par38">The degradation process is a fundamental feature of the autophagic pathway and involves both bulk and selective degradation of cellular components. Degradative autophagy is essential for maintaining protein homeostasis and the physiological function of cells, and it plays a crucial role in the regulation of energy metabolism, the development of metabolic tissues, and the pathogenesis of metabolic disorders such as obesity and diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. The induction of autophagy can eliminate damaged mitochondria, thereby inhibiting the generation of tumor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. In contrast, nondegradative autophagy, as exemplified by the ATG5-ATG12/ATG16L1 protein complex, plays a pivotal role in the antiviral effect of interferon gamma against murine norovirus. Viruses and bacteria adeptly evade degradation and induce nondegradative autophagy while simultaneously harnessing autophagic vacuoles to support their survival, replication, and dissemination. For example, Kaposi&#x02019;s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus interacts with Rubicon and inhibits the fusion of the autophagosome with lysosome to enhance viral replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Similarly, Poliovirus induces nondegradative autophagy to form double-membrane vesicles to promote its replication. Importantly, the impairment of genes central to autophagosome formation differs from the loss of function of genes involved in autophagosome maturation, with the latter leading to milder defects and more gradual accumulation of autophagic vacuoles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Additional pharmacological agents can induce nondegradative autophagy. AMDE-1 has emerged as a bifunctional compound that plays dual roles in both the activation and inhibition of autophagy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Furthermore, the inhibition of lysosomal function triggers autophagy through a feedback mechanism that results in the downregulation of mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Notably, RAB33A can not only induce autophagy but also concurrently inhibit the degradation process of autophagy, which is similar to the dual roles of AMDE-1 in autophagy. In addition, secretory autophagy represents another nondegradative function of the autophagy machinery.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary information</title><p>
