The Theory of Change identified overall impact of improved care and quality of life, through improved identification of symptoms and concerns and improved communication between healthcare teams.

Logistical, resource and staffing barriers must be addressed, alongside the development of a detailed implementation plan. Analysis of workshop transcripts identified seven themes relating to the domains of Normalisation Process Theory: education and information needs, the importance of a tailored approach, stakeholder engagement and the role of champions, healthcare records and IT system support requirements, improved health outcomes, improved experience of care and evidence for service provision, development, evaluation and expansion</p></sec><sec id="section6-02692163251331165"><title>Conclusion:</title><p>Future work should pilot test the Theory of Change and Implementation Plan.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Pediatrics</kwd><kwd>palliative care</kwd><kwd>children</kwd><kwd>implementation science</kwd><kwd>patient reported outcome measures</kwd><kwd>patient-centred outcomes research</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group specific-use="FundRef"><award-group id="award1-02692163251331165"><funding-source id="funding1-02692163251331165">

Considerations that are specific to this population and context relate to the importance of ensuring C-POS:UK is implemented in a way that enables children to self-report their own health outcomes and that it equally engages both the child and their family members. This must be carefully considered in relation to delivery mode, as well as how the results are shared and stored across services, including issues relating to data privacy.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr16-02692163251331165" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>
</sup></p><p>As with all complex interventions, the implementation of the C-POS:UK is context-specific, and this Theory of Change has been developed for a specific healthcare context &#x02013; paediatric palliative care provided in UK National Health Service hospitals. We recommend a similar method (i.e. Theory of Change) is applied in further care delivery settings such as community and hospice.</p><p>As far as we are aware, this is the first time that Theory of Change workshops have been conducted through multiple small group workshops and using a mix of synchronous and asynchronous methods. During the time-period in which the workshops were run, there were multiple strains on paediatric healthcare services in the UK including a scarlet fever outbreak and nursing and junior doctor strikes. This led us to take the decision to take an asynchronous approach to the professional workshops. This approach allowed professionals to engage in the workshops at a time that would work best for them.</p><p>For parents/carers, we ran synchronous workshops at different times and days (without the requirement to attend all workshops) which provided parents/carers greater opportunity to participate. The small groups also provided more privacy for parents/carers to share their experiences, compared to the larger groups more typical of traditional Theory of Change workshops. The small groups also enabled the research team to probe participants&#x02019; answers and suggestions, to better understand their thoughts and reasoning. This novel approach has advanced Theory of Change methodology, providing evidence that different modes of engagement can produce robust Theory of Change development and enable engagement with stakeholder groups who may otherwise have not been able to participate.</p><p>Whilst several methods for selecting implementation strategies have been proposed,<sup>
<xref rid="bibr54-02692163251331165" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>
</sup> they typically rely on theory and/or existing research. However, there is very limited existing research into implementing an outcome measure into paediatric palliative care.<sup><xref rid="bibr15-02692163251331165" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="bibr25-02692163251331165" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> As such this study took a stakeholder-driven approach, to identify key considerations for implementation that were developed into strategies. We found this approach feasible and our systematic reporting, could enable this approach to be replicated in future research to develop implementation strategies where there is limited evidence.</p></sec><sec id="section43-02692163251331165"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>The sample is a potential limitation of this study. Only a quarter of the parent/carer participants were fathers. This is in line with much of the existing paediatric palliative care research, where fathers are often underrepresented (mothers made up 75% of samples across 45 studies).<sup>
<xref rid="bibr55-02692163251331165" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>
</sup> Additionally, the majority of the parent/carers were white British. This is a limitation as in the UK life-limiting conditions are more prevalent in children from Pakistani, Asian and Black backgrounds.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr56-02692163251331165" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>
