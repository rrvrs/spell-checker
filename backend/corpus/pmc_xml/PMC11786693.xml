There are two types of lung cancer: small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) which account for around 85&#x000a0;% of all lung cancers [<xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p id="p0045">Adenocarcinomas may present on imaging as bilateral nodular, interstitial, or ground glass opacities, or less commonly, as unilateral solid or ground glass nodules, or masses. When there is no history of smoking, these opacities could be initially misinterpreted as inflammatory or infectious or other any pulmonary diseases like interstitial lung disease, which frequently delays the diagnosis [<xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) encompass a diverse group of diffuse parenchymal lung disorders with overlapping radiologic and clinical features, making differentiation from malignancy challenging. Accurate and prompt diagnosis is crucial, as delays in identifying malignancy, such as lung adenocarcinoma, can adversely affect patient outcomes. A tissue biopsy is the definitive diagnostic tool, providing critical histopathological evidence to distinguish between benign and malignant conditions, ensuring appropriate management [<xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p id="p0050">We present a challenging diagnostic case of a 35-year-old female non-smoker who exhibited diffuse pulmonary infiltrates on imaging. Despite initial suspicion of ILD, further investigations revealed a diagnosis of primary lung adenocarcinoma with acinar and micropapillary features. This case underscores the diagnostic complexities associated with primary lung adenocarcinoma, which can manifest as bilateral interstitial infiltrates, often resembling various pulmonary diseases. While typical lung cancer presentations are generally straightforward to identify, atypical presentations can significantly complicate the diagnostic process.</p></sec><sec id="s0010"><label>2</label><title>Case presentation</title><p id="p0055">A 35-year-old Palestinian female non-smoker, previously healthy, presented with a six-month history of progressive cough, mild hemoptysis, increasing fatigue, and dyspnea with mild-to-moderate exertion, without any associated weight loss. On admission, her vital signs were stable, and her BMI was 23.4. She is a housewife with no history of chronic illnesses, surgeries, or drug use and no occupational exposure to toxins. Her family history was unremarkable. Physical examination showed clear lungs with good bilateral air entry on auscultation and no abnormalities in the cardiovascular, abdominal, or neurological systems. There was no lymphadenopathy, clubbing, cyanosis, or peripheral edema, and the overall examination was normal. The patient sought treatment for her cough over several months from various specialists. Afterward, she was referred to a pulmonologist, whose high-resolution chest CT scan indicated bilateral reticulonodular infiltrates with cystic changes suggestive of interstitial lung disease (ILD) (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Pulmonary function tests showed forced vital capacity (FVC) of 1.63&#x000a0;l, forced expiratory volume in 1&#x000a0;s (FEV1) of 1.64&#x000a0;l, and an FVC/FEV1 ratio of 1.01. Based on these findings, the patient was admitted for bronchoscopy to further evaluate the possibility of ILD, but the procedure revealed normal right and left bronchi with no endobronchial lesions or active hemoptysis. Laboratory tests, including complete blood count and comprehensive metabolic panel, were normal except for an elevated CRP of 8.9. Bronchoalveolar lavage and multiple transbronchial biopsies from the right upper and middle lobes were performed for histopathological analysis. The patient later developed an iatrogenic right-sided pneumothorax, which was confirmed on chest X-ray (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). A right posterolateral chest tube was placed, and the pneumothorax resolved the following day. Cytology and pathology revealed fragments of moderately-to-poorly differentiated pulmonary adenocarcinoma with acinar and micropapillary features. Tumor cells were positive for TTF1 immunostaining (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>).<fig id="f0005"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>CT chest axial images showing diffuse bilateral interstitial infiltrates, intermixed with ground glass infiltrates and some cystic changes.</p></caption><alt-text id="al0005">Fig. 1</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="gr1" id="lk0005"/></fig><fig id="f0010"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>chest X-ray (CXR) showing a right pneumothorax, prominent diffuse bilateral interstitial alveolar opacities.</p></caption><alt-text id="al0010">Fig. 2</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="gr2" id="lk0010"/></fig><fig id="f0015"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Moderately differentiated pulmonary adenocarcinoma with micropapillary component; A.

The patient underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS), which included a wedge resection from the right middle lobe and a biopsy from the right upper lobe, further confirming moderately-to-poorly differentiated pulmonary adenocarcinoma. A pericardial window was also created. Genetic testing identified a pathogenic ERBB (HER2) mutation, while KRAS and ALK were negative.</p><p id="p0065">The patient completed 10&#x000a0;cycles of chemotherapy with carboplatin and pemetrexed. After six months, she reported no improvement in her symptoms, including persistent hemoptysis. A comparison of CT scans revealed disease progression, with an increase in the size and number of bilateral pulmonary nodules, characterized by ground-glass opacities and diffuse septal thickening. There were also multiple bilateral pulmonary cysts up to 13&#x000a0;mm, apical fibrotic changes, and mild right-sided pleural effusion.</p></sec><sec id="s0015"><label>3</label><title>Discussion</title><p id="p0070">Lung adenocarcinoma represents about 40&#x000a0;% of all lung cancers and is associated with a high mortality rate. It commonly spreads to the liver, adrenal glands, brain, and bones, but rarely to soft tissues [<xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. It is the most common primary lung cancer in the United States and is a subtype of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). While strongly linked to smoking, it is also the most frequent lung cancer in individuals who have never smoked. Typically originating in the lung periphery, it often arises from mucosal glands and may develop in areas of scarring or chronic inflammation. Despite declining incidence and mortality rates, it remains the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the U.S [<xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. It presents with diverse clinical features, ranging from small solitary or multiple nodules to extensive miliary patterns or diffuse infiltrates resembling bacterial pneumonia. Its pathogenesis remains under investigation, but tumor proliferation is often accompanied by significant inflammation and fibrosis that mimic benign inflammatory conditions. This resemblance can delay diagnosis and negatively impact patients' quality of life [<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Retrospective studies show that younger lung cancer patients are more likely to present with adenocarcinoma, be female, and have advanced-stage disease [<xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p id="p0075">The ERBB2 (HER2) mutation in lung adenocarcinoma is a relatively uncommon alteration that is associated with aggressive tumor behavior, poor prognosis, and resistance to standard chemotherapy. This mutation results in the continuous activation of HER2 signaling pathways, which drive cell proliferation and survival. In cases like ours, the presence of this mutation can complicate diagnosis and delay treatment. However, targeted therapies such as trastuzumab-deruxtecan (T-DXd), neratinib, and trastuzumab have shown promising results in HER2-mutant lung cancer, leading to improved patient outcomes when compared to conventional therapies [<xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p id="p0080">Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths globally. Before the 2015 update to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification, lung adenocarcinoma was diagnosed based on acinar or tubular patterns, mucin production, and the expression of TTF-1 and Napsin A [<xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In 2015, the WHO adopted a new classification of lung adenocarcinoma based on histological subtypes [<xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Lung adenocarcinoma is classified based on the predominant histological pattern, with subtypes quantified in 5&#x000a0;% increments due to variability in both subtype and proportion. Prognosis varies significantly by subtype, even at the same stage. The lepidic predominant subtype, considered low-grade, has a favorable prognosis, while acinar and papillary subtypes are intermediate grade [<xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Acinar patterns prognosis are considered better than micropapillary, mucinous/colloid, and solid patterns, but worse than lepidic predominant patterns [<xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In contrast, micropapillary and solid predominant subtypes, which are high-grade patterns, are associated with a worse prognosis, even after curative resection in early-stage lung adenocarcinoma [<xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. High-grade patterns are linked to smoking, lymphatic vessel invasion (LVI), and nonground-glass opacity (GGO) lesions, all of which are important prognostic factors in lung cancer [<xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p id="p0085">Lung cancer can mimic various benign conditions, such as pneumonia, lung abscess, postinfectious scarring, atelectasis, mediastinal masses, emphysema, and granulomatous diseases. On computed tomography (CT), lung adenocarcinoma may present as ground-glass nodules, consolidative opacities, or solid mass lesions [<xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Lung cancer and ILD involve distinct biological pathways, though the precise genetic and cellular mechanisms linking these conditions remain poorly understood [<xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p id="p0090">The patient's initial presentation, characterized by bilateral interstitial and ground-glass opacities on imaging, pulmonary function tests indicative of an ILD pattern, and normal bronchoscopy findings, led to an initial misdiagnosis and treatment for ILD. The overlapping clinical and radiological features highlight the difficulty of differentiating malignancy from benign conditions, especially in the absence of overt risk factors or symptoms specific to lung cancer.</p><p id="p0095">The differential diagnosis of our case includes interstitial lung diseases (e.g., usual interstitial pneumonia, cryptogenic organizing pneumonia), infectious processes (e.g., atypical pneumonia, fungal infections), and malignancies that mimic ILD, such as lymphangitic carcinomatosis. Non-malignant mimics, such as drug-induced or hypersensitivity pneumonitis, should also be considered. Imaging, which can reveal patterns like ground-glass opacities or reticular infiltrates, and histological confirmation via biopsy are important diagnostic tools for differentiating between inflammatory, infectious, and neoplastic diseases.</p><p id="p0100">Cengiz et al. describe a 74-year-old male non-smoker presenting with progressive dyspnea and persistent cough. Imaging revealed bilateral interstitial changes in the lungs, initially suggestive of interstitial lung disease (ILD). However, a transthoracic lung biopsy showed histological features, including lepidic and micropapillary patterns, leading to a diagnosis of minimally invasive adenocarcinoma of the lung [<xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Similarly, Mehta et al. report a 59-year-old woman with a history of smoking and environmental exposures who presented with worsening respiratory symptoms, including dyspnea, cough, and weight loss. Initial findings pointed to ILD, and steroid therapy was initiated with limited improvement. A subsequent biopsy confirmed bronchoalveolar carcinoma characterized by a lepidic growth pattern and cuboidal cells lining the alveoli, establishing the diagnosis of primary lung adenocarcinoma [<xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p id="p0105">Further studies have provided valuable insights into micropapillary carcinoma. Hung et al. analyzed the prognostic significance of clinicopathological variables for metastasis-free survival in lung adenocarcinoma with distant metastases. Among 182 patients, common metastatic sites included contralateral lung (51.1&#x000a0;%), brain (44.5&#x000a0;%), bone (39.0&#x000a0;%), and liver (8.9&#x000a0;%). The micropapillary variant was strongly linked to brain metastasis (hazard ratio (HR), 2.686) and reduced brain MFS (HR, 2.186). This highlights the distinct metastatic patterns of lung adenocarcinoma subtypes and underscores the need for subtype-specific follow-up strategies. Further research is required to confirm these findings [<xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. A study by Luo et al. examined patients with stage IB invasive adenocarcinoma and found that adjuvant chemotherapy improved disease-free survival. Notably, in cases with micropapillary or solid patterns, adjuvant chemotherapy significantly enhanced DFS, although it did not lead to an improvement in overall survival. This highlights the potential benefit of chemotherapy in specific histological subtypes of lung adenocarcinoma [<xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="s0020"><label>4</label><title>Conclusion</title><p id="p0110">This case underscores the challenges in diagnosing primary lung adenocarcinoma when it presents as bilateral interstitial infiltrates, an uncommon presentation. The overlap of symptoms with interstitial lung disease necessitates a high index of suspicion, especially in non-smokers with unresponsive pulmonary symptoms. Clinicians should maintain a high level of suspicion and consider malignancy when presented with atypical pulmonary infiltrates, even in non-smokers. Prompt histopathological evaluation, including biopsy, is crucial for distinguishing malignancy from other conditions. Timely and precise diagnosis ensures proper treatment planning, reduces unnecessary interventions, and ultimately improves patient outcomes. Managing such cases requires a multidisciplinary approach, bringing together pulmonologists, oncologists, radiologists, and pathologists to ensure thorough evaluation and personalized treatment strategies. Increased familiarity with these rare manifestations of lung cancer will enhance diagnostic accuracy and optimize management, helping clinicians better navigate complex cases and provide more effective care.</p></sec><sec id="s0025"><title>Informed consent</title><p id="p0115">The patient provided written informed consent for the publication of this case report and associated images.
