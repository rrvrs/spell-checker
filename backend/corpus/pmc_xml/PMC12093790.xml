This study aimed to evaluate whether a two-week comprehensive general practice clerkship would improve C-CEP scores and to identify the specific training elements contributing to increased confidence in primary care, particularly in emergency responses.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">After obtaining ethical approval and written informed consent, fifth-year medical students at Sapporo Medical University who participated in two-week off-campus clerkships at external healthcare facilities (hospitals) during the 2023 academic year were included. Pre- and post-clerkship C-CEP scores were collected. Changes in the baseline and average scores were analyzed across facilities accepting more than four trainees. Text mining was conducted on students&#x02019; reflective portfolios from the facilities with significant findings to identify frequent and co-occurring words related to confidence-building activities.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">Out of 115 eligible participants, 97 students were included in the analysis (84.3% participation rate). The data from seven facilities accepting more than four trainees, representing 74 students in total, were analyzed. These facilities averaged 243 beds, were located 147&#x000a0;km from the medical school, and had an emergency admission rate of 84.6%. C-CEP scores showed significant improvement across all components post-clerkship (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05). Although pre-clerkship scores did not differ significantly across facilities, post-clerkship score increases varied. Multivariate analysis identified Facilities D and F as exhibiting significant differences in confidence improvement compared with the other facilities (R&#x000b2; = 0.20, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.0379). Text mining highlighted that Facility F emphasized active learning activities such as &#x0201c;interviews,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;examinations,&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;conferences,&#x0201d; whereas Facility D focused on passive activities such as &#x0201c;observation&#x0201d;, which were associated with limited impact on trainee confidence.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par4">The C-CEP effectively measured confidence improvements in primary care and emergency responses among fifth-year medical students following their clinical clerkships.

This inequitable distribution perpetuates health disparities and leads to reduced access to medical services and worsened health outcomes for residents of underserved areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. To mitigate these shortages, many nations have introduced preferential admission criteria, rural training programs, and financial incentives; however, their success hinges on the social identities and motivations of applicants and is often constrained by funding, regulatory barriers, institutional resistance, and issues of long-term sustainability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">Educational interventions, such as clinical training in rural settings, have been shown to significantly improve students&#x02019; patient-centered care skills. By interacting with patients in primary care facilities, students acquire practical skills to address real-world health challenges [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Medical schools have integrated rural health topics into their curricula and established rural medicine specialty tracks to prepare students for the unique challenges of practicing in these environments. Additionally, the integration of interprofessional education (IPE) and rural health education has been proposed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Evidence indicates that rural clinical training enhances medical students&#x02019; patient-centered care skills, understanding of community health, and interprofessional collaboration capabilities. Students who experience rural training tend to exhibit higher motivation to pursue careers in rural healthcare after graduation, making rural training a crucial tool for teaching students how to address community health challenges.</p><p id="Par7">The willingness to engage in rural healthcare appears to be rooted in students&#x02019; confidence in their own clinical skills, as supported by previous studies showing that higher self-efficacy in rural medical practice is associated with stronger intentions to pursue rural careers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Regarding students&#x02019; confidence in their clinical competencies, while clinical training improves students&#x02019; confidence in their clinical competencies, a report indicated that the location of the placement (urban, suburban, or rural) does not significantly influence the degree of confidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. This suggests that factors other than placement location may contribute to confidence building, highlighting the importance of identifying these factors. Thus, rural healthcare education and practice, which deepen students&#x02019; understanding of and confidence in rural healthcare, may promote career choices in rural medicine and consequently increase the number of healthcare professionals in rural areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">To further explore these challenges, there is a need for self-assessment tools that can capture aspects of learner development not addressed by traditional evaluations. Standard measures, such as written exams or clinical task logs, often fail to assess students&#x02019; subjective sense of preparedness and their confidence in applying knowledge to real-world settings. Since confidence is closely tied to motivation, clinical judgment, and career orientation, especially in underserved areas, tools like the C-CEP can fill this evaluative gap and provide actionable insights for improving clinical education. to evaluate the effectiveness of educational programs objectively and accurately. To address this need, we developed and validated a self-assessment tool, the Community-based assessment for Clinical and Emergency Practice (C-CEP), for medical students in the context of rural and emergency medicine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). This tool can be applied to measure changes in students&#x02019; confidence before and after primary care clinical training and to identify factors that enhance their confidence in rural healthcare. To avoid potential confusion between &#x0201c;community care&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;rural medicine,&#x0201d; it is important to clarify that in this study, &#x0201c;community care&#x0201d; refers to clinical experiences conducted at off-campus, non-tertiary facilities. These facilities are located outside the main university campus but do not necessarily meet standard definitions of &#x0201c;rural&#x0201d; based on population size or geographic remoteness. In this study, we use the term &#x0201c;primary care clinical training&#x0201d; to refer to educational experiences provided at non-tertiary, community-based facilities, many of which are located in rural or semi-rural settings. While &#x0201c;primary care&#x0201d; denotes a level of care focused on first-contact, comprehensive, and continuing services, it often overlaps with &#x0201c;rural healthcare&#x0201d; in practice due to the nature of training environments situated outside urban academic centers. Therefore, although the background of this study emphasizes rural healthcare, the scope of training described includes both the functional aspects of primary care and the geographical aspects of rural medical practice. The focus of this study is therefore on community-based experiential learning, rather than evaluating outcomes related to rural health workforce distribution. This study aimed to evaluate whether rural clinical training improves medical students&#x02019; confidence, addressing the educational gap of lacking tools to monitor subjective changes in learner confidence&#x02014;particularly in the context of rural placements in rural healthcare, including emergency care, as assessed by their C-CEP scores, and to identify the attributes of clinical training and education that contribute to increased confidence in rural healthcare.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design and participants</title><p id="Par9">This cohort study was conducted among fifth-year medical students participating in two-week clinical clerkships at external healthcare facilities as part of the General Medicine program during the 2023 academic year at Sapporo Medical University. Students were placed at 21 non-tertiary community facilities, varying in geography and demography (e.g., small towns and peri-urban settings), with each facility hosting approximately 2&#x02013;6 students depending on capacity. Facilities were assigned based on availability and preferences. In the context of this study, &#x0201c;community facilities&#x0201d; are defined as off-campus, non-tertiary care facilities where students engage in clinical clerkships. These facilities vary in their geographic and demographic profiles, including small towns and peri-urban locations, and are not necessarily classified as &#x0201c;rural&#x0201d; by national standards.</p></sec><sec id="Sec210"><title>Educational Interventions and Clinical Training Structure</title><p id="Par10">The two-week clerkship aimed to foster the following learning objectives:</p><p id="Par11">

The portfolios were written in Japanese and followed a daily reflection format, assessing content depth, specificity, and personal insight. Translations were conducted by the authors and reviewed through academic proofreading. Notably, the term &#x0201c;&#x0898b;&#x05b66;&#x0201d; was automatically translated to &#x0201c;inspection&#x0201d; in word cloud analysis; this was manually corrected to &#x0201c;observation&#x0201d; to reflect clinical meaning.</p><p id="Par18">Students completed the C-CEP scale before and after the program.

Portfolios followed the Significant Event Analysis (SEA) model, emphasizing significant realizations, accomplishments, challenges, and emotional responses. Feedbacks were provided by supervising physicians, which were not included in the analysis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Quantitative analysis of C-CEP scores</title><p id="Par19">We used the validated 15-item version of the C-CEP without modification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). This self-assessment scale employs a 1&#x02013;5 Likert scale (1&#x02013; strongly disagree; 5&#x02013; strongly agree) and consists of four domains: &#x0201c;Attitudes and Communication in Emergency Care&#x0201d; (items 1&#x02013;3), &#x0201c;Basic Clinical Skills&#x0201d; (items 4&#x02013;7), &#x0201c;Knowledge Related to Community Healthcare&#x0201d; (items 9&#x02013;13), and &#x0201c;Knowledge in Evidence-Based Medicine&#x0201d; (items 8, 14, 15). The scale has demonstrated strong psychometric properties, including high internal consistency (McDonald&#x02019;s &#x003c9;&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;0.70) and excellent model fit indices (CFI&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.979, RMSEA&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.045) in prior validation studies. In this study, changes in total and domain-specific C-CEP scores before and after the clerkship were analyzed using paired t-tests (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05). For facilities that accepted four or more students during the study period, contextual variables were included in multivariate linear regression models: number of facility beds, emergency acceptance status, distance from Sapporo Medical University, geographic location, and the population of the surrounding city. To reduce selection bias, all eligible facilities were analyzed regardless of their emergency care capacity. As a result, Facility C&#x02014;despite not accepting emergency cases&#x02014;was included in the dataset. Group comparisons were further informed by exploratory t-tests to identify optimal cut-off points for explanatory variables. Boxplots were used to visualize score distributions, highlighting not only central trends but also the presence of outliers and students who experienced decreased confidence post-clerkship. In the multivariate linear regression model, the variable &#x0201c;facility&#x0201d; was treated as a categorical factor using dummy coding. Facility H was set as the reference category; therefore, estimates for Facility H are not explicitly displayed in the model output, and all other facility coefficients represent differences relative to Facility H.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Qualitative text mining of reflective portfolios</title><p id="Par20">Portfolios were text-mined using AI-based software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.userlocal.jp">https://www.userlocal.jp</ext-link>) to analyze frequent words (nouns and verbs) and word co-occurrence patterns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The text mining results from trainees at facilities with notable C-CEP outcomes (e.g., Facilities D and F) were compared to identify reflective language differences. Text mining focused on noun and verb extraction from Japanese portfolios, with separate analyses for students at Facilities D and F. Additionally, word clouds were generated from the processed texts to intuitively visualize frequently used terms. These word clouds did not rely solely on raw frequency counts, but instead used frequency scores adjusted to exclude high-frequency, low-informational general terms (e.g., &#x0201c;do,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;think,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;go&#x0201d;). This refinement allowed for a more meaningful representation of content-relevant expressions. Word clouds were generated based on frequency scores, excluding low-informational general terms. Corrections were made for key translation errors during the English rendering process. These visualizations offered insights into differences in reflective language and learning emphasis across institutions. Separate visualizations were created for Facilities D and F to highlight institutional differences in reflective language patterns. Text mining provided insights into the linguistic patterns associated with the portfolio reflections, facilitating a deeper understanding of the educational impact of the clerkships.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Statistical tools</title><p id="Par21">All statistical analyses, including t-tests, one-way ANOVA for univariate comparisons involving three or more groups, and multivariate regression modeling were conducted using JMP<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Pro 17.0.0, with <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05 considered to be significant.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Participant demographics</title><p id="Par22">Out of 115 potential participants in the general practice clinical education program, 97 students were included in the analysis (84.3% participation rate).

In contrast, &#x0201c;rural healthcare&#x0201d; refers to medical practice in geographically underserved areas, which often present distinct logistical and educational challenges. Our study primarily examined community-based clinical education conducted at non-tertiary hospitals, located in either rural or peri-urban settings.</p><p id="Par40">This study confirmed that the Community-based assessment for Clinical and Emergency Practice (C-CEP) tool effectively detected improvements in medical students&#x02019; confidence, particularly in emergency care, following a two-week general practice clerkship. Moreover, the C-CEP highlighted differences between training sites, based on both score improvements and reflective portfolio content, demonstrating its utility as a formative tool for program evaluation and improvement.</p><p id="Par41">Text mining of reflective portfolios revealed that active participation&#x02014;such as patient interviews, examinations, and interprofessional conference attendance&#x02014;was strongly associated with confidence gains. In contrast, passive observation contributed less or even negatively. These findings support earlier work suggesting that experiential learning fosters stronger engagement and skill development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p id="Par42">Importantly, learner confidence plays a key role in shaping clinical behavior and future career paths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Recent studies in Australia and Japan have shown that students with higher self-efficacy for rural healthcare are more likely to pursue careers in underserved areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. This suggests that building confidence is not only an educational goal but also a practical strategy for workforce distribution.

This allowed for a more nuanced understanding of how and why confidence changed across training sites. Notably, students at Facility F showed marked confidence gains, while those at Facility D experienced declines&#x02014;likely reflecting the degree of active engagement permitted.</p><p id="Par44">While the majority of students reported increased confidence, some experienced declines. This may reflect the transition to &#x0201c;conscious incompetence,&#x0201d; where learners become aware of their limitations through exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Such decreases should not be interpreted as failure, but as critical moments for professional growth and self-reflection.</p><p id="Par45">In this context, self-assessment tools like the C-CEP can serve a dual function: monitoring educational effectiveness and identifying students who may benefit from targeted support. Prior research suggests that such tools promote self-directed learning and reflective practice, and better prepare students for clinical realities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p id="Par46">Our findings also underscore the broader educational and policy implications of measuring learner confidence. Confidence&#x02014;as captured by the C-CEP&#x02014;is closely linked to clinical competence, motivation, and career intentions, particularly in underserved areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Traditional evaluation methods, such as satisfaction surveys or task completion lists, often fall short in capturing subjective learning outcomes and may be prone to bias. In contrast, confidence-based self-assessment offers an honest and practical perspective with minimal burden on supervisors.</p><p id="Par47">The variation in confidence scores across facilities reinforces the need to examine instructional design. Facility F, which fostered participatory and hands-on learning, contributed positively, while Facility D, characterized by observational learning, was associated with diminished confidence. This highlights the importance of providing authentic clinical engagement opportunities during clerkships.</p><p id="Par48">Moreover, a decline in confidence during regional placements could paradoxically dissuade students from pursuing careers in community medicine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Thus, programs should incorporate structured support systems&#x02014;such as debriefings, mentoring, and feedback&#x02014;to ensure these experiences reinforce rather than hinder interest in community-oriented careers.</p><p id="Par49">Future studies should clearly differentiate between the effects of rural placements and those of broader community-based training environments. Understanding these nuances will better inform educational strategies aiming to address physician maldistribution.</p></sec><sec id="Sec248"><title>Limitations</title><p id="Par50">This study has several limitations. Comparisons between training sites were constrained by variations in student numbers, gender distribution, consent rates, and portfolio availability. Additionally, it was conducted at a single medical university, limiting the generalizability of findings. Multi-institutional studies, including learners at various training stages (e.g., residents, fellows), are needed to validate the broader applicability of the C-CEP.</p><p id="Par51">While confidence is linked to motivation and willingness to work in underserved areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], it remains unclear whether confidence gains translate into long-term behavioral change.

The C-CEP scale effectively measured confidence improvements among fifth-year medical students following their clinical clerkships. The C-CEP scale&#x02019;s ability to detect inter-facility differences highlights its potential to inform and refine clinical education programs, ensuring more targeted and effective training. The ability to capture differences between training facilities enables insights into effective training elements and supports the design and enhancement of clinical education programs. Thus, the use of the C-CEP supports the educational need to enhance learner confidence in community-based medical education.</p><p id="Par54">Participatory activities play a critical role in fostering motivation for healthcare delivery in underserved and resource-limited regions. While this study demonstrated the potential value of the C-CEP in measuring the confidence-building effects of various educational interventions, further research is needed to expand its application to other institutions, explore its utility across diverse levels of medical training, and assess its long-term impact on learners&#x02019; career choices and motivation to work in remote areas.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.</p><p>
