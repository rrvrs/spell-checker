cell based
on 1.5 &#x003bc;m-width grooves that are embossed into a plastic film
whose opposing &#x0201c;walls&#x0201d; are selectively coated with either
n- or p-type contacts. A perovskite precursor solution is then deposited
into the grooves, creating individual photovoltaic devices. Each groove
device is series-connected to its neighbors, creating minimodules
consisting of hundreds of connected grooves. Here, we report on the
fabrication of groove-based devices using slot-die coating to deposit
the perovskite precursor and explore the structure of the perovskite
in the grooves using a range of microscopy and spectroscopy techniques.
Significantly, our devices do not contain any expensive or scarce
elements such as indium, indicating that this technology is both sustainable
and low-cost. Furthermore, all coating processes explored here were
performed using roll-to-roll processing techniques. Our technology
is therefore completely scalable and is consistent with high-throughput,
low-cost manufacturing.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Perovskite</kwd><kwd>solar cell</kwd><kwd>back-contact</kwd><kwd>scaled</kwd><kwd>roll-to-roll</kwd><kwd>commercialization</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Research Councils UK</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="doi">10.13039/501100000266</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EP/M028437/1</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Innovate UK</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="doi">10.13039/501100006041</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EEF7018</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Innovate UK</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="doi">10.13039/501100006041</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>40900</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>European Commission</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="doi">10.13039/501100000781</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>854126</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Research Councils UK</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="doi">10.13039/501100000266</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EP/V055127/1</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Research Councils UK</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="doi">10.13039/501100000266</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EP/V034804/1</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Research Councils UK</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="doi">10.13039/501100000266</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EP/V027131/1</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Research Councils UK</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="doi">10.13039/501100000266</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EP/T012455/1</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-old-9</meta-name><meta-value>ae4c02734</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-new-14</meta-name><meta-value>ae4c02734</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>ccc-price</meta-name><meta-value/></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Solar cells based on metal-halide perovskites
have undergone rapid
development in recent years, with their power conversion efficiencies
(PCE) increasing from 3.8% to over 26%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref></sup> Such high efficiencies are the result of low exciton binding energies,
long charge-carrier diffusion lengths and band gaps that are tunable
to near IR wavelengths.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref></sup> As perovskites have intrinsically low materials processing
costs, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) now appear to be a potential
future competitor to devices based on silicon.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref></sup></p><p>Almost all PSC devices reported are based on a planar layer-by-layer
architecture that is deposited on a transparent conductive oxide (TCO)
coated substrate. While such devices can have very high efficiencies,
they also have limitations. For example, parasitic optical absorption
within the charge transporting and contact layers can reduce the maximum
attainable short-circuit current (<italic>J</italic><sub>sc</sub>).
Each layer in a multilayer stack must also be deposited from a solvent
that is orthogonal to the preceding layers to avoid their resolubilization;
this can limit the range of solvents available to process devices
and reduce the range of processing conditions that can be used. Planar
architecture PSCs typically also include TCOs such as Indium Tin Oxide
(ITO) as their light-facing electrode. Although ITO combines high
conductivity and transparency, supplies of ITO are at increasing risk
due to the growing scarcity of indium and current world geopolitics.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></sup> We note that indium is primarily extracted as a byproduct of zinc
mining and is currently valued at around $670/kg, compared to $16/kg
for nickel, another commonly used conductor. If the demand for indium
exceeds that of zinc, it will be necessary to directly mine indium;
a process that is less economically viable and is likely to further
inflate materials costs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></sup> Indeed, if PSC production
were to increase to a point where the global photovoltaic fleet provided
terawatts of power per year, the annual production of indium would
need to increase by 200%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref></sup> Though alternatives
to ITO exist and have been used in solar-cell devices (such as fluorine-doped
tin oxide [FTO]), these materials often require high deposition temperatures,
making them incompatible with deposition onto flexible plastic substrates.
High process temperatures also increase both production time and cost.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref></sup> For such reasons, there is significant interest
in the development of solar cell technologies that do not rely on
a steady supply of indium.</p><p>Back-contact solar cells represent
an alternative to traditional
planar architecture devices. In general, back-contact devices have
all electrode and transport layers positioned at the rear of the device,
with the active layer at the front of the device thus directly absorbing
incident light. This type of structure has the advantage of potentially
eliminating parasitic optical absorbance from device contacts and
charge transport layers. Back-contact architectures were initially
developed for silicon solar cells in the 1970s and were first used
in perovskite solar cells in 2016, with a PCE of 6.5% reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref></sup> Here, devices were composed of &#x0201c;fingers&#x0201d; of a hole
transport layer that were electrically isolated from a planar electron
transport layer, with a perovskite coating the whole structure. In
the following years, several back-contact PSC architectures have been
demonstrated, including interdigitated, quasi-interdigitated, honeycomb
and groove.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref></sup></p><p>A key issue in the development of back-contact PSCs is the
necessity
to physically separate electron and hole transport layers by a distance
that is commensurate with charge-carrier diffusion lengths, typically
a few hundred nanometers in perovskites.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref></sup> If charge contacts are separated
by a distance greater than this, device efficiency is reduced due
to charge-carrier recombination losses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref></sup> Thus, back-contact perovskite devices will require the use of submicron
scale lithography techniques to define charge contacts, with this
process being scalable for high-volume manufacture. Several lithography
techniques have so far been explored; for example, the use of a self-assembly
technique has been used to produce a honeycomb structured back-contact
PSC in which the distance between each pore was approximately 7 &#x003bc;m.
This design allowed devices to be created having champion PCEs of
11.2%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref></sup> Further progress was made by the
same group using cracked film lithography, where a lift-off technique
was used to fill the cracks in a tin oxide film with nickel oxide
and an insulator. When used in a back-contact configuration, PSCs
were realized with reverse sweep efficiencies of over 6%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref></sup> In the same year, Deng et al. used lithography
with polystyrene microspheres adsorbed onto a tin oxide film to template
a honeycomb structure that could then be used as an evaporation mask
for an insulating layer and a top electrode. This method produced
back-contact devices with a PCE of 8.9%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref></sup> Of the various commonly used deposition techniques used to create
back-contact devices, only one has been reported that involves the
use of a truly scalable process (slot-die coating) with devices fabricated
having PCEs of 0.18%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref></sup></p><p>In 2019,
we reported a novel back-contact architecture based on
a V-shaped microgroove structure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref></sup> In
brief, 1.6 &#x003bc;m wide grooves were embossed into a plastic film
and had electrodes and transport layers coated onto their opposing
walls, with a perovskite then coated over the film surface. Using
this structure, single groove efficiencies were demonstrated with
a PCE of 7.03%, and serially connected micromodules comprising 16
grooves achieved a PCE of 2.63%.</p><p>In this work, we make a significant
advance on our previous work
and demonstrate a significant scale-up of our technology, creating
micromodules composed of up to 362 serially connected grooves. Such
devices also have significantly enhanced performance, realizing stabilized
PCEs of up to 12.8%. This enhancement in performance has resulted
from a detailed device optimization program in which a large parameter
space relating to both the preparation of the patterned substrate
and the techniques used to deposit the perovskite has been explored.</p><p>Here, we discuss the use of a range of techniques to explore the
structure and operation of our devices to verify the structure of
the electrodes and charge-transport layers deposited onto the opposing
groove walls, including Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and nanofocus
X-ray fluorescence (XRF) mapping. This latter technique, together
with Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) allows us to characterize the crystallinity,
topography, and size of perovskite grains within the grooves. We also
explore photocurrent generation via photocurrent mapping and fluorescence
decay lifetime measurements and use this to understand the functionality
of the devices. Critically, we also show that the flexible, back-contact
perovskite solar module devices we create can be fabricated using
fully scalable, roll-to-roll deposition processes. Significantly,
all techniques used in the processing of groove-based modules, including
embossing, are fully compatible with upscaled manufacture, with the
titanium and nickel metal contacts used here being significantly cheaper
than Indium.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>Groove Structure and Fabrication</title><p>The structure of the
devices explored here is schematically illustrated in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>d. Briefly, fabrication begins
with a PET: acrylic roll onto which a series of 1.5 &#x003bc;m-width
grooves are embossed using a UV-curable acrylic. As we describe below,
the back-contact architecture developed is based on coating opposing
groove walls with electron- or hole-selective contacts. Here, the
effective collection of charges without significant recombination
effects requires the physical separation of the opposing contacts
to be commensurate with typical carrier diffusion lengths. In the
perovskite used in our devices (MAPbI<sub>3</sub>), a range of carrier
diffusion lengths have been reported, ranging from 0.1 to 2 &#x003bc;m,
with this length being dependent on process conditions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref></sup> In an ideal structure, the widths of the grooves would match carrier
diffusion lengths, however, creating submicron features over large
areas is challenging. We have therefore adopted a groove width of
around 1.5 &#x003bc;m; empirically we find this both results in efficient
charge-carrier extraction and allows grooves to be reliably embossed
over large areas having a consistent width and feature size.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Schematic of

under a commercial
contract. In contrast to our previous work in which we used substrates
embossed with a V-shaped groove, here we use grooves that have a U-shaped
cross-section.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref></sup> This change in groove
structure was based on the finding that U-shaped grooves are generally
easier to emboss with high fidelity. This embossed roll was then loaded
into a vacuum deposition chamber on a spool and was passed at a web
speed of 5&#x02013;15 mm/s in front of a series of deposition sources.
Here, the coating selectivity of either wall was achieved using a
directional deposition technique as shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>b,c. To do this, an evaporation source was
oriented at an oblique angle to the surface. This resulted in a &#x0201c;self-shading&#x0201d;
effect that allowed each side of the groove walls to be coated by
a contact material without coating the opposing wall, as previously
reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref></sup> When selecting contact materials,
it was necessary to identify materials having suitable electronic
properties that could be deposited by either electron-beam (e-beam)
or thermal evaporation. Attention was also paid to materials that
were known to form stable contacts with perovskites, had low cost
(to be compatible with a high-throughput manufacturing process), and
did not require any high-temperature processes to be compatible with
plastic substrates. For these reasons, we avoided commonly used contact
materials such as gold, silver and ITO due to their cost, stability
and processing requirements, respectively.</p><p>The n-type (electron
extracting) contact deposited was composed
of a Ti/SnO<sub>2</sub>/C<sub>60</sub> multilayer, with the p-type
(hole extracting) contact composed of Ni/NiO. All metals and metal
oxides were deposited using e-beam evaporation with the SnO<sub>2</sub> and NiO deposited by a reactive deposition in which a low partial
pressure of oxygen was maintained in the chamber to oxidize the deposited
material.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref></sup> The n-type contact also incorporated a C<sub>60</sub> layer deposited by thermal evaporation to enhance electron
extraction. Here, an additional SnO<sub>2</sub> layer was included
(which was not present in our previous work) to prevent undesirable
reactions between titanium and C<sub>60</sub>, with these reactions
occurring at low temperature and in the solid state.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref></sup> Such reactions have been demonstrated to form amorphous
titanium carbide which can result in the passivation of metals against
corrosion, thus likely fouling metal electrodes in electronic devices
causing increased series resistance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref></sup></p><p>As can be seen in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>c, there is an overlap between the metal contacts of neighboring
grooves at the apex of each groove. This creates a serial electrical
connection between the grooves; a feature that&#x02013;as we show below&#x02013;allows
us to create discrete minimodules that we term &#x0201c;cascades&#x0201d;.
In the experiments described below, we have explored cascades composed
of either 50 or 362 series-connected grooves; with the number of grooves
in a cascade defined by the layout of the pattern initially embossed
onto the plastic roll. Note that the substrate was also patterned
with so-called &#x0201c;delineation features&#x0201d;. These consist
of a set of deeper grooves that separate cascades without producing
any photocurrent (as investigated below). We have chosen to emboss
cascades containing relatively large numbers of grooves (up to 362),
as this allows us to maximize the geometric fill factor - i.e., the
relative area of the module that can produce a photocurrent.</p><p>We have performed extensive optimization experiments to enhance
device efficiency; for the preparation of the substrate, this involved
exploring the effect of deposition angle, partial pressure of oxygen
in the deposition chamber during reactive depositions (affecting the
degree of oxidation), individual layer thicknesses and the use of
initial plasma-treatments on the embossed substrate. This optimization
process and its effect on device efficiency is summarized in <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsaem.4c02734/suppl_file/ae4c02734_si_001.pdf">Supporting Information Figure S1</ext-link>. The approximate

the deposition

by slot-die coating. This
is a scalable technique that has recently been used to fabricate fully

the substrate was translated relative to the slot-die head at a web
speed of 1 m/min. A typical coating run involved the deposition of
perovskite over a 3 m length of substrate, creating around 4000 individual
device cascades. The coated substrate was then heated to 85 &#x000b0;C
using an in-line oven and finally respooled without any further processing
being applied. Here, device efficiency was improved by extensive optimization
studies that explored effects such as web speed, ink flow rate, solution

were also fabricated from the same precursor by spin-coating. Owing
to the relatively sensitive nature of the embossed polymeric substrate,
our perovskite precursor formulation has been optimized around a short,
low-temperature anneal.

a 0.4 eV difference between the valence band of MAPbI<sub>3</sub> and
the work function of Ni. However, the conduction band offset between

the efficiency of the groove-based perovskite solar cells, we have
explored the crystallinity, topography and chemical identity of the
constituent materials. Gaining a full understanding of device morphology
over length scales commensurate with charge-diffusion lengths is critical
in order to identify structures that may result in performance losses. <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>a shows an SEM image

region) largely
fills the grooves, although a small void is often observed at the
bottom of the grooves. We believe that such voids likely result from
trapped solvent remaining after precursor deposition or partial dewetting
of the ink from the bare substrate at the bottom of the groove. A
small amount of perovskite material can be seen at the apex of some
grooves in the top-down SEM and AFM images shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>b,c respectively. These can
be a source of performance loss in the devices as this overburden
can create shunting pathways between adjacent grooves, resulting in
reduced module performance. We have therefore optimized our coating
process to minimize the volume of material deposited at the groove
apex; such optimization required control over solution concentration,
coating speed and slot-die coating (slot-die head geometry, solution
flow rate, environmental conditions, etc.).</p><p>Even without perovskite
being present, the distribution of the
transport layers cannot be elucidated by SEM alone. To explore the
distribution of the various metals that form the contacts, we have
used nanofocus X-ray Fluorescence (XRF) mapping to characterize devices
at various stages in their fabrication. The nanofocus technique involves
using an X-ray beam generated by a synchrotron (Diamond Light Source
station I14) which is focused to a 50 nm diameter spot. The beam spot
was then scanned across the surface with the emitted X-rays dispersed
using a spectrometer to determine which elements are present from
their characteristic X-ray emission energies. This technique produces
high-resolution maps of the relative chemical composition of the film
at 50 nm resolution, bypassing the optical diffraction limit.</p><p>A typical scanning XRF image of a series of perovskite-filled grooves
is shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>c, with the distribution of Ni, Ti and Pb plotted using red, blue,

onto the grooves are shown in <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsaem.4c02734/suppl_file/ae4c02734_si_001.pdf">Figures S9 and S10</ext-link>. We find, as anticipated, the n- and p-type layers are clearly defined,
being coated onto opposing walls with no evidence of any contact between
these layers at the bottom of the groove (which might otherwise provide
shorting pathways). From the image, we determine an approximate separation
between n- and p-type contacts at the surface of around 950 nm. Note
that the tin signal is generally weaker than that of the other elements
and has significant spectral overlap with Ti emission so is not clearly
distinguishable (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsaem.4c02734/suppl_file/ae4c02734_si_001.pdf">Figure S9</ext-link>), nevertheless,
the presence of SnO<sub>2</sub> can be confirmed from the cross-sectional
SEM images. The elemental distribution across the substrate has also
been confirmed using EDX SEM as shown in <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsaem.4c02734/suppl_file/ae4c02734_si_001.pdf">Figures S13 and S14</ext-link>.</p><p>The scanning XRF measurements allow us to
gain some insight into
the structure of the perovskite within the grooves. It is apparent
that there is some fluctuation in the magnitude of the lead signal
over length scales of around a micron. Interestingly, we also find
that the average lead signal varies <italic>between</italic> neighboring
grooves; a result that suggests that some grooves have a thicker perovskite
layer (i.e., deeper fill into the groove) than others. From the above-discussed
SEM images, we find that the surface-level of the perovskite does
not vary appreciably across the grooves, suggesting that some of the
local variations in the lead and iodine signals may instead result
from variations in the size and shape of subsurface voids located
at the bottom of the grooves. The origin of the variation of the size
and distribution of such voids is currently not understood; they may
result from slight differences in the depth or dimensions of the grooves
or local variations in the distribution of the charge-extraction contacts
which result in enhanced local dewetting. We also find that the lead
signal can vary by a factor of 2 across the width of one groove (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsaem.4c02734/suppl_file/ae4c02734_si_001.pdf">Figure S11</ext-link>); a result suggesting that the perovskite
is thicker toward the nickel-coated walls. We speculate that this
may result from improved wetting of the precursor on the NiO surface
compared to the opposing C<sub>60-</sub>coated contact. We
also find fluctuations in the relative ratio of lead and iodine in
the perovskite across the surface (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsaem.4c02734/suppl_file/ae4c02734_si_001.pdf">Figure S12</ext-link>) suggesting that certain areas are lead-rich&#x02013;possibly resulting
from local regions of PbI<sub>2</sub>. Interestingly, in samples in
which the perovskite precursor was spin-cast, these regions seem to
be more localized to specific grooves; an effect that may result from
variations in solvent drying dynamics between the two methods. Note
however, that we do not find evidence for systematic changes in the
stoichiometry of the perovskite across the width of the grooves when
deposited roll-to-roll via slot-die coating (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsaem.4c02734/suppl_file/ae4c02734_si_001.pdf">Figure S11</ext-link>).</p><p>As was evident from the top-down SEM images, we
again clearly observe
perovskite grain structure in our AFM measurements, as shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>d. We can postprocess
such images to more clearly identify grain boundaries as shown in <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsaem.4c02734/suppl_file/ae4c02734_si_001.pdf">Figure S15</ext-link>. From this, we determine that typical
grains have a mean size of 114 nm. This compares with the mean grain
size of control perovskite films that were spin-cast onto a quartz-glass
surface of 105 nm. We note that the average separation between the
walls of the grooves (and thus the charge-extraction contacts) is
around 950 nm. This distance is greater than the thickness of the
perovskite active layer in a conventional-architecture solar cell
(which is typically 300&#x02013;600 nm), and thus we expect that photogenerated
charges within each groove will likely have to traverse a number of
grain boundaries before being extracted at a device contact. Recombination
at grain boundaries may therefore act as a loss mechanism within our
devices.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3"><title>Charge Separation and Generation of Photocurrent</title><p>Having
validated the distribution of the charge transport and contact materials
and the polycrystalline nature of the perovskite, we now explore the
ability of such devices to generate and extract a photocurrent. Here,
we first demonstrate the function of transport materials to act as
charge extraction layers via characterizing photoluminescence decay
lifetime of the MAPbI<sub>3</sub> perovskite when spin-coated on a
series of different representative substrates using Time-Correlated
Single-Photon Counting (TCSPC). This is shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>a where we present example
decay curves of perovskite deposited into grooves where only one of
the walls was coated with a contact material. These substrates are
designed to explore the efficiency by which each of the different
charge-transport layers are able to extract charge-carriers from the
device. For completeness, the photoluminescence decay of the perovskite
spin-coated on a quartz substrate is also shown. The data presented
in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>a was taken
from part of a larger data set with measurements made at a series
of different points across each substrate. We show histograms of these
decay lifetimes across 10 &#x003bc;m &#x000d7; 10 &#x003bc;m areas in <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsaem.4c02734/suppl_file/ae4c02734_si_001.pdf">Figure S16</ext-link>, with data also recorded on quartz

of this data set indicates median decay lifetimes of 1.0, 72, and
14 ns for the perovskite deposited on ETL-only (C<sub>60</sub>/SnO<sub>2</sub>), HTL-only (NiO/Ni), and grooves with both walls coated respectively.
This compares to the median lifetime of 1252 ns of an identical MAPbI<sub>3</sub> film spin-coated onto a quartz substrate without any transport
layers.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>(a) TCSPC decay curves of MAPbI<sub>3</sub> on a quartz substrate

modify charge
recombination mechanics in different ways. As the photoluminescence
intensity is proportional to the local electron and hole density,
we associate a reduction in decay lifetime with an increase in the
nonradiative recombination rates. Indeed, we suspect that the SnO<sub>2</sub>/C<sub>60</sub> ETL interface is characterized by a series
of defects which enhance nonradiative recombination. The observed
reduction in the emission lifetime of the perovskite in single-carrier
devices can therefore be attributed to increased nonradiative recombination
around the perovskite/transport layer interface. Interestingly, the
observed decay lifetime of the structure containing <italic>both</italic> ETL and HTL contacts is intermediate between those with either ETL
or HTL alone. We propose therefore that the built-in field in the
full device helps to reduce nonradiative recombination by moving holes
away from the ETL/perovskite interface.</p><p>As discussed above,
the series-connected grooves embossed onto
the substrate form modules which we term cascades. Between each adjacent
cascade, we also emboss a series of deeper, wider grooves, known collectively
as &#x0201c;delineation features&#x0201d;. The added depth of these
features ensures that transport layers are not in contact with perovskite
and can thus electrically isolate each cascade from those adjacent.
Extending these delineation features to cap the ends of a cascade
of grooves aids to further direct extraction of electrons and holes
in a direction perpendicular to the cascades. This also allows cascades
to be connected in parallel simply through the use of conductive tracks
at opposite sides of the substrate. This allowed simultaneous connection
to be made to either the n- or p-type side of the cascades. A schematic
of a typical layout of the cascades allowing their parallel connection
is shown in <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsaem.4c02734/suppl_file/ae4c02734_si_001.pdf">Figure S19</ext-link>.</p><p>To evidence
photovoltaic activity in parallel connected cascades,
we have recorded maps of photocurrent generation following optical
excitation at 637 nm using compressive sensing current mapping. In
this technique, a series of different pixel patterns having varying
spatial frequency are projected at the cascades via an optical microscope.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref></sup> Here, the photocurrent generated by the cascades is recorded for
each projected pattern, and by postprocessing the data, it is possible
to reconstruct the spatial distribution of photocurrent generated
across the surface. A typical image of the photocurrent generated
across a series of 50-groove cascades is shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>b. Due to the limited resolution
of the optical microscope, we do not clearly resolve individual grooves
within each cascade. However, we find a relatively uniform photocurrent
generated across individual cascades, indicating a comparable level
of performance between the individual cascades. Interestingly, we
find that one cascade generated no measurable current (white dashed
line). This implies the cascade was shunted, which could be caused
by poor electrical connection to the cascade during measurement, or
by significant shorting pathways from overfilled grooves. Nevertheless,
it is clear that the failure of this one cascade does not affect the
performance of neighboring cascades, with such parallel connected
cascades forming separate PV minimodules.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.4"><title>Electronic Characterization of Devices</title><p>Having explored
the physical structure of the groove devices and their ability to
generate and extract a photocurrent, we now discuss the performance
of our devices and focus our attention on devices fabricated by slot
die coating, although devices fabricated by spin coating have very
similar performance. For testing purposes, the coated roll shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>b was first cut into
small sections of around 1.5 cm &#x000d7; 1.5 cm. Each cut section typically
contained around 20 cascades, with each cascade comprising 362 serial
connected grooves. The act of cutting sections from the substrate
surface meant that the cascades were no longer connected in parallel
at the edges of the substrate, but instead were electrically isolated
from each other by the delineation features. This allowed the JV characteristics
of individual cascades to be recorded using a probe station with alignment
of the probes at opposite sides of the cascade performed using a microscope.
No aperture mask was required in this measurement, as our previous
work has shown this is unnecessary when illuminating these devices. <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsaem.4c02734/suppl_file/ae4c02734_si_001.pdf">Figure S20</ext-link> shows an image of a section of coated
substrate together with a schematic indicating how different areas
are selected for study. In our calculation of PCE, we first calculate
the active area of each cascade from the known width of the individual
grooves (1.5 &#x003bc;m), the number of grooves in each cascade (e.g.,
362) and their length as measured using callipers (typically 1.5 cm).
This gives a typical active area of around 0.0815 cm<sup>2</sup>.
Note, we also assume a geometric fill factor of 82% to account for
the area of the cascade in which current is generated, discounting
the area at the apex of each groove. When we include this geometric
fill factor, we determine a typical active area for each cascade of
0.0689 cm<sup>2</sup>.</p><p>Devices were tested under 1 sun using
a calibrated AAA solar simulator, with light directed to the grooves
through the transparent plastic substrate (i.e., the solar simulator
was placed underneath the probe station with light projected upward).
Interestingly, we find that a photocurrent could be generated whether
the device is illuminated from above or through the substrate, with
illumination from beneath resulting in higher recorded efficiencies.
This indicates that groove devices can be regarded as a bifacial technology.</p><p><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref></xref>a is a box

cascade is shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref></xref>b. As these modules consisted of 362 grooves, short-circuit
currents and open circuit voltages can be scaled by this value to
represent a comparable value to flat devices. In doing this, we find
typical cascades have equivalent <italic>J</italic><sub>sc</sub> and <italic>V</italic><sub>oc</sub> values of 11.9 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> and 0.99
V, with champion values of 20.3 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> and 1.03 V determined.
We can in fact compare the performance of groove cascades with that
of regular planar architecture perovskite PV devices having a similar
composition in terms of layer structure (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsaem.4c02734/suppl_file/ae4c02734_si_001.pdf">Figure S21</ext-link>). Here, we find that p&#x02013;i&#x02013;n and n&#x02013;i&#x02013;p
devices with the same transport layers and perovskite with no annealing
have PCEs of 11.3 and 16.3% respectively. Note that the efficiency
of these controls are similar to the anticipated performance of MAPbI<sub>3</sub> prepared from an ACN precursor which has not been subject
to thermal annealing (around 17%).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref></sup></p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>(a) Box plots

the stabilized efficiency of a champion cascade (362 grooves) which
reaches an efficiency of 12.8% after 7 min of testing. This performance
should be compared with our previous work in which we demonstrated
a PCE of 7.03% for a single groove, and 2.63% for a mini-module consisting
of 16 grooves. The significant increase in performance for these up-scaled
grooves results from the extensive optimization experiments performed
over a period of 1 year in which around 10,000 individual cascades
were fabricated and tested.</p><p>In <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref></xref>c we
plot the external quantum efficiency of a series of cascades. It can
be seen that as expected the device response falls to zero at the
perovskite band-edge around 820 nm. Note the relatively low EQE of
the cascades results from the fact that the short-circuit current
output from a module is relatively small as discussed above. We note
that if we multiply the peak EQE (0.118%) by the number of grooves
in the cascade (362), we obtain a peak EQE value of 42.7%; a value
in reasonable agreement with what can be expected from a conventional
architecture perovskite solar cell. We can also use our EQE measurement
to calculate integrated photocurrent across the visible spectrum and
determine an integrated short-circuit current to 0.03 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>; a value in good agreement with the average short-circuit current
measured from the <italic>JV</italic> studies reported in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref></xref>a.</p><p>We have
also briefly investigated the shelf life stability of spin-coated
cascades (see <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsaem.4c02734/suppl_file/ae4c02734_si_001.pdf">Figure S22</ext-link>). Here, substrates
were stored without encapsulation under nitrogen for a period of 37
days and tested periodically. We observed that in 50-groove cascades,
PCE increased considerably in the first few days after fabrication,
with the champion cascade reaching its peak efficiency of 10.9% (average
9.9%) at day 5. After 14 and 37 days, the efficiency of cascades had
stabilized, demonstrating an average PCE of 7.3%. It was found that <italic>V</italic><sub>oc</sub> remained relatively constant throughout the
testing period, with <italic>J</italic><sub>sc</sub> and FF undergoing
a variation that accounted for the observed changes in efficiency.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3"><title>Discussion</title><p>We have shown that back-contact groove-based
modules represent
a new approach to the high-volume manufacture of perovskite solar
cells. Devices are made using a directional vapor-based coating technique
applied to an embossed substrate that creates micron-width, electrically
separated n- and p-type contacts with high fidelity. Each of the coating
and patterning processes used have been individually performed using
a roll-to-roll based process, with the MAPbI<sub>3</sub> perovskite
deposited grooves by slot-die coating. We have characterized the structure
of our devices using a range of microscopy and spectroscopy techniques.
It is apparent that some compositional and ink fill inhomogeneity
is present within individual grooves and from groove-to-groove which
we believe may result from nonuniform drying dynamics of the precursor
ink, or differences in the wettability of the n-and p-type contact
materials. Significantly, we often identify the presence of submicron-sized
voids at the bottom of the grooves. The effect of such voids is not
currently understood, though as charge extraction occurs in a direction
parallel to the substrate, such voids may not have any noticeable
effect on device performance. This is clearly an open question and
is ripe for further studies. We show that the average size of the
perovskite grains is smaller than the width of the grooves, indicating
that extracted charges likely have to traverse one or more grain boundaries.
It is possible that recombination at such grain boundaries is one
factor that limits device performance, however it may be possible
to reduce such effects via appropriate passivation strategies.</p><p>We note that device efficiency is likely to be dependent on the
size and shape of the grooves, with narrower grooves expected to reduce
the length of charge-carrier extraction pathways and therefore help
to suppress charge-carrier recombination. Deeper grooves that are
fully filled with perovskite are also expected to enhance light absorption
and therefore increase short-circuit current. However, the fabrication
of very narrow and deep grooves using embossing techniques is not
without its challenges, as is completely filling high aspect-ratio
grooves with a perovskite. Future work will address these issues.</p><p>It is clear that the primary loss mechanism in the devices studied
results from a relatively low fill factor. We suspect that the primary
contribution to this effect results from a series resistance created
at the electronic contact between adjacent grooves. It is possible
that this electronic loss can be mitigated by modifying the structure
and layout of the grooves to enhance the contact area between adjacent
grooves and thereby improve the fill factor.</p><p>Measurements of
radiative emission lifetime indicate that decay
lifetimes are reduced significantly when the perovskite is placed
in contact with the SnO<sub>2</sub>/C<sub>60</sub> electron extracting
contact, compared to the NiO/Ni contact alone. This suggests that
there may be a population of defects or trap-states at the interface
between the SnO<sub>2</sub>/C<sub>60</sub> contact and the perovskite
that enhance nonradiative recombination. Future work will explore
the development of material systems that reduce such nonradiative
recombination, with this likely to result in improvements in device
module efficiency.</p><p>We have used photocurrent mapping techniques
to explore the uniformity
of photocurrent generated by parallel connected minimodules, each
composed of 362 groove cascades. Here we occasionally find that cascades
appear to generate no measurable current, indicating that they are
at short circuit. The origin of such effects is not understood, though
this does not affect adjacent cascades and indicates that significant
improvements in overall module efficiency can be expected via improving
the homogeneity of the perovskite deposition process.</p><p>Finally,
further work will investigate the effect of extended exposure
to the combined effects of moisture, light and heat. Critically, the
demonstration of stable devices will require the development of an
encapsulation system appropriate for our device architecture. This
is likely to be rather different from the encapsulation processes
that are used to protect regular architecture perovskite devices in
which the active layer is located beneath charge-transporting layers
and metal contacts, which both provide some degree of environmental
protection. As the perovskite in groove devices is exposed, care will
be required in choosing materials appropriate for encapsulation to
avoid unwanted chemical reactions.</p></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In summary, we have explored the upscaling
via slot-die coating
of a novel MAPbI<sub>3</sub> perovskite back-contact solar-cell technology
and have shown that cascades of serially connected grooves can be
created having a stabilized efficiency of up to 12.8%. We believe
this demonstration of flexible back-contact perovskite solar cell
modules manufactured by fully scalable processes that only contains
low-cost Earth-abundant materials represents a very promising step
toward the commercialization of this technology.</p></sec></body><back><notes id="notes-1" notes-type="si"><title>Supporting Information Available</title><p>The Supporting Information
