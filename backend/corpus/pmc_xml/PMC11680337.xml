A few weeks after the initial occurrence, infected wild boar were detected in Saxony. In this study, data from wild boar surveillance in Saxony were analyzed. The analysis focused on the eastern districts of the state, where the disease likely spread through infected wild boar. Additionally, data from Meissen, located approximately 65 km further west, were examined. In Meissen, the disease emerged one year later, and a human-mediated introduction was suspected. To evaluate the progression of ASF in the two study areas over time, data from active and passive surveillance were analyzed both descriptively and using a Bayesian space&#x02013;time model. Prevalence estimates were calculated for wild boar testing positive for the ASF virus and for ASF-specific antibodies. Higher prevalence estimates were observed in the eastern districts, indicating a stronger viral load, consistent with patterns seen in other European regions. Over time, seroprevalence increased, suggesting an accumulation of surviving wild boar. The findings provide important insights into the epidemiology of ASF in wild boar over time. They complement the existing knowledge and support targeted ASF control measures. This is particularly significant, as ASF continues to spread across Europe rather than being successfully eradicated.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>surveillance</kwd><kwd>epidemiological course</kwd><kwd>prevalence</kwd><kwd>wild boar</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>This research received no external funding.</funding-statement></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-viruses-16-01894"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>African swine fever virus (ASFV) genotype II has now been present in EU countries for more than 10 years [<xref rid="B1-viruses-16-01894" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In most affected countries, infected wild boar play the leading role in the epidemiology and the spread of the disease [<xref rid="B2-viruses-16-01894" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-viruses-16-01894" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. However, the situation is notably different in countries where domestic pigs are predominantly kept in backyards and raised for private consumption due to cultural practices [<xref rid="B4-viruses-16-01894" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The situations in the different countries also vary depending on the epidemiological scenario [<xref rid="B5-viruses-16-01894" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Both, the Baltic countries and Germany face a persistent risk of new ASF incursions from neighboring countries also affected by the disease, such as Ukraine, the Russian Federation, and Poland. In contrast, there are repeated cases of ASF in wild boars several hundred kilometers away from the rest of the epidemic (e.g., in Belgium in 2018 [<xref rid="B6-viruses-16-01894" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] or in the Czech Republic in 2017 [<xref rid="B7-viruses-16-01894" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]). Usually, these cases result from human activities. Depending on the epidemiological scenario, also the epidemiological course of the disease, the applied control measures and their success seem to differ [<xref rid="B5-viruses-16-01894" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>In September 2020, the first ASF cases were detected in Brandenburg, Germany [<xref rid="B8-viruses-16-01894" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Just a few weeks later, the district of G&#x000f6;rlitz in the federal state of Saxony also reported wild boar infected with ASF. It is believed that these outbreaks were caused by infected wild boar crossing over from neighboring Poland.</p><p>However, in 2021, infected wild boar were also detected in the district Meissen, approx. 65 km away from the epidemiological front in the East. Considering the estimated speed of disease spread, it is highly likely that the virus was introduced into this new area by human activity rather than through migrating wild boar [<xref rid="B9-viruses-16-01894" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Thanks to the immense effort of all involved stakeholders in the applied control measures, ASF has not moved westwards. As of the time of writing, Saxony managed to prevent a transmission into domestic pig holdings.</p><p>In an infected wild boar, the ASFV genome is usually detectable approx. 4 days after the infection, while the immune response in the form of antibodies is detectable after 7&#x02013;10 days [<xref rid="B10-viruses-16-01894" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-viruses-16-01894" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. As long as the viral genome is detected, the occurrence of antibodies has no predictive value for the final disease outcome [<xref rid="B10-viruses-16-01894" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Several studies demonstrated that the course of ASF within the wild boar population is comparable across affected countries [<xref rid="B1-viruses-16-01894" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B12-viruses-16-01894" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-viruses-16-01894" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-viruses-16-01894" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. At the beginning of the epidemic, virus prevalence increases, especially in wild boar carcasses. Later, seroprevalence rises, primarily due to the cumulation of surviving animals. Over time, the prevalence of the virus declines, primarily due to a significant reduction in the wild boar population, which decreases the number of susceptible hosts [<xref rid="B15-viruses-16-01894" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. As the population eventually recovers, the number of susceptible animals increases once more, often leading to a resurgence of the virus [<xref rid="B1-viruses-16-01894" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B12-viruses-16-01894" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-viruses-16-01894" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-viruses-16-01894" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>Monitoring these parameters over time enhances the scientific knowledge about ASFV, its behavior within a population and potential adaptions, attenuations, or other changes. Furthermore, such studies allow the evaluation of the epidemiological course of specific situations, facilitating the design of tailored surveillance and control measures. In the present study, we looked at the spatial and temporal courses of both virus- and seroprevalence in wild boar in Saxony. Thus, we aimed to investigate the epidemiological course of ASF and to evaluate the importance of these parameters in assessing the disease situation in an affected area.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-viruses-16-01894"><title>2. Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2dot1-viruses-16-01894"><title>2.1. Study Area and Period</title><p>Two areas were investigated: area East and area West. In area East, ASF surveillance data were used from the eastern districts Bautzen and G&#x000f6;rlitz. However, only data from wild boar located in areas that were defined as restricted zone II on 19 May 2023 were used (Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2023/1080 of 2 June 2023 amending Annexes I and II to Implementing Regulation (EU) 2023/594 laying down special control measures for African swine fever and repealing Implementing Decision (EU) 2023/985). Restricted zone II is one of the designated containment areas used to control and prevent the spread of ASF in affected regions. This zone is established around areas where ASF cases have been confirmed in wild boar populations but not yet in domestic pigs. The main objective of restricted zone II is to prevent the disease from spreading to pig farms by limiting the movement and activities in the zone. Thus, the key characteristics of restricted zone II include movement restrictions, increased surveillance and biosecurity measures, wild boar population management, and increased public awareness campaigns.</p><p>Municipalities that were only partly located in the restriction zone were included completely. Data were used from 1 October 2020&#x02013;17 May 2023.</p><p>In area West, data were used from the district Meissen using the same approach as with area East. Data from the city of Dresden were also included in this study. The study period was from 1 October 2021&#x02013;17 May 2023.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-viruses-16-01894"><title>2.2. Data</title><p>Surveillance data were used with the approval of the competent authority and originated from the CSF/ASF wild boar surveillance database of the European Union (<uri xlink:href="https://surv-wildboar.eu">https://surv-wildboar.eu</uri>) (accessed on 1 July 2023). The data compilation of each data record are described in detail by Richter et al. [<xref rid="B9-viruses-16-01894" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. For our analyses, we used the location of the sampled wild boar based on x and y coordinates and the corresponding municipalities, the laboratory test result (PCR result for virus genome detection [virology] and ELISA result for antibody detection [serology]), the date and the origin of the sample (from hunted wild boar, wild boar found dead, shot sick, or died from a road traffic accident (RTA)). Additionally, we used the age and sex of the sampled wild boar for analyses.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3-viruses-16-01894"><title>2.3. Data Analyses</title><p>The analyses were conducted separately for each study area. Surveillance data were analyzed descriptively using the software package R, version 4.1.2 [<xref rid="B16-viruses-16-01894" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Sample sizes for each year and per month were calculated based on samples originating from wild boars found dead, shot sick, died in an RTA, and from hunted wild boars. The results were visualized using the R package &#x0201c;ggplot2&#x0201d; [<xref rid="B17-viruses-16-01894" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>For the following analyses, data from hunted wild boar and animals that died in an RTA were summarized and analyzed together as one variable, and data from wild boar found dead and shot sick were summarized in a second variable. For every municipality in the affected areas, the median virus prevalence of hunted wild boar and wild boar found dead as well as the seroprevalence (tested positive for ASF-specific antibodies but negative for the ASFV genome) of all hunted wild boar over the study period were calculated. The data were mapped using ArcGIS ArcMap10.8.1 (ESRI, Redlands, CA, USA). Furthermore, monthly ASF prevalence estimates were computed for each study month. In addition to the ASFV- and seroprevalence estimates, prevalence estimates were calculated for wild boar (hunted and found dead) that tested ASFV-positive and simultaneously seropositive. For all prevalence estimates, the 95% confidence interval was calculated [<xref rid="B18-viruses-16-01894" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>Temporal and spatial effects were calculated with a Bayesian space&#x02013;time model using BayesX 2.0.1 (<uri xlink:href="http://www.uni-goettingen.de/de/bayesx/550513.html">http://www.uni-goettingen.de/de/bayesx/550513.html</uri>, accessed on 27 June 2024). The model is fully described in Staubach et al. [<xref rid="B19-viruses-16-01894" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and Staubach et al. [<xref rid="B20-viruses-16-01894" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Due to the low number of data in study area West, the model was only applied to area East. The temporal and the spatial course were calculated on a monthly basis and at municipality level, respectively. The application of the model was described previously by Nurmoja et al. [<xref rid="B21-viruses-16-01894" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In the model, prevalence constituted the dependent variable, while time, space, and season were included as random factors [<xref rid="B12-viruses-16-01894" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The model output represents the temporal or spatial effect on the logit of prevalence, providing insights into how prevalence rates vary over time or across different spatial regions. By modeling the logit-transformed prevalence, we were able to capture and interpret these effects more accurately, given the bounded nature of prevalence rates between 0 and 1.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec3-viruses-16-01894"><title>3.

In area East, median virus prevalence obtained from hunted wild boar was the highest (17.28%; 95% CI 9.78&#x02013;27.30%) in K&#x000f6;nigshain, a small municipality in G&#x000f6;rlitz (<xref rid="viruses-16-01894-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>A).

However, in Lohsa, a municipality in Bautzen but directly bordering G&#x000f6;rlitz, the estimated virus prevalence in hunted wild boar was 8.12% (95% CI 6.55&#x02013;9.93%) (<xref rid="viruses-16-01894-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>A).</p><p>The estimated median ASFV prevalence in wild boar found dead showed values above 80% in 27 of the 110 municipalities in area East (<xref rid="viruses-16-01894-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>A). The highest prevalence (98%; 95% CI 89.35&#x02013;100%) was found in Wittichenau in north-central Bautzen. Also, the two municipalities of K&#x000f6;nigsbr&#x000fc;ck (85.07; 95% CI 74.26&#x02013;92.60%) and Laussnitz (87.50%; 95% CI 47.35&#x02013;99.68%) in the West of Bautzen showed high virus prevalence estimates (<xref rid="viruses-16-01894-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>A).</p><p>The highest seroprevalence estimate for hunted wild boar was found in Grossnaundorf (33.33%; 95% CI 4.33&#x02013;77.72%), located in the West of Bautzen.

The ASFV prevalence estimates for wild boar found dead (100%; 95% CI 74.54&#x02013;100%) (<xref rid="viruses-16-01894-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>B) and seroprevalence estimates for hunted wild boar (9.09%; 95% CI 0.23&#x02013;41.28%) (<xref rid="viruses-16-01894-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>C) showed the highest values in Ebersbach and in Sch&#x000f6;nfeld, south and West of Thiendorf, respectively. Although several samples were investigated in the western municipalities, in most of them, no positive wild boar were detected (<xref rid="viruses-16-01894-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). Seropositive wild boars were only found in four municipalities (Thiendorf, Ebersbach, Sch&#x000f6;nfeld, and Moritzburg) (<xref rid="viruses-16-01894-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>C).</p><p>In area East, the virus prevalence of hunted wild boar increased slightly with several peaks over time. The highest peak with a prevalence of 11.72% (95% CI 9.18&#x02013;14.67%) emerged in June 2022. Subsequently, the prevalence decreased again, returning to levels similar to those observed at the beginning of the study period (<xref rid="app1-viruses-16-01894" ref-type="app">Supplementary Materials Table S1</xref>). Adjusted for seasonal effects (<xref rid="app1-viruses-16-01894" ref-type="app">Supplementary Materials Figure S2</xref>), the temporal trend of the logit prevalence of virus-positive apparently healthy, hunted wild boar showed a similar pattern. Highest values were reached in May and June 2022, also followed by a decreasing trend (<xref rid="app1-viruses-16-01894" ref-type="app">Supplementary Materials Figure S3</xref>). The increase in ASFV prevalence in wild boar found dead was steeper than that for hunted wild boar, presenting a peak (92.21%; 95% CI 83.81&#x02013;97.09%) in July 2021. In the following months, the prevalence estimates remained at a high level; only in August 2022, the prevalence dropped drastically (32.14%; 95% CI 15.88&#x02013;52.35%), only to return to the previous level in the following months (<xref rid="app1-viruses-16-01894" ref-type="app">Supplementary Materials Table S2</xref>). The temporal trend of the logit prevalence of virus-positive wild boar found dead, including the seasonal effect (<xref rid="app1-viruses-16-01894" ref-type="app">Supplementary Materials Figure S4</xref>), showed a clear increase over time (<xref rid="viruses-16-01894-f007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p>The seroprevalence of hunted wild boar increased only after one year of the epidemic. Several peaks, with the highest peak in July 2022 (5.23%; 95% CI 3.02&#x02013;8.35%), were followed by a clear prevalence decrease (<xref rid="app1-viruses-16-01894" ref-type="app">Supplementary Materials Table S3</xref>). The model analysis resulted in a slow increase in logit prevalence over time (<xref rid="app1-viruses-16-01894" ref-type="app">Supplementary Materials Figure S5</xref>). The median seasonal effect is displayed in the <xref rid="app1-viruses-16-01894" ref-type="app">Supplementary Materials Figure S6</xref>.</p><p>Starting to increase in the 8th study month, the prevalence estimates of wild boar found dead that were ASFV- and seropositive showed the highest value in January 2022 (66.67%; 95% CI 48.17&#x02013;82.04%). In the last 12 study months, no more ASFV- and seropositive dead wild boar were detected (<xref rid="app1-viruses-16-01894" ref-type="app">Supplementary Materials Table S4</xref>). The prevalence of hunted wild boar that tested positive were clearly lower than in wild boar found dead, however the highest value (5.81%; 95% CI 2.69&#x02013;10.74%) had already been observed in September 2021 (<xref rid="app1-viruses-16-01894" ref-type="app">Supplementary Materials Table S5</xref>).</p><p>In study area West, the estimated ASFV prevalence for hunted wild boar resulted in the highest value in May 2022 (8.89%; 95% CI 3.92&#x02013;16.77%), seven months after the first case appearing in this area. In almost all subsequent months, the prevalence was zero (<xref rid="app1-viruses-16-01894" ref-type="app">Supplementary Materials Table S6</xref>). In wild boar found dead, the ASFV prevalence fluctuated with several peaks. The prevalence was 100% in January 2022 (95% CI 63.06&#x02013;100%) and July 2022 (95% 54.07&#x02013;100%) (<xref rid="app1-viruses-16-01894" ref-type="app">Supplementary Materials Table S7</xref>). The seroprevalence for hunted wild boar presented a peak in May 2022 (3.13%; 95% CI 0.08&#x02013;16.22%) and in January 2023 (3.64%; 95% CI 0.44&#x02013;12.53%). However, in 15 of the 20 study months, the seroprevalence was either not investigated or it was 0% (<xref rid="app1-viruses-16-01894" ref-type="app">Supplementary Materials Table S8</xref>). The prevalence estimates for wild boar (hunted or found dead) that tested ASFV- and seropositive were negligible in area West (<xref rid="app1-viruses-16-01894" ref-type="app">Supplementary Materials Tables S9 and S10</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec4-viruses-16-01894"><title>4. Discussion</title><p>The aim of the present study was to investigate the course of ASF in the affected wild boar population in the German federal state of Saxony focusing on the different laboratory results in wild boar samples. Two different study areas were defined and analyzed separately, however both had a similar population density, which facilitates comparability [<xref rid="B9-viruses-16-01894" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The distance of more than 60 km between the epidemic in the East and the ASF cases emerging in Meissen in the West suggest a human-mediated disease introduction and no direct disease spread through infectious wild boar [<xref rid="B9-viruses-16-01894" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In the literature, the approximate distance of ASF spread is 1 to 1.5 km per month [<xref rid="B4-viruses-16-01894" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B22-viruses-16-01894" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-viruses-16-01894" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Even assuming a faster spread, the disease would not have reached such a western point within 12 months, suggesting two independent epidemiological scenarios. This hypothesis is supported by the extensive surveillance data collected between the first case in the East and the first case in Meissen, approximately one year later (<xref rid="app1-viruses-16-01894" ref-type="app">Supplementary Materials, Figure S7</xref>). Despite the large number of samples analyzed, which provides a reasonable degree of confidence, no positive wild boar were detected between the two areas during this period.</p><p>All prevalence estimates are lower in study area West, which suggests that the viral load in the area is not as high as in the East. The epidemiological situation in eastern Saxony is comparable to the one in the Baltic countries or in the federal state Brandenburg [<xref rid="B5-viruses-16-01894" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In Lithuania, where disease introduction was also very likely due to the migration of infected wild boar [<xref rid="B24-viruses-16-01894" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], similar ASFV prevalence estimates were observed in hunted wild boar and carcasses [<xref rid="B25-viruses-16-01894" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In contrast, in Sweden, where the disease has been introduced by human activity [<xref rid="B1-viruses-16-01894" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B26-viruses-16-01894" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], the ASFV prevalence of hunted wild boar in the infected zone was 0%, although within 10 months, 104 hunted animals were examined. ASFV prevalence of wild boar found dead was 54.12% [<xref rid="B27-viruses-16-01894" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], thus lower than in areas that face high infection pressure due to the epidemiological situation in the neighborhood, but comparable to the prevalence in Meissen. In the Czech Republic, which also experienced a point introduction in 2017, the virus prevalence of hunted and found-dead wild boar was similar to that observed in Meissen. [<xref rid="B7-viruses-16-01894" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In the meantime, the Czech Republic has experienced both epidemiological scenarios. In 2022, the disease was reintroduced in the north, likely through the migration of infected wild boar from Poland. In this scenario, the virus prevalence of hunted wild boar is more similar to the situation in study area East [<xref rid="B28-viruses-16-01894" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. These findings highlight the differences between the two epidemiological scenarios, underscoring the need for tailored control measures, the associated challenges, and their long-term effectiveness.</p><p>The differences mainly arise from the longer time frame expected due to the continuous migration of infected wild boar from neighboring countries. For example, resource allocation must be carried out more cautiously, and zones should be defined more broadly.</p><p>The decision to only include data from areas that were located in restriction zone II guaranteed the best possible data basis, as the sampling and investigation of all wild boar hunted and found dead are mandatory in these areas. With regard to the descriptive analyses, it was hardly surprising that most samples originated from hunted wild boars. However, also the number of samples of wild boar involved in RTA were higher than in several other countries [<xref rid="B27-viruses-16-01894" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B29-viruses-16-01894" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B30-viruses-16-01894" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. This could be due to an underreporting bias as, for example, in Poland, also a high number of samples originated from RTA victims [<xref rid="B29-viruses-16-01894" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In the majority of samples, no information was provided regarding the age or sex of the animal, making further analyses of these parameters difficult. Currently, there is no indication that age and sex are strongly associated with disease susceptibility. However, precise information regarding the origin of samples allows comprehensive and detailed analyses and thus a differentiated view of the epidemiology of the disease [<xref rid="B31-viruses-16-01894" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The prospect of successfully controlling the disease through a better understanding of epidemiological patterns should help motivate hunters to provide accurate information about the animal when sending samples. The seasonal sampling patterns in both areas are largely similar to those in the Baltic countries and Poland [<xref rid="B12-viruses-16-01894" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B32-viruses-16-01894" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], supporting the assumption that the number of samples correlates with the hunting season. Interestingly, the number of samples from wild boar that were shot sick was very low in both study areas. These findings could be explained by fast disease progression and lethality in ASF. It can be assumed that most diseased animals will go into hiding and die before a hunter even detects them.</p><p>For the prevalence estimations, the results from samples originating from hunted wild boar and those that were killed in an RTA were combined. In the same way, samples from wild boar found dead and shot sick were analyzed together. This was performed under the assumption that hunted wild boar and RTA victims have the same probability of being infected with ASFV, as do the other two groups [<xref rid="B30-viruses-16-01894" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Seroprevalence estimates were only calculated for hunted wild boar to ensure consistent sample quality and thus reliable results. However, to evaluate the proportion of wild boar that survived the infection for at least 7&#x02013;10 days [<xref rid="B10-viruses-16-01894" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], the prevalence estimates were also calculated for wild boar (hunted and found dead) that tested ASFV-positive and simultaneously seropositive.</p><p>The generally higher ASFV prevalence estimates for wild boar carcasses compared to the ones for hunted animals correspond to the results of previous prevalence studies [<xref rid="B12-viruses-16-01894" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-viruses-16-01894" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B24-viruses-16-01894" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B32-viruses-16-01894" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] and can also be explained by the high lethality and the associated higher probability to detect the virus in wild boar carcasses.</p><p>Although the number of sampled hunted wild boar was similar in all municipalities, higher prevalence estimates were mainly observed in the eastern municipalities in the corresponding study areas. To account for spatial dependencies between neighboring municipalities and thus avoiding a false interpretation of spatial disease distribution, a hierarchical Bayesian space&#x02013;time model, at least for study area East, was applied. The positive spatial effect on the logit ASFV prevalence in the four western municipalities in area East (<xref rid="viruses-16-01894-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>) indicates that the disease tends to move towards these municipalities. This interpretation is supported by the high ASFV prevalence estimates for wild boar found dead in these four municipalities. The spatial effect on the logit ASFV prevalence of wild boar found dead is not surprising and coincides with the ASFV prevalence estimations of wild boar found dead. The high seroprevalence in Grossnaundorf has to be interpreted considering the low sample size and thus the wide confidence interval in this municipality. However, detecting few seropositive wild boar in this area and thus animals that probably survived the infection is not surprising as also the ASFV prevalence of dead wild boar was high in these municipalities. Also, in the other municipalities, seroprevalence estimates were particularly high in the municipalities in which the ASFV prevalence was also higher.</p><p>In area West, the different prevalence patterns resembled each other. The virus first appeared in Radeburg, which is located on the eastern border of the Meissen district.</p><p>However, unlike the neighboring communities to the West and north, the seroprevalence in this area is zero, indicating that the infection was concentrated in the surrounding communities.</p><p>The temporal trends of ASFV- and seroprevalence were comparable to other affected countries. Similar studies were performed in Baltic countries, and the increase in ASFV prevalence followed by an increase in seroprevalence were comparable [<xref rid="B1-viruses-16-01894" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B12-viruses-16-01894" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-viruses-16-01894" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-viruses-16-01894" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In Baltic countries, where the trend over more than 70 study months was investigated, it was observed that the temporal effect decreased after approx. three years of the epidemic. Thus, it could be assumed that, also in Saxony, the trend will decline in the near future.</p><p>The seasonal prevalence estimates in the different study months and the two study areas did not follow a consistent pattern. In Poland, prevalence rather peaked in the winter month [<xref rid="B1-viruses-16-01894" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B29-viruses-16-01894" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. However, Rogoll et al. [<xref rid="B33-viruses-16-01894" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] and also Stahl et al. [<xref rid="B1-viruses-16-01894" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] demonstrated in their studies that seasonal prevalence patterns of wild boar were not consistent in the different European countries, which fits the pattern observed in Saxony. When interpreting changes in prevalence estimates over time, it is important to always consider the sample size and the resulting confidence intervals. Seroprevalence estimates could only be calculated for a defined period of time. Saxony started with serological investigations for ASFV-specific antibodies in March 2021 and stopped two years later by the end of February 2023. The increase in seroprevalence over time is not surprising, as it is known that affected wild boar seroconvert and can survive the infection [<xref rid="B34-viruses-16-01894" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="B35-viruses-16-01894" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Thus, the increase is the result of an accumulation of surviving animals and was observed in other countries [<xref rid="B12-viruses-16-01894" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Determining the antibody status of sampled wild boar is crucial to obtain an interpretable picture of disease epidemiology. Furthermore, comparing the course of seroprevalence estimates with the one in other countries enables scientists to draw potential conclusions regarding the characteristic of the circulating virus, and thus to potentially adapt, change, or emphasize recommendations regarding disease control measures. However, as discussed by Schulz et al. [<xref rid="B36-viruses-16-01894" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], currently, the case definition of the WOAH includes seropositive animals. This means that, even in case of missing ASFV-positive animals and the presence of seropositive samples, an affected country cannot be declared free from the disease. Accordingly, it is, to a certain extent, the logical consequence that countries are not particularly keen to continue serological testing in the long term. In order to motivate countries to continue serological testing and thus to enable the gain of knowledge regarding ASF and its course in wild boar populations, it is probably necessary to discuss, politically, the options to deal with seropositive wild boar in areas that have already been affected by ASF. This is particularly true as there is now sufficient evidence that these animals play only a negligible role, if any, in the spread of the disease [<xref rid="B35-viruses-16-01894" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="B37-viruses-16-01894" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="B38-viruses-16-01894" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="B39-viruses-16-01894" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]</p><p>The present study illustrates yet again the importance of analyzing the disease pattern in different countries and regions. Only by constantly increasing our understanding of ASF and the attempt to close as many knowledge gaps as possible can the successful global control of ASF become a reality.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclaimer/Publisher&#x02019;s Note:</bold> The statements, opinions and data contained in all publications are solely those of the individual author(s) and contributor(s) and not of MDPI and/or the editor(s).
