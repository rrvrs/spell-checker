Introduction</title><p>The establishment of a high-quality team of primary and secondary school teachers is a crucial aspect of basic educational reform aimed at enhancing quality and efficiency [<xref rid="pone.0320839.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Within the process of developing such a team, teachers&#x02019; work engagement has emerged as a pivotal factor for elevating the standard of education and teaching, and driving educational reform [<xref rid="pone.0320839.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Work engagement refers to a positive and fulfilling psychological state at work, arising from the integration of three interconnected components: vigor, dedication, and absorption [<xref rid="pone.0320839.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Vigor involves a high level of energy and psychological resilience, as well as the readiness to engage in work and persevere in the face of challenges, while dedication signifies a strong sense of commitment to work, the ability to derive a sense of purpose, passion, pride, and challenge from it [<xref rid="pone.0320839.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Absorption denotes a state of being happily immersed in work and not easily disengaged from it [<xref rid="pone.0320839.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Primary and secondary school teachers&#x02019; work engagement not only serves to enhance the quality of teaching, stimulate students&#x02019; enthusiasm for learning, and foster their growth and development, but also contributes to improving teachers&#x02019; own quality of life and advancing their professional development [<xref rid="pone.0320839.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Therefore, the study of primary and secondary school teachers&#x02019; work engagement holds significant theoretical and practical implications.</p><p>The ecological systems theory posits that the school environment plays a crucial role in cultivating teachers&#x02019; work engagement. In the school environment, school leadership is an important factor influencing the growth and development of teachers. Authentic leadership has been considered a suitable model of school leadership [<xref rid="pone.0320839.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Authentic leadership is a contemporary leadership style that emphasizes genuine and values-based leadership, acknowledging and accommodating the legitimate needs of individuals, groups, organizations, communities, and cultures in an integrative manner [<xref rid="pone.0320839.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. It encompasses four dimensions: self-awareness, relational transparency, balanced processing, and concerns, and internalized moral perspective [<xref rid="pone.0320839.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0320839.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Authentic leadership exerts a more profound influence on teachers&#x02019; work engagement compared to other forms of school leadership [<xref rid="pone.0320839.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. This enhanced impact of authentic leadership is attributed to the core tenets of authentic leadership, which prioritize personal care and support for teachers [<xref rid="pone.0320839.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. When leaders demonstrate genuine concern and encouragement, teachers are likely to experience heightened enthusiasm and motivation for their teaching roles, leading to increased work engagement. Furthermore, authentic leadership fosters a positive, supportive, and encouraging school culture environment, thereby inspiring teachers&#x02019; passion and dedication to their work [<xref rid="pone.0320839.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Research indicates that school climate is considered an important factor influencing teachers&#x02019; work engagement [<xref rid="pone.0320839.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. School climate refers to the relatively enduring and stable characteristics of the school environment that can be experienced and have a significant impact on the psychological and behavioral outcomes of its members [<xref rid="pone.0320839.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. It encompasses five dimensions: instructional innovation, collaboration, decision making, student relations, and school resources [<xref rid="pone.0320839.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Eldo and Shoshani indicated that a positive school climate typically encourages cooperation, sharing, and teamwork, enabling teachers to receive support from colleagues and leaders, thereby feeling a greater sense of belonging and satisfaction, and thus being more willing to invest in their work [<xref rid="pone.0320839.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Studies also show that teacher efficacy affects their work engagement [<xref rid="pone.0320839.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0320839.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Teacher efficacy, originating from Bandura&#x02019;s self-efficacy theory [<xref rid="pone.0320839.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], primarily refers to teacher&#x02019; confidence and beliefs in their ability to successfully accomplish teaching tasks and have a positive impact. It is divided into three dimensions: efficacy for instructional strategies, efficacy for classroom management, and efficacy for student engagement [<xref rid="pone.0320839.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. When teachers believe they are capable of addressing various teaching challenges, they are more likely to maintain an optimistic attitude, actively face the difficulties in their work, and thus have more motivation to engage in their work.</p><p>While researchers have proposed that these factors influence teachers&#x02019; work engagement, there is a significant lack of exploration into the specific mechanisms through which authentic leadership affects teachers&#x02019; work engagement. Therefore, this study aims to integrate the Chinese context and explore the relationship between authentic leadership, school climate, teaching efficacy, and teachers&#x02019; work engagement. It also seeks to analyze the mediating roles of school climate and teacher efficacy in the relationship between authentic leadership and teachers&#x02019; work engagement. The study provides new empirical evidence for exploring indigenous experiences and practical pathways for cultivating teachers&#x02019; work engagement with Chinese characteristics.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>2. Literature review and research hypotheses</title><sec id="sec003"><title>2.1 Authentic leadership and teacher work engagement</title><p>Authentic leadership has been found to positively impact teachers&#x02019; work engagement [<xref rid="pone.0320839.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Bronfenbrenner&#x02019;s Ecological Systems Theory posits that an individual&#x02019;s development is the result of interactions between the individual and their environment, which is composed of four nested levels: the microsystem, mesosystem, exosystem, and macrosystem [<xref rid="pone.0320839.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Comprised of family, peer groups, schools, and neighbors, the microsystem constitutes the most immediate living environment for an individual [<xref rid="pone.0320839.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Environmental factors within the microsystem can have either positive or negative impacts on an individual&#x02019;s development and adaptation [<xref rid="pone.0320839.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Leaders who exhibit authenticity&#x02014;characterized by behaviors such as transparency, trustworthiness, and empathy, create a positive microclimate within the school. This fosters a sense of psychological safety and support for teachers, which in turn can enhance their work engagement. Empirical studies have also indicated a positive relationship between authentic leadership and teachers&#x02019; work engagement. For instance, Ba&#x0015f;aran and K&#x00131;ral&#x02019;s survey of 300 secondary school teachers revealed that the authentic leadership exhibited by school administrators significantly predicted the teachers&#x02019; reported levels of work engagement [<xref rid="pone.0320839.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In a similar vein, Alazm and Al-Mahdy&#x02019;s survey of 333 teachers across 25 primary schools in Kuwait indicated that authentic leadership positively and significantly influences teachers&#x02019; work engagement [<xref rid="pone.0320839.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Echoing these findings, Kulophas et al. reported the results of a quantitative cross-sectional survey involving 605 teachers from 182 primary schools, demonstrating the impact of authentic leadership on teachers&#x02019; work engagement [<xref rid="pone.0320839.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Building on this body of evidence, the present study posits the following hypothesis:</p><statement><p>Hypothesis 1: Authentic leadership is positively related to primary and secondary school teachers&#x02019; work engagement.</p></statement></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>2.2 The mediating role of school climate</title><p>A positive school climate can reduce depression and interpersonal sensitivity, increase a sense of belonging, decrease occupational burnout, stimulate work creativity, and fulfill self-worth [<xref rid="pone.0320839.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Research indicates that authentic leadership is more effective than traditional directive leadership in establishing a positive school climate. Authentic leadership emphasizes sincerity and transparency, allowing leaders to display their true selves and build trust and supportive relationships with teachers and staff, which contributes to an open, inclusive, and cooperative school climate. The Ecological Systems Theory underscores the interdependence between the macro-environment and micro-environments [<xref rid="pone.0320839.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Authentic leadership may exert its influence on school climate by enhancing the relationships among teachers, students, and peers, thereby shaping the interpersonal dynamics within the educational setting. Moreover, empirical studies have shown a positive association between authentic leadership and school climate. For example, Salip and Quines suggested that authenticity in leadership plays a crucial role in creating a positive school climate [<xref rid="pone.0320839.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], and Srivastava et al. indicated that authentic leadership is helpful in developing an inclusive classroom environment [<xref rid="pone.0320839.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. These findings underscore the vital role of authentic leadership in fostering a positive school climate.</p><p>School climate is closely related to teacher work engagement. Social exchange theory posits that an individual&#x02019;s commitment and loyalty in an organization are influenced by their exchange relationship with the organization [<xref rid="pone.0320839.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In a positive school climate, teachers typically perceive support and recognition from school management and colleagues, which forms a social exchange relationship that motivates teachers to become more engaged in their work and improve their job performance [<xref rid="pone.0320839.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Additionally, a positive school climate provides more resources and opportunities to meet teachers&#x02019; growth and development needs, further promoting their work engagement. Empirical research also supports the close relationship between school climate and teacher work engagement. For example, a study by Song et al. involving 1,125 responses from 38 Korean high schools found that an innovative school climate significantly influences teacher work engagement [<xref rid="pone.0320839.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Similarly, Eldor and Shoshani conducted a study with a sample of 423 teachers from 30 different schools in Israel and found that teacher work engagement was most strongly demonstrated when the service climate was high [<xref rid="pone.0320839.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].

Specifically, the indirect effect is composed of three pathways: The pathway of authentic leadership &#x02192;school climate &#x02192;teacher efficacy&#x02009;&#x02192;&#x02009;work engagement had an indirect effect of 0.116 with a 95% confidence interval of [0.081, 0.161]; The pathway of authentic leadership &#x02192;school climate&#x02192; work engagement had an indirect effect of 0.092 with a 95% confidence interval of [0.028, 0.162]; The pathway of authentic leadership&#x02009;&#x02192;&#x02009;teacher efficacy&#x02009;&#x02192;&#x02009;work engagement had an indirect effect of 0.089 with a 95% confidence interval of [0.034, 0.162]. The Bootstrap method yielded 95% confidence intervals for all three indirect effects that do not encompass zero, signifying that each of the indirect effects is statistically significant. This finding substantiates the hypotheses 2, 3, and 4.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="pone.0320839.t004"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0320839.t004</object-id><label>Table 4</label><caption><title>Mediating effects of school climate and teacher efficacy (N = 1043).</title></caption><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="pone.0320839.t004" id="pone.0320839.t004g" position="float"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="2">Path relationship</th><th align="left" rowspan="2" colspan="1">Effect</th><th align="left" rowspan="2" colspan="1">SE</th><th align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">95% confidence internal</th></tr><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Lower</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">upper</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" colspan="6" rowspan="1">

Discussion</title><p>Empirical evidence suggests that authentic leadership, school climate, and teacher efficacy has a positive impact on teachers&#x02019; work engagement. However, there is still a gap in understanding the specific mechanisms through which authentic leadership impacts teachers&#x02019; work engagement via school climate, and teacher efficacy. This research aimed to construct a mediation model to investigate whether authentic leadership would be indirectly correlated with teachers&#x02019; work engagement through school climate, and teacher efficacy. The findings are presented as follows.</p><p>The results of the study revealed that authentic leadership was directly and positively related to teachers&#x02019; work engagement, which not only corroborates Cort&#x000e9;s-Denia et al.&#x02019;s research [<xref rid="pone.0320839.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], which establishes a positive correlation between authentic leadership and teachers&#x02019; work engagement, but also resonates with Srivastava and Dhar&#x02019;s proposition [<xref rid="pone.0320839.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] that teachers&#x02019; work engagement is significantly influenced by leadership styles, with authentic leadership exerting a particularly profound impact. From the perspective of the Ecological Systems Theory, we can gain a deeper understanding of how individual behavior is influenced by the social environment. As Li has observed, authentic leadership is crucial in shaping individuals&#x02019; intrinsic motivation and their ensuing professional dedication [<xref rid="pone.0320839.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. The recognition by teachers of their leaders&#x02019; authenticity, transparency, and investment in their professional advancement is instrumental in fostering a sense of intrinsic motivation, which subsequently amplifies their work engagement [<xref rid="pone.0320839.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Furthermore, teachers who are recipients of robust support and encouragement from their leadership are less likely to be distracted and more inclined to be actively immersed in their professional endeavors [<xref rid="pone.0320839.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. This study reinforces the proposition that authentic leadership serves as a significant predictor of work engagement among teachers.</p><p>The results of the study identified school climate as one significant partial mediating role between authentic leadership and teachers&#x02019; work engagement. This finding is consistent with previous research that has suggested a positive relationship between authentic leadership and school climate [<xref rid="pone.0320839.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0320839.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], as well as a positive association between school climate and teachers&#x02019; work engagement [<xref rid="pone.0320839.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0320839.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. These findings support the notion that authentic leadership plays a crucial role in shaping the perception of school climate, which, in turn, affects teachers&#x02019; engagement in work. Besides, the finding aligns with the principle of the Ecological Systems Theory that the interaction between individuals and their environment is a dynamic developmental process [<xref rid="pone.0320839.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Authentic leadership can continuously interact and engage in feedback loops, adjusting and optimizing leadership strategies to adapt to changes in school climate and teachers&#x02019; needs, thereby promoting teacher work engagement and the improvement of the school atmosphere. The finding provides more evidence of the role of school climate in the relationship between authentic leadership and teachers&#x02019; work engagement.</p><p>The results of the study demonstrated that teacher efficacy plays a significant partial mediating role between authentic leadership and teachers&#x02019; work engagement. This finding is in line with Alazmi and Al-Mahdy&#x02019;s perspective, which emphasizes the crucial role of teacher efficacy in the association between authentic leadership and teachers&#x02019; work engagement [<xref rid="pone.0320839.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. On one hand, authentic leadership encourages teachers to participate in decision-making and provides opportunities for successful experiences, thereby boosting their self-efficacy. On the other hand, authentic leadership empowers teachers with more autonomy, making them feel that their work is more significant and valuable, which in turn enhances their self-efficacy. When teachers possess a strong sense of self-efficacy, they are more likely to engage proactively in their work, demonstrating resilience in the face of challenges, and thereby increasing their work engagement. This study reiterates the importance of teacher efficacy in the relationship between authentic leadership and teachers&#x02019; work engagement.</p><p>The results of the study further showed that both school climate and teacher efficacy functioned as a chain mediating role between authentic leadership and teachers&#x02019; work engagement.</p><p>Authentic leadership emphasizes authentic expression, giving teachers more confidence and encouraging mutual trust and cooperation among them. This leadership style is conducive to building a positive school climate of trust, cooperation, and equitable dialogue. In this atmosphere, teachers support each other, share ideas and practices, thereby enhancing their teacher efficacy and ultimately promoting teachers&#x02019; work engagement. This finding further elucidates the mechanisms by which environmental systems and individual factors influence teachers&#x02019; work engagement and advances the previous research by shedding light on how authentic leadership can increase teachers&#x02019; work engagement. It is worth noting that although both school climate and teacher efficacy as mediators were established, their effect sizes were 0.31 and 0.30, respectively, which were lower than the effect of serial mediation. This indicates that the serial mediation of school climate and teacher efficacy has a more significant impact on teachers&#x02019; work engagement. This suggests that when intervening in teachers&#x02019; work engagement at the school level, cultivating school climate and teacher efficacy should be given greater priority. The implications of these findings resonate beyond local boundaries, offering insightful lessons for educational practices across China and serving as a template for educational reforms on a global scale. By integrating the principles of authentic leadership, educational institutions worldwide can create environments that foster teacher efficacy and commitment, thereby enhancing the quality of education for all students.</p></sec><sec id="sec024"><title>6. Limitations and future research directions</title><p>This study has some limitations. Firstly, the use of cross-sectional data, while enabling the identification of influences between variables, makes it difficult to establish clear causal relationships between the variables. Future research could employ longitudinal data to delve deeper into these relationships. Secondly, constrained by data limitations, this study only analyzed the mediating pathways of school climate and teacher efficacy in the impact of authentic leadership on teachers&#x02019; work engagement. Subsequent research should refer to relevant theories to conduct a more detailed exploration of other potential pathways through which authentic leadership influences teachers&#x02019; work engagement. Lastly, as this study was primarily based on samples from Shandong, the external validity of the conclusions is somewhat limited. Future research could validate the findings through surveys in a more diverse range of regions to ensure that the conclusions are more compelling and applicable in real-world settings.</p></sec><sec id="sec025"><title>7. Implications</title><p>The findings of this study hold significant implications for theoretical understanding and practical application in addressing the work engagement of primary and secondary school teachers.</p><p>From a theoretical perspective, this study contributes to the existing literature by elucidating the chain mediating role of positive school climate and teacher efficacy in the relationship between authentic leadership and work engagement. It advances our understanding of the complex mechanisms underlying this association and emphasizes the importance of considering multiple factors in explaining work engagement among primary and secondary school teachers. This study underscores the significance of school climate and teacher efficacy as pivotal mediators in this relationship, shedding light on the underlying processes that can be targeted for intervention and prevention efforts. It offers guidance for future research to explore the mechanisms of these mediating variables across diverse educational and cultural settings, and helps expand the theoretical framework of authentic leadership&#x02019;s impact on work engagement. This prompts researchers to consider additional mediating or moderating variables for a more comprehensive understanding of the relationship&#x02019;s dynamics.</p><p>From a practical standpoint, this study offers valuable insights for designing effective interventions to enhance work engagement among primary and secondary school teachers. Interventions could focus not only on promoting authentic leadership but also on cultivating positive school climate and teacher efficacy. To improve authentic leadership, on one hand, leaders could deeply analyze their personal values, beliefs, and moral standards to ensure that they consistently adhere to these core principles in their leadership, motivating faculty and staff to pursue meaningful work lives [<xref rid="pone.0320839.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. On the other hand, leaders could maintain open, honest, and transparent communication with teachers. They should listen to their voices, respect their opinions, and fully consider their needs and expectations in the decision-making process. Recognizing the pivotal role of a positive school climate in enhancing teacher work engagement, educational institutions must prioritize its development within the constraints of limited resources. Strategic allocation of funds is crucial for optimizing both the physical teaching environment, which directly impacts comfort and workspace quality, and the intangible aspects that contribute to teacher well-being and job satisfaction. Balancing capital expenditures on infrastructure with operational costs, particularly teacher salaries, is essential to prevent adverse budgetary trade-offs. An integrated approach that sustains competitive remuneration while upgrading the physical campus is imperative. Additionally, deliberately cultivating campus culture through initiatives such as cultural walls and display boards, which highlight institutional and individual achievements, can significantly bolster teachers&#x02019; sense of belonging and pride. To foster teacher efficacy, the principal could passionately promote authentic leadership, consistently reinforce a culture of open communication and collaboration, and spark teachers&#x02019; internal motivation for professional growth by fostering shared leadership experiences and providing personalized professional development. Ultimately, this will boost teachers&#x02019; dedication and teaching performance. Additionally, schools could offer targeted assistance to address practical issues encountered in teaching through means such as teacher professional development training and school-based professional learning communities, in order to alleviate teaching pressures and enhance teachers&#x02019; sense of efficacy. These practical insights provide specific ideas and directions for future research on how to more effectively design and implement intervention measures to improve teacher work engagement, prompting researchers to pay attention to the combined effects of different intervention measures and their applicability in different educational stages and teacher groups.</p></sec><sec id="sec026" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material id="pone.0320839.s001" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>S1 dataset.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0320839.s001.xlsx"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors wish to thank Guanghai Cao for providing technical support in data analysis for this research.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0320839.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><name><surname>Niemi</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Lavonen</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name>. <article-title>Teacher education in Finland: persistent efforts for high-quality teachers</article-title>. <source>Teaching the world&#x02019;s teachers</source>. <publisher-name>Johns Hopkins University Press</publisher-name>. <year>2020</year>. p. <fpage>153</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>78</lpage>.</mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0320839.ref002"><label>2</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Alazmi</surname><given-names>AA</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Al-Mahdy</surname><given-names>YFH</given-names></name>. <article-title>Principal authentic leadership and teacher engagement in Kuwait&#x02019;s educational reform context</article-title>. <source>Educational Management Administration &#x00026; Leadership</source>. <year>2020</year>;<volume>50</volume>(<issue>3</issue>):<fpage>392</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>412</lpage>. <comment>doi: </comment><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1177/1741143220957339</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0320839.ref003"><label>3</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><name><surname>Schaufeli</surname><given-names>W</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Bakker</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name>. <source>Utrecht work engagement scale, preliminary manual</source>. <publisher-name>Utrecht University</publisher-name>. <year>2004</year>.</mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0320839.ref004"><label>4</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Han</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name>. <article-title>Investigating the Correlation Among Chinese EFL Teachers&#x02019; Self-efficacy, Work Engagement, and Reflection</article-title>. <source>Front Psychol</source>. <year>2021</year>;<volume>12</volume>:<fpage>763234</fpage>. <comment>doi: </comment><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.3389/fpsyg.2021.763234</pub-id>

For example, in what specific ways can the work engagement of primary and secondary school teachers be improved?</p><p>2.The discussion needs to be analyzed from a more critical perspective. I noticed that much of Section 5 is simply a description of the previous hypotheses, without presenting many novel or critical viewpoints. For example, the author mentions that this study is primarily based on a sample from Shandong Province, China, which raises concerns about the external validity of the conclusions. This is an important point. The author needs to analyze the significance of this study for China as a whole, and even globally, by comparing the basic characteristics of different provinces in China. If the study&#x02019;s findings are largely applicable only to Shandong Province, it would be more appropriate to publish it in a scholarly journal in Shandong rather than in Plos One.</p><p>Another typical example is the statement in the discussion: &#x0201c;schools should invest resources to improve the physical environment of the campus...&#x0201d;. This is a very general summary. I believe that schools have limited resources, and these resources may be in competition with one another. For instance, if some funds are allocated to improving the physical environment, then teachers&#x02019; salaries may be correspondingly reduced. How could this situation be evaluated? Of course, I agree that improving the physical environment is important, but the premise is that the project should have clear goals and a balance with other indicators. The author needs to explain this aspect. In other words, the author not only needs to state the benefits of improving the physical environment but also needs to acknowledge the potential risks involved.</p><p>At the same time, I noticed that the author used many uncertain terms to describe the research findings, such as &#x0201c;One possible reason is that authentic leadership ignites teachers&#x02019; intrinsic motivation, leading them to develop a deeper love for their profession.&#x0201d; However, this is not a characteristic of a high-quality paper. The author needs to use clear language to present the research findings, rather than using vague statements. The author should clearly explain how authentic leadership influences teachers&#x02019; motivation, which requires a solid literature review. Additionally, I noticed that the author frequently uses &#x0201c;should&#x0201d; to describe conclusions, but if we consider the practice scenario, &#x02018;could&#x02019; would be more appropriate. If &#x02018;should&#x02019; is used, there needs to be sufficient arguments to prove that it is reasonable.</p><p>3.Authentic leadership is the focus of this paper's discussion, but after reading it, I believe it leans more towards &#x0201c;political discourse&#x0201d;, as the author&#x02019;s definition is quite vague. The author not only needs to discuss the dimensions used to measure authentic leadership but also needs to clarify the reasons for the emergence of authentic leadership. In other words, the author should explain the relationship between authentic leadership and the social system, how the social system fosters authentic leadership, and how authentic leadership drives the social system.</p><p>Additionally, the author states, &#x0201c;The social-ecological systems theory posits that individual behaviors are influenced by multiple interconnected levels of their environment, ranging from the immediate setting (microsystem) to the broader societal context (macrosystem)&#x0201d;. I must seriously point out that this is not the main viewpoint of the social-ecological systems theory; this concept is more aligned with sociology. I recommend the author study the papers by McCay (2002) and Giddens (1984), which indicate that while individuals are influenced by the structures in which they are embedded, they can also influence and change these structures.</p><p>I also need to correct an obvious mistake made by the author: the social-ecological systems theory is an academic term in natural resource management, proposed by Elinor Ostrom, primarily discussing the coevolution of social systems and natural systems, with a focus on polycentric governance. Clearly, the use of &#x0201c;the social-ecological systems&#x0201d; in this paper is an inappropriate concept. I suggest that the author reorganize the content of the literature review and maintain a rigorous attitude towards specialized terminology.</p><p>I have noticed that the author's analysis primarily states that principals need to possess authentic leadership. However, this skill is something that every leader, including grassroots leaders, should have.</p><p>4.In the empirical section, I suggest the author include a &#x0201c;Robustness test&#x0201d; section to verify whether the research results remain stable and reliable under different conditions. This actually addresses my second comment, where the author needs to ensure that the findings are valid under various conditions and can be applied to regions beyond Shandong. The robustness test should primarily include &#x0201c;Sobel verification&#x0201d; and retesting. For example, the author can refer to the method used by Zhao et al. (2023) in discussing the mediation effect.</p><p>Reference</p><p>[1] McCay B. J.

The authors need to provide definitions for key terms in the introduction section (or at the point of their first mention). For example, the term "Authentic Leadership" appears in the introduction of the first chapter, but its definition is only provided in the literature review section of Chapter 2. This is clearly inconsistent with academic conventions. The authors should define this term in the introduction, while the literature review should focus on research related to this term.</p><p>The authors may refer to their approach to defining "Work Engagement" in the introduction section as an example.</p><p>It is recommended that the authors review the entire manuscript to identify similar issues.
