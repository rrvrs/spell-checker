The primary objective of revision surgery is the meticulous excision of all infected components, encompassing both the prosthesis and the adjacent osseous tissues, to halt the progression of the infection. Following revision surgery for PJI, a significant number of patients experience prosthesis failure due to aseptic loosening, necessitating additional surgical procedures despite successful eradication of the initial infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. However, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood, challenging the prevailing hypothesis that bone stock should recuperate post-operatively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Our recent work has demonstrated that affected patients exhibit a pronounced upregulation of inflammatory markers in the bone stock surrounding the prosthesis, coupled with alterations in bone homeostasis&#x02014;characterized by enhanced bone turnover, increased osteoclast differentiation and activity, and loss of bone mass&#x02014;suggesting these factors as potential contributors to the increased risk for aseptic loosening<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. These localized alterations in the bone bear resemblance to those observed in osteoporosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Current therapeutic strategies for managing bone resorption include bisphosphonates and the RANKL inhibitor denosumab, which are staples in the treatment of osteoporosis. Nevertheless, their potential application in the context of PJI is controversial. Investigations have indicated an association between the use of bone resorption inhibitors and an increased risks of osteonecrosis and heightened bacterial load, thus constraining their utility in PJI cases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. In contrast, targeting the programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) receptor&#x02014;an immune checkpoint found on multiple immune cell types including monocytes&#x02014;has emerged as a promising avenue: Inhibiting PD-1 has already gained clinical acceptance for counteracting immunosuppression in oncology and has been found to limit osteolytic processes in bone metastases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. However, in contrast to these findings, recent evidence indicated that immune checkpoint inhibitors may be less effective in bone metastases and could be associated with impaired bone metabolism and a subsequent increased fracture risk<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. The PD-1/PD-L1 axis has been suggested to be implicated in modulating polymorphonuclear and monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) during sepsis-induced immunosuppression, with PD-L1 being more highly expressed in polymorphonuclear MDSCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 axis have revolutionized cancer therapy by boosting the immune response against tumors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. However, their effects on bone health remain less well understood. Recent discoveries have linked PD-1 to changes in bone dynamics&#x02014;preclinical models have shown a decrease in osteoclasts leading to osteopetrosis in PD-1 knockout mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, while murine models of tumorigenesis have shown a reduction in osteoclast differentiation within metastatic sites following PD-1 inhibitor therapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. However, Wang et al. found no significant difference in trabecular bone formation between wild-type and PD-1 knockout mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. These discrepancies suggest a complex role for PD-1 signaling in bone metabolism, which warrants further investigation. Unlike bisphosphonates and denosumab, which target bone resorption, PD-1 inhibitors are designed to enhance immune responses and have demonstrated safety in systemic infections, with potential to limit sepsis progression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. This evidence posits PD-1 blockade as a potentially effective and safe therapeutic modality for PJI.</p><p id="Par6">These cumulative findings pivot the role of PD-1 in PJI into a new focal point, suggesting that its modulation could represent a novel therapeutic frontier for addressing the complex interplay of immune regulation and bone metabolism to improve local bone health and limit post-PJI prosthesis failure. Despite encouraging preclinical data, the direct implications of PD-1 pathways in human PJI remain to be elucidated. Our study aims to fill this gap, exploring the role of PD-1/PD-L1 signaling in osteoclastogenesis within the context of PJI and assessing the therapeutic potential of PD-1 inhibitors to ameliorate the pathological bone turnover in affected patients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec01"><title>Patients and sample collection</title><p id="Par7">This investigation received approval from the Ethics Committee of Charit&#x000e9; University Hospital (reference EA1/110/23) and conformed to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.

Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) reimplantation was performed in patients without clinical signs of persisting infection, negative infectious parameters (i.e., C-reactive protein [CRP] and white blood-cell count), and at least 6 weeks after implant removal. As comparators, tissue samples from subjects undergoing TKA for primary osteoarthritis served as non-PJI controls. Osteoarthritic patients undergoing primary TKA were selected as controls due to the accessibility of their samples, as it is not feasible to collect bone marrow samples from healthy individuals. While osteoarthritis involves inflammation, these patients provide a practical non-infectious comparison group. Exclusion criteria for this study encompassed any of the following conditions: (1) a pre-existing diagnosis of osteoporosis, (2) TKA due to non-primary osteoarthritis, (3) patients treated with DAIR (debridement, antibiotics and implant retention) procedures or one-stage revision TKA rather than two-stage revision TKA, or (4) infection with HIV.</p><p id="Par9">In this study, peripheral blood, bone marrow, and bone tissue specimens of affected patients were analyzed. In total, 65 specimens were obtained intraoperatively (20 primary osteoarthritis control, 21 PJI septic explantation, and 24 PJI prosthesis reimplantation samples).

After acquisition, the raw image datasets were reconstructed at a predefined global threshold range of 0 to 24, determined by the analysis of the gray-level histogram, at 16-bit stacks using NRecon v1.7.4.6 (Skyscan, 2005-11; Bruker microCT 2012-18). The reconstituted bone architecture was analyzed within selected regions of interest (ROI) that encompassed trabecular bone compartments using ImageJ (version 1.53; National Institutes of Health, USA) and 3D Slicer (Slicer Community). ROIs were selected from trabecular bone compartments located approximately 5&#x02009;mm from the implant interface. In the control group, ROIs were chosen from analogous regions in the distal femur. The ROIs were defined by a length of 1.5&#x02009;mm and width of 1.5&#x02009;mm, ensuring consistent anatomical landmarks were used across all samples. Values are reported as a percentage of the control to emphasize variations relative to baseline measurements in patients not affected by PJI, as well as temporal changes at the time of surgery.

Our analysis revealed that PD-1/PD-L1 signaling contributes significantly to excessive osteoclastogenesis and enhanced osteoclast function subsequently leading to lastingly impared bone homeostasis. Moreover, our data suggest that inhibiting the PD-1/PD-L1 axis could potentially reverse these detrimental effects. Given the high failure rates following PJI due to aseptic loosening with subsequent need for surgical intervention, our findings underscore the urgent need for innovative treatment strategies targeting this mechanism in affected patients.</p><p id="Par40">In PJI, our study observed an increased presence of PD-1 positive monocytes in peripheral blood and bone marrow, alongside a higher macrophage count in the bone marrow compared to controls, indicating active PD-1/PD-L1 signaling during PJI pathogenesis. Correspondingly, sPD-L1 levels were elevated in PJI. In contrast, sPD-1, which acts as a decoy inhibiting activation of the cellular PD-L1 pathway axis, leading to T cell anergy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, was not found to be elevated. Previous research on the role of PD-1 in osteoclast formation has mostly focused on osseous metastases and delivered controversial results: While Nagahama et al. observed an increase in bone mineral density and a decrease in osteoclast numbers in PD-1 knockout mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, Wang et al. reported no rise in osteoclast formation in similar knockout mice without tumors, noting bone structure impairment only in those with tumors (12). Conversely, Greisen et al. found PD-1 and PD-L1 knockout models showed signs of osteoporosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Our findings demonstrate the significance of PD-1/PD-L1 upregulation in excessive osteoclastogenesis and osteoclast function in humans as well. Of note, we found PD-1/PD-L1 signaling to play a pivotal role in osteoclast differentiation in the presence of RANKL in PJI.</p><p id="Par41">Intriguingly, while PD-L1 and nivolumab exhibited discernible effects on osteoclastogenesis and osteoclast resorptive function in the control group, these phenomena were significantly more pronounced in the PJI cohort. This could be due to the observed lower functional PD-1 expression in monocytes without infection or might be potentially modulated by different PD-1 protein isoforms arising from alternative splicing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. These findings suggest nivolumab as a potential preventive treatment against PJI-induced excessive osteoclastogenesis and that its usage in PJI may not adversely affect physiological osteoclast function. Cotreatment with PD-L1 and nivolumab resulted in reduced osteoclast formation compared to PD-L1 alone, indicating this therapeutic approach to be feasible in vivo. Additionally, this data suggests that off-target effects of PD-1 are unlikely to be involved in this mechanism and that instead PD-1 is the primary target of PD-L1 in PJI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par42">High-throughput sequencing technology revealed osteoclast-related genes and pathways affected by PD-1/PD-L1 signaling, further validating our findings. We identified upregulated pathways promoting osteoclast differentiation and survival, with negative implications for bone health. <italic>MMP1</italic> was the only gene affected by nivolumab treatment compared to the control suggesting a limited effect of nivolumab treatment in the absence of PD-L1. However, group comparison found that only a fraction of the up-/downregulated genes and pathways were common for the PD-L1 group compared to both the control and nivolumab treatment group, underscoring the intricate role of PD-1 signaling in osteoclast functionality. Using IPA, we identified canonical pathways and gene modules pertinent to PJI. Notably, an upregulated pathway related to osteoclast function was identified, which enhances osteoclast differentiation, survival, and bone resorption while reducing apoptosis. This pathway&#x02019;s upregulation was correlated with two crucial disease modules: &#x0201c;bone density&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;osteopetrosis,&#x0201d; suggesting a deterioration in bone health. These findings align with previously published results on the impact of PJI on the bone metabolism and underscore the need for a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms at play<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par43">Apart from bone remodeling, osteoclasts can function as antigen-presenting cells involved in cellular immunity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Activation of PD-1 signaling in T cells reduces antibacterial immunity in sepsis, which might be mitigated by a PD-1 inhibitor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. The use of PD-1 inhibitors has been successfully shown to prolong survival in animal models and was found to be safe for human use in sepsis in a phase 1b clinical trial<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Compared to systemic sepsis, PJI is a local infection associated with significant inflammatory upregulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, encouraging discovery of its potential as a novel treatment strategy in PJI. While this further suggests PD-1 inhibitors could be effective in treating PJI-related bone loss, the role of PD-1/PD-L1 in the clearance of PJI remains unknown. Our findings also demonstrate that PD-1/PD-L1 can reduce phagocytotic activity, a process reversible by nivolumab. Similarly, negative effects on phagocytosis induced by ligation of PD-1 were found in a previous cancer study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Up-regulation of the PD-1 receptor on monocytes has been associated with poor bacterial clearance and a decrease in the release of proinflammatory cytokines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. In this study, we demonstrated that treatment with PD-1 inhibitor nivolumab did not affect the internalization of xenobiotics. Neither PD-L1 nor nivolumab directly induced apoptosis of monocytes. These findings suggest that anti-PD-L1 treatment may be also safe to use in non-cancerous pathologies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>, especially when administered locally.</p><p id="Par44">This study also has several limitations, including its in vitro nature, patient heterogeneity, patient sample size, and the need for further elucidation of the underlying mechanisms. Furthermore, the use of osteoarthritic controls may underestimate the inflammatory response in PJI samples, as osteoarthritis also involves local inflammation. While our in vitro data provide evidence supporting the role of PD-1/PD-L1 signaling in osteoclastogenesis associated with PJI, further studies analyzing monocytes derived from PJI patients and controls, as well as in vivo PJI models, will be necessary to fully elucidate the functional significance of this pathway in a clinical setting. Nonetheless, our results open avenues for using nivolumab in PJI treatment to limit overshooting osteoclastogenesis without compromising monocyte functionality.</p><p id="Par45">In this study, we found PD-1/PD-L1 signaling to play a crucial role in overshooting osteoclastogenesis in patients with PJI. We demonstrated that this pathway not only contributes to the excessive formation and enhanced function of osteoclasts in PJI but also impacts monocytic phagocytosis, a process reversible by PD-1 inhibition. Our findings suggest that targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 axis could be a promising therapeutic strategy in managing PJI and addressing the high prosthesis failure rates post-treatment. This research paves the way for further investigations into the molecular mechanisms underpinning PJI and opens avenues for novel, targeted interventions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary information</title><p>
