However, how their functional capacities are encoded in their sequences and manifested in their structures remains largely unknown. Some lncRNAs bind to and modulate the availability of RNA-binding proteins, but the structural principles that underlie this mode of regulation are unknown. The NORAD lncRNA is a known decoy for Pumilio proteins, which modulate the translation and stability of hundreds of mRNAs, and, consequently, a regulator of genomic stability and aging. We probed the RNA structure and long-range RNA-RNA interactions formed by human NORAD inside cells under different stressful conditions. We discovered a highly modular structure consisting of well-defined domains that contribute independently to NORAD function. Following arsenite stress, most structural domains undergo relaxation and form interactions with other RNAs that are targeted to stress granules. We further revealed a unique structural organization that spatially clusters the multiple Pumilio binding sites along NORAD and consequently contributes to the de-repression of Pumilio targets. We then applied these structural principles to design an effective artificial decoy for the let-7 miRNA. Our work demonstrates how the sequence of a lncRNA spatially clusters its function into separated domains and how structural principles can be employed for the rational design of lncRNAs with desired activities.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">Mammalian genomes are pervasively transcribed, with tens of thousands of unique loci producing long RNA molecules that do not serve as templates for the production of functional proteins. These RNAs, which are collectively called long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) <sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>, closely resemble mRNAs on the molecular level: they are capped, polyadenylated, and usually spliced. Compared to protein-coding genes (PCGs), lncRNAs as a group are somewhat shorter, expressed at lower levels, and are more tissue-specific <sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. Whereas the catalogs of lncRNAs in mammals are well annotated, their modes of action remain largely obscure. The low abundance and large size of the lncRNA molecules make it difficult to apply the same biochemical approaches used for elucidating the molecular mechanisms of other classes of RNAs.</p><p id="P4">While most of the functionally characterized lncRNAs act in the nucleus, many other lncRNAs accumulate in the cytosol <sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> and plausibly act in post-transcriptional regulation. Specifically, modulation of the activity of RNA binding proteins (RBPs) or small RNAs by lncRNAs via competition for binding is one of the most commonly suggested modes of action for lncRNAs to date. The molecularly indistinguishable characteristics of mRNAs and lncRNAs make the latter effective decoys in theory. However, there are substantial doubts regarding the feasibility of the direct competition model in light of the low expression of lncRNAs compared to that of RBPs, and the consequently relatively few RBP binding sites offered by any lncRNA gene compared to the sites found throughout the transcriptome <sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. Understanding the features that turn lncRNAs into effective decoys is crucial for evaluating how common this mode of action is and for designing synthetic RNAs capable of competing with the activity of specific RBPs.</p><p id="P5">The NORAD lncRNA is one of the most abundant and conserved lncRNAs in mammalian cells <sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. NORAD presence is required to prevent chromosome instability in HCT 116 cells <sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> as well as prevent premature aging in mice <sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. Additional consequences of loss of NORAD were described in endothelial cells <sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> and in cancer cells <sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. NORAD accumulates to hundreds or even thousands of copies per cell, mostly in the cytoplasm <sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>, although nuclear localization and activity were also reported <sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. NORAD contains ~20 Pumilio Recognition Elements (PREs), which are binding sites for PUM1/2, two members of the Pumilio family of RBPs. PUM1/2 post-transcriptionally repress gene expression, and modulation of NORAD expression levels results in a corresponding transcriptome-wide change in the abundance of Pumilio targets <sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. While the total number of sites offered by NORAD is substantially higher than that offered by any other single gene and is comparable to the total number of PUM1/2 protein molecules in a human cell, it is still small compared to the total number of binding sites offered by all other Pumilio targets combined <sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. The formation of phase-separated NORAD-Pumilio (NP) bodies was recently shown to enable a more efficient competition for Pumilio binding by NORAD <sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P6">Little is known about the functionality of the non-PRE regions in NORAD. We recently used a massively parallel RNA assay to determine sequences within NORAD, mostly found near its 5&#x02019; end, which are sufficient for effective NXF1-dependent export of an intronless RNA <sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>, and a recent study has shown that this region binds RBM33 which is required for NORAD export to the cytoplasm <sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. Both the PREs and non-PRE regions within NORAD were recently shown to be required for effective NORAD recruitment into stress granules upon metabolic stress <sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. Additionally, a sequence in the 5&#x02019; region of NORAD was shown to be associated with RBMX protein and to be required for genome integrity <sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. We found that the sequence of NORAD contains 12 sequence-similar &#x0201c;NORAD Repeat Units&#x0201d; (NRUs) <sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. The Mendell lab recently showed that mutating all the PREs in NORAD is sufficient for abolishing its ability to prevent chromosome number instability in HCT116 cells and that a sequence containing only NRUs 7 and 8 is sufficient for this activity <sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> (NRUs 7+8 correspond to ND4 in the notations used by the Mendell lab). However, the function of the vast majority of the NORAD sequence, much of which is highly conserved among mammals, remains unknown, and it is unclear if and how it contributes to antagonizing Pumilio activity.</p><p id="P7">The structures of several lncRNAs were previously interrogated <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> using synthetic refolded RNA <sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>.</sup> More recently, transcriptome-wide methods provided additional structural data from within cells. These efforts resulted in important structural and functional insights for several lncRNAs <sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>. Yet, while <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> studies cannot reflect the impact of the cellular environment on lncRNA structure, transcriptome-wide studies typically result in low coverage and resolution per transcript. It is increasingly appreciated that inside cells, the structure of RNA is inherently dynamic <sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup>. This phenomenon is best described for riboswitches, for mRNAs undergoing splicing, and for the genome of several RNA viruses, where structural plasticity increases the functional capacity of the RNA. However, whether mammalian noncoding RNAs adopt alternative conformations during their life cycle and the functional importance of these conformations remains under-explored.</p><p id="P8">Here we combined <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> structural probing with affinity selection of a single lncRNA, resulting in high-depth and high-resolution maps reflecting the folding of NORAD inside human cells. We reveal that NORAD folds into discrete structural domains and undergoes a structural reorganization in response to certain stress stimuli. NORAD structural domains cluster together the Pumilio binding sites along its sequence and facilitate the ability of NORAD to de-repress Pumilio targets.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="S2"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>NORAD structure in unperturbed and stress conditions</title><p id="P9">In order to probe the RNA structure of NORAD within living cells, we applied the COMRADES method with probes targeting NORAD in HCT116 cells <sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup>. Briefly, base-paired RNA was crosslinked inside living cells using Psoralen-TEG-Azide, after which total RNA was extracted, and NORAD was pulled down using a tiling array of antisense biotinylated probes. Following RNA fragmentation, we employed click chemistry to attach biotin to the crosslinked RNA and pulled it down using streptavidin beads. Half of the resulting RNA - the &#x02018;interactions&#x02019; sample - was proximity ligated, followed by a reversal of the crosslink and sequencing. In the other half - the &#x02018;control&#x02019; sample - the crosslink was first reversed, after which the RNA was proximity-ligated and sequenced.</p><p id="P10">In order to characterize the structural organization of NORAD in different cellular conditions, we used untreated cells, cells treated with doxorubicin (Doxo), a DNA-damaging reagent previously shown to influence NORAD abundance and subcellular localization <sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>, and Arsenite (Ar), a reagent that leads to metabolic stress and a strong shift in the localization of NORAD to stress granules <sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup>. Analysis of the sequencing data showed that NORAD reads were enriched more than 1,000 fold following pulldown with biotinylated probes. Approximately 4% of all reads were chimeric, and ~1% represented the base pairing of NORAD inside human cells. In contrast, only &#x0003c;0.1% of the reads in the control samples in which reverse crosslinking was performed before the proximity ligation were NORAD:NORAD chimeras, demonstrating a good signal-to-noise ratio. Overall, the study identified 366,184 base pairing events, which enabled us to build high-resolution structural maps of NORAD inside cells.</p><p id="P11">We first examined the overall distribution of RNA-RNA interactions within NORAD. Replicates of untreated cells were highly reproducible, similar to those of Doxo-treated cells, and less similar to those in Ar-treated cells (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). Visual examination of the 2D interaction map revealed clusters of intramolecular interactions at the 5&#x02019; and 3&#x02019; ends of NORAD, with more focal long-distance interactions within the middle part of NORAD which harbors the Pumilio Recognition Elements (PREs). These clusters of intramolecular interactions were not present in control data obtained from cells where crosslinked reversal preceded the proximity ligation (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1A</xref>). Furthermore, some of the interactions coincided with the PRE regions (as discussed in detail below).</p><p id="P12">We next sought to test whether NORAD folds into distinctive structural domains. We applied the TopDom algorithm, originally developed for partitioning genomes into topological domains using chromatin conformation capture datasets <sup><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup>. We identified topological domains within NORAD that were highly concordant between replicates and similar between the untreated and the Doxo-treated cells (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B-C</xref>). In contrast, Ar treatment led to a substantial reduction of contacts between most NORAD regions, with a notable exception of the 5&#x02019; region (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). Taken together, NORAD folds into distinctive spatial domains within cells and undergoes global unfolding throughout most of its sequence in response to arsenite stress.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Dynamic changes in NORAD structure upon arsenite treatment</title><p id="P13">Analysis of chimeric reads revealed a marked reduction of intra-NORAD interactions following arsenite treatment, with a notable exception of the 5&#x02019; region, where a substantial number of interactions remained in Ar-treated cells (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). In order to formally test the changes in intra-NORAD interactions upon metabolic stress, we used DESeq2 <sup><xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> to compare the number of chimeras in windows of 10 nt along NORAD. This analysis showed a significant reduction in contacts throughout NORAD, except the 5&#x02019; domain, which was most pronounced within individual NRUs (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). Importantly, no such changes were observed in ribosomal RNAs (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1B</xref>). Inspection of the regions with the largest changes showed limited changes in the local structures (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C-D</xref>), but rather an overall reduction in interaction frequency in Ar-treated cells, suggesting the structure of the central and 3&#x02019; part of NORAD becomes globally unfolded upon Ar treatment, rather than adopting a particular alternative fold.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Spatial clustering of NORAD PREs</title><p id="P14">We next combined all the RNA-RNA interactions together and examined the boundaries of the structural domains identified by TopDom and the numbers of inter- and intra-molecular interactions in the context of the 12 NRUs, the 5&#x02019; region preceding them, and the 3&#x02019; region (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). In the following analysis, we focused on eight canonical &#x0201c;PRE clusters&#x0201d; found in alignable positions in the 5&#x02019; part of eight of the NRUs, with each cluster containing one or two PREs. These corresponded to the most prominent peaks in the PUM1 CLIP data from HCT116 cells <sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). These clusters correspond to 11 of the 15 PREs annotated in <sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. Four other PREs annotated in that study are in the 3&#x02019; parts of NRUs 2, 4, 6, and 8, and have weaker PUM binding in both the CLIP data in that study and in ENCODE data (only the additional PREs in NRUs 4 and 6 show evidence of endogenous PUM binding, <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>), and we refer to these as &#x0201c;supplementary&#x0201d; PRE clusters &#x0201c;2s&#x0201d;,&#x0201d;4s&#x0201d;, and &#x0201c;6s&#x0201d;. Domains typically contained several NRUs, with two domains corresponding to the 5&#x02019; region upstream of the 12 NRUs and two containing the 3&#x02019; region downstream of them. Interestingly, regions surrounding the PRE clusters had an overall lower tendency to form interactions with other RNA molecules (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>), which was evident for four of the eight PRE clusters in no-treatment and Doxo-treated cells and for all the PREs in arsenite-treated cells (<xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 2A</xref>). Upon Arsenite treatment, there was a strong reduction in the normalized number of chimeric reads corresponding to intramolecular NORAD interactions and NORAD interactions with other RNA molecules. This reduction was much less pronounced in the two 5&#x02019; domains that are overall much more G/C-rich than the rest of the NORAD sequence (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). Interestingly, the first 1/8 of the NORAD sequence, which was substantially less affected by Arsenite treatment, is also the part that is least capable of recruiting a reporter RNA to stress granules upon arsenite treatment <sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P15">When examining the predicted structures with the strongest experimental support (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> and <xref rid="F10" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 3</xref>-<xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">4</xref>), we noted that PRE clusters appeared to be in close spatial proximity to other PRE clusters, which was also evident when examining the distribution of chimeras formed by each PRE cluster, an analysis which does not rely on any explicit structure prediction (<xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 2B</xref>). In order to formally test whether spatial clustering of PREs takes place, we analyzed the number of chimeric reads connecting regions &#x000b1;50 nt around the PRE clusters and compared them to random equidistant positions within NORAD. For 8 of the 10 PRE-containing regions, the number of chimeric reads with at least one other region was significantly (P&#x0003c;0.05, adjusted for the number of PRE cluster pairs) larger than expected by chance in all experimental conditions (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S2</xref>, <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref> and <xref rid="F10" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 3B</xref>). To validate spatial clustering of regions harboring distal PREs, we used a RNA-proximity ligation assay (RNA-PLA <sup><xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup>) with probes targeting different regions within NORAD, using a pair of probes separated by &#x0003c;50 nt as a positive control, as suggested <sup><xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>). We found a significant co-localization of the regions harboring PREs 1 and 10, separated by ~2,700 nt in the linear NORAD sequence, and to a lesser extent, between PREs 2 and 8, when compared to a negative control region not predicted to interact, between PRE 10 and 3&#x02019; end of NORAD (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>). Notably, the interaction between the 2s and 5 PREs could was not evident in the RNA-PLA, possible because it occurs more rarely, and so might not be evident in the relatively few cells profiled by RNA-PLA. The overall structure of NORAD thus positions PREs in close spatial proximity to each other in a manner that may facilitate the formation of NORAD-Pumilio bodies <sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> (see <xref rid="S10" ref-type="sec">Discussion</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title><italic toggle="yes">NORAD</italic> modular structure contributes to Pumilio antagonism</title><p id="P16">In order to study the contribution of different sequences within NORAD to its ability to inhibit Pumilio activity, we generated a reporter that contains 8 PRE elements within the 3&#x02019; UTR of Renilla luciferase (8XPRE). Firefly luciferase, used as a control, was expressed from the same vector under a different promoter. Expression was compared to that of a reporter where all the canonical PRE <underline>UGU</underline>AUAUA sites were mutated to <underline>ACA</underline>AUAUA, expected to abolish Pumilio binding (8XmPRE) (<xref rid="F12" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 5A</xref>), The mPRE control was designed based on a previously described Pumilio reporter <sup><xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup>. We have previously used a similar reporter containing 3 PRE elements and showed it to be sensitive to knockdown or repression of PUM1/2 in U2OS cells <sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>, introducing the reporters into cells over-expressing different NORAD variants is an effective and quantitative way to study the efficiency of NORAD sequences in inhibiting Pumilio activity. The 8XPRE reporter was de-repressed by ~4-fold after the combined knockdown of PUM1 and PUM2, allowing for a substantial dynamic range for measurements of Pumilio repression activity (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A-B</xref>).</p><p id="P17">We first compared constructs where we removed the 5&#x02019; region (bases 1&#x02013;573, &#x00394;5&#x02019; in <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>), a 3&#x02019; region (bases 4682&#x02013;5343, &#x00394;3&#x02019; in <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>), or the middle part of NORAD (bases 604&#x02013;4774, &#x00394;NRU in <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>) which contains all the PRE clusters. Expression of the WT full-length NORAD resulted in ~2.5-fold de-repression of the 8XPRE reporter compared to 8XmPRE (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). As expected, removal of the middle part of NORAD completely abrogated the de-repression (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). Removal of the 5&#x02019; region also had a significant effect, whereas removal of the 3&#x02019; region led to a significantly stronger de-repression than that caused by the full-length NORAD (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). The combined removal of the 5&#x02019; and 3&#x02019; modules (&#x00394;5&#x02019;+3&#x02019;) led to an effect similar to the removal of the 5&#x02019; end (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>).

This paired region is much more conserved in evolution than the &#x02018;disordered&#x02019; region between the two paired strands, and the predicted structure is supported by low reactivity in DMS-MaPseq data in HEK 293 cell lines (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A-B</xref>, data from <sup><xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup>).

In contrast, the removal of the &#x02018;disordered&#x02019; part had a limited and insignificant effect (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref>), and as expected had a limited effect on the folding of the region (Spearman&#x02019;s R=0.96 between mini-NORAD7/8 and mini-NORAD7/8&#x00394;disorded, <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>). Similar results were obtained in the context of the mini-NORAD3/4, where removal of the paired region reduced the ability to de-repress the luciferase reporter (<xref rid="F13" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 6A</xref>). We next wondered whether the structure of this region is sufficient for its function. We used RNAinverse <sup><xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup> to design two RNA sequences with the same predicted fold as the structured region but a different sequence and replaced the structure within the context of mini-NORAD7/8. Interestingly, this recoded sequence had a significantly impaired ability to de-repress the reporter (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref> left), despite similar folding for alternative sequence 1 (R=0.58), and to a lesser extent alternative sequence2 (R=0.32), suggesting that both the structure and the sequence in this region contribute to NORAD function. The changes also affected NORAD expression, and removal of the paired region in particular significantly impaired mini-NORAD expression, as evident when comparing also to the Neomycin resistance gene expressed from the same plasmid (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6F</xref>). We experimented with changing the amount of transfected plasmid, yet the &#x02018;&#x00394;paired&#x02019; variants were consistently expressed at lower levels, and so we could not attain comparable expression levels between the different constructs (<xref rid="F13" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 6C</xref>). Therefore, we conclude that the paired region may assist to stabilize NORAD while bound to Pumilio or may act through another mechanism. Interestingly, when the 7/8 hairpin region was deleted in the context of the full NORAD, it did not affect its ability to de-repress the Pumilio reporter (<xref rid="F13" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 6D</xref>), which was likely facilitated by the maintained interactions between the other PRE elements (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>NORAD elements can be co-opted to inhibit other repressors</title><p id="P22">In order to test if the design principles of NORAD RNA can be utilized to inhibit other RNA binding proteins, we generated a synthetic RNA, mini-NORAD-let7, based on the &#x00394;disordered version of mini-NORAD7/8, in which the three PREs were replaced with three CUACCUCA miRNA response elements (MREs) for let-7 a microRNA that is abundant in U2OS cells <sup><xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup> (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6G</xref>) and known to be functional in these cells <sup><xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup>.

Transfection of mini-NORAD-let7 into cells led to a significant de-repression of the reporter (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6H</xref>). The de-repression was twice stronger when using a vector with the structured element than for one without (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6H</xref>), despite the fact that they were expressed at the same levels (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6I</xref>). This de-repression was comparable to that obtained using a &#x0201c;sponge&#x0201d; vector for GFP (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6H</xref>), which carries six extensively complementary let-7 binding sites (alternating AACUAUACAAGGACUACCUCA and AACUAUACAAUGACUACCUCA, Addgene #29766). Replacing the paired region with one of the the alternative sequences described above, predicted to have a similar fold as the inter-PRE region, significantly reduced de-repression (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6H-I</xref>), consistently with the results in mini-NORAD7/8.

We identified chimeric reads linking NORAD with other RNAs and used DESeq2 <sup><xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> to evaluate the significance of the enrichment in COMRADES samples compared to the controls in which the psoralen crosslinking was reversed before the proximity ligation (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S4</xref>). Among non-coding RNAs, only U1 snRNA had a significant and reproducible enrichment of interactions with NORAD, most of which were localized in three regions and largely unaffected by the Ar treatment (<xref rid="F14" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 7</xref>). Interactions with mRNAs appeared in other regions and were spread throughout the NORAD locus with a notable peak between NRUs 2 and 3 and in the &#x02018;disordered&#x02019; region between NRUs 7 and 8, and their pattern was also largely unaffected by Ar treatment (<xref rid="F14" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 7</xref>).</p><p id="P24">When grouping the chimeric reads by the interacting protein-coding gene, there were 32, 18, and 9 RNAs with a number of chimeras higher in the crosslinked cells compared to their controls in untreated, Ar-treated, and Doxo-treated cells, respectively (fold-enrichment &#x0003e;1.25 and P&#x0003c;0.05, <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S4</xref>). Five RNAs were shared between untreated and Ar-treated cells. These transcripts were neither significantly enriched for PREs in their 3&#x02019;UTRs nor significantly affected by NORAD depletion in HCT116 cells, suggesting that NORAD does not show preferential basepairing with other Pumilio targets (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A-B</xref>). However, transcripts enriched in each of the conditions were significantly more likely to be enriched in stress granules compared to other genes, with the most significant enrichment observed for transcripts interacting with NORAD in Ar-treated cells (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref>). Notably, there was no substantial difference in the regions of NORAD enriched with chimeric reads with the 2,462 genes enriched in stress granules (Fold-change &#x0003e;2, P&#x0003c;0.05) vs. regions chimeric with segments other genes (<xref rid="F14" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 7</xref>), suggesting that there is no particular region in NORAD that preferentially interacts with stress-granule&#x02013;localized RNAs.</p><p id="P25">As the stress-granule transcriptome was reported to preferentially include genes with specific characteristics, we analyzed the length and the G/C content of the mRNAs enriched in NORAD interactions and found that they had longer coding sequences (CDS), in particular when considering the enrichments in the Ar conditions, and higher G/C content throughout the RNA (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D-E</xref>). A longer CDS (but not UTRs) has been previously associated with stress-granule enrichment <sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup>. We then wondered if the differences in G/C content might reflect a general tendency for COMRADES to recover interactions of G/C-rich RNAs. To test this, we considered all the chimeric NORAD-NORAD and NORAD-mRNA reads, divided them into the fragments that mapped to NORAD and those that mapped to the mRNA, and computed the respective G/C content of each fragment (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7F</xref>). The G/C content of the mRNA fragments was similar between NORAD-mRNA hybrids and mRNA-mRNA hybrids in an un-enriched HCT116 COMRADES dataset, and matched the average mRNA G/C content, arguing against a strong bias in COMRADES data. Interestingly, within NORAD, in the NT samples, chimeric reads mapping to different NORAD parts were significantly less G/C rich than those mapping to NORAD and mRNAs and below the average G/C content of the NORAD sequence. In Ar-treated cells, NORAD-NORAD chimeras were more G/C-rich, fitting the increase in interactions in the G/C-rich 5&#x02019; module and the decline in interactions in the more A/U-rich central part (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>).</p><p id="P26">Intramolecular RNA-RNA interactions of NORAD, enriched in the proximity to the A/U-rich PREs and the A/U-rich SAM68 binding sites we described previously <sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>, are thus preferentially formed between more A/U-rich regions of NORAD, whereas the intermolecular interactions, presumably mostly occurring at the &#x0201c;outer surface&#x0201d; of the folded NORAD in the cell, are more G/C-rich, less sensitive to Ar stress, and preferentially connect NORAD with long, G/C-rich RNAs that travel to the stress granules upon Ar treatment.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="S10"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P27">Our structural analysis indicates that the structure of NORAD is modular, with separate 5&#x02019; and 3&#x02019; modules and a middle region containing the NRUs, each folded into separate modules (structural domains) (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7G</xref>). Furthermore, long-range interactions within the central region help position the PREs in the NRUs in a closer spatial proximity to each other than expected by chance, with a particularly strong interaction formed by an extensively paired region between the PREs in NRUs 7 and 8. We used these findings to design a &#x02018;mini-NORAD&#x02019; gene that can potently de-repress a Pumilio reporter and is thus instrumental for future studies of the ability of NORAD to repress Pumilio activity.</p><p id="P28">We suggest that the different modules within NORAD contribute to different aspects of its function. The two 5&#x02019; modules are substantially more G/C-rich and rapidly evolving than the rest of the NORAD sequence (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>) and do not contain prominent PREs. The 5&#x02019; modules contain the region that binds RBM33 and facilitates NORAD export from the nucleus <sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>, the sequences that were previously shown to be sufficient for an NXF1-dependent export of a single-exon RNA from the nucleus <sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>, as well as a region showing extensive interactions with the RBMX protein <sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. This region was also shown to be the least effective in recruiting a reporter RNA to stress granules upon Arsenite treatment <sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>, and we see its structure is least affected by Arsenite treatment (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). We find that this region is important for the ability of NORAD to inhibit Pumilio repression, and suggest that it likely does so through ensuring efficient export of NORAD to the cytoplasm and/or its stability there, while potentially being responsible for additional functions in the nucleus through its interaction with RBMX.</p><p id="P29">The functions of the 3&#x02019; part of NORAD remain enigmatic. In our experimental setup, we find that it limits the ability of NORAD to inhibit Pumilio function, potentially by limiting its expression. One potential reason could be that without this region, the PREs in NORAD become physically closer to its poly(A) tail, a feature associated with more efficient repression by Pumilio proteins <sup><xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup>. It is possible that one function of the 3&#x02019; module is thus to provide a &#x0201c;buffer&#x0201d; between the PREs in the NRUs and the poly(A) tail and thus limit the ability of the NORAD PREs to induce its degradation. It is also possible that this region, which contains many bases conserved in evolution, also serves additional, Pumilio-unrelated, functions.</p><p id="P30">It was recently shown that NORAD nucleates the formation of phase-separated PUM condensates, termed NORAD-PUM (NP) bodies <sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. Our results complement this model, as they suggest the structure of NORAD helps position some of the PREs in close spatial proximity to each other in a manner that likely increases NP body formation efficiency. For instance, it was demonstrated that four but not two PREs are sufficient for NP formation, but only in a specific context, as mRNA 3&#x02019; UTRs with multiple PREs did not efficiently promote NP body formation <sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. mini-NORAD7/8 contains three spatially co-located PREs and additional U/A-rich sequences that can potentially also bind Pumilio proteins or proteins that can interact with the Pumilio proteins, such as SAM68 <sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. Single NRUs 7 or 8, with just one or two PREs, do not appear to be sufficient for potent Pumilio de-repression that requires both PRE clusters, as well as the paired structured regions connecting them. The structured regions connecting NORAD PREs thus likely mediate its efficient ability to form NP bodies that are absent in Pumilio-bound multi-PRE 3&#x02019; UTRs. Further, NP-bodies were shown to increase in size upon DNA damage induction, and interestingly, we find that the number of significant PRE-PRE interactions becomes higher upon Doxorubicin treatment (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>).</p><p id="P31">We report that Ar treatment, which leads to a prominent shift of NORAD localization to stress granules <sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup>, also results in a structural rearrangement within NORAD, which includes a major reduction in intra-molecular contacts within most of NORAD sequence, with a notable exception of the 5&#x02019; module, and, to a lesser extent, a reduction in inter-molecular contacts with other RNAs. We cannot exclude the possibility that the stress granule environment is less accessible for the psoralen probing reagent we use, which may underlie some of these changes. Interestingly, Ar treatment overall did not affect the clustering of the PREs within NORAD, which remained significant (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>), and correspondingly, NORAD over-expression prior to Ar treatment de-repressed the Pumilio reporter as efficiently as in untreated cells (<xref rid="F13" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 6E</xref>). The changes in NORAD structure upon Ar treatment thus do not appear to impact the ability of NORAD to inhibit Pumilio but may have other unrelated, stress-granule&#x02013;related functions. Notably, we did not observe any large-scale changes in the numbers or morphology of stress granules in NORAD-depleted Ar-treated cells.</p><p id="P32">One limitation of our study is that whereas we characterized NORAD structure in cells where it is expressed endogenously at physiological levels, for the luciferase reporter assays, we use an over-expression setting in WT cells, in which NORAD levels are higher than in the physiological setting. The advantage of this approach is that in U2OS cells, it allows us a large dynamic range of up to ~4-fold de-repression of our sensitive 8XPRE reporter, which is better than what was observed in WT or NORAD<sup>&#x02013;/&#x02013;</sup> HCT116 cells upon NORAD expression (<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> and <xref rid="F13" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 6F</xref>). Our experimental model thus allows us to effectively measure differences between the different NORAD variants. Notably, several features that we observed in this setting closely match those observed in a stable expression system, such as the requirement of the canonical PREs for NORAD function and the observation that NRUs 7 and 8 are sufficient for suppressing the chromosomal instability resulting from NORAD loss <sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P33">A recent study has characterized the folding of the NORAD in vitro by the nextPARS approach, which allows measurements of reactivities of individual bases that can be used to inform structure predictions <sup><xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup>. This structure is concordant with our finding that NRUs mostly fold independently, with occasional inter-NRU interactions, in particular between NRUs 1&#x02013;10. When we originally characterized the 12 NRUs and the similarities between them, we noted that several conserved elements, including a small and a larger hairpin, are peculiarly found in some NRUs and not others <sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. The nextPARS probing data analysis has suggested that, in fact some of the NRUs that do not contain these elements do fold into similar structures some of the time <sup><xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup>. Specific proteins that recognize and bind these elements have remained elusive so far. Based on our findings here, a sensible hypothesis is that these small structured elements mainly function in the context of the broader &#x02018;task&#x02019; of the overall NORAD structure to spatially position the PREs at favorable distances and orientations relative to one another. This can explain the tolerance of NRUs in evolution, where individual NRUs lost some of the elements that were presumably present in the ancestral NRU prior to its duplication.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="S11"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S12"><title>Cell culture</title><p id="P34">HCT116 cells (ATCC) and NORAD<sup>&#x02013;/&#x02013;</sup> HCT116 cells (kind gift from Joshua Mendell) ere cultured in McCoy&#x02019;s 5a medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 100 U of penicillin/0.1 mg mL<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> streptomycin.

We also performed the mapping against a database that consisted of the NORAD sequence alone, which recovered approximately 10% more NORAD:NORAD chimeras, without noticeably altering the pattern of interactions.</p><p id="P39">We obtained 2M-11M unique mapped reads per replicate experiment, of which 3&#x02013;4% were chimeric reads; in the untreated and Doxo experiments, 0.8&#x02013;1.3% of all mapped reads were NORAD:NORAD chimeras, while in Ar experiments, 0.2&#x02013;0.3% of reads were NORAD:NORAD chimeras. In the control experiments, in which the order of UVC irradiation and proximity ligation was reversed, the fraction of NORAD:NORAD chimeras ranged from 0.02% to 0.12%. Between 3 and 19% of all mapped reads, chimeric or non-chimeric, were mapped to NORAD in the NT, Ar, and Doxo datasets. By contrast, 0.002% of reads were mapped to NORAD in a control COMRADES experiment that did not include NORAD pulldown.</p><p id="P40">Pearson correlations between replicate experiments were calculated using numbers of NORAD:NORAD chimeras in 100 nt x 100 nt windows, and were plotted in R using the &#x0201c;corrplot&#x0201d; package. The same data was used for the hierarchical clustering of the experiments. 2-dimensional maps of chimera coverage were generated using Java Treeview. To calculate topological domains alongside NORAD, we used the coverage of chimeras in 10 nt x 10 nt windows as an input matrix for TopDom <sup><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup>, and ran TopDom with window.size=30, which resulted in an effective window size of 300 nt.

The direction of change was distinguished using log fold change values, and &#x02013;log<sub>10</sub> p-values (capped at 2/&#x02013;2) were used to plot the interaction heatmap in R, where color intensity reflects statistical significance.

The color of arcs represents the p-values, which were calculated by counting the interactions between two connected PRE sites with a 50nt radius (e.g. between PRE1:710&#x02013;817 and PRE2:1087&#x02013;1195), and comparing it to 50nt circular permutations along the genome (e.g. 760&#x02013;867 and 1137&#x02013;1195, and so on) using independent t-tests. The resulting p-values were then subjected to Bonferroni correction before plotting.</p><p id="P43">NORAD secondary structures were predicted using the comradesFold pipeline (Ziv et al. 2018), and the structures were plotted in VARNA. comradesFold generates a set of folding constraints from hyb files, which is then shuffled randomly 1,000 times, and used for structure prediction using hybrid-ss-min. The whole NORAD secondary structure was generated as 6 parts: 1&#x02013;760, 761&#x02013;2050, 2051&#x02013;2630, 2631&#x02013;3400, 3401&#x02013;4150, and 4151&#x02013;5339, each combining domains determined by the TopDom algorithm, with slight adjustments to preserve high confidence structures.

Horizontal lines indicate the average G/C content in mRNAs (weighted averages of the 5&#x02019;UTRs, CDS, and 3&#x02019;UTRs) and the average G/C content of the NORAD sequence. Comparisons done using Wilcoxon rank-sum test. In <bold>B</bold>-<bold>F</bold> boxplots, the central box shows the interquartile range, and the whiskers extend from the box to the furthest data point within 1.5&#x000d7; the interquartile range and Wilcoxon rank-sum two-sided test P-values comparing the enriched and the other genes are shown above. <bold>G</bold>. Outline of the three major parts of NORAD sequence as revealed by COMRADES analysis. The upper part shows interactions between NORAD regions in untreated cells and it is taken from the heatmap in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>. The vertical green and cyan lines show the locations of the PRE clusters. Dashed lines indicate the approximate borders of the 5&#x02019; and 3&#x02019; modules.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS203434-f007" position="float"/></fig></floats-group></article>
