To extract characteristic features of the ensemble, these spatiotemporal profiles are typically summarized by their mean and variance, often requiring prior padding or resampling of the data to equalize signal length. Such compression can conceal essential information in the signal. This work presents the method of time-warping, reformulated as elastic functional data analysis (EFDA), in an accessible way. This powerful approach rescales the temporal evolution of signals, aligns them accurately, decouples their spatial and temporal variability, and faithfully extracts their characteristics. This technique was compared to conventional methods of normalizing or padding data followed by averaging, using synthetized signals with controlled variability and real human data from a complex manipulation task. Comparative analysis demonstrates that EFDA successfully reveals otherwise concealed features and teases apart temporal and spatial variability. Critical advances to the more common method of dynamic time-warping (DTW) are discussed. Application of EFDA and potential new insights are illustrated in the context of human motor neuroscience. Annotated code to facilitate the use of this technique is provided.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Computational neuroscience</kwd><kwd>Motor control</kwd><kwd>Time series</kwd><kwd>Neuroscience</kwd><kwd>Systems biology</kwd><kwd>Computational neuroscience</kwd><kwd>Data processing</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R37-HD087089</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sternad</surname><given-names>Dagmar</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BCS-PAC-2043318</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sternad</surname><given-names>Dagmar</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer Nature Limited 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Biological signals are noisy, both in amplitude and time. When repeated measurements are obtained from the &#x02018;same&#x02019; process, the challenge for the scientist is to extract the salient features that are characteristic to the process of interest. Typically, these spatiotemporal profiles are summarized by their mean and variance, often requiring time normalization by resampling and binning of the data. However, such data compression is prone to lose, or even distort, essential information. This paper aims to present elastic functional data analysis (EFDA), a recent development of the time-warping method, in an accessible way and highlight its benefits over other conventional methods with synthetic and some experimental data.</p><p id="Par3">This method has been developed in statistics and applied in computer animation and speech analysis, but only in few other domains where it may also be relevant<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. One reason may be that the technique is mathematically and computationally sophisticated and several variants of it exist that can present a hurdle for a newcomer to apply the technique to their own data. This paper aims to present one recent method for time-warping alignment in tutorial fashion, together with an annotated ready-to-use code and an example application to data from motor neuroscience, where this method has found little application. Thus far,&#x000a0;the goal of this paper is to motivate more frequent use of this data analysis technique.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>A first overview of time-warping</title><p id="Par4">Research in life science typically starts with raw data that are time-series with varying amplitudes and durations. Regardless of whether the time-varying metric is displacement, force, intensity, or any other physiological quantity, the analysis problems have much in common. Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A illustrates an exemplary ensemble of signals that was synthesized to have two peaks with normally distributed noise added to peak values and peak locations (see more in Section &#x0201c;<xref rid="Sec6" ref-type="sec">Benefits of time-warping shown on a synthetic dataset as ground truth</xref>&#x0201d;). Inspection of these curves reveals common patterns and features of interest, such as maxima and minima, but with different intervals between those. Further analysis often necessitates discrete estimates of temporal and spatial features, but quantification of, for example, peak amplitude might be challenged by its varying location and shape and by the trials&#x02019; different overall durations and number of samples.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Averaging time-series with spatial and temporal variability.

The mean and standard deviations may be then readily calculated at every time point across the entire signal, rendering the mean time-series in red with the shaded band indicating standard deviations at every time point. This averaging procedure not only masks or inflates the salient features, but may even create false features that were not present in the original signals (the red averaged signal created an additional small peak at the end).</p><p id="Par6">Evidently, when padding the time-series, the number of samples in the later portions of the time-series decreases and confounds the calculation of the means in these portions. Therefore, a second, more frequently used method is assuming both a common start and end, normalizing the different trial durations to 100% and re-sampling the data uniformly across the different realizations (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>C). The means and standard deviations calculated at every time point then exhibit a different summary of the spatiotemporal evolution. The example here shows a slightly distorted and slower rise to the second peak, compared to the individual time-series and the zero-padded mean. This is the typical case resulting in underestimating peak values and overestimating peak widths.</p><p id="Par7">In addition, variability estimates may also become unreliable. Spatial variability is readily assessed by examining standard deviations of salient features, such as amplitude peaks; temporal variability is assessed by standard deviations of movement time or intervals between chosen landmarks. The variability of an ensemble of time-series is also estimated by the standard deviations at every time point integrated over the time-series, as shown by the shaded band around the mean in Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B and <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">C</xref>. This can be summarized by the sum-of-squares or root-mean-square error (RMSE). However, this latter estimate is critically influenced by the signal&#x02019;s temporal profile and duration, because the relevant peaks and valleys may be misaligned.</p><p id="Par8">Alignment of the features of interest, or registration of curves, was developed in statistics and is based on the concept of re-parametrization. Time-series are a special case of one-dimensional curves, and their re-parametrization is a mathematical expression of their temporal (horizontal) deformation.

In contrast, the experimental hand speed was affected to a similar extent by the spatial variability from varying peak heights and by the temporal variability from varying execution rates, as observed in each of the three participants. The temporal variability was similar between the two novices and the expert suggesting its pertinence to the human motor system without affecting the task outcome. In fact, the expert&#x02019;s high temporal variability may indicate its reduced relevance for the task.

However, several modifications have emerged since then, including the approach of Elastic Functional Data Analysis (EFDA) discussed in this work. The common concept shared between various approaches is time-warping, or re-parametrization of a curve, which is a nonlinear temporal stretching or shrinking of time<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. Such re-parametrization has the purpose of aligning two or more signals, called curve registration when generalized to higher dimensions (see terminology in Appendix <xref rid="Sec14" ref-type="sec">I</xref>). The differences between various alignment approaches arise from the choice of (1) landmark-based or continuous alignment, (2) optimization algorithm, and (3)&#x000a0;the distance metric between two signals.<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par40"><italic>Alignment</italic> can be based on preselected landmarks, such as extrema or inflection points, or can use the entire signal in an automated fashion.

To avoid these disadvantages, alignment can also be continuous, i.e., include every sample of the signals as demonstrated in the elastic functional data analysis presented here. This procedure does not provide explicit control over the landmarks and requires more advanced optimization procedures, such as minimizing the Fisher-Rao distance through iterative time-warping as in the method adopted in our work. Specific applications may benefit from combining semi-manual selection of landmarks and the following time-warping of the segments between the landmarks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par41"><italic>Optimization</italic> supports continuous registration, i.e., finding a warping function that would minimize a distance metric between the specified template and the warped signal.

Consider two similar displacement signals with different durations and apply conventional time-normalization dilating one signal and shrinking the other one. This raises the question whether the velocity of the dilated signal should be reduced proportionally to keep the total distance travelled invariant, or whether the velocity values should be kept invariant, essentially changing the total distance travelled. A similar issue arises with time-warping alignment. When the time-series represent velocity, as in our experimental example, alignment keeps its values invariant but changes the acceleration values (derivatives) and the cumulative distance travelled (integral). Depending on the research question, alignment may instead be applied to the time-series of the cumulative distance travelled or to the actuation forces, i.e., to its integrals or derivatives<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par44">Particular caution is also needed when studying variables with more than one dimension but of the same units, for example movements in two or three dimensions.
