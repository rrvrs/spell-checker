Although ESCRT core components are conserved among higher eukaryotes, the regulators that control the function of the ESCRT machinery remain elusive. We recently identified a plant-specific ESCRT component, FREE1, that is essential for multivesicular body/prevacuolar compartment (MVB/PVC) biogenesis and vacuolar sorting of membrane proteins. Here we identify a plant-specific Bro1-domain protein BRAF, which regulates FREE1 recruitment to the MVB/PVC membrane by competitively binding to the ESCRT-I component Vps23. Altogether, we have successfully identified a role for BRAF, whose function as a unique evolutionary ESCRT regulator in orchestrating intraluminal vesicle formation in MVB/PVCs and the sorting of membrane proteins for degradation in plants makes it an important regulatory mechanism underlying the ESCRT machinery in higher eukaryotes.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="web-summary"><p id="Par2">The ESCRT complex contributes to selective vacuolar degradation of membrane proteins.

Thus, the tight control of membrane protein homeostasis by selective vacuole/lysosome degradation is not only essential for the destruction of non-functional or misfolded proteins but also ensures proper cell signaling and facilitates interactions with the environment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. In this sorting process, membrane proteins are firstly ubiquitinated and subsequently sequestered into the intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) of the multivesicular bodies/prevacuolar compartments (MVB/PVCs) through the function of the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) machinery. Ultimately, the fusion of the MVB/PVCs allows the membrane proteins to be degraded in the lumen of the vacuole/lysosome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">The formation and scission of ILVs in MVB/PVC are mediated by the ESCRT machinery, which are assembled on the endosomal membrane into several protein complexes, termed ESCRT-0, -I, -II, -III, and the Vps4 complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. The <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genome contains most canonical ESCRT components, except for ESCRT-0 subunits and the ESCRT-I component Mvb12<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. It is suggested that other components might therefore act as non-canonical ESCRT-0 in cargo recognition in plants, together with the unique plant Fab1, YOTB, Vac1, and EEA1 (FYVE) domain protein required for endosomal sorting 1 (FREE1 or FYVE1)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. FREE1 is a phosphatidylinositol 3-P-binding protein, which also interacts with the ESCRT-I complex component Vps23. Consistent with the ESCRT mutants phenotype, in which the assembly or dissociation of the ESCRT machinery is disrupted, FREE1 loss-of-function mutants (T-DNA and RNAi mutants) are seedling lethal, resulted from defects in the formation of ILVs in MVBs, which eventually block endocytosed PM proteins, such as the auxin efflux carrier PIN2 and iron transporter IRT1, gaining access to the vacuole lumen for degradation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Although FREE1 has been assumed to be reserved for integral membrane proteins from the PM to vacuole degradation pathway, recent studies also show the involvement of FREE1 in the vacuolar degradation of the membrane associated ABA receptor, PYL4<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Moreover, it has also been shown that FREE1 manipulates autophagic degradation in plants by interacting with a unique plant autophagic regulator SH3 domain-containing protein 2 (SH3P2)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>.

According to our previously proposed model of FREE1 functions in the ILV formation and ubiquitinated membrane cargo sorting (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2A</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, depletion of FREE1 results in failure of ILV formation and consequently causes accumulation of ubiquitinated membrane cargo in endosomes and finally at the tonoplast. We then performed a series of experiments to test whether <italic>sof524</italic> mutants were able to restore the phenotype of <italic>FREE1-RNAi</italic> plants in membrane protein homeostasis. Consistent with controls of <italic>FREE1-RNAi</italic> without DEX induction, the DEX-treated <italic>sof524</italic> mutants expressing the auxin efflux carrier component PIN2-GFP were incubated in darkness for 6&#x02009;h to stabilize the fluorescent proteins in the lytic vacuole<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, green fluorescent protein (GFP) signals were observed in the root vacuole with the endocytic tracker FM4-64 at the vacuolar membrane (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>), suggesting that these proteins were indeed transported to the vacuole for degradation. In contrast, no obvious vacuolar accumulation of PIN2-GFP was observed in DEX-treated <italic>FREE1-RNAi</italic> plants, instead the internalized PIN2-GFP signal was found at the vacuolar membrane. In addition, similar results were observed for the recovery phenotype in boron-induced vacuolar degradation of the borate transporter BOR1-GFP in the <italic>sof524</italic> mutant (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>). To further establish how the <italic>sof524</italic> mutant restores the defect of <italic>FREE1-RNAi</italic> plants in sorting ubiquitinated membrane cargo for vacuolar degradation, we conducted immunoblot assays with the ubiquitin antibody (anti-UBQ) on membrane protein extracts of <italic>FREE1-RNAi</italic> and <italic>sof524</italic> seedlings. DEX-treated <italic>FREE1-RNAi</italic> seedlings accumulated ubiquitinated proteins at a higher level than those without DEX treatment. Interestingly, accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins is restored to the WT level in <italic>sof524</italic> mutant plants (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1f</xref>).

We speculated that the <italic>sof524</italic> mutant after DEX treatment can still form typical MVB structures with numerous ILVs, and therefore investigated MVB morphology at the ultrastructural level by performing transmission electron microscopic (TEM) analysis of ultrathin sections of high-pressure frozen/freeze-substituted samples. Consistent with previous reports on the morphology of MVBs in <italic>free1</italic> mutant root cells, empty MVBs lacking ILVs, which are nicely labeled by the MVB/PVC marker vacuolar sorting receptor (VSR) antibodies, could be observed in <italic>FREE1</italic> RNAi cells (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1g</xref>).

Moreover, cell biological analysis further revealed that the <italic>sof524</italic> mutant partially restored the loss of the FREE1 phenotype in terms of central vacuole morphology as marked by the tonoplast marker YFP-VAMP711 and the soluble lytic vacuolar cargo spL-RFP transport into central vacuole (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2B, C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>The <italic>sof524</italic> mutation affects the Bro1-domain protein BRAF</title><p id="Par9">To identify the mutated gene, <italic>sof524</italic> was firstly outcrossed to <italic>Ler</italic>.

AtBRO1/ALIX corresponds to a conserved multifunctional class of proteins extensively studied in yeast (represented by Bro1p and Rim20) and mammals (ALIX), which functions to recruit the de-ubiquitinating enzyme to remove ubiquitin from cargo<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> and also works for the selective sorting of ubiquitinated cargo at an early step in endocytosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>.

AtBRO1/ALIX has an N-terminal Bro1-domain, V-shaped central domain (V-domain), and a C-terminal proline-rich domain, whereas the remaining four proteins contain a single Bro1-domain. A BLASTP search using BRAF as a query retrieved no homologs outside the plant kingdom. However, a protein, named BROX, with a single Bro1-domain was also found in mammals but with unknown physiological function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. BRAF orthologs can be widely found in eudicots, monocots, and more basal classes of plant. The phylogenetic analysis shows that the plant BRAF proteins can be phylogenetically grouped into distinct classes and there seems to be a unique plant Bro1-domain protein with proposed functions distinct from animal and yeast Bro1-domain proteins (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>).

Hierarchical clustering of tissue-specific expression patterns of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> single Bro1-domain genes (without AtBRO1/ALIX) and FREE1 showed the nearest cluster between BRAF and FREE1, indicating their related function in plant development (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3D</xref>).</p><p id="Par11">To demonstrate that the point mutation identified in BRAF, hereafter called &#x0201c;<italic>braf-1</italic>&#x0201d;, is responsible for the survival phenotype of <italic>sof524</italic>, we performed complementation experiments by transforming <italic>sof524</italic> plants with <italic>BRAF</italic> under its native promoter (<italic>BRAFpro::BRAF</italic>) and the homozygous T3 seedlings showed a lethal phenotype in the DEX treatment (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref> and Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4A</xref>).

All these data point to a unique and specific interaction between BRAF and Vps23.</p><p id="Par15">To further analyze the interaction between BRAF and Vps23, we purified recombinant maltose-binding protein (MBP), MBP-Vps28A, MBP-Vps23A, and Sumo-tagged BRAF (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6B</xref>). In an in vitro binding assay, MBP-Vps23A bound BRAF, but not with the controls MBP or MBP-Vps28A (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>), indicating that Vps23A and BRAF can directly interact with each other. We further confirmed the specific interaction of BRAF and Vps23 in planta by immunoprecipitation (IP) between BRAF-YFP and Myc-tagged Vps23A or Vps23B with controls, including ESCRT-I (Vps28A and Vps37A) and ESCRT-III components (SNF7A and SNF7B), as well as by acceptor photobleaching fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET-AB) analysis between Cerulean-Vps23A or Vps23B and BRAF-YFP (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3e</xref> and Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6C</xref>).

To clarify the domain(s) in Vps23 that is(are) required for interaction with FREE1 or BRAF, we next generated different Vps23A fragments for Y2H interaction analysis. As shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>, the UEV, PRR, and the C-terminal SB region were dispensable for the interaction with FREE1, whereas the CC domain was sufficient for the interaction with FREE1. Similar results also showed that deletion of the CC domain of BRAF but not the N-terminal UEV, PRR, nor C-terminal SB domain abolished their interaction with the Vps23A. In addition, an in vitro binding assay using recombinant MBP, MBP-Vps23A(CC), and Sumo-tagged BRAF or FREE1 demonstrated that both BRAF and FREE1 can interact directly with the Vps23A CC domain (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>). Collectively, these results prove that FREE1 and BRAF interact with Vps23 via the same middle CC domain. Thus, the Vps23 CC domain can serve as an interacting surface for both FREE1 and BRAF binding. If this were true, FREE1 and BRAF should compete for the binding to Vps23. To test this hypothesis, we conducted an in vitro binding competition assay with purified MBP, MBP-Vps23A, FREE1, and BRAF. Relative quantification analysis of the pull-down efficiency in the competition assay demonstrated that an increasing amount of FREE1 in the binding assay lead to a reduction of BRAF binding to MBP-Vps23A, and conversely increasing the BRAF decreased the binding of FREE1 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>). Interestingly, compared to the WT form, BRAF(A330V) containing the <italic>sof524</italic> mutation has a lower competition ability with FREE1 in binding to Vps23A.

However, the existence of regulators modulating the ESCRT machinery in order to control MVB/PVC organelle biogenesis and maintain membrane protein homeostasis remains unclear. To summarize our findings, we first identified a plant Bro1-domain protein that regulates the ILVs of MVB formation by demonstrating (1) through both in vitro and in vivo biochemical analysis that BRAF is incorporated into the ESCRT-I complex and competes with FREE1 for binding to Vps23; (2) with genetic data, which show that depletion of BRAF increases FREE1 recruitment to MVB/PVCs, providing a rationale for the reversion of <italic>FREE1-RNAi</italic> phenotypes; and (3) that overexpression of endosome-localized BRAF gives rise to a seedling lethality phenotype as do FREE1 loss-of-function mutants with defects in the formation of ILVs in MVBs leading to the accumulation of ubiquitinated membrane proteins. These observations would seem to argue that BRAF is a regulator that negatively controls the formation of ILVs in MVBs in plants mainly through competing with the unique plant FREE1 protein for binding to the ESCRT-I component Vps23, an upstream component of the ESCRT pathway. This regulatory mechanism is distinct from the known positive regulators identified in higher eukaryotes, including the evolutionally conserved LYST-interacting protein 5 (LIP5) and IST1-like 1 (ISTL1) as its animal and yeast counterparts as well as plant-specific positive regulator of SKD1 (PROS), which coordinately regulate SKD1/Vps4 ATPase activity to catalyze the disassembly and recycling of the ESCRT-III components back to the cytoplasm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par26">The existence of such a pathway is meaningful, as receptors need to be constitutively turned over and recycled back to the PM for proper cellular functions as well as degradation. For example, the phytohormones auxin and gibberellin as well as cytokinin mutually coordinate their activities to regulate the abundance and polar distribution of PINs by modulating their endocytosis and endosomal recycling in response to different phytohormone interplay in different plant organs or tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>.

Our study may provide hints on an important regulating mechanism that a factor such as BRAF may modulate ILV formation through controlling the assembly of the ESCRT machinery.

Based on the findings of this study, we propose a working model of BRAF function in plants (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">10</xref>) as follows: (1) BRAFs are cytoplasmic pool proteins that can be recruited to MVB/PVCs via interaction with the ESCRT-I components Vps23, or to the PM upon their <italic>S</italic>-acylation; (2) upon their de-acylation, the PM-localized BRAF proteins are released from the PM into the cytoplasm, resulting in increased cytosolic pool of BRAF for MVB/PVCs recruitment; (3) at the MVB/PVC membrane, BRAF competes with FREE1 through direct binding to the ESCRT-I component Vps23, thus negatively regulating FREE1 recruitment to MVB/PVCs; and (4) the <italic>sof524</italic> mutant contains BRAF(A330V) mutation in the <italic>FREE1-RNAi</italic> plants. The BRAF(A330V) has a lower competition ability with FREE1 in binding to Vps23.
