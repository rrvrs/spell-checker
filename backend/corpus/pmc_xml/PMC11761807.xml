Oral microbes play a crucial role in the development of oral chronic inflammation diseases such as gingivitis and periodontal disease (<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">Signat et al., 2011</xref>) (<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">Mei et al., 2020</xref>). It has become increasingly appreciated that microbial-host cell interaction affects local immune responses in the oral cavity and may also profoundly affect systemic health through inflammatory pathways (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">Gao et al., 2018</xref>) (<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">Le Bars et al., 2017</xref>). To maintain homeostasis, the gingival epithelium provides a physical and biological barrier responsible for host defense yet is frequently challenged by pathogenic bacteria. Therefore, understanding the interaction between oral bacteria and host tissues is essential for both local oral health and the prevention of systemic diseases. To understand the exact role of oral microorganisms in diseases, the coculture system, which allows for the simultaneous cultivation of bacteria and host cells, has become an essential tool in this field. By simulating the interaction between anaerobes and host cells, we can better understand the pathogenic mechanisms of these microorganisms in certain disease models and even explore their potential role in systemic diseases (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">Fofanova et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, studying the coculture of oral microorganisms and host cells is significant in promoting a scientific understanding of the relationship between the oral cavity and systemic health.</p><p id="P4">However, there are significant limitations in current bacterial-host cell coculture systems, particularly when involving anaerobic bacteria (<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>). In traditional cell culture systems, anaerobic bacteria are typically introduced directly into the normoxic culture medium, which presents several challenges. First, anaerobic bacteria often struggle to maintain viability in these environments due to the presence of oxygen (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">Jalili-Firoozinezhad et al., 2019</xref>). This significantly impairs their growth and metabolism, limiting the duration of studies to less than 12 hours (<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">Mountcastle et al., 2020</xref>). Second, the oral environment naturally contains distinct normoxic and anaerobic gradients, exposing cells and bacteria to varying oxygen levels (<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">Xu et al., 2015</xref>). Without replicating these oxygen gradients, it is difficult to fully simulate the physical and chemical properties of the oral cavity, making coculture systems less representative of actual physiological conditions (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">Albenberg et al., 2014</xref>). Lastly, the conventional method fails to effectively simulate the complex process by which bacteria invade host cells, limiting the relevance and accuracy of the long-term models in reflecting <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> conditions (<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">Mountcastle et al., 2020</xref>). As a result, these limitations hinder the ability to fully understand oral bacterial pathogenesis and necessitate the development of improved coculture techniques that better simulate the natural interactions between anaerobic bacteria and host cells. To date, <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> devices to mimic the gingival pockets are largely complex and do not necessarily allow for facile characterization of microbe-host interactions (<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">Makkar et al., 2023</xref>) (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">Adelfio et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p id="P5">To address these gaps, we propose an asymmetric gas coculture system to recapitulate an oxygen gradient within the interface of the host and oral anaerobes, which allows for studying bacterial invasion and infection under physiologically relevant conditions (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Although this setup has been employed for interrogating the gut microbe-host interactions <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic>, to the best of our knowledge, a similar system has not been used for characterizing the interplay between oral microbes and the host (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">Fofanova et al., 2019</xref>). As a proof-of-concept, we employed <italic toggle="yes">Fusobacterium nucleatum</italic> (<italic toggle="yes">Fn</italic>), a key oral pathobiont, to demonstrate the utility and advantages of our system. <italic toggle="yes">Fn</italic> is of particular interest due to its ability to invade gingival epithelial cells and its association with both periodontal disease and systemic conditions such as gastrointestinal cancers (<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">Lai et al., 2022</xref>) (<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">Stokowa-So&#x00142;tys et al., 2021</xref>). We demonstrate that our coculture system outperforms traditional platforms by recapitulating the oxygen gradient, allowing oral anaerobes to thrive under anaerobic conditions while maintaining oral epithelial cells at physiological oxygen levels (i.e., the normoxic condition). This approach holds the potential to advance our understanding of microbial pathogenesis in oral and systemic diseases and serves as a valuable platform for drug screening and therapeutic development.</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>The asymmetric gas chamber maintains the viability of telomerase-immortalized gingival keratinocytes (TIGKs)</title><p id="P6">Different regions in the oral cavity are exposed to varying levels of oxygen, influenced by factors such as proximity to oxygen-rich surfaces (like the open air and saliva) and oxygen-consuming bacterial communities. At the bacterial-host interface, these gradients become even more pronounced due to the metabolic activity of both the host cells and the microbial community (<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">Kenney and Ash, 1969</xref>) (<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">Mettraux et al., 1984</xref>). Thus, an asymmetric gas chamber was developed to mimic the distinct oxygen gradients in the oral cavity. The experimental setup utilized a monolayer of telomerase-immortalized gingival keratinocytes (TIGKs) cultured on Transwell inserts (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). The apical compartment was maintained under anaerobic conditions, while the basolateral chamber was supplied with a 10% oxygen gas mixture, simulating two distinct culture environments (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). This setup contrasts with conventional methods, which expose host cells and anaerobes to uniform normoxic conditions. To recapitulate an oxygen concentration gradient within the interface of oral epithelial cells and anaerobes established by the gingival epithelium, we used the TIGK cell line, which was previously developed to enable <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> studies while maintaining biological characteristics similar to human primary gingival epithelial cells (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">Bailey et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p id="P7">Before transferring TIGKs into the asymmetric gas coculture chamber, the cells&#x02014;exhibiting a polygonal shape, close packing, and large, round nuclei&#x02014;were first seeded in Transwell inserts in Dermal Cell Basal Medium (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S1</xref>) (<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">Holm and Qu, 2022</xref>). After 24 h of attachment, the medium was replaced with Dulbecco&#x02019;s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM), in which calcium ions promoted differentiation of the TIGKs, leading to the formation of a tight monolayer on the collagen IV-coated membrane in Transwells (<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">Leonardo et al., 2020</xref>). Following 4 d of differentiation, the intact monolayer was examined under a microscope (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S2</xref>). After confirming monolayer formation, we transferred the Transwell inserts containing TIGK monolayers to the asymmetric gas coculture chamber and placed the entire setup in an anaerobic workstation (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Unlike typical Transwell assays where both apical and basolateral chambers utilize mammalian cell culture media to support the growth of host cells, we developed a chemically defined medium (cell-compatible medium, CCM) introduced in the apical chamber to allow for the maintenance of anaerobes without affecting the viability of TIGKs in the coculture. After placing the asymmetric gas chamber in the anaerobic workstation, the basolateral chamber was stabilized for 3 h with a continuous supply of 10% oxygen at 0.5 standard cubic feet per hour (SCFH) to establish an oxygen gradient. This setup contrasts with the conventional methods, where TIGKs were cocultured with oral anaerobes under a uniform normoxic culture condition in a 5% CO<sub>2</sub> incubator (<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">Kasper et al., 2020</xref>) (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">Casasanta et al., 2020</xref>) (<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">Udayasuryan et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p id="P8">We first assessed whether the asymmetric gas chamber could affect the integrity of the TIGK monolayer in the absence of bacterial challenge. We used fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled dextran (molecular weight=4,000 Da) as a small molecule surrogate to characterize the formation of a tight biological barrier established by the differentiated TIGK monolayer and compared it to the undifferentiated state. 24 h after introducing FITC-dextran in the apical chamber, the fluorescence intensity of the media in the basolateral chamber was quantified to indicate the leakiness of the TIGK monolayer (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Compared to undifferentiated TIGKs, the diffusion of FITC-dextran through the Transwell under the normoxic condition decreased more than five times, suggesting the formation of a tight monolayer barrier. Moreover, the intactness of the differentiated monolayer under the asymmetric condition remained comparable to that of the normoxic condition. Additionally, bright-field imaging of the monolayers showed minimal changes with regards to cell shape or monolayer intactness after 24 h under asymmetric conditions compared to normoxic conditions (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). Notably, the collagen coating affects bright field imaging due to the presence of collagen fibers, which can obscure the details of the cells or structures being observed compared to the uncoated surface (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">Hashimoto et al., 2020</xref>) (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S1</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref>). The monolayer cells were further dissociated to measure cell viability by flow cytometry. SYTOX Green, a cell viability dye, was applied to quantify the percentage of dead cells. Due to its strong binding affinity to nucleic acids, this dye emits an intense fluorescence in membrane-compromised dead cells. Flow cytometry analysis with SYTOX Green staining indicated no significant increase in cell death under asymmetric conditions compared to normoxic conditions (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S3</xref>). These results validate that the asymmetric gas chamber maintains the viability and functionality of TIGK monolayers, providing a robust platform for the following studies on characterizing the interactions between anaerobic bacteria and gingival epithelial cells.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>The asymmetric gas coculture system preserves the viability of <italic toggle="yes">Fusobacterium nucleatum</italic></title><p id="P9">In conventional studies of oral anaerobic bacteria-cell interactions, anaerobes such as <italic toggle="yes">F. nucleatum</italic> (<italic toggle="yes">Fn</italic>) are introduced into well plates or Transwells with epithelial cells or other host cell types in a static incubator containing 5% CO<sub>2</sub> and ambient oxygen levels (<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2023</xref>) (<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">Koido et al., 2022</xref>). We speculate that traditional normoxic conditions can compromise the viability of anaerobes (<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">Han et al., 2000</xref>). In comparison, our asymmetric gas coculture chamber places a monolayer of gingival epithelial cells such as TIGKs as a physiologically relevant barrier between the two chambers, allowing anaerobes to be cultured in the apical chamber under anaerobic conditions. This ensures that the monolayer of TIGKs reduces oxygen diffusion from the basolateral chamber to the apical chamber, recapitulating an oxygen gradient present on the mucosal surfaces (<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al., 2011</xref>). We hypothesized that utilizing this asymmetric coculture chamber can preserve the viability of <italic toggle="yes">Fn</italic> in the apical chamber compared to the conventional coculture methods under normoxic conditions. To validate this hypothesis, we first tested two commonly used <italic toggle="yes">Fn</italic> type strains (<italic toggle="yes">Fn</italic> 23726 and <italic toggle="yes">Fn</italic> 25586). Instead of using a high multiplicity of infection (MOI) in the literature (<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2022</xref>) (<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">Udayasuryan et al., 2024</xref>), which may not be physiologically relevant, we chose an MOI of 1. Bacteria were seeded in the apical chambers of Transwells under asymmetric or normoxic conditions. After 24 h, flow cytometry revealed a significant reduction in bacterial viability under normoxic conditions, with viability decreasing by over 70% for <italic toggle="yes">Fn</italic> 23726. In contrast, the asymmetric gas chamber preserved bacterial viability, comparable to strictly anaerobic conditions (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">C</xref>). Similar findings were observed in <italic toggle="yes">Fn</italic> 25586, showing that the asymmetric gas coculture system could maintain the viability of <italic toggle="yes">Fn</italic> 25586 better than the conventional normoxic coculture condition. We reason that oxygen exposure may have compromised bacterial viability under the normoxic condition, affecting how bacteria interact with gingival epithelial cells (<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">Robinson et al., 2020</xref>). In comparison, the asymmetric gas coculture system offers certain advantages when bacterial viability is critical for characterizing anaerobe-host interactions under physiologically relevant conditions.</p><p id="P10">In addition to using SYTOX green for measuring bacterial viability, we quantified and compared the temporal changes of colony-forming units (CFUs) of <italic toggle="yes">Fn</italic> 23726 and <italic toggle="yes">Fn</italic> 25586 in the apical chambers of Transwells with differentiated TIGKs under asymmetric or normoxic coculture conditions. At 0, 12, and 24 h post <italic toggle="yes">Fn</italic> inoculation with an MOI of 1, small aliquots were removed from the apical chamber, serially diluted, and plated on Columbia blood agar plates for CFU quantification. For both <italic toggle="yes">Fn</italic> 23726 and <italic toggle="yes">Fn</italic> 25586, relative to the initial bacterial concentrations, there were 10&#x02013;100-fold decreases in CFUs under the normoxic coculture at the 24-h endpoint, consistent with the reduced viability of <italic toggle="yes">Fn</italic> strains under the same condition, as evidenced by the SYTOX green staining. However, bacterial concentrations increased over time under the asymmetric coculture condition, suggesting that the viability of <italic toggle="yes">Fn</italic> was maintained (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2E</xref>). To confirm if the improved viability was due to the limited oxygen exposure in the apical chamber of the asymmetric coculture system, we performed a control experiment in which <italic toggle="yes">Fn</italic> strains were added to the apical chamber without the differentiated cell monolayer of TIGKs seeded in Transwells. As expected, in the absence of the intact monolayer, a marked reduction in bacterial viability was observed for both strains over time (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S4</xref>). Therefore, our findings underscored the essential role of the intact differentiated TIGK monolayer in generating an oxygen barrier between the aerobic basolateral chamber and the anaerobic apical chamber. Additionally, the asymmetric gas coculture setup offers an advantage over the conventional coculture system with uniform normoxic conditions to simultaneously support the viability of gingival epithelial cells and anaerobic oral bacteria.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Differential effects of <italic toggle="yes">Fn</italic> challenge on TIGKs under normoxic and asymmetric conditions</title><p id="P11">Impaired interactions between bacteria and their surrounding epithelium are responsible for bacterial infections (<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">Meyer et al., 1997</xref>) (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">Finlay and Falkow, 1989</xref>) (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">Finlay and Cossart, 1997</xref>). To assess the impact of <italic toggle="yes">Fn</italic> on the host cells in the asymmetric coculture system, we examined the changes in the morphology of the TIGK monolayer directly in the Transwell after coculture with three different <italic toggle="yes">Fn</italic> type strains (<italic toggle="yes">Fn</italic> 23726, <italic toggle="yes">Fn</italic> 25586, and <italic toggle="yes">Fn</italic> 10953) or the medium control for 24 h. In the medium control group, the cell monolayer displayed distinct cell junctions, with uniformly sized cells forming a flat, epithelial-like layer. In contrast, the cell monolayer cocultured with <italic toggle="yes">Fn</italic> exhibited irregular morphology with dense bacterial clusters adhering to the surface (indicated by red arrows) (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3D</xref>). Although the same MOI of 1 was used for all three <italic toggle="yes">Fn</italic> type strains, the formation of dense bacterial clusters was particularly pronounced in strains <italic toggle="yes">Fn</italic> 25586 and 10953, likely due to differences at the sub-species level (<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">Gursoy et al., 2010</xref>) (<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">Muchova et al., 2022</xref>). Nevertheless, these observations align with previous observations on co-aggregation and adhesive properties of <italic toggle="yes">Fn</italic> during interactions with oral epithelial cells (<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">Han et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p id="P12">We further characterized and compared the adverse effects of three different <italic toggle="yes">Fn</italic> type strains (<italic toggle="yes">Fn</italic> 23726, <italic toggle="yes">Fn</italic> 25586, and <italic toggle="yes">Fn</italic> 10953) on the viability of TIGKs under two different coculture conditions. Compared to the medium control (i.e., no bacterium in the apical chamber), coculture with <italic toggle="yes">Fn</italic> 23726, 25586, and 10953 resulted in ~20% reductions in TIGK cell viability under the asymmetric coculture system (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref> and <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3F</xref>). In comparison, there was no noticeable reduction in the viability of TIGKs under normoxic coculture conditions, likely because the viability of <italic toggle="yes">Fn</italic> strains was largely inhibited under the normoxic condition (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2E</xref>). Since <italic toggle="yes">Fn</italic> 25586 exhibited a statistically significant differential impact on the viability of TIGKs between asymmetric and normoxic coculture conditions, we further performed the FITC-dextran diffusion assay, in which the diffusion of FITC-dextran inversely correlates with the integrity of the cell monolayer. It was demonstrated that <italic toggle="yes">Fn</italic> 25586 increased monolayer permeability under asymmetric conditions, with fluorescence intensity in the basolateral chamber increasing by 50% over normoxic conditions (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>). In summary, these results emphasize the importance of the asymmetric coculture condition in demonstrating the severity of <italic toggle="yes">Fn</italic> infection and the impaired viability and barrier function of oral epithelial cells under physiologically relevant conditions.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Enhanced invasion and pro-inflammatory responses under asymmetric conditions</title><p id="P13"><italic toggle="yes">Fn</italic> is well known for its adhesion and invasion of oral epithelial cells (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">Groeger et al., 2022</xref>). Adherence to epithelial cells is necessary for colonization, while invasion allows the bacteria to evade immune surveillance and spread to distant organs (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">Casasanta et al., 2020</xref>) (<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">Han et al., 2000</xref>) (<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">Meyer et al., 1997</xref>) (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). Based on the above findings on the increased <italic toggle="yes">Fn</italic> viability and severity of <italic toggle="yes">Fn</italic> infection (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> and <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>), we hypothesize that the asymmetric coculture conditions may induce elevated adhesion and invasion of <italic toggle="yes">Fn</italic> to oral gingival epithelial cells. To test the hypothesis, we pre-labeled <italic toggle="yes">Fn</italic> with a red fluorescence dye (DiD) and conducted a short 2-h coculture with TIGKs to minimize the impact of bacterial proliferation (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">E</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S5</xref>). After 2 h, TIGK monolayers were extensively washed to remove free bacteria and stained by Alexa Fluor<sup>&#x02122;</sup> 488 Phalloidin specific for the eukaryotic cytoskeleton. Confocal imaging data suggest that <italic toggle="yes">Fn</italic> was more adherent under asymmetric conditions, particularly for <italic toggle="yes">Fn</italic> 25586 and 10953, indicating strain-dependent variations in invasiveness. To further remove unwashed extracellular bacteria to quantify intracellular bacterial loads, TIGKs were dissociated by trypsin and subjected to a cell-impermeable antibiotic, gentamicin, for 2 h. Subsequently, intracellular bacteria were released upon lysis of TIGKs by a surfactant (Triton X-100), and bacterial counts were quantified by plating serially diluted cell lysates on Columbia blood agar plates. As expected, the same trend was observed for each group&#x02019;s plating result after coculture. Within 2 h of coculture, <italic toggle="yes">Fn</italic> invasion was significantly higher under asymmetric coculture conditions than under the normoxic condition (2 h, an MOI of 50, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S6</xref>). <italic toggle="yes">Fn</italic> 25586 exhibited greater invasion into TIGKs than <italic toggle="yes">Fn</italic> 23726, further supporting the differential invasiveness of different <italic toggle="yes">Fn</italic> strains (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">Dabija-Wolter et al., 2009</xref>). Although high MOIs, such as &#x02265;50, were typically used for <italic toggle="yes">Fn</italic> coculture with host cells under the normoxic condition in the literature (<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2022</xref>) (<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">Udayasuryan et al., 2024</xref>), we reason that an extremely high MOI may not be physiologically relevant. Therefore, the monolayers of TIGKs were further infected with three different <italic toggle="yes">Fn</italic> strains with an MOI of 1 for 24 h under normoxic or asymmetric coculture conditions. Afterward, extracellular bacteria were eliminated by gentamicin. Intracellular bacterial counts were quantified by plating serially diluted cell lysates on Columbia blood agar plates. Under the asymmetric coculture condition, the intracellular bacteria counts were approximately 10<sup>5</sup> times higher than those under the normoxic coculture condition, where intracellular bacteria were almost undetectable (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>). This observation was consistent with the increased bacterial proliferation under the asymmetric coculture (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). Furthermore, <italic toggle="yes">Fn</italic> 25586 and 10953 exhibited higher intracellular bacterial loads with the same initial MOI of 1 than <italic toggle="yes">Fn</italic> 23726 under the asymmetric coculture condition (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>). These findings demonstrate that our asymmetric anaerobic coculture system effectively preserves the invasive characteristics of <italic toggle="yes">Fn</italic> in a physiologically relevant environment, which can be severely affected by normoxic conditions.</p><p id="P14">Besides serving as a physical barrier, the oral gingival epithelium also provides early immune surveillance to alert the presence of pathogenic bacteria. The direct contact between bacteria and the mucosal surface elicits the secretion of different immune cytokines and chemokines from epithelial cells (<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">Neurath and Kesting, 2024</xref>) (<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">Wright et al., 2011</xref>) (<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">Okada and Murakami, 1998</xref>) (<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">Kagnoff and Eckmann, 1997</xref>). Considering the higher invasiveness displayed by <italic toggle="yes">Fn</italic> 25586 and <italic toggle="yes">Fn</italic> 10953 over <italic toggle="yes">Fn</italic> 23726 (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> and <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>), we focused on <italic toggle="yes">Fn</italic> 25586 and <italic toggle="yes">Fn</italic> 10953 to evaluate the differential inflammatory responses from TIGKs under normoxic and asymmetric conditions. CXCL10 (IP-10), a key chemokine in the CXC chemokine family, plays a critical role in recruiting different immune cell types and is heavily involved in inflammation and immune regulation. Given the established link between elevated CXCL10 levels and oral bacterial infections of host cells (<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">Jang et al., 2017</xref>) (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">Groeger et al., 2022</xref>), we quantified the induction of CXCL10 using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Our results indicated that CXCL10 levels in the bacterial challenge group increased more than twofold compared to the baseline level of the unchallenged group under the asymmetric gas coculture conditions (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>). In contrast, under normoxic conditions, the increase in CXCL10 levels in the bacterial challenge group was less than one-fold compared to the unchallenged group. Furthermore, Luminex analysis of additional pro-inflammatory markers revealed significant upregulation of IL-6, IL-8, TNF-&#x003b1;, and IL-1RA (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4J</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S7</xref>), consistent with previous studies (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">Casasanta et al., 2020</xref>) (<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">Koido et al., 2022</xref>) (<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">Sheikhi et al., 2000</xref>). Of note, the expression of IL-8, a proinflammatory chemokine, has been suggested to be an important regulatory mechanism to induce neutrophil migration into the gingival sulcus (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">Bickel, 1993</xref>). Taken together, these results highlight the ability of the asymmetric gas coculture system to effectively mimic the proinflammatory responses and cytokine/chemokine secretion typically observed during oral infections, offering an advantage over conventional coculture models for studying bacteria-host interactions in a physiologically relevant environment.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Antibiotic susceptibility of intracellular <italic toggle="yes">Fn</italic> under asymmetric conditions</title><p id="P15">To demonstrate the translational potential for applied research, we explored the utility of the asymmetric coculture system for evaluating antibiotic treatment of bacterial infection. The invasion of <italic toggle="yes">Fn</italic> into host cells may contribute to increased resistance to antibiotics, leading to secondary infections (<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">Mountcastle et al., 2020</xref>). To assess the efficacy of commonly used antibiotics against intracellular <italic toggle="yes">Fn</italic>, in addition to gentamicin, we selected metronidazole and amoxicillin, two widely prescribed treatments for oral inflammation (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">Brennan and Garrett, 2019</xref>). We first demonstrated that extracellular <italic toggle="yes">Fn</italic> in the apical chamber of the asymmetric coculture was effectively inhibited by individual antibiotics, reducing bacterial counts by over three orders of magnitude compared to the untreated group (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S8</xref>). We then treated TIGKs with each antibiotic to investigate their effects on intracellular bacteria. Metronidazole and amoxicillin individually exhibited certain inhibitory efficacy against intracellular <italic toggle="yes">Fn</italic> 25586, reducing bacterial load by an order of magnitude, while their combination did not further reduce the bacterial loads (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4K</xref>). In comparison, metronidazole and amoxicillin inhibited intracellular <italic toggle="yes">Fn</italic> 10953, respectively, and their combined use significantly decreased intracellular bacterial load, reducing it to as low as 1% of the original level, which aligns with previous reports (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">Anyiam et al., 2024</xref>) (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">Dabija-Wolter et al., 2018</xref>) (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">Feres et al., 2021</xref>). These findings highlight the potential of our asymmetric oral coculture platform as a valuable tool for screening antibiotic susceptibility against intracellular oral pathogenic anaerobes, facilitating the development of targeted therapeutic drugs.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P16">This study highlights the critical need for physiologically relevant <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> models to study microbial-host interactions, particularly for anaerobic pathogens like <italic toggle="yes">Fusobacterium nucleatum</italic> (<italic toggle="yes">Fn</italic>). Existing coculture systems, while instrumental, fail to mimic the oxygen gradients inherent to the oral environment. The asymmetric gas coculture system developed here addresses these limitations by creating a controlled oxygen gradient that preserves bacterial viability and epithelial cell functionality. This innovation is particularly significant for studying anaerobes, whose growth and pathogenic potential are often compromised in traditional setups. The system&#x02019;s ability to maintain the integrity of both host and microbial components over extended periods provides a robust platform for investigating complex interactions, including bacterial adhesion, invasion, and immune modulation.</p><p id="P17">Regarding microbial pathogenesis and host responses, this work demonstrates that the asymmetric coculture model not only sustains bacterial viability but also recapitulates key pathogenic features of <italic toggle="yes">Fn</italic>, such as enhanced invasion and intracellular persistence. These capabilities are pivotal for studying how <italic toggle="yes">Fn</italic> contributes to periodontal disease and its potential systemic implications, including its role in cancers. Moreover, the increased secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines like CXCL10 and IL-8 under asymmetric conditions underscores the model&#x02019;s capacity to mimic innate immune responses observed <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic>. By enabling the study of pathogen virulence and host immune dynamics, this system offers a nuanced view of the molecular and cellular mechanisms underpinning microbial pathogenesis and host defense.</p><p id="P18">Beyond advancing fundamental understanding, the asymmetric gas coculture system has significant implications for drug discovery and development. The differential antibiotic susceptibility observed for intracellular <italic toggle="yes">Fn</italic> highlights the importance of testing therapeutics under conditions that closely simulate the physiological microenvironment. The system&#x02019;s ability to differentiate the effects of antibiotics on extracellular versus intracellular bacteria presents a valuable tool for evaluating targeted therapies. Furthermore, by maintaining the physiological relevance of bacterial and host interactions, this model could streamline the development of novel therapeutics for oral infections and related systemic diseases, bridging the gap between <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> studies and clinical applications.</p><p id="P19">Future work could focus on improving the system&#x02019;s capabilities by incorporating a flow-based setup that continuously supplies fresh medium to both bacterial and host compartments (<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">Makkar et al., 2023</xref>). Such an enhancement would allow for extended investigations of microbial-host dynamics over longer time frames, providing insights into chronic interactions and adaptations. Moreover, evaluating the system with a broader range of cell types, such as immune cells or fibroblasts, and oral commensals or pathobionts, would enable the exploration of differential host responses to various microbial species (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">Adelfio et al., 2023</xref>) (<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">Welch et al., 2016</xref>). These advancements could reveal key mechanisms driving oral health and disease and further establish the platform&#x02019;s utility for personalized medicine and therapeutic screening.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM1"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="SD1" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>Supplement 1</label><media xlink:href="media-1.docx" id="d67e764" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S9"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p id="P20">This work was supported by National Science Foundation CAREER (2238972) and National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research awards (R03DE031329 and R01DE030943).

The plate cap covers the gas-permeable plate , preventing contamination and leakage.

The lower compartment (i.e., the basolateral compartment) of the Transwell insert is filled with cell culture medium. The gas-permeable membrane at the bottom ensures unidirectional oxygen diffusion, creating an oxygen gradient throughout the coculture chamber. Basolateral gas flow containing 10% oxygen enters through the gas inlet , spreading evenly through the asymmetric coculture chamber with a magnetic stirrer . Exhaust gas is discharged through the gas outlet , completing the system&#x02019;s airflow (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">Fofanova et al., 2019</xref>). The figure was created using BioRender.
