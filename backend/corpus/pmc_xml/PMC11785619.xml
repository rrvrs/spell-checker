Since somatic BRCA mutations are rare in breast cancer (BC), this dysfunction frequently is the result of <italic>BRCA</italic> promoter methylation.

PARP inhibitor treatment of tumor organoids derived from the <italic>BRCA2</italic> methylated xenograft tumor tissue of the young patient showed a significant decline in cell viability, similar to organoids with somatic <italic>BRCA1</italic> mutation, while having no effect on organoids with <italic>BRCA1</italic> wildtype.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par4"><italic>BRCA</italic> promotor hypermethylation seems to be a rare event in metastatic BC but is preserved in subsequent xenograft models and might represent an attractive therapeutic marker for PARP inhibitors.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>BRCA promoter methylation</kwd><kwd>Triple-negative breast cancer</kwd><kwd>PARP inhibitors</kwd><kwd>Metastatic breast cancer</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Dr Hans Altsch&#x000fc;ler Stiftung</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Illumina</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>European Research Council</institution></funding-source><award-id>ERC advanced grant 694033 STEM-BCPC</award-id><award-id>ERC advanced grant 694033 STEM-BCPC</award-id><award-id>ERC advanced grant 694033 STEM-BCPC</award-id><award-id>ERC advanced grant 694033 STEM-BCPC</award-id><award-id>ERC advanced grant 694033 STEM-BCPC</award-id><award-id>ERC advanced grant 694033 STEM-BCPC</award-id><award-id>ERC advanced grant 694033 STEM-BCPC</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Diepenbruck</surname><given-names>Maren</given-names></name><name><surname>Volkmann</surname><given-names>Katrin</given-names></name><name><surname>Rouchon</surname><given-names>Adelin</given-names></name><name><surname>Palafox</surname><given-names>Marta</given-names></name><name><surname>Miragaya</surname><given-names>Jorge Gomez</given-names></name><name><surname>Preca</surname><given-names>Bogdan Tiberius</given-names></name><name><surname>Bentires-Alj</surname><given-names>Mohamed</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>the Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>the Krebsliga Beider Basel</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>the Swiss Cancer League</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>the Swiss Personalized Health Network</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Department of Surgery, University Hospital Basel</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>University of Basel</institution></funding-source></award-group><open-access><p>Open access funding provided by University of Basel</p></open-access></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par5"><italic>BRCA1</italic> is an important breast cancer susceptibility gene first identified in 1994 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Breast cells with heterozygous loss-of-function germline <italic>BRCA</italic> mutations can lose the remaining wild-type allele, resulting in homologous-recombination deficient DNA repair (HRD), which leads to accumulation of genetic mutations that drive breast carcinogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Consequently, germline <italic>(g)BRCA1</italic> and <italic>BRCA2</italic> mutations are associated with a lifetime risk of breast cancer of up to 72% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Typically, <italic>BRCA2-</italic>associated breast cancers are usually hormone receptor positive. Conversely, <italic>BRCA1-</italic>associated breast cancers are usually estrogen (ER) and progesterone (PR) receptor negative [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. However, only around 15&#x02013;20% of triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC) are associated with a <italic>BRCA1</italic> germline mutation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">Recent studies show that about 40% of sporadic, non-familial TNBC also harbor HRD due to silencing or dysfunction of <italic>BRCA1</italic> or <italic>BRCA2</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Given that <italic>BRCA1</italic> somatic mutations are uncommon and detected in only 3&#x02013;5% of sporadic TNBC, the main mechanism behind this seems to be the epigenetic inactivation of the <italic>BRCA1</italic> and <italic>BRCA2</italic> gene by aberrant addition of methyl groups in their CpG-rich regulatory regions (promoter CpG islands) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The methylation of <italic>BRCA</italic> promoter results in the reduction and/or loss of the BRCA protein abundance similar to that of germline or somatic mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The available studies assessing <italic>BRCA1</italic> and 2 promoter methylation in breast cancer have predominantly analyzed primary breast tumors with only one recent study by Bonnet et al. showing <italic>BRCA1</italic> promotor hypermethylation in 4% of metastatic TNBC samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Therefore, overall, there is scarcity of studies in assessing the prevalence of <italic>BRCA</italic> promoter methylation in metastatic breast cancer tissue and the prevalence of BRCA 2 in this patient cohort is still yet to be determined.</p><p id="Par7">The use of poly(adenosine diphosphate [ADP]&#x02013;ribose) polymerases (PARP) inhibitors is an elegant therapeutic strategy with compelling antitumor activity in patients with <italic>gBRCA</italic> mutated tumors. Through the concept of synthetic lethality, they induce selective tumor cytotoxicity, sparing normal cells and predicting a high therapeutic index [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. This has been successfully demonstrated in phase 3 clinical trials in patients with <italic>gBRCA</italic> breast cancers, especially of the TNBC subtype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">Whether therapy with PARP inhibitors can be extended to <italic>BRCA1</italic> promoter-methylated cancers is still under investigation. Interestingly, several recently published studies indicate that patients with advanced, <italic>BRCA1</italic> promoter-methylated TNBC also respond to PARP inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p id="Par9">The aim of our study was to assess the prevalence of <italic>BRCA1</italic> or <italic>BRCA2</italic> promotor hypermethylation in metastatic triple-negative and Luminal B breast cancer. Given that early studies show that <italic>BRCA</italic> methylation may confer sensitivity to PARP inhibitors, identifying <italic>BRCA</italic> promoter methylation in metastatic tissue (in particular TNBCs and Luminal B breast cancers) could further expand the use of this targeted therapy. Parallel to this, we aimed to investigate the response to PARP inhibitors in tumor organoids stemming from <italic>BRCA</italic> promoter-methylated TNBCs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par10">We assessed the prevalence of <italic>BRCA1</italic> and <italic>BRCA2</italic> promoter methylation in archival metastatic biopsies as well as in TNBC xenograft tissues.</p><p id="Par11">After identifying suitable biopsies in our archives, diagnoses of (metastatic) TNBC or Luminal B breast cancer were confirmed by a specialized breast pathologist (S.M.). Tumors were defined as triple-negative as follows: less than 1% of ER and PR immunoreactivity and absence of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) protein overexpression or gene amplification. Luminal B tumors were defined as ER-positive (&#x0003e;&#x02009;1%), HER2-negative cancers with a proliferation rate (Ki-67) of&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;25%.</p><p id="Par12">The technical protocol of the methylation analysis is well-established and part of our routine diagnostic practice: for each case, depending on biopsy size, a sufficient number of sections (usually, between 2 and 6 sections of 70&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m thickness) was used for DNA isolation (Promega Maxwell FFPE kit, applicable to both native and FFPE tissue). After bisulfite-conversion and low-level amplification, the DNA was hybridized to Illumina Infinium Human Methylation Beadchips (EPIC V1, 850&#x000a0;K), and the array read on an Illumina scanner (service provided by the LIFE&#x00026;BRAIN research platform, Bonn/Germany). The resulting data (IDAT format) were then preprocessed and normalized (SWAN), mapped to the genome and converted into beta values (which represent methylation state at each scanned site; all pre-processing via minfi) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].

The patient underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy with epirubicin, cyclophosphamide, paclitaxel and carboplatin, followed by wide local excision with sentinel lymph node biopsy a postoperative radiotherapy. She presented with a non-invasive local recurrence (ductal carcinoma in situ) 11&#x000a0;months later, which was treated with skin-sparing mastectomy and a Deep Inferior Epigastric Artery Perforator (DIEP) reconstruction. Over the following months, she had two more local recurrences at the mastectomy site, which were both again surgically excised, followed by second- and third-line chemotherapy. Unfortunately, she developed liver, lung and brain metastases for which she received multiple palliative lines of chemotherapy including Mitoxanthron, Methotrexate and Mitomycin. Importantly, she received genetic testing, and no germline mutations in <italic>BRCA1</italic> or <italic>BRCA2</italic> could be detected, so she was never treated with PARP inhibitors. Unfortunately, by January 2020 she suffered from significant disease progression, and she subsequently passed away, four years after the initial diagnosis, at the age of 29.</p><p id="Par23">Next-generation sequencing analysis of the locally recurrent tumor as well as the pleural metastasis revealed a <italic>BRCA2</italic> mutation in exon 11 (p.N1279S), which was somatic, given that germline testing for <italic>BRCA1</italic> and <italic>BRCA2</italic> revealed no mutations in either of these genes. <italic>BRCA2</italic> exon 11 (~&#x02009;65% of the coding sequence) is a coldspot, where missense variants are very unlikely to be pathogenic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p id="Par24">This alteration in the sequence results in the replacement of asparagine, which is a neutral and polar amino acid, with serine, another neutral and polar amino acid, at codon 1279 of the <italic>BRCA2</italic> protein (p.Asn1279Ser).

Advanced computational analysis of the protein sequence and its biophysical characteristics, including structural, functional, and spatial data, amino acid conservation, physicochemical variability, residue mobility, and thermodynamic stability, suggests that this missense variant is unlikely to disrupt the function of the <italic>BRCA2</italic> protein.

Despite a large tumor size of 45&#x000a0;mm, she opted for primary surgery and underwent a mastectomy with sentinel node biopsy, followed by four cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy with epirubicin and cyclophosphamide, as well as carboplatin and taxol. She subsequently gave birth to a healthy girl and is currently free of disease, 3&#x000a0;years after the initial diagnosis.</p><p id="Par26">Simultaneously, tumor organoids derived from the PDX model from the first patient with pleural TNBC metastasis with <italic>BRCA2</italic> methylation were treated with two different PARP inhibitors (Olaparib and Rucaparib) in three different concentrations (25, 50 and 100&#x000a0;&#x000b5;M).

The TNBC cell line MDA-MB-436 display a <italic>BRCA1</italic> mutation, the TNBC cell lines MDA-MB-231 displays a <italic>BRCA</italic> wildtype status. After PARPi treatment for 6&#x000a0;days, the tumor organoids from the xenograft models of the <italic>BRCA2</italic> hypermethylated patient showed a decline in tumor cell nuclei, in contrast to the organoids with BRCA wildtype, but similar to the <italic>BRCA1</italic> mutated organoids (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). These results further support the notion that <italic>BRCA2</italic> methylation leads to a similar phenotype as a <italic>BRCA</italic> mutation and that tumors with inactivation of <italic>BRCA</italic> through methylation may thus also benefit from PARP inhibitor treatments.

Importantly, our reported incidence may be an underestimation, since we also found <italic>BRCA2</italic> methylations in 6 out of 24 TNBC xenografts of which unfortunately, we did only have the primary tumor tissue to analyze for one case. This case indeed also showed a <italic>BRCA2</italic> methylation in the corresponding primary tumor, which suggests that this alteration is generally preserved during PDX generation. Including the <italic>BRCA</italic> methylations found in the xenografts, the incidence rises to 7 out of 21 TNBC cases, or 33.3%. The prevalence of <italic>BRCA1</italic> promoter methylation in sporadic breast cancer is variable, depending on the selected cohort, in particular the molecular subtype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].

The published literature however does reflect our findings. Jacot et al. assessed 155 patients with sporadic breast cancers which were matched for TNM status and found <italic>BRCA1</italic> promoter methylation in 29% of TNBC and only in 5 and 2% of ER-positive and HER2-positive breast cancers respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].

Importantly, the prevalence of <italic>BRCA1</italic> promoter methylation in Luminal B breast cancers has been reported to be higher compared to the Luminal A subtypes.

Studies have also demonstrated that <italic>BRCA1</italic> promoter methylation is a possible marker of poor disease outcome, as it is associated with reduced disease-free survival (DFS), overall survival (OS) and an increased risk of breast cancer-specific mortality, and also seems to be associated with increased sensitivity to adjuvant chemotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].

Our findings suggest that <italic>BRCA2</italic> methylation may also be a negative prognostic factor, since the two patients with <italic>BRCA2</italic> methylation we studied were both very young, with highly aggressive TBNC tumors.</p><p id="Par30">PARP inhibitors have become increasingly important in the treatment of <italic>gBRCA</italic> mutated breast cancer, entering first-line therapy.

The results were promising in that patients with high <italic>BRCA1</italic> promoter methylation showed better 6-month PFS compared with patients without <italic>BRCA1</italic> methylation when treated with Olaparib. However, this study had several limitations, including the small number of patients, and that the origin of the biopsy specimens was not mentioned. Therefore, the study could not definitely conclude that <italic>BRCA1</italic> methylation reliably predicts the response to PARP inhibitors similar to that of <italic>gBRCA</italic> mutated cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p id="Par33">Concerning our two breast cancer patients with a proven <italic>BRCA2</italic> methylation in the cancer cells, the use of PARP inhibitors may very well have been an option for the first patient in the metastatic setting.

However, since most patients succumb to their metastatic disease, detection of a <italic>BRCA</italic> methylation in the metastatic tissue would be clinically more relevant. Additionally, it is not possible to say with absolute certainty if the detected coldspot mutation of the BRCA2 gene in the locally recurrent tumor of the young patient with proven BRCA2 methylation, from where the organoids were created led to an additional susceptibility to PARP inhibitors, even though structural analysis suggest that it does not disrupt the function of the <italic>BRCA2</italic> protein and should thus not lead to a HRD.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par37"><italic>BRCA</italic> methylation is a rare event in metastatic TNBC but seems to lead to HRD comparable to tumors with germline or somatic <italic>BRCA</italic> mutations.
