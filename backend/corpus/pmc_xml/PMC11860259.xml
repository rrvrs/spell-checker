Early studies indicated that Sf9 cells produced a reverse transcriptase (RT) activity that was detected using a sensitive PCR-enhanced reverse transcriptase (PERT) assay. Since RT is generally associated with retrovirus particles, we undertook the investigation of the physical properties and infectious nature of the extracellular RT activity that was constitutively expressed from Sf9 cells or induced after the chemical treatment of the cells with drugs known to activate endogenous retroviruses. A density gradient analysis indicated that the peak RT activity corresponded to a low buoyant density of about 1.08 g/mL. Ultracentrifugation and size filtration of cell-free Sf9 supernatant indicated that different particle sizes were associated with the RT activity. This was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy and cryoEM, which revealed a diversity in particle size and type, including viral-like and extracellular vesicles. The treatment of Sf9 cells with 5-iodo-2&#x02032;-deoxyuridine (IUdR) induced a 33-fold higher RT activity with a similar low buoyant density compared to untreated cells. Infectivity studies using various target cells (human A204, A549, MRC-5, and Raji, and African green monkey Vero cells) inoculated with cell-free supernatant from untreated and IUdR-treated Sf9 cells showed the absence of a replicating retrovirus by PERT-testing of cell-free supernatant during the 30 day-culturing period. Additionally, there was no evidence of virus entry by whole genome analysis of inoculated MRC-5 cells using high-throughput sequencing.

Introduction</title><p>Baculovirus-insect cell expression systems are a robust platform for large-scale, and rapid protein expression and have been used for the development of various investigational products and the manufacturing of several U.S. licensed human viral vaccines and therapeutics [<xref rid="B1-viruses-17-00136" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-viruses-17-00136" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-viruses-17-00136" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-viruses-17-00136" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Since insects are phylogenetically very distant from humans, insect-based cell lines are generally considered to have less safety concerns related to adventitious viruses than mammalian cells for the manufacturing of biological products [for example, Sf9, Sf21, and High Five insect cell lines]. However, the detection of RT activity in the cell-free supernatant of Sf cells [<xref rid="B5-viruses-17-00136" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-viruses-17-00136" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] raised potential safety concerns regarding the presence of retroviruses in the Sf9 cell substrate for manufacturing of biologics. A major scientific hurdle was the limited knowledge regarding endogenous retroelements in <italic toggle="yes">Spodoptera</italic>. To date, nine errantivirus sequences have been identified in the Sf9 cell genome by PCR amplification [<xref rid="B7-viruses-17-00136" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], and Sf-Maverick, R1 LINE, and errantivirus transposon sequences were reported in the Sf-RVN cells by bioinformatics analysis [<xref rid="B8-viruses-17-00136" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, there have been no reports of retrovirus-like particles (RVLPs) in <italic toggle="yes">Spodoptera frugiperda</italic> or Sf cell lines. Insect endogenous retroviral elements have been characterized in other insect cell lines [<xref rid="B9-viruses-17-00136" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-viruses-17-00136" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and although they are generally repressed by PIWI-interacting RNAs [<xref rid="B11-viruses-17-00136" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-viruses-17-00136" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], the presence of RVLPs has been reported in some species. In the case of <italic toggle="yes">Drosophila</italic>, intracytoplasmic A-type retrovirus-like toroidal particles of about 40 nm in diameter were found in <italic toggle="yes">Drosophila melanogaster</italic> cells and an RT activity with a density of 1.22 g/mL was reported by the sucrose gradient analysis of cell lysate [<xref rid="B13-viruses-17-00136" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Additionally, <italic toggle="yes">gypsy</italic> virus-like particles, spherical 50&#x02013;75 nm in diameter with 1.22 g/mL density, were reported to be expressed extracellularly from <italic toggle="yes">D. melanogaster</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">D. virilis</italic> cell lines [<xref rid="B14-viruses-17-00136" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Virus-like particles with a diameter of 55&#x02013;60 nm could be assembled from the baculovirus-expressed gag-like and pol-like ORFs of retrotransposon TED [<xref rid="B15-viruses-17-00136" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Furthermore, the ZAM retrotransposon in <italic toggle="yes">D. melanogaster</italic> can assemble virus particles with a diameter of about 45 nm in the posterior follicle cells of ovarian follicles [<xref rid="B16-viruses-17-00136" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>Our laboratory previously developed a stepwise strategy for optimizing the chemical induction assay to investigate the presence of latent viruses, including endogenous retroviruses and oncogenic DNA viruses [<xref rid="B17-viruses-17-00136" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-viruses-17-00136" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. We applied this strategy to demonstrate the presence of inducible, endogenous retroviruses in the African green monkey Vero cell line with 5-azacytidine (AzaC) and 5-iodo-2&#x02032;-deoxyuridine (IUdR) [<xref rid="B19-viruses-17-00136" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. It was not known whether this chemical induction strategy could induce endogenous retroelements or retroviruses from insect cells. In this paper, we have characterized the RT activity that is constitutively produced from Sf9 cells and investigated the induction of endogenous retroviral particles from chemically treated Sf9 cells. Since Sf9 cells or clones derived from them are used for the manufacturing of biological products, we have evaluated the potential risk of the Sf-RT particles for human infection by conducting infectivity studies using selected cell lines with a known susceptibility for retroviruses, as well as to a broad range of other viruses [<xref rid="B20-viruses-17-00136" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-viruses-17-00136" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-viruses-17-00136" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-viruses-17-00136" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec2-viruses-17-00136"><title>2.

All cell lines were grown in a medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS (56 &#x000b0;C for 30 min), 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U of penicillin per mL, and 100 &#x000b5;g of streptomycin per mL: MRC-5 and Vero were grown in Eagle&#x02019;s minimum essential medium (modified with Earle&#x02019;s salts without L-glutamine (EMEM; Mediatech, Manassas, VA, USA; catalogue number 15-010-CV), 1x nonessential amino acids (MEM-NEAA, Quality Biological; catalogue number 116-078-721), and 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Quality Biological; catalogue number 116-079-060); A204 and Raji were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Quality Biologicals, catalogue number 112-024-101) and 1x MEM-NEAA; and A549 was grown in Dulbecco&#x02019;s modified Eagle&#x02019;s MEM (DMEM; Invitrogen; catalogue number 119955).</p><p>Virus stock. Simian foamy virus type 1 (SFV-1) was obtained from the ATCC (Catalogue number VR 276) and a high-titer virus stock (10<sup>5.5</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub> per mL) was prepared by low passage in <italic toggle="yes">Mus dunni</italic> cells and tittered as previously described [<xref rid="B21-viruses-17-00136" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. This was included as a positive control for retrovirus infection in the infectivity study.</p><p>PCR-enhanced RT (PERT) assay. Cell supernatants were filtered (0.45 &#x003bc;m, Corning, Corning, NY, USA; catalogue number 430314),and stored in aliquots at &#x02212;80 &#x000b0;C in single-use tubes. The protocol used for the PERT assay was a two-step assay [<xref rid="B21-viruses-17-00136" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], which was based on the previously described method [<xref rid="B26-viruses-17-00136" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27-viruses-17-00136" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Briefly, the cell supernatant sample was prepared by diluting at 1:10 in NZ/DTT buffer per the standard protocol (to reduce interference due to serum in the medium), and in the case of direct testing of Sf9 supernatant, an additional 1:10 dilution was needed to reduce interference due to the insect cell culture medium. A standard curve of ten-fold serial dilutions of purified HIV-1 RT enzyme (Worthington Biochemical Corp, Lakewood, NJ, USA; Catalogue number RTHIV) was generated for each assay based on the enzymatic activity provided for the lot used in the assay. A medium or water was used as the negative control. Each sample was tested in duplicate or triplicate in a 96-well PCR plate. In each well, 10 &#x000b5;L of the sample were mixed with 15 &#x000b5;L of RT reaction cocktail containing RT buffer, MS2 RNA and primer B. The mixed samples were incubated at 37 &#x000b0;C for 90 min on a PCR thermocycler (Eppendorf MasterCycler ProS). Then, 25 &#x000b5;L of PCR cocktail containing PCR buffer, AmpliTaq Gold, TaqMS2 specific primers and a probe was added to each well and the reaction was run for 1 cycle at 95 &#x000b0;C for 10 min, 50 cycles at 95 &#x000b0;C for 15 s and 56 &#x000b0;C for 30 s on the QuantStudio 3 System (Thermo Fisher scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The PERT assay was valid if the R<sup>2</sup> &#x0003e; 0.97 for the HIV-1 RT enzyme standard curve and negative control was negative. The PERT activity in the samples were calculated based on the HIV-1 enzyme standard curve.</p><p>Inhibition of the Sf-RT activity was evaluated in the PERT assay by adding 10 &#x003bc;L of different concentrations of 3&#x02019;-azido-2&#x02019;,3&#x02019;-dideoxythymidine-5&#x02019;-triphosphate (AzTTP; TriLink Biotechnologies, San Diego, CA, USA; Catalogue number N-4009) to 90 &#x003bc;L of Sf9 supernatant, which was diluted at 1:10 with NZ/DTT buffer, and further diluted 1:10 prior to performing the PERT assay. HIV-1 RT enzyme was diluted to 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> pU/mL with NZ/DTT buffer and similar concentrations of AzTTP were added to obtain the positive control. The final concentrations of AzTTP based on the 25 &#x003bc;L RT reaction mix were as follows: 2, 4, 20, and 40 &#x003bc;M. A sample without AzTTP (0 &#x003bc;M) was also included.</p><p>Ultracentrifugation and Gradient Ultracentrifugation. Sf9 filtered supernatant (800 &#x000b5;L) was ultracentrifuged at 124,406&#x000d7; <italic toggle="yes">g</italic> (45,000 rpm) for 1 h and for 20 h at 4 &#x000b0;C (Beckman TLA 45 rotor). After ultracentrifugation, the supernatant was removed, and the pelleted material was resuspended in the original volume (800 &#x000b5;L) of complete medium. Cell-free supernatants and resuspended pellets were stored in aliquots (10 &#x000b5;L) at &#x02212;80 &#x000b0;C for analysis in the PERT assay.</p><p>For the OptiPrep gradient, 2 mL of 48%, 38%, 28%, 18% and 8% of OptiPrep density gradient medium (Millipore Sigma, Burlington, MA, USA; catalogue number D1556), diluted in PBS, were layered from bottom to top in an ultracentrifugation tube (Beckman Coulter, Indianapolis, IN, USA; catalogue number 344059). For sucrose gradient, 2 mL of 60%, 45%, 30%, 15% and 0% of sucrose (Millipore Sigma, catalogue number S0389) dilutions in PBS were layered from bottom to top in an ultracentrifugation tube. For both gradients, the tube with 10 mL of OptiPrep or sucrose was sealed with parafilm and tipped over gently to a horizontal position for 45 min. Then, the tube was switched to a vertical position gently and the seal was removed. The sample (0.5 mL) was added on top of the gradient. The tubes were ultracentrifuged at 122,000&#x000d7; <italic toggle="yes">g</italic> (31,400 rpm; SW41 rotor) for 16 h at 4 &#x000b0;C with the highest deceleration setting. Fractions (0.5 mL) were removed from the top to bottom of the gradient. Forty microliters of each fraction were used to measure the refractive index with a refractometer (Reichert Amterk, Depew, NY, USA) for calculating the density. Ten microliter aliquots from each fraction were stored at &#x02212;80 &#x000b0;C for the PERT assays.</p><p>Size filtration. Sf9 supernatant (400 &#x003bc;L; 0.45 &#x003bc;m filter) was filtered using 0.2 &#x003bc;m, 300 K, 100 K, 30 K Nanosep centrifugal devices (Catalogue number: ODPTFE02C34, OD 300C33, OD100C33, OD030C33, respectively; Pall, Port Washington, NY, USA) and centrifuged at 12,000&#x000d7; <italic toggle="yes">g</italic> for 5&#x02013;15 min until no fluid remained on top of the filter unit.

The optimum drug concentration was determined based on cell toxicity and cell recovery by treating Sf9 cells with different concentrations of 5-iodo-2&#x02032;-deoxyuridine (IUdR Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA, catalogue number 17125; stock solution of 75 mg per mL prepared in 1N NH4OH), 5-azacytidine (AzaC, Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA, catalogue number A1287; stock solution of 1 mg/mL prepared in Grace&#x02019;s Supplemented Insect Medium), sodium butyrate (NaB; Sigma, catalogue number B5887; stock solution of 0.9 M prepared in sterile water), and 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA; Sigma, catalogue number P3766; stock solution, stock solution of 1 mg/mL prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide, DMSO).</p><p>Sf9 cells (1.6 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup>; passage 23) were plated for 24 h in 25 cm<sup>2</sup> flasks (to reach the beginning of the log phase based on the growth curve) before replacing the medium with medium containing different concentrations of AzaC (0, 1.25, 2.5, 5, 10, 20, 40 &#x000b5;g/mL), IUdR (0, 25, 50, 100, 200, 400 &#x000b5;g/mL), NaB (0, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 mM) and TPA (0, 50, 100, 200, 400 ng/mL). After 48 h of drug treatment (equal to 1.25 times of the population doubling time of the cells) (designated as day 0), the cells were washed with medium three times and culturing continued with fresh complete medium. The culture was observed for cell toxicity and the medium was changed each day until the cells reached 95&#x02013;100% confluence. The medium collected each day was filtered (0.45 &#x003bc;M filter; Corning, Corning, NY, USA catalogue number 430314) and 10 &#x003bc;L aliquots were stored at &#x02212;80 &#x000b0;C for RT analysis using the PERT assay. Cells were set up in parallel without drug or with NH4OH (in the case of IUdR) and the medium collected was used as a negative control for the PERT assay.</p><p>Infectivity&#x000a0;studies. The inocula used for infectivity studies were the cell-free supernatant collected from Sf9 cells (passage 20) and the cell-free supernatant collected from IUdR-treated Sf9 cells (200 &#x003bc;g/mL; Day 2), which had been filtered through a 0.45 &#x003bc;M filter (Corning, Corning, NY, USA, catalogue number 430314). SFV-1 (10 TCID<sub>50</sub>) was used as a positive control in an independent experiment to demonstrate the susceptibility of the target cell lines to retrovirus infection at 37 &#x000b0;C incubation. SFV-1 replication was based on progression of cytopathic effect (CPE) and increasing RT activity in PERT assay performed on selected samples [<xref rid="B20-viruses-17-00136" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-viruses-17-00136" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>The target cells were plated 24 h prior to infection to reach 70% confluence at the time of infection.

The media from all of the cultures were replaced with target-cell medium after 3 rounds of washing and the cell lines were further incubated at 37 &#x000b0;C. The cells were passaged every 2&#x02013;4 days upon reaching 95% confluence, at which time the medium was completely replaced with fresh medium. The cultures were regularly observed for CPE. All cultures without CPE were continued for at least 30 days. The cultures infected with SFV-1 were terminated upon reaching extensive CPE.</p><p>Filtered supernatants and washed cell pellets were collected and stored at &#x02212;80 &#x000b0;C at every passage.</p><p>High-Throughput Sequencing analysis. DNA was extracted using a DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA; catalogue number 69504) from a pellet of MRC-5 cells collected on Day 2 after inoculation of the cells with IUdR-induced Sf9 cell supernatant. HTS whole-genome sequencing was performed by the CBER core facility using Illumina NovaSeq. The number of paired-end reads after trimming was 3,892,770,556 with an average read length of 146 bp. HTS data analysis was performed using CLC Genomics Workbench Version 23.0.2 (parameter length fraction = 0.3 or 0.5, similarity fraction = 0.9) to map the total reads against an in-house database of 571 retroelements identified in the Sf9 genome.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec3-viruses-17-00136"><title>3.

Characterization of Extracellular Sf-RT Activity</title><p>The Sf9 cell line can be cultured adherent or in suspension, with or without a serum. In this study, the cells were grown as an adherent culture with a serum. The presence of RT activity in cell-free supernatant of Sf9 cells was evaluated using the highly sensitive PERT assay. The results shown in <xref rid="viruses-17-00136-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A indicated that a similar RT activity (about 10<sup>5</sup> to 10<sup>6</sup> pU/&#x000b5;L) was produced by Sf9 cells, which are infected with the Sf-rhabdovirus, and Sf9-13F12 cells, which are Sf-rhabdovirus-free cells [<xref rid="B25-viruses-17-00136" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B28-viruses-17-00136" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. No RT activity was detected in the complete medium. A similar level of RT activity was also detected in the cell free supernatant from insect High Five cells and a lower level (about 10<sup>4</sup> to 10<sup>5</sup> pU/&#x000b5;L) was detected from D. Mel. (2) cells (<xref rid="viruses-17-00136-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>B). A high level of RT activity (about 10<sup>6</sup> to 10<sup>7</sup> pU/&#x000b5;L) was detected in the cell-free supernatant of SFV-1 infected MRC-5 cells, which represented a positive retrovirus control for the PERT assay. No RT activity was detected from the uninfected MRC-5 cells (<xref rid="viruses-17-00136-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>C).</p><p>Since the PERT assay can detect retroviral RT and some cellular DNA polymerases, the specificity of the Sf-RT activity, being of retroviral origin, was determined using AzTTP, a known inhibitor of HIV-1 RT and DNA polymerase gamma [<xref rid="B29-viruses-17-00136" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In <xref rid="viruses-17-00136-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>, the HIV-1 RT enzyme was diluted to 10<sup>6</sup> pU/&#x000b5;L, comparable to the RT activity in the Sf9 supernatant. The results showed that the HIV-1 RT activity decreased significantly with an increasing concentration of AzTTP: a 633-fold decrease was seen with 40 &#x000b5;M of AzTTP. However, the Sf-RT activity remained the same up to 20 &#x000b5;M of AzTTP and decreased 6-fold at 40 &#x000b5;M of AzTTP. These results indicated that the RT in the Sf9 supernatant is retroviral-related and distinct from the HIV-1 RT.</p><p>To determine if the RT was particle-associated, Sf9 cell-free supernatant was ultracentrifuged at 45,000 rpm (124,406&#x000d7; g) for 1 h and for 20 h. The results shown in <xref rid="viruses-17-00136-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>A demonstrate that about 30% more RT activity was pelleted when the duration of ultracentrifugation was increased from 1 h to 20 h. Compared to enveloped retroviruses like HIV-1, which can be pelleted by ultracentrifugation at 25,500&#x000d7; <italic toggle="yes">g</italic> for 1 h [<xref rid="B30-viruses-17-00136" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], it seems that the Sf9 supernatant contained various sizes of particles and some RT-particles needed an extended ultracentrifugation time to be pelleted. It was notable that some of the RT activity still remained in the supernatant after 20 h of ultracentrifugation. To characterize the particle size associated with the Sf9 RT activity, cell-free supernatant was filtered through centrifugal devices with different membrane pore sizes. <xref rid="viruses-17-00136-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>B shows that the filtrate contained a similar level of RT activity using 0.45 and 0.2 &#x000b5;m filters whereas about half of the RT activity passed through the 300 K device, which had a 35 nm membrane nominal pore size for 90&#x02013;200 nm viruses or particles (based on the manufacturer&#x02019;s instruction), and about 5% of the RT activity passed through the 100 K device, whch had a 10 nm membrane nominal pore size for 30&#x02013;90 nm viruses or particles. No RT activity was detected in the filtrate of the 30 K device. These results further demonstrated that particles produced from Sf9 cells were a mix of different sizes.</p><p>TEM analysis indicated that some spherical retrovirus-like particles, about 65&#x02013;110 nm in diameter, were seen in thin-sections that were prepared from the ultracentrifuged pellet of Sf9 supernatant (<xref rid="viruses-17-00136-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>A).

The bacilliform Sf-rhabdovirus of about 170 to 190 nm in length, which was described previously [<xref rid="B24-viruses-17-00136" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], was also observed in the same image (<xref rid="viruses-17-00136-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>A, left panel, indicated by the arrow). Cryo-EM showed 40&#x02013;120 nm unilamellar spherical particles that appeared to have a textured appearance and proteinaceous material on their surface (<xref rid="viruses-17-00136-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>B). Additionally, a few spherical particles contained highly electron-dense structures (<xref rid="viruses-17-00136-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>B, lower middle panel) and some were present inside larger vesicles (<xref rid="viruses-17-00136-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>B, lower left panel). Rod-like Sf-rhabdovirus with a scaled appearance, which has been described previously, was present in the same sample (<xref rid="viruses-17-00136-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>F; [<xref rid="B24-viruses-17-00136" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]).

The highest RT activity was induced with 200 &#x000b5;g/mL of IUdR on D2, albeit with significant cell toxicity (less than 20% cell confluence).

Discussion</title><p>The safety of biological products is assured by demonstrating the absence of adventitious viruses in the final product.

In such cases, it is expected that the manufacturing process demonstrates the clearance of the viral particles (as in the case of Chinese hamster ovary CHO cells) [<xref rid="B35-viruses-17-00136" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] or the extensive analysis of the particles for evaluating its potential risk for human infection based on physical and genomic characterization and infectivity studies (as in the case of chicken embryo fibroblast cultures) [<xref rid="B20-viruses-17-00136" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B36-viruses-17-00136" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="B37-viruses-17-00136" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="B38-viruses-17-00136" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Some insect cell lines have been used for manufacturing of biological products [<xref rid="B39-viruses-17-00136" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], but the analysis of retroviral particles have only been performed for <italic toggle="yes">Drosophila</italic> [<xref rid="B13-viruses-17-00136" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B15-viruses-17-00136" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-viruses-17-00136" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. A highly sensitive PCR-based RT assay was used to detect the presence of RT activity expressed from Sf9 cells, which are used for baculovirus-expressed products [<xref rid="B6-viruses-17-00136" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, a systematic characterization was not performed to determine if the RT activity was associated with retroviral particles, whether the associated viral genome was complete and could encode proteins from putative retroviral genes, or if the particles were infectious and posed a potential safety concern for humans. This paper describes the evaluation of the physical and infectious properties associated with Sf-RT activity. Further, investigations of the potential endogenous retroviral sequences encoding the Sf-RT are ongoing.</p><p>Using the PERT assay, we found that the Sf9 cell supernatant contained about 10<sup>5</sup> pU/&#x003bc;L of RT activity, which could be partially pelleted by ultracentrifugation. TEM analysis of cell-free supernatant revealed the presence of heterogenous particles with varying sizes and structures, some of which resembled type A retroviral-like particles that have been previously described in <italic toggle="yes">Drosophila</italic> tissues and cell lines [<xref rid="B13-viruses-17-00136" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-viruses-17-00136" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B16-viruses-17-00136" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B40-viruses-17-00136" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. It should be noted that the extracellular viral-like particles produced from Sf9 cells corresponded to a low buoyant density RT, which peaked at about 1.08 g/mL, which was also seen in the previous study with <italic toggle="yes">D. melanogaster</italic> cell lysate but was not followed up [<xref rid="B13-viruses-17-00136" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Additionally, the Sf-RT activity was distributed broadly around the peak RT in the density gradient analysis, suggesting the association with particles of different sizes and types. This was evident by electron microscopy studies which showed retrovirus-like particles that could possibly be associated with low-density lipoproteins while egressing from the cells or the particles may have interacted with &#x0201c;light&#x0201d; extracellular vesicles, resulting in the low buoyant density [<xref rid="B41-viruses-17-00136" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Interestingly, the hepatitis C virus has been shown to have a low buoyant density by associating with very low-density lipoproteins, whereas the naked viruses are of high density [<xref rid="B42-viruses-17-00136" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="B43-viruses-17-00136" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="B44-viruses-17-00136" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Our ongoing studies using various membrane dissociation and disruption reagents and qPCR assays based on an HTS analysis of the Sf9 genome [<xref rid="B45-viruses-17-00136" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], transcriptome, and virome will help provide further insights into the structure and genomes of the Sf-RT particles.

The results of our study demonstrated that the IUdR treatment resulted in a higher RT activity from the Sf9 cells, compared with AzaC and NaB, whereas TPA induction did not significantly affect the RT activity. The induction of a high RT activity from Sf9 cells suggests that it is produced from endogenous retroviruses or retrotransposons. Interestingly, the peak RT activity had a low density compared with the expected density of known retroviruses [<xref rid="B32-viruses-17-00136" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. We have further investigations ongoing to characterize the novel RT-viral particles associated with a low buoyant density.</p><p>The gypsy retrotransposon in <italic toggle="yes">D. melanogaster</italic> was reported to be infectious and transmitted horizontally and vertically in its host [<xref rid="B40-viruses-17-00136" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="B50-viruses-17-00136" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], and also to be propagated in <italic toggle="yes">D. hydei</italic> cells [<xref rid="B51-viruses-17-00136" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. To address the potential safety concerns related to RT particles in the Sf9 cell line, we performed infectivity studies to investigate their potential replication in mammalian cell lines. The results demonstrated that the Sf-RT particles expressed from Sf9 cells or after induction by chemical treatment were not replication competent in the target cell lines used in the study. We further showed that mammalian cells cannot support the replication of the Sf-RT particles at the 28 &#x000b0;C temperature that may be important for their production in the Sf9 cells. Other insect cell lines that were cultured at 28 &#x000b0;C, such as the High Five cell line (BTI-Tn-5B1-4) and D. Mel. (2), could be potential cell lines for evaluating the infectivity of Sf-RT particles, but they also produce RT activity, which would interfere in interpreting the results of such infectivity studies. Therefore, we have focused our efforts on characterizing the viral genomes in the Sf-RT particles and focus on those with putative ORFs for developing virus-specific PCR assays to investigate their potential entry/integration in mammalian cells.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclaimer/Publisher&#x02019;s Note:</bold> The statements, opinions and data contained in all publications are solely those of the individual author(s) and contributor(s) and not of MDPI and/or the editor(s).
