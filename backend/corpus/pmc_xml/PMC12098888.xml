Therefore, manipulating DDR by small molecule inhibitors (SMI) is a promising treatment option. The main DNA double strand break (DSB) repair mechanisms in healthy mammalian cells are homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). It is known that HR is already often impaired in tumors because of cancerous transitions. Therefore, additionally inhibiting NHEJ is a possibility to specifically target tumor cells and spare healthy tissue, which has the alternative DSB repair mechanism available. We treated HNSCC and healthy fibroblast cell lines with 30 &#x000b5;M of the ligase IV inhibitor SCR130 and a single dose of 2&#x000a0;Gy (Gy) ionizing radiation (IR) to investigate the inhibitor&#x02019;s radiosensitizing effect. In short, the effect of SCR130 in combination with IR on cell death, clonogenicity, and DNA damage is limited and highly cell line specific. Nevertheless, SCR130 increases the number of cells in G0/G1 phase concomitant with gained p21 expression consistently. We suggest that SCR130 in combination with IR has anti-proliferative effects, but an escape of the cells by upregulation of ligase IV resulting from the treatment is possible.</p><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1038/s41598-025-03159-5.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Ligase IV</kwd><kwd>SCR130</kwd><kwd>Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma</kwd><kwd>DNA damage response</kwd><kwd>Radiation sensitivity</kwd><kwd>Ionizing radiation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Radiotherapy</kwd><kwd>Targeted therapies</kwd><kwd>Head and neck cancer</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Universit&#x000e4;tsklinikum Erlangen (8546)</institution></funding-source></award-group><open-access><p>Open Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL.</p></open-access></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer Nature Limited 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par48">Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is a very heterogenous group of tumor diseases affecting the upper respiratory tract and swallowing organs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. HNSCCs are relevant worldwide but risk and prognosis differ depending on country and demography; highest incidence rates appear in South and Southeast Asia and more men than women are affected<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Risk factors are mainly - on the one hand - infections with high risk human papilloma virus (HPV); on the other hand, tobacco and alcohol abuse, summarized as HPV-negative cancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. In the last decades, it was not possible to improve treatment of HNSCC patients significantly so survival rates stagnate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> and optimized therapies are urgently needed. Established treatment options for HNSCC patients are surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy (RT)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Advanced multimodal treatment schemes also include immunotherapy; however, the outcome is variable<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Clinical trials identifying responder populations and optimized immunomodulation are currently ongoing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par49">Problematically, radioresistance of HNSCC is a common issue, which has to be overcome to increase patients&#x02019; prognosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Radioresistance is elevated proportional to the tumor cells&#x02019; ability to handle ionizing radiation (IR) -induced DNA damage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. However, DNA damage response (DDR) is often pathologically altered in cancer cells, which can reduce the efficacy of radiation in the tumor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. To address the radioresistance of HNSCCs we inhibited their DDR with the ligase IV inhibitor SCR130 and additionally induced DNA damage by IR. We hypothesize that this combined treatment should radiosensitize the cells and increase the efficacy of the IR.</p><p id="Par50">There is clinical evidence that HPV-negative HNSCCs are less radiosensitive than HPV-positive ones, resulting in poorer prognosis and the need of improved treatment schemes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Biological differences are not understood completely, but the reasons are probably multifactorial; it is conceivable that DDR, tumor microenvironment, and immune reactions to the viral proteins influence treatment response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. To overcome treatment resistance, novel therapeutics and useful combination with available options are essential<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Small molecule inhibitors (SMI) are a promising advanced treatment option to open the therapeutic window by specifically targeting tumor cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. For RT, SMI that inhibit DDR are of special interest because they have the potential to radiosensitize tumor cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par51">Healthy mammalian cells have several repair mechanisms available, but IR-induced DNA double strand breaks (DSB) are repaired mainly by homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), depending on the cell cycle state and the complexity of the DNA damage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. For NHEJ DNA ends are stabilized by dimeric Ku70/Ku80 protein complex (Ku70/Ku80) followed by optional modifications of the DNA ends<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. In the very last step, the ligase IV complex - consisting of ligase IV, X-ray repair cross-complementing protein 4 (XRCC4), XRCC4-like factor (XLF), and paralog of XRCC4 and XLF (PAXX) - rejoins the loose DNA ends (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. The advantage of NHEJ is that it is very fast and efficient, which is essential for genomic integrity, but it is also error-prone<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. In contrast, HR requires a homologous sequence of the damaged region of DNA, usually the sister chromatid; this enables error-free repair and prevents genetic instability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Consequently, HR is limited to S and G2 phase of the cell cycle, whereas NHEJ is permanently available<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par53">We focused on NHEJ because it is possible throughout the whole cell cycle and therefore very efficient and essential for cell survival<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. An additional advantage of inhibiting NHEJ is that HR in tumor cells is often non-functional or only partially functional due to mutations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>; this means that tumors are at a distinct disadvantage compared to normal tissue cells when NHEJ is blocked and their HR is not functional.</p><p id="Par54">We hypothesize inhibiting NHEJ should enable specifically targeting tumor and sparing normal tissue cells. As mentioned, an essential enzyme for the NHEJ is ligase IV. There are very few cases of patients with the so-called ligase IV syndrome, which is defined by genetic changes in the ligase IV encoding gene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Consequently, NHEJ is impaired in those patients causing - among other symptoms &#x02013; increased radiation sensitivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Therefore, we chose ligase IV as the target for our SMI treatment; it is one of the most essential DNA repair proteins in NHEJ and it is known that ligase IV deficiency leads to radiation sensitivity in cell lines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> and in patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par55">The relevance of combining SMI of DNA DSB repair with IR was shown in several studies for example by Faulhaber and Jost et al. who inhibited DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs)/mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase (mTOR), ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), and ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein (ATR) and showed increased efficacy by a combined treatment with IR in cancer cell lines <italic>in vitro</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. There is also a wide variety of clinical studies ongoing combining IR with DNA repair inhibition summarized by Monge-Cadet et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Peposertib for example inhibits NHEJ by targeting repair-relevant DNA-PKcs, which has been studied in patients in multiple clinical trials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par56">Taken together ligase IV is a promising target protein for a SMI in combination with IR to increase radiation sensitivity in HNSCC cell lines. Already in 2012, Srivastava et al. presented the ligase IV inhibitor SCR7, which increased unrepaired DNA DSB and cytotoxicity and decreased proliferation in cancer cell lines in a ligase IV baseline dependent manner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Moreover, they showed response in three of four tested cancer mouse models resulting from SCR7 treatment and elevated radiation sensitivity in a combined treatment of SCR7 and IR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, a study from Greco et al. from 2016 questions the effectiveness and specificity of the SCR7 molecule<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Therefore, in 2020 Ray et al. described several molecules derived from SCR7 structure and suggested SCR130 being the most promising ligase IV inhibitor and potential candidate for radiosensitizing cancer cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. There is a lack of knowledge if SCR130 could be clinically relevant for treating HNSCCs and especially the radioresistant HPV-negative ones, which we addressed in a preclinical setting.</p><p id="Par57">We hypothesize that ligase IV inhibition by a specific and efficient SMI is a promising strategy to radiosensitize HNSCC cell lines and therefore serve as a treatment option for radioresistant HPV-negative cancer patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Therefore, we characterized the effect of SCR130 treatment combined with IR on HPV-positive and HPV-negative HNSCC cell lines.</p><p id="Par58">Additionally, we included healthy fibroblasts to calculate adverse effects on healthy tissue.

In general, the radiation sensitivity of the cell lines varied from SBLF9 and CLS-354, where IR alone strongly reduced the SF, to HSC4, which barely responded to IR. Because IR alone already reduced the SF, making it difficult to estimate the additional effect of SCR130, we normalized the irradiated samples to the DMSO control. To do so we shifted the 2-Gy-line parallel into the starting point of the 0-Gy-line (SF&#x02009;=&#x02009;1). This resulted in the same starting point for the 0-Gy- and 2-Gy-lines in the diagram, which makes it easier to understand the influence of SCR130 with or without IR.

In contrast, two of them did not respond at all exactly as the healthy fibroblasts. The resistance of the healthy cells against the treatment is beneficial because it implies that the treatment would be less hazardous for healthy than for cancerous tissue. The HPV-positive cell lines UD-SCC-2 and UM-SCC-47 were more sensitive to the combined treatment and died more effectively, while the HPV-negative ones were heterogeneously sensitive to SCR130.

Already in the 1960s, Sinclair concluded that the radiation sensitivity of cells increases from S phase over G0/G1 phase to G2/M phase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. Problematically, the only HNSCC cell line replying to the combined treatment with an increased number of cells in G2/M phase compared to IR alone was CLS-354. Equally, the healthy cell line 01-GI-SBL, which should be spared from radiosensitization ideally, showed a G2/M block. IR alone induced a G2/M block in all tested cell lines as already shown by Liu et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. Interestingly, this was compensated by the ligase IV inhibitor SCR130 in Cal33, RPMI 2650, UD-SCC-2, UM-SCC-47, and slightly in Detroit 562, as evidenced by a reduction of cells in G2/M phase and corresponding increase in cells in G0/G1 phase after combined treatment compared to IR alone. Remarkably, it is well described for tumor cells in contrast to healthy tissue that the regulation of progression from G1 to S phase is commonly impaired and tumor cells does not arrest in G0/G1 phase but proceed in the cell cycle to the S phase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. Consequently, we would have not expected a G0/G1 arrest in the HNSCC cell lines. Wilson et al. showed that cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase in a breast cancer cell line correlates with induction of senescence, but we could not detect senescence after treatment by C12FDG staining<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. Preferably, the induction of G0/G1 arrest can be anti-proliferative<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup> and, according to Foy et al., G1 arrest can result in uncontrolled growth, which is toxic for the cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par111">Even if there was no radiosensitizing effect by arresting cells to G2/M phase, which would be preferable for fractionated treatment scheme<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>, reduced proliferation and toxic cell growth in G1 arrest can compensate for this. The cell cycle distribution of HSC4 and SBLF9 fibroblasts was not modified by the combined treatment of SCR130 and IR.

We chose liposomes as a promising drug delivery system in our study because they are biocompatible, non-toxic themselves, can enhance solubility of drugs, and can optimize cellular drug uptake due to their cell membrane-like lipid structure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, there was no increased cell death or changed cell cycle distribution resulting from the liposome treatment compared to the standard treatment. This leads us to the conclusion that SCR130 uptake of the cells or its solubility is not the limiting factor. Our group established the standard treatment scheme with addition of SMI 3&#x000a0;h prior to IR in several studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, there is evidence that SMI probably need IR-induced damage before their addition to function, as shown for AT406 known as Xevinapant<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup>. We could show that the reverse treatment scheme did not increase SCR130s&#x02019; efficacy. Also, we checked if HSC4, which showed up as non-responder, may have an individual radiation sensitivity that is lower than for the other cell lines. But even with higher doses of IR there was no increased effect of SCR130. As we rejected low cellular uptake, treatment procedure, and individual radiation sensitivity as reasons for SCR130&#x02019;s limited efficacy, it is likely that it is structure-dependent or the cells can handle the treatment because of intrinsic escape mechanisms.</p><p id="Par123">Another option is that SCR130 is not best suitable for treatment of HNSCC but another tumor entity. Analysis of entity-specific Kaplan-Meier plots revealed that there is no influence of ligase IV expression on the overall survival of HNSCC patients but for breast cancer patients, where a low ligase IV expression in the cancer tissue was favorable for overall survival<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. Overall, the influence of ligase IV expression on survival is heterogenous and entity-specific<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. Grupp et al. for example also showed that poor clinical prognosis in prostate cancer correlated with ligase IV expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref></sup>. Therefore, an analysis of SCR130 in another entity could be promising.</p><p id="Par124">To sum it up, we showed that the combination of IR with SCR130 has the potential to radiosensitize HNSCC while sparing healthy fibroblast cell lines. Even if SMI are administered systematically, there are a few characteristics of normal tissue that enable targeting cancer cells and sparing healthy ones. Tumor cells proliferate more than healthy cells and therefore accumulate more replication-induced damage, which will persist because of inhibited DNA repair<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref></sup>. Moreover, tumor cells are known to have impaired DNA repair while healthy cells have several repair pathways available<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref></sup>. Especially for HR deficient cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> targeting NHEJ is promising because of the important role of those pathways in DNA DSB repair<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Srivastava et al. already showed that HR deficiency sensitizes cell lines to ligase IV inhibition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. The HPV-positive cell lines UD-SCC-2 and UM-SCC-47, which already have a better prognosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, reacted with increased cell death and G0/G1 arrest. The reaction of the HPVnegative cell lines was more heterogenous only leading to increased cell death in one of five cell lines, reduced SF and G0/G1 arrest in two of five cell lines, and G2/M block in one of five cell lines. Unfavorable results in HPV-negative cell lines are presumably caused by cell line origin and genetic differences, for example in cell death and cell cycle regulation, which is also true for clinical outcome in patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par125">Considering the vital role<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> of ligase IV in NHEJ, this low efficacy regarding cell death, colony formation assay, and DNA damage is noteworthy. Nevertheless, we suggest that SCR130 has antiproliferative effects seen by increased G0/G1 fraction. Moreover, we elucidated some possible escape mechanisms importantly the upregulation of <italic>LIG4</italic> and could exclude others like efflux proteins or drug uptake and solubility. Especially HSC4 and RPMI 2650 effectively escaped the treatment without knowing why yet. A possible escape mechanism that need to be checked further could be the upregulation of alternative repair mechanisms because there is broad evidence that NHEJ deficient cells can switch to alternative end-joining for DNA repair<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref></sup>. Another possibility would be that cells already have mutations in their ligase IV encoding gene or alternative genes of radiation response, therefore SCR130 could not work<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par126">Our study investigated the radiosensitizing effect of the ligase IV inhibitor SCR130 on HNSCC cell lines. Even if there were slight effects detectable, they were weak and strongly cell line specific. Yet, there is no final explanation if those limited effects are caused by intrinsic escape mechanisms of the cell lines or the lack of efficacy of the drug. Future research should focus on the cell line specific differences in the DDR. Moreover, it remains unclear if the low efficacy of SCR130 is caused by its chemical structure and that the SMI therefore is insufficient itself. SCR130 is already an improved structure of SCR7 and meanwhile there are several modifications available that may probably improve the performance of the ligase IV inhibition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref></sup>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par127">We characterized the radiosensitizing effect of the ligase IV inhibitor SCR130 on HNSCC and healthy fibroblast cell lines. Radiosensitization regarding cell death was possible but cell line specific, while it was limited in colony formation assay. Combined treatment resulted in G0/G1 arrest, which was accompanied by upregulation of <italic>CDKN1A</italic> (p21) and <italic>LIG4</italic>. Therefore, we suggest that SCR130 has anti-proliferative potential but there are also non-responder cell lines. Considering the vital role of ligase IV in DNA DSB repair, the limited effects of SCR130 in combination with IR are unexpected and the heterogenous reaction of the different cell lines is noteworthy. We elucidated the upregulation of <italic>LIG4</italic> after SCR130 treatment as a possible escape mechanism. Overall, our study indicates that SCR130 is not able to inhibit NHEJ in HNSCC cell lines and therefore is not a sufficient radiosensitizer.</p></sec><sec id="Sec28" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.</p><p>
