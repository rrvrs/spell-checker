CPR 2019, 1&#x02013;11), which is characterized by several symptoms, including lack of attention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity that are incompatible with age and developmental level (Caye, A., et al. 2020 JAACAP, 990&#x02013;997)</p></sec><sec id="sec4860"><title>Objectives</title><p>This study aimed to determine the effect of Self-Regulation Based Cognitive Psychoeducation Program on emotion regulation and self-efficacy in children diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and receiving medication.</p></sec><sec id="sec4861"><title>Methods</title><p>The sample of this study with control group and pre-test, post-test and follow-up randomized experimental design consisted of children followed in the child and adolescent mental health outpatient clinic of a state hospital.

A statistically significant increase was also found in their external functional emotion regulation mean scores measured before and 6 months after the intervention (p &#x0003c; 0.05). In addition, a statistically significant difference was found between their internal dysfunctional and external dysfunctional emotion regulation mean scores measured before and 6 months after the intervention; however the mean scores of those in the control group 6 months after the intervention were higher than those in the intervention group (p &#x0003c; 0.05). Furthermore, there was a statistically significant increase in their self-efficacy mean scores measured before and 6 months after the intervention (p &#x0003c; 0.05).</p></sec><sec id="sec4863"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The Self-Regulation Based Cognitive Psychoeducation Program was found be effective in increasing the levels of emotion regulation and self-efficacy in children with ADHD.</p></sec><sec id="sec4864"><title>Disclosure of Interest</title><p>None Declared</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="1"/></counts></article-meta></front></article>
