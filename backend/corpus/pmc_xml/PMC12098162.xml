This study characterized the physicochemical properties of native NSCLC ECM to inform the biomimetic design of 3D models utilizing biomaterials and light-based 3D bioprinting technologies. A tunable 3D model was constructed that replicates the interfacial structures and matrix stiffness of both lung cancer tissue and adjacent normal tissue. This model elucidates the impact of matrix stiffness on cellular behaviors, including proliferation, invasion, and drug sensitivity, and delineates the role of the CCN1 gene under different mechanical conditions. Specifically, it demonstrates that a reduction in CCN1 expression within soft matrices can attenuate the migratory and proliferative capabilities of tumor cells. Furthermore, primary NSCLC patient-derived bioprinted tissues validated the model fidelity to clinical samples and its predictive potential for responses to combined chemotherapy and immunotherapy. This study establishes a versatile platform for NSCLC modeling and research, advancing biomaterial and bioprinting strategies to replicate the tumor microenvironment and optimize therapeutic approaches.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical" id="abs0015"><title>Graphical abstract</title><p><fig id="undfig1" position="anchor"><alt-text id="alttext0010">Image 1</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="ga1"/></fig></p></abstract><kwd-group id="kwrds0010"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>3D bioprinting</kwd><kwd>Non-small cell lung cancer</kwd><kwd>Extracellular matrix</kwd><kwd>Stiffness</kwd><kwd>Patient-derived tissue</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0015">Lung cancer (LC) remains the leading cause of cancer-related mortality in men and the second leading cause in women worldwide [<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Lung cancer is classified into small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). NSCLC accounts for over 80&#x000a0;% of all LC cases [<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. NSCLC is further divided, based on histological differences, into adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, large cell lung cancer, neuroendocrine tumors, among others, with adenocarcinoma representing over 50&#x000a0;% [<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The differentiation level of tumor cells is often linked to treatment outcomes. Clinically, lower differentiation is associated with greater malignancy and worse treatment results, whereas higher differentiation indicates better therapeutic effects [<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Despite advances in diagnosis and treatment, only about 15&#x000a0;% of NSCLC patients present with early-stage disease suitable for surgical resection, while more than half are diagnosed at advanced stages [<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Metastasis is the primary cause of mortality in these patients [<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. For advanced NSCLC, treatment options primarily include radiotherapy, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy [<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. While chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immune checkpoint inhibitors have shown efficacy in some patients, approximately 30&#x000a0;% fail to respond, highlighting the critical need for personalized therapeutic strategies [<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p id="p0020">Treatment decisions in lung cancer often rely on clinical and molecular diagnostics, which fail to capture the intricate complexities of the tumor microenvironment (TME) [<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Traditional 2D cell culture systems are insufficient for replicating the architecture and physiochemical properties of the TME, including the extracellular matrix (ECM) and its critical roles in cell behavior and drug penetration [<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. To address these limitations, 3D in vitro tissue models have emerged as valuable tools for studying tumor biology and enhancing the accuracy of drug screening [<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>]. These models utilize cells and biomaterials to mimic the compositional, morphological, structural, and functional characteristics of native tissues, as well as the specific microenvironmental conditions found in vivo [<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p id="p0025">Several approaches have been developed for constructing 3D models, including stem cell-derived organoid technology, organ-on-a-chip systems employing microfluidics, and 3D bioprinting [<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>]. These methodologies have been applied to various cancers, such as breast, colorectal, liver, and brain tumors. Among these, tumor organoids cultured in Matrigel are the most extensively studied [<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>]. However, Matrigel has notable limitations, including inadequate stiffness for modeling tumor tissues, inability to form specific architecture, and batch-to-batch variability, which hinder its suitability for replicating the TME with precise ECM characteristics [<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>]. In contrast, light-based 3D bioprinting technology combined with photosensitive biomaterials offers a highly controllable platform for simulating the native architecture and ECM [<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>]. This approach enables precise manipulation of ECM composition, stiffness, and interfacial structures, facilitating the creation of models tailored to specific TME characteristics [<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Additionally, 3D bioprinting supports the co-culture of multiple cell types, providing a more comprehensive representation of patient-specific tumor tissues [<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. While such advancements have shown great promise in developing patient-derived in vitro drug screening platforms for various cancers including NSCLC and others [<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>], their potential application in investigating mechanical regulation in NSCLC remains largely unexplored.</p><p id="p0030">Here, we developed a 3D bioprinted model of NSCLC using digital light processing (DLP)-based 3D bioprinting. The bio-ink formulation included methacrylated gelatin (GelMA), methacrylated hyaluronic acid (HAMA), and the photoinitiator lithium phenyl-2,4,6-trimethylbenzoylphosphinate (LAP) to mimic the ECM components and stiffness of NSCLC tissue and the adjacent normal tissue. Transcriptomic analysis revealed significant differences in gene expression profiles between tumor cells cultured in 2D versus 3D systems. Further investigation revealed that softer ECM environments enhanced tumor cell invasiveness and proliferation, whereas stiffer ECM models were associated with increased resistance to chemotherapy but not targeted therapies. Building on these findings, we developed patient-derived tissue (PDT) models that preserved the cellular heterogeneity of clinical samples, encompassing tumor cells, CD45<sup>+</sup> immune cells, CD3<sup>+</sup> T cells, and other cell populations. These models also retained the molecular profiles of the original patient tissues, providing a more accurate representation of the tumor microenvironment. PDT models were subsequently employed to assess the efficacy of combination therapy with chemotherapeutic agents and immunotherapy, with experimental outcomes demonstrating strong concordance with clinical treatment responses. These results underscore the utility of 3D bioprinting technology as a robust platform for investigating the regulatory effects of biomimetic ECM properties and matrix stiffness on lung cancer progression. Moreover, PDT models constructed via this approach show substantial promise for guiding personalized therapeutic strategies, offering a practical tool for tailoring treatments to individual patient profiles in clinical settings.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Result</title><sec id="sec2.1"><label>2.1</label><title>Characterization of physiochemical property of NSCLC ECM and generation of 3D bioprinted LC model</title><p id="p0035">To guide the design of bioinks and optimize 3D printing parameters, we first characterized the compositional and mechanical properties of the ECM of NSCLC tissues. Clinical samples, comprising 17 pairs of NSCLC tissues and corresponding peritumoral tissues, were analyzed (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>A, <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Raman imaging and immunohistochemical staining of representative tumor samples across clinical stages revealed prominent presence of type I collagen, hyaluronan, aggrecan, and laminin (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>B and C, <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Figures 1A</xref>). In addition, collagen I expression positively correlated with tumor stiffness but not with clinical staging. A significant difference in stiffness was observed between the tumor tissue and the peritumoral tissue. Tumor tissues exhibited high heterogeneity in stiffness, ranging from 0.4 to 4&#x000a0;kPa, while peritumoral tissues displayed more uniform stiffness, averaging 0.46&#x000a0;kPa (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>D). This variability highlights the diverse microenvironments within tumors. Samples were further classified by pathological differentiation, including poorly, moderately, and well-differentiated. A trend toward reduced stiffness with increasing differentiation was observed, though differences were not statistically significant due to limited sample size (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>E). Analysis by TNM stage and histological subtype, including lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and non-LUAD subtypes, showed no significant stiffness differences (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Fig. 1B&#x02013;C</xref>). Additional analyses categorized by clinical and demographic parameters&#x02014;such as sex, age, recurrence status, and postoperative treatment&#x02014;demonstrated that patients who received postoperative treatment, typically indicated clinically as high-risk, tended to exhibit higher tumor stiffness compared to lower-risk patients (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Fig. 1D&#x02013;G</xref>).<fig id="fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p><bold>Characterization of the physicochemical properties of NSCLC ECM and generation of 3D bioprinted lung cancer (LC) models.</bold></p><p><bold>(A)</bold> Schematic workflow showing tumor tissue processing, ECM component and stiffness analysis, and 3D bioprinting of LC models.

PDTs from four patients were treated with cisplatin, a platinum-based chemotherapy agent. Three PDTs demonstrated significantly greater drug sensitivity in soft matrices compared to stiff matrices, consistent with trends observed in cell-line models (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Fig. 6B</xref>). This may be attributed to higher proliferation rates in softer matrices, rendering cells more susceptible to DNA-replicating agents. However, the PDT derived from 6512-JN patient sample exhibited stiffness-independent response, emphasizing the potential impact of inter-patient heterogeneity in drug sensitivity. These findings suggest that ECM stiffness can modulate chemotherapeutic response, likely due to increased proliferation in softer matrices, while also emphasizing the potential impact of inter-patient heterogeneity in drug sensitivity.</p><p id="p0145">Additionally, we tested the response of PDT immune microenvironments to anti-PD-1 antibody (&#x003b1;PD-1).

Conversely, in 4513-JN PDTs, neither T cell populations nor tumor cell apoptosis increased under similar conditions (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Fig. 7B</xref>).

As the patient had undergone curative resection and had no measurable primary tumor postoperatively, disease recurrence was monitored via an enlarged mediastinal lymph node, which served as the only target lesion for response evaluation. Following the initiation of combination therapy, imaging performed in April 2024 revealed a 30&#x000a0;% reduction in lymph node size. This change met the threshold for partial response according to RECIST 1.1 criteria and was consistent with the in vitro treatment responses observed in the PDT models (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>F). These findings support the predictive potential of PDT models in therapeutic assessment.

These biomimetic models address the challenges posed by ECM heterogeneity and complexity, highlighting their potential to advance precision oncology by incorporating patient cells. To isolate the effect of mechanical stiffness on tumor cell behavior, we maintained constant concentrations of GelMA and HAMA across soft and stiff models while adjusting the LAP concentrations. Our findings emphasize the critical influence of ECM stiffness on tumor heterogeneity and progression. We identified significant differences in stiffness between tumor and non-tumor tissues, where softer normal tissues might create a permissive environment for invasion and expansion. LUAD tissues in general exhibited greater variability than other NSCLC subtypes. These insights informed the design of our 3D bioprinted models, which revealed that softer ECM conditions enhance tumor invasion and proliferation, while stiffer conditions promote resistance to chemotherapeutic agents like alkylating drugs. Mechanistically, ECM stiffness was found to regulate CCN1 expression, with functional studies confirming that CCN1-mediated invasion and proliferation are context-dependent.</p><p id="p0175">The 3D bioprinted models demonstrated ECM stiffness-dependent variability in chemotherapeutic responses in PDTs, with notable differences in drug sensitivity observed both across patients and between different ECM conditions within the same patient (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Fig. 4B</xref>). In contrast, for combination therapies involving chemotherapy and immunotherapy, the PDT models showed no significant differences in drug response between soft and stiff matrix conditions, despite aligning with the clinical response observed for the patient (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). This discrepancy may reflect the limited sample size, and future studies with an expanded patient cohort are planned to further assess the impact of ECM stiffness on combination therapy outcomes. These findings highlight the importance of patient-specific approaches to capture inter- and intra-patient variability in drug sensitivity, particularly under differing ECM conditions, for optimizing cancer treatment efficacy.</p><p id="p0180">In summary, our work highlights the potential of bioprinted cell line-based tumor-peritumor models and PDT models as versatile tools for investigating ECM-driven tumor biology and guiding personalized therapy. By providing clinically relevant insights into tumor behaviors and drug responses, these models underscore the transformative potential of bioinspired approaches in advancing precision oncology and improving patient outcomes. Future studies that modify biomaterial compositions and concentrations alongside crosslinking parameters, expand patient sample size and subtype diversity, or integrate structural elements such as vasculature into bioprinted models could provide a more comprehensive and physiologically relevant representation of the tumor microenvironment. These advancements would enhance the translational potential of the platform and broaden its applicability across different NSCLC subtypes and disease stages. Moreover, the current study primarily focused on short-term drug responses; future work should incorporate long-term culture and drug exposure to investigate resistance mechanisms and improve the model's predictive value in guiding clinical treatment strategies.</p></sec><sec id="sec4"><label>4</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec4.1"><label>4.1</label><title>Ethical approval</title><p id="p0185">Tumor tissues and adjacent normal tissues were collected from LC patients in the Department of Thoracic Surgery at Jiangnan University Affiliated Hospital.

Subsequently, 2&#x02013;3 small pieces are sectioned and preserved for subsequent mechanical testing, RNA sequencing, DNA sequencing, and other analyses. The remaining tissue is minced into fragments less than 1&#x000a0;mm<sup>3</sup> in a 7&#x000a0;mL centrifuge tube and treated with a digestive enzyme working solution at a ratio of 1&#x000a0;mL per 100&#x000a0;mg of tissue. The enzyme solution comprises 2&#x000a0;mg/mL Type I Collagenase, 1&#x000a0;mg/mL Hyaluronidase, and 0.1&#x000a0;mg/mL DNase (all from Yeasen Biotechnology, China), dissolved in DMEM/F12 medium and filter-sterilized at 0.22&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m for immediate use. Tissue fragments are incubated with the enzyme solution on a 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C shaker for 20&#x02013;40&#x000a0;min, with intermittent pipetting every 15&#x000a0;min to facilitate digestion. Digestion is quenched with an equal volume of DMEM/F12 medium. The cell suspension is then strained through a 70&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m cell strainer, and the remaining tissue on the strainer is gently macerated with a 5&#x000a0;mL syringe plunger. The filtrate is flushed through the strainer with basal medium to collect the cells. The cell suspension is centrifuged at 400g for 5&#x000a0;min, the supernatant is aspirated, and the cell pellet is resuspended in 2&#x000a0;mL of red blood cell lysis buffer and incubated at room temperature for 5&#x000a0;min.

Culture was conducted using a serum-free, complete growth medium specifically formulated for lung cancer PDT (CYM-LC01, Cyberiad Biotech, China).</p></sec><sec id="sec4.15"><label>4.15</label><title>Whole exome sequencing (WES)</title><p id="p0290">WES analysis was conducted on both patient samples and their corresponding PDT models. DNA was extracted using the QIAamp FFPE DNA Tissue Kit (Qiagen), and its quality was evaluated through electrophoresis on a 1&#x000a0;% agarose gel, while concentration was quantified using the Qubit DNA Assay Kit (Life Technologies) and the Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer (Life Technologies). The DNA was fragmented to a length range of 150&#x02013;230 bp, and adapters were ligated to the ends of the fragments. The DNA was then PCR-amplified and enriched using KAPA HyperExome probes (Roche). Library preparation was followed by sequencing on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform (Honsunbio). Both the patient samples and PDT models were sequenced to an average depth of &#x0003e;400&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;in the targeted exon regions.</p><p id="p0295">The sequencing data was processed through various bioinformatics tools. Reads were aligned to the human reference genome (hg19) using Burrows-Wheeler Aligner v0.7.17, and duplicates were removed using Picard v1.119. Indel realignment and base quality score recalibration were performed with the Genome Analysis Toolkit v4.1.9. Somatic single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and indels were detected using Mutect2 and Varscan_Indel v2.4.2, respectively, and annotated with ANNOVAR. Copy number variations (CNVs) and gene fusions were analyzed using CNVkit v0.9.9 and Lumpy v0.2.13, respectively. Purity and ploidy were calculated manually by comparing the variant allele frequencies (VAF) of somatic SNVs with CNV log2 ratios from multiple variants within each sample. The final purity/ploidy estimates were based on Sequenza or ABSOLUTE calculations that best aligned with the manual assessments. For samples with a purity &#x0003c;15&#x000a0;%, no accurate purity estimation was possible.</p><p id="p0300">To assess tumor-PDT SNV concordance, the overlap of variant calls and their respective allele fractions were compared. For each SNV detected in either the tumor or PDT, SAMTOOLS Pileup was used to calculate the VAF for both samples at the variant position, using a minimum base quality and mapping quality of 10. Variants were considered concordant if the VAF was &#x0003e;0 in both samples, and if they were identified by at least two variant callers in one of the samples. CNVs were compared between PDT and tumor by plotting log2 CNV values across chromosomes, with cutoffs of &#x02212;0.235 and 0.2 marking deletions and amplifications, respectively, for a diploid sample with 30&#x000a0;% purity. Neutral regions were marked in green, while deletions and amplifications were shown in red. A narrower y-axis was used for tumor samples to enhance CNV detection. Structural variations (SVs) between PDT and tumor were visualized using LUMPY results. The SNV landscape was illustrated using the Bioconductor package GenVisR v1.8.0, and CNV heatmaps were generated using ComplexHeatmap v1.17.1.</p></sec><sec id="sec4.16"><label>4.16</label><title>Proliferation and drug sensitivity assays</title><p id="p0305">Cell viabilities and proliferation were assessed using the ATP-based CellTiter-Glo 3D assay (Promega).
