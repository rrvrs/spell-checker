<boxed-text id="dtbox1"><caption><title>Research in context</title></caption><sec id="dtbox1sec1"><title>Evidence before this study</title><p id="p0015">The generation of scientific evidence on the effects of emerging and ongoing epidemic threats, as well as related preventive and therapeutic interventions, on pregnant women, fetuses, and neonates, is often severely delayed or entirely lacking. This leaves decision makers, such as policy makers, healthcare providers and pregnant women, without information needed to make informed care decisions, as highlighted in the COVID-19 pandemic. Establishing a set of outcomes could help standardize reporting and timely evidence generation. Before conducting this study, we searched on Pubmed (&#x0201c;Pregnancy&#x0201d; OR &#x0201c;Childbirth&#x0201d; OR &#x0201c;Fetal&#x0201d; OR &#x0201c;Maternofetal&#x0201d; OR &#x0201c;Perinatal&#x0201d; OR &#x0201c;Newborn&#x0201d; OR &#x0201c;Neonatal&#x0201d;) AND (&#x0201c;Outbreaks&#x0201d; OR &#x0201c;Epidemic&#x0201d; OR &#x0201c;Pandemic&#x0201d;) AND (&#x0201c;Basic outcomes&#x0201d; OR &#x0201c;Core outcomes&#x0201d; OR &#x0201c;Core outcome set&#x0201d; OR &#x0201c;Minimal set&#x0201d; OR &#x0201c;COS&#x0201d;), but did not identify relevant publications. A subsequent broader search using this strategy (Pregnancy [Mesh] OR Pregnancy Complications [Mesh] OR Abortion, Spontaneous [Mesh] OR Parturition [Mesh] OR Fetus [Mesh] OR DART [tiab]) AND (Epidemics [Mesh]) AND (Pregnancy Outcome [Mesh]), along with a review of all core outcome sets (COS) registered in the COMET database, also did not identified relevant publications. Although there is literature on standardizing pregnancy and newborn outcomes for immunization safety assessment, there are currently no published COS for maternal and neonatal health research specifically designed for application in the context of ongoing and emerging epidemic threats.</p></sec><sec id="dtbox1sec2"><title>Added value of this study</title><p id="p0020">We developed a COS&#x02014;consisting of 18 main outcomes and 11 complementary outcomes&#x02014;for evaluating maternal and neonatal health during emerging and ongoing epidemic threats across epidemiological studies, clinical studies assessing the safety and effectiveness of preventive and therapeutic interventions, and post-authorization safety surveillance. The development of this COS involved multiple stages and incorporated diverse perspectives from an international group of stakeholders including representatives from civil society, ensuring its relevance and applicability across diverse settings. This COS will contribute to minimize research waste and help facilitate timely evidence generation to enhance preparedness for future epidemics.</p></sec><sec id="dtbox1sec3"><title>Implications of all the available evidence</title><p id="p0025">This COS can help researchers in standardising outcome reporting in epidemiological studies on maternal and neonatal health, product development, and post-authorization surveillance during epidemic threats. Researchers should report this COS as a minimum, alongside any complementary and additional outcomes of interest. Once outcome sets have been defined, it is necessary to identify barriers that inhibit the implementation and adoption of the core outcome sets in various settings. Developing strategies to overcome these barriers is essential to effectively enhance the comparability and meta-analysis of study findings, thereby fostering meaningful changes in health research.</p></sec></boxed-text>

While these outcomes refer to the woman and neonate respectively, combining them requires linking maternal and neonatal records, which could impact data collection in some settings.

For example, certain outcomes should be measured when the outbreak infection is suspected or confirmed to influence pathophysiological mechanisms of these outcomes (e.g., SARS-CoV-2 infection and preeclampsia). However, they may not be necessary for other diseases where such relationship is not suspected (e.g., Zika virus and preeclampsia). Certain outcomes should be considered when assessing the safety of interventions. In studies where these complementary outcomes are not being collected, the impact of the epidemic on these conditions can be assessed through mortality analysis. Finally, stakeholders highlighted that these outcomes may need to be measured if they could be confounders or the outbreak is related to a pathogen that has not yet been characterized.</p><p id="p0215">The outcome <italic>maternal admission to intensive care unit</italic>/<italic>special unit</italic> generated debate about the global variability of access to intensive care and the validity of the outcome in low-resource settings. It was considered an outcome that measures the capacity to respond to emergencies and not exclusively the type of care required or the severity of the disease. Participants agreed that in settings where intensive care is available, the outcome should be reported. The outcome <italic>maternal mechanical ventilation</italic> was renamed as <italic>maternal respiratory support</italic> to include any respiratory therapy given the varying availability of respiratory support interventions in different settings. This outcome was proposed as complementary due to reporting concerns in settings with restricted availability and because it may be more relevant for respiratory diseases outbreaks.</p><p id="p0220">Participants strongly agreed on the importance of measuring <italic>maternal depression</italic> and <italic>anxiety</italic>, because both, women experiencing pregnancy during infectious disease outbreak or pregnant women who have an infection may have a higher risk of experiencing these outcomes than the general population. However, concerns were raised regarding the appropriateness of conducting screening tests in settings where diagnostic and management pathways are not well established. Consequently, it was proposed to measure them in settings where systems for referral, diagnosis and management of women who screen positive are established, or could be provided in the context of research. Additionally, it might not be suitable for product development and post-authorization surveillance.</p><p id="p0225">Participants unanimously emphasized the relevance of gender-based violence; however, concerns were raised due to the current lack of WHO recommendations for population-wide screening, and the substantial underreporting associated with administrative data, particularly in countries where the issue is most prevalent. In addition, this outcome was related to isolation rather than the infectious disease. Therefore, it was decided not to include it in the final list of outcomes.

If they choose not to measure certain outcomes, they should provide a justification for this decision. We recognize that certain outcomes, although essential, may be difficult to be measured, particularly during wide outbreaks and shortage of resources. For instance vertical transmission may require several tests and different techniques and impose a significant burden on providers.<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr"><sup>48</sup></xref> Other outcomes are easy to measure but may be considered &#x0201c;weak&#x0201d; because they rely on criteria non universally shared (e.g., admission to intensive care).

Also, additional outcomes should be considered depending on the research question. Certain additional outcomes can be reported without the need to collect additional variables. For instance, weight-for-gestational-age can be derived from the same enabling terms (birth weight and gestational age) used to report low birth weight and prematurity. The results of this systematic review, which reported outcomes across different types of research studies and diseases could facilitate the selection of additional specific outcomes.</p><p id="p0295">Finally, definitions were agreed upon with consideration of their applicability across all settings, including those with limited resources. However, some outcome definitions are aspirational in certain settings. For instance, defining stillbirth to include all fetal deaths from 22 weeks of gestational age, instead of the 28-week threshold often used for statistical purposes, poses a challenge.</p><p id="p0300">This study has several strengths. First, the methodology was defined <italic>a priori</italic> based on the guidelines of the COMET Initiative, and the development of the core outcome set followed a rigorous multistage approach. Second, it included diverse perspectives from international key stakeholders, including representatives from civil society. Participants came from a wide array of countries with varying income levels, ensuring the relevance and applicability of the developed COS across diverse settings. Other strengths of the study include the low attrition follow-up rate, and the diversity of domains, such as patient-relevant outcomes and those related to service delivery. We also advanced the definitions of each outcome within the COS. Finally, this COS is not limited to experimental studies, but can also be applied to epidemiological research.</p><p id="p0305">However, our study has some limitations. There were imbalances in the size of the panels, although this was compensated for the equitable weight ascribed to each of the four panels for decision-making, independent of its size. No participants with expertise in mental health were invited to the face-to-face meeting, as a consequence the consensus on the definitions of &#x0201c;depression and anxiety&#x0201d; and the suggestions on measurement instruments derived from published WHO recommendations. Additionally, the outcomes initially identified through the systematic review were primarily derived from epidemiological studies in the context of COVID-19; and the search was conducted from 2015 onwards, which may have led to the omission of outcomes from earlier epidemics. It is possible that we missed outcomes reported in other languages and smaller studies, specifically those with fewer than 50 participants (e.g. mpox and listeria outbreaks). Nevertheless, studies covering a range of diseases with various modes of transmission were included. We did not conduct a qualitative study to identify outcomes that were not documented in the literature. This limitation was mitigated by the participation of representatives of civil society and asking to propose additional outcomes. Finally, although the methodology is well described, the published evidence supporting it is limited, including the agreement criteria; and final decisions were made during consensus meetings. We attempted to address this limitation by following robust methodological standards. However, a necessary next step is to evaluate the acceptability of this COS on a larger scale.</p><p id="p0310">This COS, developed through a robust methodology with an international multidisciplinary effort, will serve to standardize outcome selection, collection, and reporting in maternal and neonatal health research and surveillance during epidemics. We suggest that researchers conducting epidemiological studies, product development, and post-authorization surveillance report main COS outcomes as a minimum, along with complementary and additional outcomes of interest.</p><p id="p0315">Further research is needed to identify stakeholders&#x02019; acceptability of the COS and validating them to facilitate the adoption of the COS and ensure its generalizability, credibility, and usability. It will be important to develop standardized data collection tools that include essential data elements to facilitate implementation. Additionally, feasibility assessments in diverse settings are required, including pilot testing of data collection in real-time outbreak scenarios, to identify potential barriers to data collection and reporting. This is especially important for observational studies, as most evaluation of barriers to the use of COS have been conducted in the context of experimental studies.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>Contributors</title><p id="p0320">MBo and OTO conceived the idea and contributed to funding acquisition.
