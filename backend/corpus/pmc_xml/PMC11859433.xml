However, there is limited knowledge regarding its real-world utilization and long-term impact in clinical practice. This study assessed how often PGx information informs treatment decisions and evaluated patients&#x02019; perspectives on its use and non-use, identifying enablers for PGx implementation. A mixed-methods study was conducted with 24 patients with a median of 1 year after PGx testing. Medication and health-related data were collected at enrollment and at the follow-up 1 year later using a semi-structured questionnaire. At the follow-up, 62 medication changes were identified in 18 patients. A median of four medication changes per patient were initiated mainly by medical specialists (58%). PGx information was considered for 15 patients in 39 medication changes (63%). Patient-reported factors contributing to the non-use of PGx information included a lack of knowledge and interest among healthcare professionals (HCPs), structural and administrative barriers, and an over-reliance on patient advocacy. Potential enablers should address targeted PGx education, interprofessional collaboration, awareness among policymakers, and concise recommendations focused on PGx-actionable drugs from testing providers. By implementing these interdependent enablers, PGx can evolve into a long-term, clinically integrated cornerstone of individualized pharmacotherapy.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>PGx</kwd><kwd>medication changes</kwd><kwd>patient perspective</kwd><kwd>implementation</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>This research received no external funding.</funding-statement></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-pharmacy-13-00014"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Adverse drug reactions (ADR) and therapy failure (TF) are common drug-related problems (DRPs) [<xref rid="B1-pharmacy-13-00014" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Such interindividual drug responses affect a substantial part of the population. In Europe, around 8.6 million unplanned hospital admissions are caused by ADR each year, half of which are considered preventable [<xref rid="B2-pharmacy-13-00014" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>One factor contributing to interindividual drug responses is variations in genes, which influence the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of a drug. Such genetic variations are frequent. According to a large study based on data from the UK Biobank, up to 100% of the population carry genetic variations that could lead to an interindividual response to at least one drug [<xref rid="B3-pharmacy-13-00014" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Meanwhile, exposure to drugs potentially affected by pharmacogenetics (PGx) is also common [<xref rid="B4-pharmacy-13-00014" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Data from a representative sample of the Swiss population indicate that 78.8% were exposed to at least one PGx-associated drug over the period from 2016 to 2020 [<xref rid="B5-pharmacy-13-00014" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Over the last three decades, personalized medicine has experienced an extensive evolution considering the increase in knowledge about genetic variations affecting drug response. In this context, PGx testing has been established to incorporate an individual&#x02019;s genetic information into drug therapy decisions. Today, various providers offer PGx tests that enable personalized therapy recommendations. As a result, the &#x0201c;one size fits all&#x0201d; approach is slowly becoming obsolete, and the importance of tailored, individualized pharmacotherapy is constantly increasing. While 313 studies indexed under the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) term &#x0201c;pharmacogenomics&#x0201d; were published in 2003, this number increased to 1111 publications in 2023 (<uri xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/</uri>, accessed on 30 January 2025).</p><p>Several studies focus on the implementation of PGx in clinical practice and assess the potential benefit of pharmacotherapies in diverse patient populations [<xref rid="B6-pharmacy-13-00014" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>In theory, PGx testing seems to be a promising approach for optimizing drug therapies [<xref rid="B7-pharmacy-13-00014" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>However, outside controlled study settings, it is considerably less used and accepted, and faces challenges during application [<xref rid="B8-pharmacy-13-00014" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-pharmacy-13-00014" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-pharmacy-13-00014" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-pharmacy-13-00014" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. It is also questioned whether the real-world implementation of PGx, in terms of cost and effort, is justified by the resulting improvement in therapy outcomes [<xref rid="B6-pharmacy-13-00014" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B12-pharmacy-13-00014" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-pharmacy-13-00014" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-pharmacy-13-00014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Also, there is limited knowledge about the long-term utilization and impact of PGx testing information in routine clinical practice.</p><p>In this study, we aimed to assess, in patients with access to PGx test information, how often this information is used over time to inform treatment decisions and to evaluate the factors that influence its use or non-use. Our overall goal was to provide insights into the use and non-use of PGx information and its context from the patient&#x02019;s perspective and to contribute to the expert field by identifying enablers in the overall implementation process of PGx testing in clinical practice.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-pharmacy-13-00014"><title>2. Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2dot1-pharmacy-13-00014"><title>2.1. Study Design</title><p>We performed a convergent parallel mixed-method study using semi-structured interviews. This design was chosen because it enables a comprehensive exploration of the research question.

Patients who received PGx testing in primary or secondary healthcare institutions, either in a study setting or routine practice, were invited to participate. A requirement for participation was the patients&#x02019; access to PGx panel test information or results from at least three different PGx single gene tests. There was no time restriction on when the PGx test was conducted. All participants provided written consent for the analysis and publication of their responses.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3-pharmacy-13-00014"><title>2.3. Data Collection</title><p>After patient enrollment, medication- and health-related data were collected via initial telephone interviews conducted between the patient and a trained professional from the study center in 2023. This enrollment procedure ensured a consistent baseline, as the recruited patients had undergone PGx testing at different timepoints over several years before enrollment.</p><p>Follow-ups were performed as semi-structured telephone interviews one year after enrollment. Patients also had the possibility of answering the questions in written form. In this case, patients sent the completed semi-structured questionnaire, along with an updated current medication plan, to the study center using a postage-paid envelope.</p><p>Data were collected by A.B.

Data Analysis</title><p>Quantitative and qualitative data were analyzed simultaneously. The Swiss trade names of the drugs were replaced with the active ingredient names. For quantitative data, descriptive statistics, including means, standard deviations, and medians, with interquartile ranges (IQR), were calculated using Microsoft Office Professional Plus, Excel, version 16.0 (2016). For qualitative data, interviews were analyzed according to the grounded theory approach [<xref rid="B17-pharmacy-13-00014" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Thematic data saturation was reached after 24 interviews. The qualitative data analysis consisted of the following three processes: open coding, axial coding to define categories, and selective coding to identify core categories. MAXQDA Plus 2022 software (VERBI GmbH, Berlin, Germany, version 22.1.0) was used for open coding. Microsoft Office Professional Plus, Excel, version 16.0 (2016) was used for axial and selective coding. A.B. and M.S.F. independently coded the qualitative data within the four key themes. The core categories and the selected patient quotes were determined through discussion until consensus was reached.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot5-pharmacy-13-00014"><title>2.5.

Long-Term Use of PGx Information to Inform Treatment Decisions</title><p>The study results demonstrate that PGx information was considered for medication changes, with a median of 2 years between PGx test and follow-up. This suggests that PGx information is not only used when addressing the initial reason for testing, but it is also reused over time, highlighting its potential for long-term utility. In a previous analysis of a Swiss case series study, we observed that PGx information was considered in 62% of all medication changes within 6 months after a PGx test [<xref rid="B15-pharmacy-13-00014" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Comparably, PGx information was considered in 63% of all medication changes during this longer follow-up period, suggesting that the consideration of PGx information to inform treatment decisions does not diminish over time. However, in this patient population with main diagnoses in the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) sections F, M, and I, a high compliance rate in using PGx information might be expected based on findings from the literature [<xref rid="B20-pharmacy-13-00014" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-pharmacy-13-00014" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-pharmacy-13-00014" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-pharmacy-13-00014" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Various drugs used to treat these diagnoses are PGx-actionable, which means that concrete dosing and recommendation guidelines exist (<uri xlink:href="www.pharmgkb.org">www.pharmgkb.org</uri>, accessed on 30 January 2025). Consequently, the implications of PGx testing results may be more relevant for physicians of these patient groups.</p><p>In our study, a median of four medication changes per patient were initiated between enrollment and follow-up, with a median of two medication changes involving the consideration of PGx information, as perceived by the treated patient. This represents a relevant use of PGx information, especially important in this patient population at risk for polypharmacy. The high percentage of the initiation of a new drug as the main type of medication change, along with the increasing median number of prescribed drugs per patient between enrollment and follow-up, demonstrates that the expected growing number of daily medication use is already evident in a patient population with a median of 61 years.</p><p>Beyond the explicit PGx-based recommendation to change a medication, patients reported that PGx information was also considered, even when those decisions to change a medication were initiated for other reasons, such as changes in health status. This suggests that having access to PGx panel test information is helpful regardless of the context, even to validate that a drug is pharmacogenetically not relevant (e.g., as P17 noted during opioid withdrawal and the initiation of clonidine).</p><p>However, it is essential to note that PGx does not address all DRPs, and symptoms may persist even when PGx information is considered to inform treatment decisions. In this context, four patients of the study population expressed a desire for further medication changes, as they were experiencing an ADR or TF from medications that are not known to be PGx relevant (e.g., P23 with hydroxychloroquine). Drug response is influenced by numerous factors, many of which cannot be explained by PGx [<xref rid="B24-pharmacy-13-00014" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-pharmacy-13-00014" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>Of the study population, 17% expressed a desire for further medication changes due to dissatisfaction with their current drug therapy caused by DRPs, while 83% reported being satisfied. Notably, Kemp et al. (2020) described in a systematic review that 10&#x02013;20% of hospital admissions among older patients (&#x0003e;65 years) are attributable to DRPs [<xref rid="B26-pharmacy-13-00014" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Given the demographic similarity, the observed 17% of patients experiencing DRPs in our study may be representative of this patient group. This is in line with a study by Reji et al. (2024) of older patients, reporting that 75% were satisfied with their overall medical care, while 25% were dissatisfied [<xref rid="B27-pharmacy-13-00014" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. These findings also broadly align with our study results. Reji et al. (2024) further found that patients with higher literacy status were more satisfied, which could be attributable to greater awareness of treatment options and their benefits. Since all our patients underwent PGx testing and counseling, it could be hypothesized that they are, in general, well-informed about their medications and PGx data. This might reflect a higher health literacy level, which, according to the literature, is associated with better health outcomes [<xref rid="B28-pharmacy-13-00014" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B29-pharmacy-13-00014" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec4dot2-pharmacy-13-00014"><title>4.2.

Need for Interprofessional Collaboration, Education, and Awareness</title><p>An important finding is the need for improved interprofessional collaboration among HCPs. Our study participants highlighted no or limited communication between HCPs and the inconsistent sharing of PGx data across specialties, as structural and systemic barriers. These observations have previously been reported in the literature [<xref rid="B30-pharmacy-13-00014" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B31-pharmacy-13-00014" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].

This suggests that effective interprofessional collaboration, particularly between GPs, medical specialists, and pharmacists, might be essential to maximize the utility of PGx data in clinical workflows.</p><p>The lack of awareness and education among HCPs was recognized by our study participants as a reason for the non-use of PGx data. These findings indicate a need for expanded training opportunities for both undergraduate and postgraduate HCPs. This aligns with prior research, which has demonstrated that targeted educational initiatives improve HCPs&#x02019; confidence and competence in handling PGx information [<xref rid="B33-pharmacy-13-00014" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B34-pharmacy-13-00014" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].

Similarly, St&#x000e4;uble et al. (2021) reported the positive impact of a digital blended learning program on pharmacist-led PGx services [<xref rid="B34-pharmacy-13-00014" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p><p>While the knowledge gap among HCPs is only a patient-reported perspective in our study, the existing literature addresses physicians&#x02019; and pharmacists&#x02019; attitudes toward PGx, revealing a self-reported lack of awareness and education [<xref rid="B35-pharmacy-13-00014" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="B36-pharmacy-13-00014" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Muflih et al. (2021) explored in a cross-sectional survey of 200 physicians their self-reported knowledge gaps in PGx. The majority of the physicians expressed that they were not aware of PGx testing and uncertain about their expertise in implementing PGx testing results [<xref rid="B35-pharmacy-13-00014" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In addition, Makrygianni et al. (2023) investigated pharmacy students&#x02019; attitudes and intentions towards PGx, reporting that while interest was high, students felt unprepared to use PGx in clinical practice due to insufficient training [<xref rid="B36-pharmacy-13-00014" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. These findings suggest that the use of PGx data depends not only on the information itself but also on the educated and supportive environment in which it is applied. This highlights the need to integrate PGx education on a broader scale into healthcare systems, which is also supported in the literature by calls for systemic reforms to promote awareness among all stakeholders, including policymakers [<xref rid="B33-pharmacy-13-00014" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec4dot2dot2-pharmacy-13-00014"><title>4.2.2. Patient Empowerment Without Shifting Responsibility</title><p>Participants in our study demonstrated a proactive initiative to ensure their PGx information was considered in treatments decisions. This observation reflects a study finding that highlights the importance of patient empowerment as an essential cornerstone of modern medicine [<xref rid="B37-pharmacy-13-00014" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The proactive involvement of patients who independently consulted their PGx data or asked HCPs to consider it demonstrates how patients&#x02019; engagement can positively influence PGx information utilization. However, our results indicated that not all patients want to take an active role in coordinating their care (e.g., P10, P13). In the literature, the over-reliance on patients&#x02019; self-advocacy has also raised concerns [<xref rid="B38-pharmacy-13-00014" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="B39-pharmacy-13-00014" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="B40-pharmacy-13-00014" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].

This might be particularly important for patients who are unable to do so due to severe illness, language, or other barriers. However, since our study revealed that some patients use the PGx information independently (e.g., P4), PGx testing providers should offer educational materials and resources to ensure patients understand the role and limitations of PGx information accurately.</p></sec><sec id="sec4dot2dot3-pharmacy-13-00014"><title>4.2.3. Practical Utility of PGx Information</title><p>The utility of practical PGx recommendations emerged as a key enabler in informing treatment decisions. This was notably shown in scenarios where the data directly informed treatment decisions, as described by patients who reported active consideration by HCPs (e.g., P8). Another driver was the interest and engagement shown by HCPs when reviewing the PGx information. Patients mentioned that certain medical specialists, particularly anesthesiologists, incorporated PGx information into their decision-making during hospital stays and surgical procedures. This suggests that integrating PGx into specific clinical workflows, such as perioperative care, could serve as a model for broader adoption. The utilization of PGx information by anesthesiologists in PGx data has previously been observed in the literature [<xref rid="B41-pharmacy-13-00014" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="B42-pharmacy-13-00014" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="B43-pharmacy-13-00014" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Gabriel et al. (2020) and Landau et al. (2012) identified the perioperative care as a promising area for PGx integration [<xref rid="B42-pharmacy-13-00014" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="B43-pharmacy-13-00014" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. These findings align with literature emphasizing the utility of PGx data in contexts where clinical relevance has already been described. Crews et al. (2021), Matic et al. (2022), and Hicks et al. (2017) elaborated on how dosing guidelines for PGx-actionable drugs, specifically analgesics, opioids, and antidepressants, facilitate their direct application in clinical practice [<xref rid="B44-pharmacy-13-00014" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="B45-pharmacy-13-00014" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="B46-pharmacy-13-00014" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. This perspective is supported by the existing literature, which suggests that excessive or ambiguous information may hinder the clinical implementation of PGx [<xref rid="B33-pharmacy-13-00014" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B46-pharmacy-13-00014" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. These findings indicate that the utilization of PGx information and, therefore, the success of long-term PGx implementation also relies on how well the information is presented and tailored to relevant clinical questions by the provider. We suggest that PGx information should be structured, concise, and focused on PGx-actionable drugs with established guidelines or at least robust evidence, while prioritizing clarity and relevance over excess information.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec4dot3-pharmacy-13-00014"><title>4.3. Study Limitations and Future Directions</title><p>This study has limitations that should be considered. First, all findings are based on patients&#x02019; perspectives, which provide valuable insights, but may lack the complementary point of view of other involved parties, especially of HCPs. However, we already conducted a study investigating the HCPs&#x02019; perspective on the implementation of PGx [<xref rid="B47-pharmacy-13-00014" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The findings of our study and those of Wiss et al. (2024) revealed both shared and diverging perspectives regarding the barriers and enablers in the implementation of PGx in clinical practice. One key similarity is the recognition of insufficient PGx knowledge among HCPs. Also, both studies highlighted the importance of interprofessional collaboration as a critical enabler, while its absence was identified in both studies as a barrier. A notable divergence between the two studies concerns the role of patient empowerment. Wiss et al. (2024) described that HCPs desired greater patient involvement as a facilitator for successful PGx implementation. In contrast, our study reported that patients often perceived this as a burden, particularly when they were required to advocate for the use of PGx information. However, it is important to note that the two studies are not directly comparable, as their methodologies and the questions posed to participants differed. Future directions could include the establishment of a focus group comprising all involved stakeholders, including physicians, pharmacists, and patient representatives, to foster a comprehensive dialogue and share the diverse perspectives and needs of HCPs and patients regarding the implementation of PGx.</p><p>Second, the sample size consisted of 24 participants, and, while thematic saturation was reached, the selective patient recruitment may have limited the generalizability of our findings. In this context, it must be noted that sociodemographic factors were not collected. As a result, it is possible that the educational attainment of our study population does not represent that of the general population [<xref rid="B48-pharmacy-13-00014" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], particularly since our findings indicate that our population exhibits a high level of health literacy. Also, it may be possible that our study participants were primed to use their PGx testing results more frequently due to the enrollment in the study.</p><p>Third, as the study inclusion criteria did not define restriction on the time frame since the PGx test, the test was conducted at various timepoints among the patients. Conclusions about the longitudinal use of PGx information following testing were derived from the median values. Further, the follow-up period was limited to 1 year after study enrollment. To ensure transferability of our results, follow-ups should be continued for 3&#x02013;5 years after PGx testing to compare whether the use of PGx information in informing treatment decisions decreases or stabilizes over time. Moreover, the insights gained from this study will serve as a basis for further development of a structured questionnaire, enabling an enhanced continuation of this research. Beyond this, the next steps should include investigating the economic and clinical outcomes of PGx-guided therapy to further strengthen the motivation for integrating PGx into clinical practice.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec5-pharmacy-13-00014"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>Our findings demonstrate that PGx information is not only used immediately after initial testing but is also continuously used to inform treatment decisions over time. This highlights its potential for sustained clinical relevance. Based on the patient-reported factors for the use or non-use, we identified several potential enablers for the successful and long-term integration of PGx information into routine clinical workflows, including the need for interprofessional collaboration among HCPs, enhanced PGx education, and raising general awareness about personalized pharmacotherapy, particularly among policymakers. Simultaneously, while patient empowerment is becoming increasingly important for modern medicine, technical solutions could ensure that patients&#x02019; PGx information is used by HCPs without relying on patients&#x02019; self-advocacy. To improve the practical utility of PGx information, testing providers should ensure that recommendations are well-structured, concise, and focused on PGx-actionable drugs with established evidence. By addressing these interdependent challenges, PGx can evolve into a clinically integrated cornerstone of individualized pharmacotherapy, ultimately improving patient care over the long term.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclaimer/Publisher&#x02019;s Note:</bold> The statements, opinions and data contained in all publications are solely those of the individual author(s) and contributor(s) and not of MDPI and/or the editor(s).
