A regulatory health authority raised concerns after receiving spontaneous reports for NIU following exposure to Remicade<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, a biologic therapy with multiple indications for which alternative therapies are available. In assessment of this clinical question, we applied validity diagnostics to support observational data causal inferences.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">We assessed the risk of NIU among patients exposed to Remicade<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> compared to alternative biologics. Five databases, four study populations, and four analysis methodologies were used to estimate 80 potential treatment effects, with 20 pre-specified as primary. The study populations included inflammatory bowel conditions Crohn&#x02019;s disease or ulcerative colitis (IBD), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), psoriatic conditions plaque psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis (PsO/PsA), and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We conducted four analysis strategies intended to address limitations of causal estimation using observational data and applied four diagnostics with pre-specified quantitative rules to evaluate threats to validity from observed and unobserved confounding. We also qualitatively assessed post-propensity score matching representativeness, and bias susceptibility from outcome misclassification. We fit Cox proportional-hazards models, conditioned on propensity score-matched sets, to estimate the on-treatment risk of NIU among Remicade<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> initiators versus alternatives. Estimates from analyses that passed four validity tests were assessed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">Of the 80 total analyses and the 20 analyses pre-specified as primary, 24% and 20% passed diagnostics, respectively. Among patients with IBD, we observed no evidence of increased risk for NIU relative to other similarly indicated biologics (pooled hazard ratio [HR] 0.75, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.38&#x02013;1.40). For patients with RA, we observed no increased risk relative to similarly indicated biologics, although results were imprecise (HR: 1.23, 95% CI 0.14&#x02013;10.47).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">We applied validity diagnostics on a heterogenous, observational setting to answer a specific research question. The results indicated that safety effect estimates from many analyses would be inappropriate to interpret as causal, given the data available and methods employed. Validity diagnostics should always be used to determine if the design and analysis are of sufficient quality to support causal inferences. The clinical implications of our findings on IBD suggests that, if an increased risk exists, it is unlikely to be greater than 40% given the 1.40 upper bound of the pooled HR confidence interval.</p></sec><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12874-024-02428-7.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Observational study</kwd><kwd>Causal inference</kwd><kwd>Autoimmune disorders</kwd><kwd>Biologic agents</kwd><kwd>Non-infectious uveitis</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004331</institution-id><institution>Johnson and Johnson</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature 2024</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par5">Randomized controlled trials (RCT) are the gold standard for estimating causal effects between drug exposures and health outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In an ideal, perfectly specified and conducted RCT, the treatment effect is an unbiased estimate of the effect of treatment on the outcome. Randomization ensures balance on baseline observed and unobserved factors that if unbalanced could confound effect estimates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Additionally, RCTs generally evaluate a well-defined study population whose subjects must meet strict inclusion/exclusion criteria applied by trained investigators at enrollment, which selects the subject sample to represent the target population of interest. Further, study outcome case adjudication by trained clinicians reduces or eliminates bias from outcome misclassification.</p><p id="Par6">RCTs are resource intensive and slow in response to urgently needed evidence and medical innovation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], although the RECOVERY trial demonstrated that rapid RCT execution is possible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. They demonstrate strong internal validity through rigorous design and strict inclusion/exclusion criteria, but the tradeoff is reduced external validity and generalizability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Moreover, RCTs are often under powered or of insufficient follow-up time to detect uncommon or longer-term adverse events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Lastly, ethical considerations exclude vulnerable populations from participation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], leaving evidence gaps for patients in need of informed treatment decisions.</p><p id="Par7">So, out of necessity is an opportunity for researchers to attempt to make valid causal inferences from observational data. Following the US 21st Century Cures Act of 2016 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], real-world evidence (RWE) derived from the analysis of real-world data (RWD) has been increasingly called upon by regulatory authorities for evidentiary needs to complement what is known from clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">Despite the promise of using RWE to inform clinical, policy, and regulatory decisions when RCT evidence is unavailable, causal inferences made from RWD have historically been inconsistent or contradictory. For example, in evaluating whether bisphosphonates cause an increased risk of esophageal cancer among patients in the Clinical Practice Research Datalink database, two investigator teams reported and published conflicting results. A comparative cohort study reported no increased risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] whereas a nested case-control study reported a 30% increased risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Such inconsistencies compromise the reliability of and confidence in causal inferences made from RWD<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn1">1</xref>.</p><p id="Par10">Nonetheless, recent advances have been promising. Contrary to current guidelines, observational cohort studies found chlorthalidone use was not associated with cardiovascular benefit compared to hydrochlorothiazide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and these accurately predicted a subsequently reported RCT assessing the same question [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Further, the RCT-DUPLICATE initiative demonstrated high concordance between results from a selected sample of RCTs and corresponding observational study results intended for replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. These advances support continuing health authority commitment to ongoing RWD and RWE policy development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p id="Par11">Despite these advances, threats to the validity of causal estimation using observational data persist. Inherent to all observational studies intended to draw causal inferences are risks of bias from observed and unobserved confounding, measurement error such as outcome misclassification, and poor sample representativeness of the target population. In this study, we illustrate the use of diagnostics to assess whether valid causal inferences can be made to address a health authority query on a specific safety concern for a biologic therapy with multiple indications for which many alternative therapies are available. We addressed this concern by conducting an observational, comparative cohort safety study intended to estimate the causal effect on Remicade<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> on non-infectious uveitis (NIU). To address these concerns in this work, we identified, evaluated, and reduced threats to the validity of our study causal inferences using a set of diagnostics.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Objectives</title><p id="Par12">We investigated whether exposure to Remicade<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> caused an increased risk of NIU compared to other biologics within indication-specific study populations across five observational databases. Our analysis underwent four validity diagnostics, supplemented by two qualitative diagnostics. First, we present the clinical study example. Secondly, we detail the validity diagnostics employed to evaluate the analysis&#x02019;s potential for supporting causal inference. Thirdly, these diagnostics were applied to our observational clinical study. This study showcases how validity diagnostics enhance the credibility of evidence for comparative effect estimation derived from observational data.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par13">We designed and conducted an active comparator, new user, PS-matched cohort study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] to estimate the risk of NIU among new users of Remicade<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>.

This was a multi-database study that allows for analysis of diverse patient populations, rare exposures and outcomes, and supports replicability and generalizability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Further, evidence from multi-database studies is strengthened by assessing results consistency across databases.</p><sec id="Sec5"><title>Data sources</title><p id="Par14">We conducted the study in five databases, three administrative claims and two electronic health record (EHR) databases, all from the United States (US). The claims databases included Merative&#x02122; MarketScan<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Commercial Database (CCAE), Optum<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> de-Identified Clinformatics<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Data Mart Database (Clinformatics<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>), IQVIA Pharmetrics Plus (Pharmetrics). The EHR databases included Optum<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> de-identified Electronic Health Record Dataset (Optum<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> EHR) and IQVIA Ambulatory EMR (Amb EMR). These five US databases provide multiple perspectives on the study populations given variation in population composition and data capture process by database. Detailed database descriptions are available in Appendix <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>.</p><p id="Par15">The databases were standardized in structure and content into the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] which is maintained by the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) community. This standardization allows the strictly consistent application of analytic routines across multiple, disparate databases that eliminates variability of cohort definitions, variable definitions, and analytic implementation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Study populations</title><p id="Par16">We assessed four non-mutually exclusive populations that are indicated for Remicade<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>: patients with inflammatory bowel conditions Crohn&#x02019;s disease or ulcerative colitis (IBD), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), psoriatic conditions plaque psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis (PsO/PsA), and rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

The PS was calculated for each patient as the predicted probability of target exposure status from an L1 regularized logistic regression model, fit with a Laplace prior where the regularization hyperparameter was selected by optimizing the likelihood in a 10-fold cross validation with a starting variance of 0.01 and a tolerance of 2*10<sup>&#x02212;&#x02009;7</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>].

We chose this persistence window based on recommended administration frequency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>] and an empirical assessment of the durations between subsequent administrations for the drugs in three data sources included in this study. The days distribution between successive exposures showed that 75% of sequential administration records occurred within 90 days for all drugs in all databases except for ustekinumab in Optum EHR<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>.

Negative controls were selected by a semi-automated process that identifies conditions with no evidence of causal drug effects per spontaneous reports, published literature, and product labels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Because of the a priori assertion of no target or comparator effect on the negative control outcomes, we assume the difference between hypothetical null (hazard ratio [HR]&#x02009;=&#x02009;1) and the observed effect on a negative control is considered residual systematic error from unmeasured sources. The set of negative controls outcomes are in Appendix <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>.

One key assumption for causal inference from a potential outcomes framework is exchangeability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. In the context of estimating the average treatment effect among the treated (ATT) (and the ATO using PS matching with a caliper) we assume partial exchangeability, the potential outcome under no treatment must be unrelated to treatment assignment conditional on measured covariates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. The PS is a balancing score, such that the distribution of observed baseline covariates will be equivalent between target and comparator patients with similar PS values, and if strong ignorability with partial exchangeability holds then treatment assignment is unrelated to the potential outcome under no treatment conditional on the PS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. PS matching is used to approximate exchangeability between exposed patient cohorts that have been selectively assigned treatments during routine clinical care. Exchangeable target and comparator cohorts are those where exposure status is the only difference between them, where we can attribute any difference in outcome occurrence to exposure status only [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>].</p><p id="Par40">For each analysis in each database intended to generate an effect estimate, we applied the following validity diagnostics to determine whether we could report the result as reliable.</p><sec id="Sec11"><title>Empirical equipoise</title><p id="Par41">Empirical equipoise is a diagnostic related to partial exchangeability. Specifically, target and comparator cohorts with similar PS distributions, or a high degree of overlap, will have similar baseline covariate distributions on average. Further, these patient cohorts will resemble each other on observed baseline covariates including confounders, thereby making it more likely that the partial exchangeability assumption has been met. After fitting the PS model, plotting the PS distribution stratified by exposure status can help assess partial exchangeability. By calculating the proportion of study population patients with PS overlap near equipoise (PS&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.5), we can appraise comparability appropriateness before applying any statistical balancing techniques to strengthen exchangeability. A patient is in empirical equipoise if their preference score (a transformation of the PS that normalizes for exposure cohort size imbalances) is between 0.3 and 0.7 of the preference score distribution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. If the proportion of patients in empirical equipoise was less than 35% in an analysis, then it failed the equipoise diagnostic. We were more liberal than the 50% threshold proposed by Walker [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>] because we prioritized bias reduction and internal validity over initial comparability assessment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Covariate balance</title><p id="Par42">Covariate balance is another diagnostic related to partial exchangeability. Conditional on the PS, patients of different exposure status should have similar distributions of baseline covariates. This assertion requires empirical confirmation to meet the assumption that treatment effect estimates are only valid only if patients in the two exposure cohorts have similar distributions of observed baseline covariates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. In the sample of PS-matched patients, we assessed baseline covariate distribution similarity by calculating and plotting the absolute standardized difference (ASD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>] of every covariate before and after applying PS matching. For binary covariates, the ASD is the absolute prevalence difference of a covariate in units of the pooled standard deviation and is insensitive to sample size. We considered after matching ASDs less than 0.1 to indicate a negligible difference between cohorts in a pairwise comparison [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. If any covariate in a comparison had an ASD greater than or equal to 0.1, then the analysis failed the covariate balance diagnostic.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Expected absolute standardized error</title><p id="Par43">The expected absolute standardized error (EASE) metric detects and quantifies residual bias from unobserved sources, which relates to the assumption of partial exchangeability. To compute EASE, we first generate a residual systematic error distribution using effect size estimates for negative controls, assuming this distribution follows a normal distribution. We fit this distribution similarly to the random-effects component in a meta-analysis, capturing deviations from the null that are not attributed to random error (as indicated by estimated systematic errors) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. EASE then summarizes this systematic error distribution by integrating over its absolute values. An EASE of 0 suggests that the variance in negative control estimates is fully explained by random error, indicating the absence of systematic error. We considered analyses where EASE was greater than 0.25 to have failed the diagnostic. When EASE&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.25 and systematic error is centered on 0, a true relative risk of 1 has a 95% probability of being observed between 0.54 and 1.85 due to systematic error. Although empirical calibration could statistically restore nominal operating characteristics, we decided EASE&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.25 identified unacceptable design operating characteristics even after PS adjustment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Non-zero event counts</title><p id="Par44">For a HR to be estimated from a Cox PH model, outcome occurrences during the TAR for both target and comparator cohorts in the analysis had to be greater than zero. Otherwise, the HR would approach negative or positive infinity, which is not a valid estimate of a causal effect. Analyses where target and/or comparator TAR outcome occurrence counts were zero failed this diagnostic.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Representativeness</title><p id="Par45">In establishing valid causal estimates from observational data, patient restriction from the original study population is sometimes required, for example, when patients are excluded after PS matching or for having an outcome occur before index. This practice is often necessary to ensure the interval validity of the study, but it can be at odds with representativeness. While it has been argued that representativeness may not be essential for scientific study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>], the extent to which the characteristics distribution of the restricted analytic cohort differ from that of the original study population can be assessed empirically. We assessed the extent to which baseline characteristics of the after-matching target cohort are like those of the initial target cohort. We evaluated covariate similarity between the two cohorts by plotting the prevalence of all baseline covariates and calculating ASDs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>].

The close distribution of data points about the diagonal indicates that the prevalence of baseline covariates between the target and after matching cohort were similar, suggesting that patient attrition from PS matching did not substantially alter the composition of the target population. By contrast, the representativeness plot for Amb EMR suggests greater differences between the target and after matching cohort in this database. We observed similar passed diagnostic results in the Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> rows for the Optum<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> EHR and CCAE databases.

This covariate was of low prevalence before and after matching, so despite difference across cohorts, may not have a strong confounding impact on the effect estimate were it also associated with the outcome. But strict adherence to a priori defined thresholds dictate a diagnostics failure.</p><p id="Par53">

Four of our 20 primary analyses conducted across a network of 5 US observational databases passed all validity diagnostics. Of the 80 primary and secondary analyses, 19 of 80 (24%) passed all diagnostics. That most analyses failed diagnostics suggests that the clinical, scientific, and analytic complexity of the research question applied to heterogenous databases was not easily addressed despite the application of many best practices in the field supported by robust methodological research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. This complexity notwithstanding, we identified three databases that passed validity diagnostics in the IBD study population, which facilitated a meta-analysis.</p><p id="Par67">The methodological implementation of the research question was complex for two reasons. First, because Remicade<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> is indicated for several autoimmune disorders that have primary manifestations such as joint pain and bowel inflammation but can also have secondary manifestations such as NIU. We accounted for potential confounding by indication by designing an active comparator cohort study where the target and comparator exposures were both indicated for the same underlying disease, thereby balancing the baseline risk for NIU. Because NIU risk differs among Remicade&#x000ae; indicated populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>], we approximated equal baseline NIU risk distribution between target and comparator cohorts by conducting comparisons within non-mutually exclusive study populations (i.e., IBD, PsA/PsO, RA, and AS). Second, Remicade<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> is an early biologic therapy with five adult indications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>] for which alternative therapies are available. This complexity was reflected in the finding that of 16 analyses &#x000d7; 5 databases&#x02009;=&#x02009;80 effect estimates, 61 (76%) failed diagnostics and did not produce an estimate we could interpret as causal.</p><p id="Par68"><bold>Empirical equipoise</bold> is a state in which a health care provider would be indifferent to treatment choice given the benefits and risks of competing potential therapies and the known clinical history of a patient. In the context of a comparative study, empirical equipoise is identified as a proportion of patients for whom provider preference for a target or comparator treatment is equivalent. Although we designed our treatment comparisons to be among patients with the same underlying conditions to control for confounding by indication and create more balanced groups, patient characteristics may still have influenced treatment preference. Empirical equipoise was proposed as a feasibility diagnostic to determine whether most (&#x02265;&#x02009;50%) patients in a comparative effect estimation study would be near equally likely (between 0.3 and 0.7 of the preference score distribution) to be assigned either treatment, conditional on their clinical history [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. All primary analyses in the PsO/PsA study population failed empirical equipoise at our lower threshold of 35%, which suggests that the multi-drug comparator cohort of [golimumab, certolizumab pegol, guselkumab, risankizumab, tildrakizumab, brodalumab, ixekizumab, secukinumab, or ustekinumab] may not represent suitable exposures for comparison to Remicade<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> in this population. It is possible that patient heterogeneity among the multi-drug comparator population made equipoise difficult to achieve. Of the primary analyses that failed equipoise, two failed the zero events diagnostic (Amb EMR and Clinformatics<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) and one failed EASE (Amb EMR). Given that less than 35% of patients were in equipoise for all databases in this study population, it followed that PS matching failed to achieve covariate balance in the one database (Optum EHR<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) with the largest cohort sizes and most data for LSPS modeling. This finding lends support the use of empirical equipoise as a practical feasibility tool as was its original intent.</p><p id="Par69">In the large IBD study population, we achieved a priori specified <bold>covariate balance</bold> in four of the five databases, although as noted above, covariate balance failure in Clinformatics<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> was based on one covariate which was unlikely to be a confounder because of a 0.007% baseline prevalence target comparator-difference of &#x02018;Requires Bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccination.&#x02019; Although likely inapplicable in this clinical content, this finding illustrates the utility of using LSPS adjustment methods. The classic directed acyclic graph intended to encode confounding is the following: A &#x02192; Y and A &#x02190; <bold>X</bold> &#x02192; Y, where A&#x02009;=&#x02009;exposure status, Y&#x02009;=&#x02009;outcome, and <bold>X</bold> = [vector of confounding covariates]. Typically, investigators will select confounders to balance patients of differing exposure status using expert opinion or a screening algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>], where the former method assumes known confounding structure and covariates and the latter relies on analyzing outcome associations before establishing covariate balance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. An advantage to the LSPS approach is that it assumes no confounding structure, nor does it analyze the outcome in identifying confounders for balancing. Rather, by including all baseline covariates as candidate predictors of exposure status, the LSPS selects and includes highly discriminative covariates into a final parsimonious model and shrinks the coefficients of covariates of low discriminative importance (some to zero, removing them from the final model). A consequence of this approach is that after adjustment with LSPS built with sufficiently large cohorts with rich baseline data, <italic>all</italic> baseline covariates will often be sufficiently balanced, some of which will be confounders. This effectively erases the <bold>X</bold> &#x02192; A edge, which eliminates observed confounding and requires no untestable confounding structure assumptions. In the smaller RA study populations, cohort size and associated baseline covariate data were sufficiently rich to achieve cohort balance in Optum<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> EHR. Although covariate imbalance was substantially reduced after LSPS matching in the RA study population in all databases, the diagnostic criterion only passed in Optum<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> EHR. All comparisons in the AS study population failed covariate balance and four databases in the PsA/PsO study populations failed except for Optum<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> EHR. In many comparisons covariate imbalance was considerably reduced, which is encouraging, but these analyses did not meet our pre-specified diagnostic criteria to which we strictly adhered. Similarly, in the RA study population, only Optum<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> EHR passed the covariate balance diagnostic. It is worth noting that the LSPS is a data intensive predictive algorithm that better balances baseline covariates after training on large, high dimensional input data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. The Optum<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> EHR database, in which the AS and PsA/PsO comparisons passed covariate balance, had the largest study populations of the five databases analyzed.</p><p id="Par70"><bold>EASE</bold> is a metric that summarizes the systematic error component of the empirical null distribution fit from negative control outcome effect estimates intended to identify and correct for unobserved confounding. Comparative analyses for all study populations (IBD, PsA/PsO, AS, and RA) failed the EASE diagnostic in the Amb EMR database. Compared to insurance claims databases, electronic health record databases like Amb EMR generally have less observable patient time and it is more inconsistently captured [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. A consequence of this is that periods of inferred persistent drug exposure are shorter in electronic health records which results in less opportunity to observe outcome events such as negative controls during post exposure TAR periods. As such, we observed relatively few negative control events in the Amb EMR analyses, which resulted in large, statistically unstable EASE values. The lowest EASE value we observed was 0.28 in the IBD analysis from an empirical null distribution computed from 28/86 (33%) observed negative controls. The largest EASE value was 0.98 in the AS study population from an empirical null distribution computed from 4/86 (5%) observed negative controls. This large EASE value was highly influenced by a single large negative control HR. In the IBD, RA, and AS study populations, Remicade<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> increased the risk of negative controls on average, whereas it reduced the risk in the PsA/PsO study population. These findings suggest that the EASE diagnostic and negative controls-based calibration is sensitive to the patient observable time, drug exposure durations, and the frequency of negative control occurrence during exposure TAR.</p><p id="Par71">Causal studies estimating the effect of an exposure on an outcome do not necessarily rely on <bold>representativeness</bold> and in some cases requiring sample representativeness can be counterproductive to establishing the internal validity on which causal assumptions rely [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. However, it may be worth reporting to evidence consumers the extent to which patient attrition from observational study design choices impact the constitution of the target study population. In our study, except for the RA study population analysis in the Pharmetrics database (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> [row 2, column 4]), the patient restrictions from our study design choices did not substantially alter the composition of the Remicade<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> target population.</p><p id="Par72">We strove to reduce outcome misclassification by developing a NIU definition by following a novel phenotyping process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. In this data driven approach, we specified three candidate computable phenotype algorithms to adhere as closely as possible to a complete physiological, clinical description of NIU. Our algorithms adhered to this clinical description to the extent possible given temporal logic constraints and code availability in standardized medical vocabularies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. We then comprehensively characterized the patient cohorts returned by the algorithm in the five databases and mapped the results against the clinical description and determined the extent to which the characteristics reflected the description. Further, we evaluated the candidate definitions by estimating misclassification errors using a probabilistic reference standard, a method designed for flexible and scalable validation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>].

When rigorously and transparently developed and evaluated, a phenotype definition acts as a reliable, consistent input to any observational analysis intended to study that patient population. Further, when defined against a common data model, the definition is transportable and easily implement across databases, facilitating results interpretation across sources. In short, good phenotyping practices create reusable definitions for use as consistent inputs to support standardized, repeatable, and reproducible evidence generation. For example, since development, our NIU definition was included in the OHDSI community &#x02018;How Often&#x02019; initiative (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/ohdsi-studies/HowOften">https://github.com/ohdsi-studies/HowOften</ext-link>), a large-scale incidence rate characterization study intended to systematically generate incidence evidence across a large set of conditions across a global, distributed database network [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec25"><title>Attributes of reliable evidence</title><p id="Par74">Attributes of reliable evidence are that it is repeatable, reproducible, replicable, generalizable, robust, and calibrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>].

Repeatable and reproducible evidence implies a publicly available, fully pre-specified protocol including methodological rationale (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/ohdsi-studies/UveitisSafetyEstimation/tree/master/Documents">https://github.com/ohdsi-studies/UveitisSafetyEstimation/tree/master/Documents</ext-link>) and accessible source code to review the analytic implementation process (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/ohdsi-studies/UveitisSafetyEstimation">https://github.com/ohdsi-studies/UveitisSafetyEstimation</ext-link>). Our study is replicable in that we asked the same research question using identical analytic routines against several similar data sources (e.g., multiple US commercial insurance claims databases) which yielded comparable results. Our confidence in the reliability of this evidence is strengthened further by its generalizability, since we observed consistent results across databases of varying content and intent (e.g., insurance claims and EHRs). We subjected our analysis to several sensitivity analyses where we were uncertain of our design specifications which resulted in consistent results, indicating that our results are robust.

NIU is a known secondary manifestation of underlying autoimmune disease, so disambiguating causal risk attributable to confounding by indication rather than autoimmune disease therapy with Remicade<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> is complex, particularly given that there is also an association between use of certain medications and development of NIU [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. Through the use of observational data sources available and the causal methods employed, we did not observe evidence of an increased NIU risk attributable to Remicade<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> in these analyses.

Etanercept, a TNF&#x003b1; and TNF&#x003b2; inhibitor, is an alternative therapy for PsO/PsA, RA, and AS and has been shown to increases risk of NIU [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].

First, it leveraged data from five large US-based observational health care databases that provided a large, comprehensive sample of commercially insured patients treated with biologics from which we could evaluate an important safety outcome across diverse settings. We used best practices for pharmacoepidemiologic causal estimation by conducting the new user active comparator design [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], using LSPS to adjust for directly and indirectly measured confounders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>], meaningful comparisons based on extensive diagnostics. The integration of negative control outcomes as a diagnostic tool enhances the study&#x02019;s capacity to identify and assess systematic errors within its design. Furthermore, a meticulous clinical characterization of patients with non-infectious uveitis was undertaken, ensuring the validity of the outcome cohort definition, with the added credibility of an ophthalmologist&#x02019;s review. The study also performed thorough characterization of exposure within indication populations.</p><p id="Par79">Despite its strengths, we acknowledge several limitations that warrant consideration. Data quality and clinical event misclassification concerns arise in repurposing administrative data and electronic health record data for clinical research. Data quality was assessed during data standardization to the OMOP CDM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>] and through explicit data quality assessment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>] and deemed sufficient for clinical research purposes. For the key study population and outcome variables we followed rigorous phenotype development and evaluation processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], that have been applied elsewhere in the observational research literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>].</p><p id="Par80">The clinical community and literature in the field acknowledges that disease severity and reasons for treatment switching to biologics are important patient characteristics that may confound these exposure-outcome relationships. These characteristics are poorly recorded or absent from the data we used, but we sought mitigate this limitation by two methods. We employed LSPS methodology which balances all observed and indirectly measured baseline covariates. Also, we employed empirical calibration that measures and calibrates effect estimates for residual bias after other bias mitigation strategies like PS matching were conducted.</p><p id="Par81">Notably, while we quantified outcome misclassification during phenotype development and evaluation, we did not correct effect estimates for this source of bias. Further we did not calculate misclassification errors by exposure status. However, if we assume the high specificity is non-differential to exposure status, this suggests the effect estimate would be minimally biased from outcome misclassification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>]. When outcome specificity depends on exposure status, bias could be considerable, especially in low outcome prevalence settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>].</p><p id="Par82">Also, attrition to the after matching cohort by excluding non-PS matched patients poses a potential threat to external validity, raising concerns about the generalizability of results to Remicade<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>-exposed populations as initially defined, as well as power to detect safety effects. Due to the attrition, we performed characteristic comparisons between the initial and after-matching target cohorts that demonstrated similarity suggesting generalizability, although this finding is supportive of our ATO estimate targeting the ATT. Alternatively, ATT weights would target the ATT without needing to demonstrate representativeness, given that no treated patients are excluded using this method. However, methods evaluation work using average treatment effect (ATE) weights demonstrated poor coverage, increase risk on negative controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>] and imprecise estimates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>] likely because of the presence of extreme weights. Other weighting methods that are less prone to influence of extreme weights, such as fine stratification weights [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>], would be a useful direction for future research.</p><p id="Par83">Additionally, in this study, a condition for causal inference, and in turn for the results from a database to be included in the meta-analysis, was that both target and comparator cohorts each had at least one event observed during their respective TARs. Exploration of novel meta-analysis methods capable of relaxing this constraint is recommended [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>]. For example, a Bayesian random-effects meta-analysis that uses non-normal likelihood approximations can reduce bias and increase precision of the treatment effect in future multi-database studies facing low and zero event counts.</p><p id="Par84">Lastly, our use of LSPS was intended to balance all observed baseline covariates, of which a subset are likely confounders that if imbalanced would lead to biased effect estimates. However, this method requires that many baseline covariates that are not confounders to be similarly balanced given their likely association with unobserved confounders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>].

Three quarters (76%) of the total primary and secondary analyses failed to pass the pre-specified diagnostic thresholds, so we did not review the effect estimates because we could not interpret these results as causally valid. In our primary analyses that passed validity diagnostics, we failed to reject the null hypothesis of no effect and conclude that we observed no strong evidence of an increased risk of NIU among new users of Remicade<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> in the IBD and RA study populations relative to their respective comparator exposure cohorts.
