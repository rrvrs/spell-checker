We have previously demonstrated that this reduced fertility persists for multiple generations in the mouse. However, how altered ovarian function contributes to this infertility is unknown. Therefore, this study sought to determine if DES exposure promotes two common ovarian disorders, primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) and polycystic ovary syndrome, contributing to the reduced fertility in DES offspring. Moreover, we investigated if these impacts are transgenerational. Gestating mice were exposed to 100&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g/kg DES, and ovarian morphology was observed in F1-F3 female descendants. F1 females trended towards fewer primordial and more secondary follicles and similarly, F2 females had fewer primordial and significantly more secondary follicles compared to controls. No differences in follicle proportions were observed in the F3. Moreover, DES exposure did not increase follicular cysts. These results show that DES accelerates folliculogenesis, indicative of a POI phenotype and that this is likely contributing to the reduced fertility observed in DES descendants. Moreover, this study highlights the ability of estrogenic EDCs to disrupt folliculogenesis, which may exacerbate the onset of POI in women already at risk.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Infertility</kwd><kwd>Reproductive disorders</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>This work was funded by a John McKenzie fellowship awarded to Deidre Mattiske from the University of Melbourne.</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer Nature Limited 2024</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Infertility is one of the most pressing issues affecting society today, with 15% of reproductive aged couples experiencing infertility in their lifetime<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. A major contributor to this increasing rate of infertility is our exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs). We are continuously exposed to EDCs in our everyday life as they are present in plastics, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, herbicides, and pesticides. Although exposure to EDCs is harmful during all stages of life, developmental exposure to EDCs poses the greatest threat as EDCs can alter the fetal hormonal environment through disrupting normal hormonal actions, resulting in an increased risk of developing reproductive abnormalities later in life<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">The estrogenic EDC diethylstilbestrol (DES) provides a clear example of the adverse effects early life EDC exposure can have on reproductive development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. DES is pharmaceutical drug that was prescribed to millions of pregnant women world-wide in the hopes to prevent miscarriage and premature labour, however, it resulted in detrimental reproductive effects in the offspring exposed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Specifically, DES daughters have increased rates of reproductive tract tumors and pregnancy complications, including preterm birth, miscarriage, and ectopic pregnancy, as well as increased rates of infertility, at 33% compared to 14% in unexposed women<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Similar abnormalities have been described in the DES mouse model, with prenatal exposure resulting in structural malformations of the oviduct, uterus, cervix and vagina<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. High rates of infertility have also been described in the DES mouse model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. However, despite this increased infertility observed in both DES daughters and animals, few studies have investigated the effect of DES on folliculogenesis and if abnormal ovarian function contributes to this reduced fertility.</p><p id="Par4">Females reproductive capacity relies on correct ovarian function, specifically, folliculogenesis and subsequent ovulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Folliculogenesis is the process by which primordial follicles are recruited from the resting pool and mature until they are either ovulated or die via atresia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. In humans, primordial follicle formation begins by week 20 of gestation and the pool that is formed represents all the follicles that will be accessible to a female over the course of her reproductive life<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. After primordial follicle formation, a subset are selected to grow and mature into primary follicles and continue to progress into antral follicles, while the remaining follicles stay dormant<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. This process is known as initial recruitment and occurs in a continuous manner throughout a females reproductive lifespan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. After the onset of puberty, a subset of antral follicles are rescued from atresia due to an increase in circulating follicle stimulating hormone (FSH). These antral follicles continue to develop and mature, with one follicle becoming dominant and producing high levels of estrogen and inhibins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. This increase in estrogen exerts a negative feedback loop and suppresses FSH secretion such that the remaining growing antral follicles are deprived of adequate FSH stimulation required for survival and die via atresia. Due to the increase in estrogen, luteinising hormone is released and ovulation of the dominant follicle is triggered<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. This process is known as cyclic recruitment and occurs every month until the follicle pool is depleted, leading to reproductive senescence. Therefore exposure to EDCs, like DES, could impact initial and cyclic recruitment, leading to altered folliculogenesis and subsequent infertility.</p><p id="Par5">Two common ovarian disorders that impact folliculogenesis and can contribute to infertility are primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). POI affects 1% of reproductive aged women and disrupts ovarian function such that menopause is reached before the age of 40<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. This early decline in ovarian function can be due to an exhaustion of the primordial follicle pool, increased activation of primordial follicles, increased follicle atresia or disrupted ovulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. The aetiology of POI is largely unknown, with genetic causes being responsible for only 10.8% of POI cases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Environmental factors are able to contribute to POI, with exposure to EDCs significantly impacting the ovarian reserve and increasing the risk of developing POI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Female mice exposed neonatally to 20&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g/kg of DEHP, an EDC with both estrogenic and anti-androgenic properties, have significantly fewer primordial follicles and significantly more pre-antral follicles, indicating accelerated folliculogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Furthermore, prenatal exposure to a mixture of phthalates significantly reduces the number of secondary follicles and significantly increases the number of atretic follicles in PND 21 and 9 month old female mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Human studies have demonstrated the impacts of the estrogenic EDC BPA on folliculogenesis, with high levels of urinary BPA being associated with decreased antral follicle counts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">PCOS is one of the most common reproductive diseases in women, affecting approximately 5&#x02013;15% of the female population<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Symptoms of PCOS include increased androgen levels, abnormal ovulation and cystic ovaries. Long term impacts of PCOS include infertility, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Currently the aetiology of PCOS involves both genetic and environmental factors, with exposure to EDCs playing a role in disease prevalence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Notably, women with PCOS have significantly higher levels of BPA in their blood compared to women without PCOS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Moreover, rats exposed developmentally to a mixture of EDCs results in an increased number of cystic ovaries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par7">EDCs impact many aspects of ovarian development, however, of greatest concern is their ability cause long-lasting, transgenerational effects on the ovary. Transgenerational effects refer to inherited disorders that are observed in individuals that have not been directly exposed. When a gestating female is exposed to an EDC, herself, the F1 fetus and the germ cells that will produce the F2 generation are all directly exposed. Therefore, any effects seen in these generations are known as multigenerational and are due to a direct exposure. The F3 generation however, is the first generation that hasn&#x02019;t had any exposure to the EDC and effects observed in the F3 and beyond are known as transgenerational. Transgenerational inheritance of ovarian disease has been described in animal models after exposure to several EDCs. Neonatal exposure to DEHP significantly decreases the number of primordial follicles in F1, F2 and F3 female mice whilst prenatal exposure to both a mixture of EDCs and methoxychlor increases the rate of cystic ovaries in F3 female rats<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. We have previously shown that exposure to DES has transgenerational effects on fertility, timing of puberty and the anogenital distance (AGD) in female DES descendants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. However, the transgenerational effect of DES on the ovary has yet to be investigated.</p><p id="Par8">Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine if DES exposure alters folliculogenesis and whether this can contribute to the reduced fertility observed in the DES mouse model. Additionally, it sought to assess whether DES exposure has a transgenerational effect on the ovary. The transgenerational effects caused by EDCs is particularly alarming for the more than 50&#x000a0;million DES descendants, as they may have a higher risk of experiencing infertility and other reproductive abnormalities due to their ancestral exposure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Moreover, the results gathered from this study can be used as a model for other estrogenic EDCs that are pervasive in our environment and deepen our understanding of the transgenerational effects EDCs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Young cohort</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>DES does not impact female body weight and AGD during puberty</title><p id="Par9">Previous animal studies have demonstrated an increase in body weight after exposure to EDCs due to their ability to impair metabolic function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>.

One way in which EDCs can contribute to female infertility is through altering ovarian development and function. We have previously shown that exposing gestating mice to a dose of 100&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g/kg of DES reduces females fertility in a multigenerational manner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.

Furthermore, we investigated if DES exposure has a transgenerational effect on these phenotypes. We found that DES does not impact the number of follicular cysts, however, it does impact folliculogenesis in F1 and F2 females. These results indicate that a direct exposure to 100&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g/kg of DES can contribute to the onset of POI which in turn may contribute to the reduced fertility observed after prenatal DES exposure.</p><p id="Par26">EDCs are able to interfere with hormones involved in metabolism and promote weight gain and obesity with prenatal exposure to DES, and other EDCs, increasing body weight in adult female mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. However, our study found that <italic>in utero&#x000a0;</italic>exposure to DES does not have an effect on body weight in PND 21 females but the median body weight is increased in 12 month old F1 and F2 DES females. We have previously shown that median body weight is increased in 5 month old females after exposure to 100&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g/kg of DES, and that this increase is greater in F1 and F2 females compared to F3 females<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Therefore, a direct exposure to DES promotes a small increase in body weight once a female is sexually mature, not only in F1 females that are exposed as a fetus, but also in F2 females that are only exposed as a germ cell, but this effect is not inherited transgenerationally.</p><p id="Par27">It is surprising that DES exposure did not impact the AGD in the young cohort but did significantly reduce the AGD in all three generations in the aged cohort. We have previously shown that 100&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g/kg of DES significantly reduces the AGD in F1, F2 and F3 females at 5 months of age<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. The AGD is a key marker for reproductive toxicity, with the development of the AGD being highly sensitive to the fetal hormonal environment. As we have seen a significant reduction in the AGD in post-pubertal but not pre-pubertal females, this suggests that DES exposure is likely having a greater impact on the maturation rather than on the early patterning and differentiation of the AGD. Sexual maturation and the development of the female external genitalia continues postnatally and is programmed by hormonal exposures during fetal development. Furthermore, the transgenerational impact seen on the AGD, but not folliculogenesis, indicates that DES is disrupting hormonal signalling pathways specific to AGD development in a transgenerational manner.</p><p id="Par28">To determine if altered folliculogenesis can contribute to the reduced fertility observed in DES descendants, we quantified the proportion of follicle types in PND 21 females. DES exposure significantly increased the proportion of secondary follicles in F2 females, and although not significant, the median proportion of primordial follicles was reduced compared to the control cohort. This reduction in primordial follicles and increase in secondary follicles suggests follicle recruitment is accelerated in the F2 DES generation leading to early exhaustion of the resting follicle pool. The F1 generation displayed a similar acceleration of folliculogenesis, although not statistically significant, with a trend towards fewer primordial and more secondary follicles being observed. Interestingly, this trend was not observed in the F3 generation in our study, indicating that this effect is not transgenerational at a dose of 100&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g/kg of DES and only occurs in individuals that are exposed either during embryogenesis or during initial primordial germ cell development.</p><p id="Par29">A similar acceleration of folliculogenesis is observed in F1 mice after prenatal exposure to a single injection of DES on gestation day 15, with later stage follicles being observed 24&#x000a0;h earlier in treatment animals compared to controls<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. In contrast, McLachlan et al. found no significant difference in follicle proportions in PND 60 mice after prenatal exposure to doses of DES ranging from 0.01 to 100&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g/kg<sup>7</sup>. However, primordial and primary follicles were classified as one follicle type in this study and therefore, if the now standardised classification of follicle types was applied, effects may be observed. Interestingly, both rats and lambs treated neonatally with either DES or BPA have significantly fewer primordial and significantly more primary follicles compared to control ovaries, similar to the effects observed in our study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. In contrast, mice neonatally exposed to 3&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g of DES on PND 0 and PND 1 results in significantly more primordial follicles and significantly fewer primary follicles by PND 5, suggesting that neonatal DES exposure delays follicle recruitment in the mouse<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. However, despite these differences, all these studies highlight that exposure to estrogenic EDCs, like DES, disrupt the regulation of early follicle transition and impact initial follicle recruitment, leading to altered folliculogenesis. Altered folliculogenesis is a mechanism that contributes to POI and early reproductive senescence, and therefore this observed phenotype could contribute to reduced fertility in DES descendants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Alarmingly, we have shown that this altered folliculogenesis persists into the F2 generation. These results highlight the long-lasting impacts of EDCs and the importance in understanding the impact ancestral EDC exposure can have on females reproductive health.</p><p id="Par30">Although no previous studies have investigated the multi- or trans-generational effect of DES on folliculogenesis, research has been conducted on the EDC DEHP. Pocar et al. investigated the effect of 0.05 and 5&#x000a0;mg/kg of DEHP exposure on follicle proportions in F1-F3 PND 42 female mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. DEHP significantly reduced the number of primordial follicles and significantly increased the number of pre-antral follicles (primary and secondary follicles) in F1-F3 generations at both doses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. Similarly, prenatal exposure to 40&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g/kg of DEHP significantly reduces the percentage of primordial follicles and significantly increases the percentage of secondary follicles in both F1 and F2 females<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. These studies align with the results presented here and together, demonstrate that developmental EDC exposure disrupts folliculogenesis and, importantly, these effects persist across generations.</p><p id="Par31">Although the changes in folliculogenesis observed in our study are small, these results reflect the reproductive changes that are observed in human populations. Increases in the rates of fertility and sub-fertility have coincided with increased rates of reproductive disorders such as POI. Accelerated folliculogenesis appears to be an important factor contributing to reduced fertility in DES descendants, especially when coupled with other reproductive issues. Although DES is no longer in use in pregnancy, it is a valuable model for other estrogenic EDCs present in our environment and provides insight into the effects estrogenic EDCs can have on the development of disorders such as POI. POI is a multifactorial disease, with genetic, metabolic and environmental factors all playing a role in its onset. The prevalence of POI has gradually increased, yet the cause of POI onset remains unknown for the majority of patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. Exposure to estrogenic EDCs may be a likely contributor to this increasing incidence, with EDC exposure exacerbating the onset of POI in women who are already at risk due to their genetic makeup. Therefore, there is a need for improved diagnosis and earlier detection of patients at risk of POI. Informing clinicians and patients about contributing factors such as exposure to EDCs will improve management and treatment of women with POI.</p><p id="Par32">One mechanism that can lead to POI is increased follicle atresia. GCs are the largest population of cells in the follicle and are essential for maintaining the health of the oocyte. Any alterations to GCs, such as disrupted proliferation or development, can directly impact the oocyte, with apoptosis of the GCs leading to follicle atresia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. Cell culture studies have shown that treating GCs with BPA significantly decreases GC viability and increases GC apoptosis at a dose as low as 100 pM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. Our study found that F1 females had a higher percentage of Casp3 positive follicles than control females, although this increase was not significant. Moreover, although not significant, a slight increase in GC proliferation was observed at each generation. Similarly, a slight increase in both GC proliferation and follicle atresia, as determined by Ki27 and p27 markers respectively, is observed in lambs treated neonatally with either DES or BPA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. These subtle alterations to the GCs may contribute to altered folliculogenesis and therefore contribute to a POI phenotype. Furthermore, FOXL2 was used a marker for GC morphology in the current study as it is required to maintain a GC phenotype and mutations in <italic>Foxl2&#x000a0;</italic>have been associated with POI in mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. However, DES exposure had no effect on FOXL2, with no qualitative differences observed between DES descendants and the control. Theca cells are another important lineage of somatic cells found in the ovarian follicle that are fundamental for steroidogenesis and follicular growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. Theca cells are responsible for producing androgens, which are ultimately converted to estrogens by the GCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. DES exposure may be able to disrupt theca development and in turn impact folliculogenesis. COUP-TFII is highly expressed in theca cells and was used as a marker for theca cell steroidogenesis in the current study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. However, no changes to COUP-TFII were observed after DES exposure. In rats, DES exposure alters both androgen production from the theca cells and estrogen production from the GCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>.Therefore, although no morphological differences in granulosa and theca cells were observed in our study, further studies would be required to isolate follicles following DES exposure and determine the individual hormonal production in granulosa and theca cells.</p><p id="Par33">PCOS is one of the most common female reproductive disorders and is thus a major cause of female infertility. PCOS has been associated with EDC exposure in both humans and mice with prenatal exposure to a mixture of plastics significantly increasing the number of follicular cysts in F1 and F3 female mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Moreover, Brehm et al. also demonstrated that prenatal exposure to 750&#x000a0;mg/kg of DEHP significantly increases the number of ovarian cysts in mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. In contrast, our study found that DES exposure did not increase the proportion of cystic follicles in any generation. While this suggests different modes of action of these EDCs, differences in the effects of these EDCs may also be due to the lower dose of DES used in our study. In order for PCOS to be diagnosed in females, two of the following three symptoms need to be observed; irregular ovulation, increased androgen levels and ovarian cysts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. As we only analysed the presence of follicular cysts in our study, future studies should assess androgen levels and ovulation patterns to further discern if DES has the potential to induce a PCOS phenotype and contribute to reduced fertility.</p><p id="Par34">This is the first study that has investigated the transgenerational effect of DES on folliculogenesis. We have shown that a direct exposure to DES, either as a fetus or germ cells, accelerates follicle recruitment, a mechanism that can contribute to POI. This accelerated folliculogenesis can contribute to the reduced fertility observed in F1 and F2 DES females. However, altered folliculogenesis was not observed in F3 females, suggesting that DES does not impact ovarian function transgenerationally. Furthermore, DES did not increase the number of follicular cysts, suggesting that PCOS was not a contributing factor to reduced fertility in DES descendants. These results highlight the ability of estrogenic EDCs to disrupt normal ovarian function and contribute to the onset of POI and subsequent infertility.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec12"><title>Animals and treatments</title><p id="Par35">C57BL/6 mice were raised in the animal facility at BioSciences 4 at the University of Melbourne under a 13&#x000a0;h light/11hr dark cycle at 22&#x02013;23<sup>o</sup>C and fed a standard diet and tap water ad libitum.
