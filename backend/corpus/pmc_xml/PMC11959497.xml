She is receiving hormone therapy for breast cancer. No relatives have been treated for colorectal cancer and colorectal polyps. In 2022, an endoscopy of the lower gastrointestinal tract was performed by a local doctor for physical examination, and a 15&#x02010;mm&#x02010;sized SSL was found in the hepatic fold, and endoscopic submucosal dissection was performed at another hospital in March 2023. Serrated polyps were noted in two lesions, including the aforementioned and this case, and do not fit the 2019 WHO criteria for serrated polyposis syndrome diagnosis. Subsequently, a lower gastrointestinal endoscopy was performed in February 2024 for follow&#x02010;up, and a 35&#x02010;mm&#x02010;sized honeycomb&#x02010;like inverted SSL was observed in the ascending colon (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="deo270106-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The color was slightly faded in white light and some vasodilatation was observed. There were no surrounding diverticula, and multiple honeycomb&#x02010;like depressions were observed inside the lesion. The border between the lesion and the normal mucosa was indistinct under white light but became more distinct when indigocarmine was sprayed on the lesion, and a large amount of mucus adhesion was also observed. Narrow&#x02010;band imaging (NBI) magnification showed that the vessel pattern was generally invisible in the flat area, and the surface pattern was similar to the surrounding normal mucosa. On the other hand, the vessel pattern in Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="deo270106-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2a</xref> showed dilated vessels with regular caliber and regular distribution. Based on the above, we diagnosed the patient as having mainly Japan NBI Expert Team (JNET) Type 1 and partly 2A. In Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="deo270106-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>, the depressed area, the vessel pattern was invisible and the surface pattern appeared to have a more dilated crypt, although it could not be observed in detail due to mucus adhesion. Crystal violet scattering showed that the pit pattern was open type II, which was suspicious for serrated lesions. The inside of the depression was difficult to evaluate due to the high mucus content and poor staining. The possibility of dysplasia could not be ruled out due to the presence of areas containing JNET 2A and insufficient observation of the interior of the depression by crystal violet staining, and the patient was referred to our hospital for endoscopic treatment because of the poor operability of the endoscope and the possibility of emergency surgery in the event of perforation during endoscopic treatment.</p><fig position="float" fig-type="FIGURE" id="deo270106-fig-0001"><label>FIGURE 1</label><caption><p>Close endoscopic examination of a honeycomb&#x02010;like inverted sessile serrated lesion.

The resected lesion was divided into 12 sections. Both flat areas and depressed areas show horizontal growth along the muscularis mucosae, serrations extending into the crypt base, and asymmetrical proliferation, which was the basis for the diagnosis of SSL in WHO Classification 2019. In addition, the area diagnosed as JNET Type 2A on NBI magnification prior to endoscopic treatment (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="deo270106-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>) showed lymphatic follicles and no obvious dysplasia. The same was true in the other sections, and the diagnosis of SSL with inverted growth was made. On the other hand, the depressed area showed more pronounced dilation of the crypt base than the flat area. In addition, the crypts in the depressed area had more goblet cells and more mucus production, and the space between the crypts was narrower with the dilation of the crypt base. Desmin staining revealed that the muscularis mucosae layer was thin and partially destroyed (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="deo270106-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). Additional immunostaining for MUC2, MUC5AC, MUC6, and CD10 was performed (Figure <xref rid="deo270106-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). The results were positive for MUC2, partially positive for MUC5AC, and negative for MUC6 and CD10; MUC2 positivity indicates a colonic mucosal origin; MUC5AC is a marker found in the gastric mucosa, but has been reported to be positive in many cases of SSL.<xref rid="deo270106-bib-0005" ref-type="bibr">

</xref> MUC5AC shows staining from the crypt opening to the middle of the depression, with less staining at the crypt base. This indicates that goblet cells are broken at the crypt base, but remain at the opening, indicating that the cytoplasm is preserved.<xref rid="deo270106-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">&#x000a0;</xref>

Inverted SSL can be further divided into two pathological patterns: expansive growth type (EGT) and infiltrating growth type.<xref rid="deo270106-bib-0008" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>8</sup>
</xref> EGT is a type of infiltration that pushes down the muscularis mucosae, while infiltrating growth type slips through the gaps between the muscularis mucosae and enters the submucosa and lymph follicles. The only inverted SSL that showed endoscopic depression was EGT.</p><p>The frequency of inverted SSL varied considerably, ranging from 1.1% in Lee et&#x000a0;al.<xref rid="deo270106-bib-0006" ref-type="bibr">

</xref> Takashima et al report was limited to EGT, the frequency was 12.5%. The frequency of EGT is considered to range from 1.1% to 12.5%, but the difference is still wide, future studies are needed to determine regional differences.</p><p>The morphology of the depression has rarely been reported, but most of them show a large depression in the center of the lesion,<xref rid="deo270106-bib-0004" ref-type="bibr">

</xref> and there have been no reports of multiple depressions of different sizes. Therefore, we defined &#x0201c;honeycomb&#x02010;like inverted SSL&#x0201d; as a form of inverted SSL in which four or more small or large depressions are observed on endoscopy at this hospital. It will be necessary to compile patient background data for inverted SSLs that fit this definition in the future.</p><p>As for the cause of SSL depression, it has been reported that crypt shape may be involved.<xref rid="deo270106-bib-0009" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>9</sup>
</xref> The crypts in the depression of the inverted SSL remain largely the same at the opening, but the base is considerably dilated and frustoconical shape. The arrangement of the frustoconical crypts is thought to push the muscularis mucosae convexly downward. Furthermore, columnar crypts that do not have a wide base are not depressed when aligned, but are flat.</p><p>The reason why the crypt base is dilated may be related to the amount of goblet cells. Crypts in the depressed area have many goblet cells, and in some crypt bases, goblet cells are broken and released as mucus. The mucus is laterally compressed to form inverted T&#x02010;shaped and/or L&#x02010;shaped crypts and is also compressed downward pushing down the muscularis mucosae. Although mucus is draining upward, the multiple goblet cells near the crypt opening are relatively preserved and are not as dilated as at the base. In other words, we consider that the crypt base is dilated because more mucus is expelled from the base, but there is resistance in the upward direction.</p><p>It is necessary to distinguish it from a colonic diverticulum as a differential disease, it is important to observe the presence of mucus adhesion and the interior of the depression before treatment. Although there is no clear report on the carcinogenicity of inverted SSL, it is suggested that malignant transformation of inverted SSL may immediately lead to invasive carcinoma because the muscularis mucosae are pushed downward,<xref rid="deo270106-bib-0010" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>10</sup>
</xref> and it is important to distinguish between SSLDs. Honeycomb&#x02010;like inverted SSLs such as the one in this case are likely to be large lesions, measuring approximately 30&#x000a0;mm, and may require treatment with endoscopic submucosal dissection.</p><p>This is the first report of a special morphology called &#x0201c;honeycomb&#x02010;like inverted SSL&#x0201d; in the world. The reason for this special morphology is unknown but thought to be related to the fact that the crypts in the depressed area were frustoconical shaped with many goblet cells, while the crypts in the flat area were conically shaped with few goblet cells. Since this is a single case study, it is necessary to compare the amount of goblet cells and crypt shape between flat and concave areas if other honeycomb&#x02010;like inverted SSLs are found.</p></sec><sec sec-type="COI-statement" id="deo270106-sec-0040"><title>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT</title><p>None.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="deo270106-bibl-0001"><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="deo270106-bib-0001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book" id="deo270106-cite-0001">
