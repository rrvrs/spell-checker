<bold>Dear Editor,</bold>
</p><p>Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is an emerging tick-borne infectious disease caused by Dabie bandavirus, also known as SFTS virus (SFTSV), a novel <italic toggle="yes">phlebovirus</italic> in the family <italic toggle="yes">Phenuiviridae</italic> of the order <italic toggle="yes">Bunyavirales.</italic> The disease was first identified in China and subsequently reported in South Korea and Japan, leading to a high fatality rate of 12%&#x02013;50% (<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">Yu et al., 2011</xref>). The disease causes a wide clinical spectrum, ranging from mild febrile disease accompanied by thrombocytopenia and/or leukocytopenia, to hemorrhagic fever, clinical encephalitis, multiple organ failure (MODS), sepsis, and disseminated intravascular coagulation, and even death (<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2014</xref>). Despite the high case fatality, vaccines, or specific antivirals for SFTSV are currently not available. A recent study has demonstrated a clinical benefit of favipiravir in reducing viral loads and increasing survival rates in human patients, which, however, are effective only when administered at early disease and to a portion of patients (<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2021</xref>). There is an urgent requirement for the development of effective anti-SFTSV drugs and therapeutic strategies may be perceived as critical.</p><p>Lipoxygenases (LOXs) are enzymes that oxidize polyunsaturated fatty acids, leading to lipid peroxidation. LOXs are found in various organisms, including humans, animals, plants, fungi, and bacteria (<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">Chrisnasari et al., 2022</xref>). In humans, there are six known isoforms of LOX: 15-LOX, 15-LOX-2, 12-LOX, 12R-LOX, eLOX-3, and 5-LOX (<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">Mashima and Okuyama, 2015</xref>). LOXs and their metabolites play important roles as signaling molecules involved in biological processes such as cell proliferation and carcinogenesis, inflammation, and metabolic disorders (<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">Kuhn et al., 2015</xref>). Recent studies have demonstrated the association between lipoxygenase and viral infection. For instance, the enzyme responsible for producing lipid mediator protectin D1 (PD1), which attenuates influenza virus replication through RNA export machinery is identified as 12/15-LOX (<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">Morita et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, Daidzein activates anti-influenza activity by suppressing intracellular replication of influenza virus via mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) /extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway by activating 5-LOX (<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">Horio et al., 2023</xref>). In addition to this, lipid-protein assemblies like biomembranes can be modified structurally or functionally by oxidation from LOXs (<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">Kuhn et al., 2015</xref>). A previous report has reported that iron oxide nanozyme disrupts the viral envelope and diminishes H1N1 virus infection through triggering lipid peroxidation (<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">Qin et al., 2019</xref>). However, it remains unknown whether LOX oxidizes viral envelopes to prevent viral infection. Here, we demonstrated that soybean LOX, which shares both amino acid sequence similarity and biochemical properties with human 15-LOX enzymes (<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">Prigge et al., 1996</xref>), effectively inhibits the entire infection process of SFTSV <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic>.</p><p>To determine the potential antiviral function of LOX, we initially assessed its cytotoxicity on Huh 7 cells. The results showed that concentrations of LOX ranging from 0 to 8 mg/mL had no detrimental effect on cell survival (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). Subsequently, we evaluated the antiviral effect of LOX on SFTSV in Huh7 cells by examining intracellular and supernatant SFTSV vRNA at 24 hpi. Our findings demonstrated a dose-dependent inhibitory effect of LOX treatment on the entire infection process of SFTSV (entire stage, 2 h pre-infection to 24 hpi) (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B&#x02013;D</xref>). Similar inhibitory effects were observed in terms of viral nucleoprotein production under LOX treatment as confirmed by Western blot assay and immunofluorescence assay (IFA) (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref> and <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1F</xref>). Furthermore, we validated the inhibitory activity of LOX on SFTSV infection in THP-1 cells and HUVECs, which are susceptible to SFTSV infection (<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">Sun et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2023</xref>). Consistent with the result obtained from Huh7 cells, dose-dependent anti-SFTSV effects were observed for LOX treatment (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S1</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>

As shown in <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S2B</xref>, both intracellular and supernatant vRNA levels were reduced. In addition, western blot assay revealed a decrease in the expression level of SFTSV nucleoprotein when the virus was pre-incubated with LOX before adding it to the cell culture medium (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S2C</xref>). Subsequently, time-of-addition analysis was conducted to identify specific stages during SFTSV replication that were inhibited by LOX. We added LOX during both the entry process (0&#x02013;2 hpi) and post-entry process (2&#x02013;24 hpi), followed by harvesting infected cells at 24 hpi (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S2A</xref>). The levels of intracellular and supernatant vRNA were quantified using RT-qPCR. A corresponding inhibitory effect was observed at both the virus entry and post-entry phases, with intracellular vRNA levels being reduced significantly (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S2D</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">G</xref>). Consistently, treatment with LOX also resulted in a decrease in viral nucleoprotein present in cells during both phases (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S2H</xref> and <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2I</xref>) These results collectively suggest that besides destabilizing virus particles, LOX also interferes with virus entry as well as subsequent stages after entry; effectively inhibiting SFTSV infection.</p><p>To validate the virucidal effect of LOX on SFTSV virions, we used immunofluorescence analysis to observe the infectivity of SFTSV pre-incubated with LOX in Huh 7 cells. Immunofluorescence assay demonstrated a significant dose-dependent suppression of SFTSV infectivity by LOX (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). LOX, acting as a lipid-peroxidizing enzyme, can modify the structure and function of complex ester lipid or lipid-protein assemblies (<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">Kuhn et al., 2015</xref>). To test whether LOX alters the stability of virions by oxidizing the virus lipid envelope, we initially measured maleic dialdehyde (MDA), a biomarker for lipid peroxidation, produced through incubating LOX with SFTSV. As shown in <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>, both increasing concentration of LOX and culture duration of purified SFTSV correlated positively with a gradual increase in MDA. Furthermore, pretreatment with LOX revealed substantial damage to the viral lipid envelope, altering its morphology (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). The Gn and Gc glycoproteins (GP) form heterodimers on the SFTSV envelope to facilitate virus-cell binding. Western blot assay indicated that GP was degraded when exposed to LOX, while NP protein remained unaffected (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). These observations suggest that treatment with LOX may disrupt the integrity of the viral membrane of SFTSV, potentially compromising its ability to efficiently enter host cells.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>

(J) The H&#x00026;E assays and immunohistochemistry staining revealed pathological lesions in the liver, lung, and spleen sections collected at 5 dpi from mice treated with SFTSV pre-incubated with LOX or vehicle.

Next, the internalization assay showed that no difference in intracellular vRNA between LOX-treated and vehicle-treated samples (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S3B</xref>). These results indicate that LOX affects the binding of SFTSV to cellular receptors rather than SFTSV internalization. Furthermore, when pre-incubated with other enveloped virus, including H1N1 influenza virus (family <italic toggle="yes">Orthomyxoviridae</italic>), vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV, family <italic toggle="yes">Rhabdoviridae</italic>), and herpes simplex virus encephalitis HSV-1 (family <italic toggle="yes">Herpesviridae</italic>), LOX significantly reduced viral infection (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S4</xref>). Conversely, enterovirus 71, EV71 (family <italic toggle="yes">Picornaviridae</italic>), which lacks envelope structure, maintained effective infection in Huh 7 cells under conditions where it was pre-incubated with LOX (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S4</xref>). These findings suggest that LOX may possess broad-spectrum anti-viral activity against enveloped viruses.</p><p>The virucidal effect of LOX was further evaluated in a lethal mouse model, where six-week-old C57BL/6J mice were pretreated with anti-IFNAR1-blocking antibodies to assess the pathogenicity of SFTSV (<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2019</xref>). Compared to mice infected with intact SFTSV, fatality rate, and viral loads in serum, spleen, lung, and liver tissues from mice infected with LOX pre-incubated SFTSV were significantly lower (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E&#x02013;I</xref>). Moreover, hematoxylin and eosin (H&#x00026;E) staining revealed that ballooning degeneration induced by SFTSV in hepatocytes was attenuated in mice infected with LOX pre-incubated virus. Severe pneumonia characterized by inflammatory cellular infiltration along with alveolar wall edema and thickening was observed in lung tissues; an increased number of megakaryocytes present in spleen tissues from mice infected with intact SFTSV also occurred. In comparison, histopathological damage was ameliorated in the group exposed to LOX pre-incubated SFTSV (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2J</xref>). Similar results were also observed through immunohistochemical staining for SFTSV antigen expression in the spleen (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2J</xref>); although viral antigen expression was still detected, the number of cell foci decreased among mice infected with LOX pre-incubated SFTSV. These findings provide evidence that LOX could suppress the replication and spread of viruses by effectively deactivating them.</p><p>The therapeutic efficacy of LOX on SFTSV infection was further evaluated. The mice were divided into two groups and received either a vehicle (PBS) or a 100 mg/kg/day dose of LOX. Compared to the vehicle-treated group, LOX treatment resulted in reduced fatality rate and decreased viral loads in serum and tissue samples including spleen, lung, and liver (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S5</xref>). Collectively, these results indicate that LOX effectively mitigates lethality in mice while enhancing their resistance to infection.</p><p>In our study, we identified LOX as a potent inhibitor of SFTSV infection <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic>. LOX functions by catalyzing lipid peroxidation of the viral lipid envelope and thus destabilize SFTSV virions <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic>. Furthermore, pre-incubation with LOX resulted in reduced mortality and alleviated tissue lesions in a mouse model infected with SFTSV. Interestingly, treatment with LOX also decreased SFTSV infection and increased survival rate in mice. It is worth noting that LOXs possess the capacity to oxygenate polyenoic fatty acids, and the incorporation of a hydrophilic peroxide group into the hydrophobic tail of a fatty acid alters the physico-chemical properties of the ester lipids, thereby impairing membrane function (<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">Kuhn et al., 2015</xref>). The viral envelope membrane primarily originates from the host cell membrane (phospholipid layer and membrane proteins) and contains some viral glycoproteins. <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">Qin et al., (2019)</xref> demonstrated that IONzymes catalyze lipid peroxidation in the viral lipid envelope, compromising the integrity of the neighboring proteins. Our findings indicate that LOX also exhibits the potential to disrupt the envelope structure of SFTSV, consequently hindering virus-cell binding and reducing viral adsorption onto host cells. The glycoprotein (GP), cleaved into Gn and Gc, plays a crucial role in mediating SFTSV infection within host cells (<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">Yuan et al., 2021</xref>). Our Western blot analysis confirmed GP degradation while leaving nucleoprotein unaffected due to LOX-induced lipid peroxidation damaging GP or causing structural changes through envelope disintegration. Importantly, we have demonstrated a broad-spectrum virucidal efficacy of LOX against enveloped viruses <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> which holds potential as a broad-spectrum antiviral agent for other enveloped viral diseases. Further investigation is warranted to elucidate the intricate mechanisms underlying LOX&#x02019;s inhibitory effects on SFTSV. In summary, we have demonstrated that LOX exerts a virucidal effect against SFTSV, through the peroxidation of the viral lipid envelope. As a result, LOX poses as a promising therapeutic and preventive candidate for SFTSV and potentially other enveloped viruses.</p><sec id="s1" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary data</title><p>Supplementary data is available at <italic toggle="yes">Protein &#x00026; Cell</italic> online at <ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1093/procel/pwae061" ext-link-type="uri">https://doi.org/10.1093/procel/pwae061</ext-link>.</p><supplementary-material id="sup1" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>pwae061_suppl_Supplementary_Figures_S1-S5</label><media xlink:href="pwae061_suppl_supplementary_figures_s1-s5.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><sec id="s2"><title>Footnotes</title><p>The authors would like to thank Prof. Wen-hai Feng from China Agricultural University for kindly providing HSV-1 and VSV.
