This study investigated the effect of temperature on the solubilization of cassava peel during hydrothermal treatment to determine the emulsifying ability of solubilized cassava peel (SCP). Subcritical water conditions were employed via hydrothermal (120&#x02013;200 &#x000b0;C; 2 MPa) or autoclave (127 &#x000b0;C; 0.2 MPa) treatments to solubilize cassava peels. The composition of the SCPs was determined, and their emulsifying ability was assessed using interfacial tension and zeta potential measurements. Under the best treatment conditions (140 &#x000b0;C at 2 MPa [hydrothermal]; 127 &#x000b0;C at 0.2 MPa [autoclave]), SCPs reduced interfacial tension against soybean oil to 12.9 mN/m and 13.4 mN/m, respectively. A strengthened co-emulsifier system was developed by incorporating SCPs with <italic toggle="yes">Quillaja</italic> saponins (QS) or Tween 20 to enhance the performance. Dynamic interfacial tension and zeta potential measurements revealed synergistic interactions, showing a remarkable reduction in interfacial tension from 12.94 to 5.33 mN/m. This suggests that the SCP has a surfactant-like structure owing to its amphiphilic structure and hydrophobic chains (nonpolar region) attached to the -OH functional group (polar region). Combining a second surface-active compound or co-emulsifier results in an additive effect, reducing the interfacial tension. These findings provide novel insights into carbohydrate-saponin binding and elucidate the impact of peel composition, concentration, and hydrothermal treatment conditions on co-emulsifier system performance, which will assist in the development of emulsifiers, contributing to the advancement of clean-label food technologies, effectively replacing synthetic emulsifiers in food formulations, and offering both sustainability and functionality. A systematic investigation of processing conditions and co-emulsifier interactions provides a practical framework for developing high-performance natural emulsifiers from agricultural waste.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>cassava peel</kwd><kwd>subcritical water</kwd><kwd>extraction</kwd><kwd>emulsifier</kwd><kwd>co-emulsifier</kwd><kwd>interfacial tension</kwd><kwd>sustainable food technology</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>This study received no external funding.</funding-statement></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-polymers-17-00496"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Food wastes, including agricultural by-products, present a significant global challenge with economic, environmental, and social implications. In 2023, the United States alone generated 60.3 billion kg of food waste, whereas Japan discards approximately 18 billion kg annually, equivalent to 40% of its national food production [<xref rid="B1-polymers-17-00496" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-polymers-17-00496" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Developed countries produce more food waste than developing nations [<xref rid="B3-polymers-17-00496" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-polymers-17-00496" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Among the various types of food waste, cassava processing generates substantial amounts of peel, often discarded and underutilized. Cassava (<italic toggle="yes">Manihot esculenta</italic> Crantz) is a staple crop in several tropical and subtropical regions. Global cassava production reached 30.3 billion kg in 2020, with Nigeria being the largest producer [<xref rid="B5-polymers-17-00496" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Cassava peel, which constitutes approximately 15&#x02013;20% of the root weight, is rich in starch (50&#x02013;70% dry weight) and dietary fiber (10&#x02013;30% dry weight) and is a potentially valuable resource [<xref rid="B6-polymers-17-00496" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-polymers-17-00496" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. However, these peels are often considered waste contributing to environmental pollution when not properly managed [<xref rid="B8-polymers-17-00496" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>The increasing focus on sustainable polymer science has led to extensive research on modifying and functionalizing natural polysaccharides obtained from agricultural byproducts. Cassava peels, rich in starch and cellulose polymers, are an abundant source of natural polysaccharides that can be modified for various applications through controlled depolymerization. The transformation of complex polysaccharides into functional materials addresses the growing need for sustainable polymer-based solutions. Hydrothermal treatment (HTS) is a process that uses hot water as the primary solvent, which eliminates the need for organic solvents and reduces environmental impact [<xref rid="B9-polymers-17-00496" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. They can also be used to process wet biomass, reduce energy requirements for feedstock drying [<xref rid="B10-polymers-17-00496" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], and recover valuable compounds in the liquid phase, including nutrients and bioactive substances [<xref rid="B11-polymers-17-00496" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. HTS uses water under subcritical conditions (120&#x02013;370 &#x000b0;C at 0.2&#x02013;25 MPa) as a solvent and a reactant, exploiting water&#x02019;s unique properties under these conditions [<xref rid="B12-polymers-17-00496" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Under subcritical conditions, water exhibits decreased density and dielectric constant, increased hydrocarbon solubility, and enhanced ionic production of H<sup>+</sup> and OH<sup>&#x02212;</sup> [<xref rid="B12-polymers-17-00496" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-polymers-17-00496" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. This makes Hydrothermal treatment (HTS) a sustainable processing method for cassava peel, as it neither generates additional waste streams nor requires chemical additives. These properties enable the efficient breakdown of the lignocellulosic structure of cassava peels without the need for acid/base catalysts or subsequent neutralization steps. However, autoclave treatment can be employed to compare the effects of temperature and pressure for a lower-cost and more sustainable process. A previous study compared the energy efficiencies of autoclaves and conventional HTS reactors [<xref rid="B14-polymers-17-00496" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Despite several studies employing HTS, it has seldom been used independently as a pretreatment for enzymatic hydrolysis. Recent studies have demonstrated the potential of HTS for valorizing cassava peels. Bayitse et al. [<xref rid="B15-polymers-17-00496" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] optimized the enzymatic hydrolysis conditions for cassava peel, achieving up to 98% hydrolysis efficiency and producing substantial amounts of fermentable sugars. Similarly, Olanbiwoninu and Odunfa [<xref rid="B16-polymers-17-00496" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] highlighted the importance of pretreatment methods, including hydrothermal processes, for enhancing the bioconversion of cassava peels into fermentable sugars.</p><p>Hydrothermal treatment is crucial in detoxifying cassava peels containing cyanogenic glycosides that can be harmful if consumed directly. Olafadehan et al. [<xref rid="B17-polymers-17-00496" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] demonstrated that processing methods, including hydrothermal treatment, could effectively reduce hydrogen cyanide concentrations in cassava peels. According to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), the safety limit for cyanide in cassava products is 2&#x02013;10 mg/kg. This detoxification process is essential for utilizing cassava peels in livestock feed because untreated peels can pose health risks owing to their cyanogenic content. Moreover, the hydrothermal carbonization of cassava peel has been explored as a method for producing hydrochar. This is a carbon-rich material that can be used as a soil amendment or adsorbent for water treatment applications. Pratiwi et al. [<xref rid="B18-polymers-17-00496" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] successfully synthesized hydrochar from cassava peel using hydrothermal carbonization, demonstrating its potential as a hard-water softener [<xref rid="B18-polymers-17-00496" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. This dual application of cassava peel, both as feedstock for bioenergy and as a material for environmental remediation, highlights the versatility of hydrothermal treatment in waste valorization, which aligns with the principles of circular economy and biorefinery concepts, potentially transforming cassava waste into valuable products [<xref rid="B17-polymers-17-00496" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>Subcritical water treatment of cassava peel concentrates and preserves bioactive compounds, including polysaccharides and lignocellulosic components, contributing to their emulsifying properties. These compounds can stabilize emulsions by providing a network that traps oil droplets while improving the digestibility of complex carbohydrates through partial hydrolysis [<xref rid="B19-polymers-17-00496" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-polymers-17-00496" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Although synthetic emulsifiers currently dominate 70% of the market due to their cost-effectiveness and availability, their production from primary agricultural resources may compromise food security and sustainable development goals. Therefore, the valorization of plant byproducts presents a more sustainable alternative for emulsifier production, aligning with the need for sustainable practices in the food industry [<xref rid="B21-polymers-17-00496" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-polymers-17-00496" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-polymers-17-00496" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Despite the abundance of polysaccharides in cassava peels, few studies have been conducted on their emulsifying properties. This study aimed to fill this gap by exploring the potential of cassava peel for emulsion stabilization, highlighting its promising role in the food industry.</p><p>However, cassava peel is a complex matrix of several compounds, and reducing the isolation and purification of a single compound can lead to lower costs. A study by Sulaeman et al. [<xref rid="B19-polymers-17-00496" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] showed the zeta potentials of cassava peels after microwave processing at 120 &#x000b0;C to be between 0.8 and 1.2 mV, which is not a desirable trait for emulsion stabilization. Hence, this study further explored the introduction of other emulsifiers with greater surface activity to strengthen the potential of cassava peel and to form synergistic interactions for more desirable emulsion properties.</p><p><italic toggle="yes">Quillaja</italic> saponin is a plant-based, nonionic, and commercially available emulsifier, whereas polyoxyethylene sorbitan monolaurate, commercially known as Tween 20, is a synthetic nonionic emulsifier. <italic toggle="yes">Quillaja</italic> saponins sourced from <italic toggle="yes">Quillaja</italic> trees are preferred over other natural/plant-based emulsifiers because of their low molecular weights. They consist of polar sugar moieties attached to a nonpolar triterpene or steroid backbone, making these amphiphilic molecules highly active on their surfaces [<xref rid="B24-polymers-17-00496" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and exhibit excellent techno-functional properties. However, the high cost of <italic toggle="yes">Quillaja</italic> significantly hinders its use in most commercial applications. In addition, the issues of sustainable farming and sourcing to meet the demand must be addressed [<xref rid="B25-polymers-17-00496" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Tween 20 is widely used because of its availability, low cost, and efficient emulsifying properties [<xref rid="B26-polymers-17-00496" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. It has been approved as a non-toxic synthetic emulsifier by several regulatory bodies, such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Food Safety Authority (EFSA).</p><p>The present study addresses critical gaps in sustainable food technology through an innovative approach to cassava peel valorization. While previous research has explored various aspects of cassava waste management, this work pioneers the systematic investigation of hydrothermal processing for natural emulsifier development. Specifically, this study aims to (1) develop and optimize a chemical-free, subcritical water process for transforming cassava peels into functional emulsifiers; (2) establish the relationship between processing parameters and emulsifying properties; and (3) create a novel co-emulsifier system with <italic toggle="yes">Quillaja</italic> saponins to enhance stability while maintaining clean-label status. This research is particularly significant given the current dominance of synthetic emulsifiers (70% market share) and the massive scale of cassava waste generation (15&#x02013;20% of 303 billion kg produced globally in 2020). By systematically investigating the effects of temperature, pressure, and residence time on extract properties, this study seeks to demonstrate how hydrothermal processing can be precisely controlled to generate customized emulsifiers for food, cosmetic, and pharmaceutical applications. This approach addresses the pressing need for clean-label ingredients and establishes a new paradigm for sustainable waste valorization, contributing to both circular economy principles and the advancement of green chemistry in food technology.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-polymers-17-00496"><title>2.

The peels were sun-dried to a constant weight in the month of February when the average temperature and humidity were approximately 36 &#x000b0;C with 10% moisture content and collected for further processing. The cassava peels were milled using a rasper mill and sundried during the warmer months in Nigeria, in February, when the average temperature was approximately 36 &#x000b0;C to a constant weight with 10% moisture content, and the samples were dried to constant weight in an oven at 105 &#x000b0;C (ADVANTEC DRM620DB, Saito, Japan) to ensure consistency across all procedures. Once the cassava peels were adequately dried, they were sealed in airtight bags to prevent moisture absorption and to maintain sample quality. The sealed bags were stored in a cool, dry place before being transported to the laboratory for further analysis.

The HTS process demonstrates a bell-shaped yield curve, peaking at approximately 140&#x02013;160 &#x000b0;C with yields approaching 70%, followed by a decline at higher temperatures. The highest yield was attained at the lowest pH, indicating a positive effect of acidic compounds on solubilization. This trend is consistent with the observed behavior of other lignocellulosic biomasses, such as corn stover and rice straw, after HTS [<xref rid="B35-polymers-17-00496" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The optimal temperature range likely corresponds to the effective breakdown of hemicellulose (150 &#x000b0;C to 180 &#x000b0;C) and partial depolymerization of cellulose (180 &#x000b0;C to 220 &#x000b0;C). The yield reduction at temperatures below 160 &#x000b0;C is due to the increased formation of solid residues (biochar) or gaseous products, as observed during material collection and in studies on HTS of woody biomass. The observed molecular structure and functionality changes demonstrate how controlled processing conditions can effectively modify natural polysaccharides to create functional polymeric materials with enhanced surface-active properties. The relationship between processing parameters and polymer characteristics provides insights into tailoring natural polysaccharides for specific applications.</p><p>Cassava peel primarily consists of starch (50&#x02013;60%), cellulose (10&#x02013;30%), hemicellulose (10&#x02013;20%), and lignin (10&#x02013;20%). Aromatic compounds from lignin decomposition may also contribute to the liquid yield at higher temperatures. The yield difference between HTS (57% at 120 &#x000b0;C) and autoclave treatment (26% at 127 &#x000b0;C) highlights the crucial role of pressure in enhancing hydrolysis reactions and maintaining water in a subcritical state, thereby improving mass transfer and solubility of biomass components.

Importantly, SCPs showed efficacy as co-emulsifiers under milder processing conditions (127 &#x000b0;C at 0.2 MPa) compared to more intense conditions (140 &#x000b0;C at 2 MPa) suggesting that energy-efficient methods can be employed without compromising the functional properties.
