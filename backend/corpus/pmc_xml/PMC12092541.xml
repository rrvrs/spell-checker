While we know that careful learning walks enable the homing behavior of foraging ants to their original nest, we do not know whether additional learning is required to navigate to the new nest location. To answer this question, we investigated the nest relocation behavior of a colony of Australian desert ants (<italic>Melophorus bagoti</italic>) that relocated their nest in response to heavy rainfall in the semidesert terrain of Alice Springs. We identified five types of behavior: exploration between nests (Old-to-New nest and New-to-Old nest), transport from Old to New nest, and relearning walks at Old and New nests. Initially, the workers performed relearning walks at the Old nest and exploratory walks between the Old and New nests. Once they completed the exploratory walks, the workers transported resources and brood to the new nest. Finally, we observed the workers performing relearning walks at the New nest. While the relearning walks at the Old nest were slow and appear to enable exploratory walks to the New nest, the relearning walks at the new nest were faster and appeared to enable homing from foraging trips. These observations shed insight on how learning helps these ants to respond to sudden changes in their environment.</p><sec><title>Supplementary information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.3758/s13420-024-00652-1.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Nest relocation</kwd><kwd>Red honey ants</kwd><kwd>Relearning walks</kwd><kwd>Transportation</kwd><kwd>Exploratory walks</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Macquarie University</institution></funding-source></award-group><open-access><p> Open Access funding enabled and organized by CAUL and its Member Institutions</p></open-access></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Psychonomic Society, Inc. 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">For social insects like ants, social wasps, and honeybees, nests are a vital resource. They serve as a sanctuary, offering protection, storage space, and a communal platform (Jeanne, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">1975</xref>; Seeley &#x00026; Morse, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">1976</xref>; Tschinkel, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2004</xref>; Wilson, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2000</xref>). Sometimes, however, nests must be abandoned and the colony must relocate due to factors such as disturbances, microclimate changes, predation, and competition (H&#x000f6;lldobler &#x00026; Wilson, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">1990</xref>; McGlynn, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2012</xref>). Transport of workers and brood toward new nests is not restricted to colony relocation; it also occurs in the context of the foundation of new colonies by colony fission, as seen in species like <italic>Cataglyphis cursor</italic> (Ch&#x000e9;ron et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2011</xref>). Nest relocation in desert ants is a remarkable behavior that encompasses collective action, navigation, and adaptation to the extreme conditions of the desert environment. While this study focuses on the red honey ant <italic>Melophorus bagoti</italic>, the desert ant <italic>Cataglyphis iberica</italic> provides a compelling example of sophisticated navigational strategies and diverse nest relocation tactics. This species exhibits exceptional navigational abilities, employing a combination of visual cues&#x02014;such as the position of the sun&#x02014;and path integration, which involves tracking their movements relative to their starting point (Fourcassi&#x000e9; et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2000</xref>). These ants maintain remarkable accuracy in their navigation despite the harsh desert terrain, effectively integrating visual information with internal movement tracking to relocate their nests. The diverse strategies for nest relocation observed in <italic>Cataglyphis iberica</italic> include following prominent landmarks and adjusting their navigation based on environmental changes (Fourcassi&#x000e9; et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2000</xref>). To date, only four sets of field-based studies have investigated nest relocation in desert-living ants: on <italic>Cataglyphis iberica</italic> in Spain (Dahbi et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2008</xref>), on <italic>Melophorus bagoti</italic> (Deeti &#x00026; Cheng, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2021a</xref>; Schultheiss et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2010</xref>), and on nocturnal bull ants <italic>Myrmecia midas</italic> (Deeti et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2024b</xref>). While these studies documented the relocation process, which includes the physical movement of the nest and the associated logistical coordination, they did not explore the learning processes involved in navigation to the new nest site. Specifically, they did not address whether ants engage in exploratory behavior or &#x02018;learning walks&#x02019; that facilitate successful nest relocation. Understanding these strategies is crucial as it offers insights into how ants manage complex navigational tasks and adapt to extreme conditions, which can be valuable for studying similar behaviors in other species and environments.</p><p id="Par3">Most ant species rely heavily on trail pheromones and not or very little on visual cues. But some hymenopterans, such as bees, wasps, and some ants, learn and relearn the visual cues surrounding their nest for navigation (Deeti et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2024a</xref>;&#x000a0;Collett &#x00026; Zeil, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">1996</xref>; Lehrer &#x00026; Bianco, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2000</xref>; Nicholson et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">1999</xref>; Philippides et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2013</xref>; Zeil et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">1996</xref>). These learning walks and flights enable these insects to efficiently navigate in their environment. The learning or orientation flights of bees and wasps play a key role in learning about the location of landmarks, food sources, and potential hazards (Collett &#x00026; Lehrer, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">1993</xref>; Zeil, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">1993</xref>). Individual na&#x000ef;ve ants explore their environment in a systematic pattern in order to learn the location of their nest before beginning their foraging life (Deeti &#x00026; Cheng, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2021b</xref>; Fleischmann et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2016</xref>; Jayatilaka et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2018</xref>). Desert ants also perform learning walks at feeders and also learn the route (Nicholson et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">1999</xref>; Vega Vermehren et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2020</xref>). Experienced ant foragers also sometimes perform short, looping walks, reminiscent of learning walks, called relearning walks (Jayatilaka et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2018</xref>; Narendra &#x00026; Ramirez-Esquivel, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2017</xref>), for example, at the start of a new day or when presented with a new landmark set up (Wystrach et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2014</xref>). Relearning flights or walks are also important for navigation in wasps, bees, and ants. During relearning flights, the insect typically flies in a looping or circuitous pattern, similar to learning walks seen in ants (Collett &#x00026; Zeil, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">1996</xref>; Lehrer &#x00026; Bianco, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2000</xref>; Nicholson et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">1999</xref>; Philippides et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2013</xref>; Zeil et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">1996</xref>), where insects update their memories of their surroundings seemingly to adjust to changes in their environment or degradation of their memories. Updating is important: Studies on two species of bull ants of <italic>Myrmecia</italic> genus showed that changes in the landmark panorama affected the visual navigation ability of these nocturnal ants. These changes prompted ants to repeatedly turn back and look toward the nest while heading out to forage (Islam et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2020</xref>; Narendra &#x00026; Ramirez-Esquivel, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2017</xref>). While we know much about the na&#x000ef;ve learning walks, we know less about when and how foragers augment their initial learning as they experience navigational challenges, changes to their visual environment, or locations beyond their familiar range, such as during nest relocation.</p><p id="Par4">Relocation in social insects differs from relocation in solitary animals. While both require searching for a new nest, social insects must also coordinate the transfer of colony members unable to make the trip alone. This intricate navigational behavior has been extensively studied in honeybees (Seeley, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2009</xref>) as well as in a few species of wasps (Strassmann, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2001</xref>) and ants (Franks et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2005</xref>). During nest relocation in colonies with monomorphic workers, different workers take on different roles and perform specific tasks to ensure a successful move (Visscher, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2007</xref>). Scouts explore the surroundings to find potential nest sites, assess these sites, and communicate their findings to the colony (Pratt et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2005</xref>). Excavators or builders construct new chambers at the chosen location (Beshers &#x00026; Fewell, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2001</xref>). Transporters coordinate the transportation of brood, including eggs, larvae, and pupae, to the new location (Visscher, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2007</xref>). It remains unclear, however, whether navigational learning is required to support these behaviors and enable these individual tasks, which often require travel between the old and new nest locations.</p><p id="Par5">Here, in a natural experiment, we observed the relocation behavior of one rain-damaged colony of desert ants. We filmed the behavior of these ants around their old nest, their new nest, and during their trips between the two nests to examine the path structures they follow and whether they transport brood during nest relocation. Beyond describing these behaviors, we formed the following research questions before analysing any of the data: Do colony members perform relearning walks before engaging in relocation behaviors? Do colony members perform any additional learning walks at the new nest once they have traveled there? What is the structure of these learning behaviors and to what extent do they differ from na&#x000ef;ve learning walks? Answering these questions will help us to better understand the role that learning plays in relocation, while also shedding light on how life-long learning can help facilitate navigational behavior across the wide range of environments and scenarios that these animals find themselves in.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study species</title><p id="Par6">All observations were performed in an open and grassy arid desert land at the Centre for Appropriate Technology in Alice Springs from November to December 2022. The region is characterized by vast semidesert landscapes with sparse vegetation, such as spinifex grass, acacia trees, shrubs, and eucalyptus trees. The red honey ant, <italic>M. bagoti</italic>, is the most thermophilic ant species found on the Australian continent (Christian &#x00026; Morton, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">1992</xref>). Our observations revealed that these ants were usually active outside the nest when temperatures ranged between 32&#x000b0; and 40 &#x000b0;C. During the hot southern summer, these <italic>M. bagoti</italic> ants engage in foraging. They scavenge primarily dead spiders, sugar ants, termites, centipedes, moths and other dead arthropods. Additionally, they also collect sugary plant exudates and seeds (Muser et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2005</xref>; Schultheiss &#x00026; Nooten, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2013</xref>). These Australian desert ant <italic>Melophorus bagoti</italic> colonies are widely distributed across the central Australian semidesert, where these endemic honey ants make their monodomous colonies. The ants are known for their unique nesting habits, which involve excavating subterranean nests with multiple chambers made in sandy soil, typically with only one entrance on the ground (Deeti et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2023a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2023b</xref>). The red soil was composed of sand sediments laid down by floods (Baker et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1983</xref>). During summer months, we had the opportunity to record the workers&#x02019; activity in a collapsed colony after a heavy rainfall. We found the workers of the colony excavating the new nest a week after heavy rain. For the first 7 days foragers were found excavating a new tunnel at the Old nest. Later on, we found the foragers were scouting and excavating the new nest. We started our systematic recordings of relocation-related events of the nest from the eighth day, starting with recording the relearning walks of the worker ants at the Old nest. While Australian ethical clearance is not required to conduct research on the ants, our study was completely observational and did not impose any manipulations during the nest relocation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Procedure</title><p id="Par7">The methods for this study involved observation and documentation of the structure of the paths of workers during nest relocation. The study was initiated after the discovery of the workers excavating a new nest 20 m away from the old nest 3 days after the heavy rainfall. After the discovery, we focused on key behaviors and events that were relevant to nest relocation, such as worker interactions, the process of nest relocation, worker roles and responsibilities, and any notable changes in behavior following heavy rainfall. In order to accurately document the behavior of workers during nest relocation, the study employed a systematic approach to observe and record events. The observed ant behaviors were classified into five different behaviors: Relearning walks (Old nest), Relearning walks (New nest), exploratory walks (Old-to-New), exploratory walks (New-to-Old), and transportation walks (always Old-to-New nest). Furthermore, these five behaviors were grouped into two main categories: Nest-based learning walks and traveling behavior. In the Traveling behavior category, ants started on a journey from one nest and ended it at the other nest. In contrast, during the nest-based learning behavior, ants initiated their journey at one nest and ended it at the same nest. This categorization allowed for a clear analysis of the ants&#x02019; behaviors in different scenarios during the nest-relocation process. Nest-based learning walks were defined as systematic loops around the nest area, both at the old and new nest locations, starting and ending at the same nest. Ants engaged in relearning walks did not carry debris, and these walks extended within a maximum distance of 30&#x02013;80 cm from the nest entrance. We also observed ants traveling toward the Old or New nest. Ants which were shuttling between the Old and New nests without carrying any ant colony resources were considered as doing exploratory walks. On the other hand, when a worker carried pupae, callows, or larvae from the Old nest to the New nest, we considered it a Transporter. We recorded the one relearning walk of each unique individual worker (Old nest: <italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;10; and New nest: <italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;10), by painting them once they completed a relearning walk and only analysing the walks of unpainted ants. Then, we recorded the individual workers&#x02019; Traveling behavior from the Old to the New nest (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;16) and from the New to the Old nest (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;10) and later when the workers&#x02019; transporting of resources and brood from the Old to the New nest (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;10) at a midpoint 10 m from the Old and New nests. In the traveling behavior we only recorded a meter of their paths during their travel to target nest at the midpoint. Once we recorded their walks, we captured at them at the target location and painted each ant with a dot of color on their gaster to avoid rerecording of the same ant.</p><sec id="Sec5"><title>Recording</title><p id="Par8">A Sony (4 K) Handy Cam recorded the relearning walks. We placed the camera on a tripod at the Old nest to capture the relearning walks occurring there. On the same day we placed a second camera at the midpoint approximately 10 m away from both the Old and New nests. Here, we recorded the exploration behavior of the ants as they ventured between the nests in both directions. We recorded the ants that happened to travel under the camera, capturing their activities during this exploration. On the next day, we placed a camera at the midpoint to record foragers transporting resources to the New nest, at the same location where the exploration behavior was earlier captured. On the day after the relocation was completed, we used the second camera to record the relearning walks of ants at the New nest. This comprehensive recording approach allowed us to study the workers&#x02019; behavior during all the crucial stages of nest relocation. Each recording was captured at 25 frames per second, and the recording area covered a 1-square-meter area with a resolution of 3,860&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;2,160 pixels. To record the individual ant relearning behavior at the Old and New nests, we observed the relearning walks as the ants left the nest and continued observing them until they returned back to the nest. For exploratory walks, we followed the ants from the Old and New nests, recorded their behavior at the midpoint, and continued to follow them until they arrived at their goal. As for the transporters, we followed them from the Old nest until they reached the recording area, where we filmed their behavior, and continued to follow them until they entered the new nest. To avoid rerecording ants in all experimental observations, we painted each videotaped ant&#x02019;s gaster with a color (Citadel brand) immediately before it entered its destination nest. These painted ants were found frequently exploring between the Old and New nests. However, we did not record any of their activities in these further appearances.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Tracking</title><p id="Par9">We used the animal tracking program DLTdv8 (8.2.9) in MATLAB (2022B) to extract frame-by-frame coordinates of the head and thorax of each ant in each video from our recordings of their behavior (S. Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). These frame-by-frame coordinates were used for all subsequent analyses of the workers&#x02019; trajectories during nest relocation. The thorax positions were used for all the path characteristics described next and presented in the Results, while the head positions defined the direction in which an ant was facing (line from thorax through head), a variable that was not analysed in this study.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Trajectory plots of ants accomplishing different types of travel. <bold>A</bold> Ants returning to the Old nest from the New nest (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;10). <bold>B</bold> Ants heading to the New nest from the Old nest (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;10). <bold>C</bold> Ants carrying brood and larvae to the New nest from the Old nest (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;10).

Na&#x000ef;ve ants were identified by painting every emerging ant from the nest with a dot of paint (Citadel brand) for 9 days. After 9 days, any unpainted ant emerging was considered na&#x000ef;ve. A video camera was set up centered over the nest in the same fashion as at the Old nest. The camera was turned on as soon as an unpainted ant emerged. Characteristics of learning walks in this species, including the first, na&#x000ef;ve walk, have been described (Deeti &#x00026; Cheng, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2021b</xref>), but we obtained a new set here on statistical grounds, to avoid multiple comparisons with the same data set from Deeti and Cheng (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2021b</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Data analysis</title><p id="Par11">We analysed the ants&#x02019; trajectories (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;56) using multiple indices of straightness and speed to understand the structure and function of these nest relocation behaviors.

For movement characteristics, we calculated the maximum displacement, duration and area covered by the ants during the relearning walks. The nest location was chosen as the origin (0, 0). For each relearning walk, we noted the farthest distance the ant traveled from the nest entrance (maximum displacement). This helped us understand how extensively the ants explored their surroundings. We also recorded the exact duration of each relearning walk, from the moment the ant left the nest until it returned. For the area covered during these walks, we calculated the enclosed area, using the convex-hull method to encompass all the points visited by the ant.

We thus split our models into two groups: Traveling and Relearning. Our traveling models compare the effect of walk types (New-to-Old nest, Old-to-New nest, and Transportation walks) on path characteristics. Relearning models, on the other hand, compare the relearning walks at the Old nest, at the New nest, and the first learning walks at the nonrelocating nest.

Notably, relearning at the Old nest showed directed movement, while relearning at the New nest exhibited a more uniform directional distribution. During transportation, in which ants were carrying brood or other colony resources, ants moved more slowly than during exploration.</p><p id="Par21">In the walks between the two nests, while the exploratory walks between nests likely aided the learning of the route, the slower transportation walks appeared to efficiently transport resources. Transporters walked slower, with a higher degree of moment-to-moment curviness or sinuosity. Two nonmutually exclusive reasons for these differences are that the resources being transported are more valuable to the colony than the pieces of food carried by foragers, and the ants are impeded by carrying materials in their mandibles. The slower speed might reflect the ants strategically reducing the chances of dropping or damaging the goods. We currently do not know what decisional and neurobiological processes might underlie this idea of taking care in walking. Perhaps a more likely cause is the material that an ant is carrying on transportation walks impedes travel. From other as yet unpublished observations on these ants, we do not think that it is the weight that causes ants to slow down. The material that an ant is transporting, however, is held in front of the ant and changes the panoramic view, especially in front of the traveling ant, and view changes cause changes in gait (unpublished observations). The side-to-side oscillations exhibited by transporters may be an attempt to view the scene in front unobstructed. Further tests are needed to examine these various interpretations.</p><p id="Par22">When it comes to the relearning walks, those at the Old nest might be important for later transportation of resources to the new nest. The sequence of Old-nest relearning walks followed by exploration between nests supports such an interpretation. So is the fact that relearning walks at the Old nest are concentrated in the general direction of the New nest (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, S. Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). New-nest relearning behaviors, on the other hand, suggest that their purpose is to enable future homing, such as after foraging. Walks at the new nest had a uniform directional distribution around the nest, covering all directions around the nest. Both Old- and New-nest relearning walks resembled the learning walks of na&#x000ef;ve ants to an extent, but differences in walk characteristics were found. The relearning walks at the New nest were faster, covered a larger area, and were not directed toward the Old nest. Relearning walks at the New nest resembled the first learning walks of future <italic>M. bagoti</italic> foragers, covering a similar area and maximum displacement. Future foragers gradually learn the foraging direction by increasing the area covered on learning walks with successive trips (Deeti &#x00026; Cheng, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2021a</xref>; Deeti et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2024a</xref>)This strategy is also observed in the tree-foraging bull ant <italic>Myrmecia crosslandi</italic> (Jayatilaka et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2018</xref>). At the Old nest, relearning walks contributed to the development of the one route leading to the New nest, while at the New nest, ants were attempting to learn the surrounding scene to return to their new home from various directions. The two types of relearning walks were geared at successful nest relocation at the Old nest and spatial knowledge acquisition at the New nest. These different functions likely explain the differences in characteristics between relearning walks at the Old and New nests.</p><p id="Par23">While exploratory or scouting behavior for finding a suitable nest site and optimal food resources is well known in insects (Doran et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2016</xref>), how these animals coordinate the transportation of brood and other colony resources to the new nest site was largely unknown. We have shown that workers explore the route between the old and new nests before transporting resources to the new nest. Since desert ants do not rely on pheromone trails for navigation (Graham &#x00026; Cheng, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2009</xref>; Wehner et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2014</xref>; Wystrach et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2014</xref>), these ants may be familiarizing themselves with the route between the old and new nest. This familiarization could develop their route memory and learning of the nearby environmental cues. Alternatively, these exploratory walks may help ants identify potential hazards and predator risks in the new environment, which could otherwise interfere with relocation and nest establishment. Thirdly, it is possible that the ants are compensating for the large distance between the old and new nests by engaging in these exploration walks before transporting resources. Foraging distances are often shorter than the 20-m distance between nests that we observed (Muser et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2005</xref>). These possible explanations are not mutually exclusive, and further research on this topic is needed to evaluate them.</p><p id="Par24">Our study shows that learning and navigation play key roles in nest relocation in this species (Deeti &#x00026; Cheng, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2021b</xref>; Schultheiss et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2010</xref>). In one earlier study, an <italic>M. bagoti</italic> worker was observed dragging her abdomen across the sandy ground to direct the colony members toward the new nest (Schultheiss et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2010</xref>). However, this study did not definitively establish whether all exploratory or transporting ants lay intermittent odor trails. The desert climate destroys pheromones quickly, so that even with odor trails as guides, ants might well need to learn visual cues in addition to travel the route regularly. Our study shows these desert ants doing just that. Future studies should examine how many relearning walks are required before starting the relocation.</p><p id="Par25">Nest relocation is uncommon for many solitarily foraging desert ant colonies with a large workforce, such as the Australian desert ant <italic>Melophorus bagoti</italic>, which, based on the personal observations, typically does not move nests. For any ant colony, however, various exogenous and endogenous factors may cause them to relocate. In the current study, heavy rainfall triggered the relocation of the observed desert ant colony to a new site 20 m away from their old nest. While two previous studies have reported instances of nest relocation in this species (Deeti &#x00026; Cheng, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2021a</xref>; Schultheiss &#x00026; Cheng, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2010</xref>), nest disturbance from field experimentation, such as setting up feeders and partitioning areas around nests, usually does not lead to nest movement. Heavy rainfall has also been associated with relocation in nocturnal bull ants <italic>Myrmecia midas</italic> colonies (Deeti et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2024b</xref>). Record rains in NSW in 2022 led to deterioration of nest chambers in a sizeable minority of nests at the field site. Even though some social insects like termite colonies are not sessile and shift locations even in the absence of significant changes in environmental conditions (McGlynn, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2012</xref>), the current nest relocation in the red honey ants is likely to have been triggered by structural damage to the nest chambers caused by the heavy rain.</p><p id="Par26">One limitation of the current study is that it is based on a single nest, unlike the multiple relocation events observed in bull ants (Deeti et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2024b</xref>). Given the evidence that flooding can cause nest relocation, it is possible and legal to experimentally flood nests and then observe nest relocation. Although legal, and although the ants are common in Central Australia, we would still find it unethical to deliberately cause the destruction of a red-honey-ant nest.</p><p id="Par27">In sum, this study investigated the nest relocation behavior and response to nest damage in the solitarily foraging desert ant <italic>Melophorus bagoti,</italic> particularly focusing on their behavioral patterns and learning processes during relocation. Heavy rainfall causing structural damage to nest chambers likely triggered the observed nest relocation. The field-based observations revealed a sequence of behaviors, from old-nest relearning walks to exploration between old and new nests to transportation walks ferrying resources to the new nest to new-nest relearning walks. Notably, transporters exhibited slower and more sinuous movements when carrying brood or resources, suggesting a careful approach in transportation. The relearning walks at the old nest appeared to facilitate later resource transportation to the new nest, while relearning walks at the new nest seemed geared toward spatial knowledge acquisition. The study highlights the importance of exploratory walks in familiarizing ants with the route between old and new nests, contributing to route memory and identification of environmental cues. The lack of reliance on pheromone trails in desert ants highlights the significance of visual cues and regular route travel for successful relocation. The findings emphasize the role of learning and navigation in nest relocation. Future studies should explore the number of relearning walks required before initiating relocation. Overall, this study revealed some of the complex behavioral processes involved in nest relocation in <italic>Melophorus bagoti,</italic> offering insights into the ant&#x02019;s adaptive responses to environmental changes and challenges.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary information</title><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.<supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM1"><media xlink:href="13420_2024_652_MOESM1_ESM.docx"><caption><p>Supplementary file1 (DOCX 1586 KB)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher's Note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We acknowledge the traditional custodians of the land upon which this research was conducted, the Arrernte people.
