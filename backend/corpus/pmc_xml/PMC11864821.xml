Niche microbiome investigations so far have identified alterations in microbial composition between normal and various esophageal disease states [<xref rid="jvim70029-bib-0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. A landmark study in people suggests the classification of the EM into two groups: Type I microbiome dominated by Gram&#x02010;positive taxa in normal individuals and Type II microbiome dominated by Gram&#x02010;negative taxa in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and Barrett's esophagus (BE) [<xref rid="jvim70029-bib-0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The majority of the EM studies describe phenomenological observations and associations rather than a definitive causal role [<xref rid="jvim70029-bib-0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Whether EM alteration induces esophageal disease remains unknown [<xref rid="jvim70029-bib-0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Although microbiota from various locations have been elucidated in veterinary medicine [<xref rid="jvim70029-bib-0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], the EM of dogs has not been researched in relation to esophageal health and common esophageal diseases, including gastrointestinal reflux disease, megaesophagus, and other motility disorders.</p><p>Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are a common class of medications used for the management of esophageal diseases in human and veterinary medicine. Gastric acid suppression with PPIs might impact the EM, and though the disease&#x02010;modifying effects and clinical implications of these changes are unknown, it has the potential to be quite relevant [<xref rid="jvim70029-bib-0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Examples of adverse effects reported with PPI use in people include PPI&#x02010;associated pneumonia and dysbiosis&#x02010;associated <italic toggle="yes">Clostridioides difficile</italic> infections [<xref rid="jvim70029-bib-0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="jvim70029-bib-0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="jvim70029-bib-0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Currently, there are no veterinary studies investigating the effects of PPIs on the EM, although omeprazole was found to alter the quantitative abundance of several bacterial communities in the gastrointestinal tract of dogs without any qualitative changes in the phylogenetic composition of the microbiota of the stomach and duodenum [<xref rid="jvim70029-bib-0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Previous studies investigating esophageal microbiota have utilized endoscopic mucosal biopsies or brush sampling techniques for sample collection. However, this is invasive, time&#x02010;consuming, and requires general anesthesia [<xref rid="jvim70029-bib-0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. This complication risk under general anesthesia increases in patient groups that are already predisposed to reflux or regurgitation [<xref rid="jvim70029-bib-0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. A minimally invasive capsule&#x02010;based string technology, called an &#x0201c;esophageal string test&#x0201d; (EST) has been used in awake human patients to sample the EM and the microbial profiles obtained were comparable to matched endoscopic biopsies [<xref rid="jvim70029-bib-0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. This minimally invasive method could promote veterinary studies investigating the EM of dogs and help reduce the risk of complications associated with sampling in certain disease groups.</p><p>The aim of this study was to characterize the EM in a group of healthy dogs, evaluate the effect of short&#x02010;term omeprazole therapy (14&#x02009;days) on the compositional change of the EM, and determine if the EM is restored by 30&#x02009;days after the discontinuation of omeprazole. The study hypothesized that the EST would be safe and successful in obtaining esophageal biofluid for EM determination in healthy, unsedated dogs. We also hypothesized that short&#x02010;term omeprazole administered orally at a standard dose would cause changes to the EM composition, and restoration to the native state would be noted within 30&#x02009;days.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials-and-methods" id="jvim70029-sec-0008"><label>2</label><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="jvim70029-sec-0009"><label>2.1</label><title>Study Design and Dogs</title><p>This was a prospective longitudinal study design reviewed and approved by the institutional animal care and use committee at Washington State University. Clinically healthy, client&#x02010;owned dogs between the ages of 3 and 6&#x02009;years were enrolled in the study. This age range was selected to avoid age&#x02010;related compositional changes to the microbiome [<xref rid="jvim70029-bib-0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. A minimum weight of 9&#x02009;kg was selected to avoid esophageal string&#x02010;associated complications related to body size. A physical examination, complete blood count, biochemical profile, urinalysis, and fecal examination were performed before enrollment to determine health status. A questionnaire was used to obtain information regarding their diet, environment, and medical history. Study dogs included had no previous history of gastrointestinal disease in the last 12&#x02009;months and no gastro&#x02010;protectant, antimicrobial, or probiotic therapy for at least 3&#x02009;months before enrollment [<xref rid="jvim70029-bib-0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Routine ectoparasite preventatives and joint supplements were allowed. A medication log was provided to the clients to document when they administered the medication to the study participants.</p></sec><sec id="jvim70029-sec-0010"><label>2.2</label><title>Sample Collection&#x02010;Esophageal String Test</title><p>Esophageal biofluid samples were collected by the esophageal string test (EST) method using the EnteroTracker (EnteroTrack LLC, Aurora, CO). The device comprises an ingestible capsule containing a weighted, stainless&#x02010;steel ball and a highly absorbent nylon string (90&#x02009;cm, pediatric size). The kit provided by the commercial vendor (EnteroTrack LLC) contained a sterile thermoplastic sheet, a pair of scissors, forceps, measuring tape, pH indicator sticks (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="jvim70029-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1A,B</xref>) and a colorimetric chart (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="jvim70029-supitem-0002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2C</xref>). About 15&#x02013;20&#x02009;cm of string was pulled from the capsule until the beginning of the thicker absorbent string was visible. The capsule was orally administered by pilling, followed by 10&#x02013;12&#x02009;mL of water to ensure a complete swallow. The external portion of the string was secured to the dog's collar using an adhesive to allow free head movement. Using a permanent marker, a mark (0&#x02009;cm) was made on the string at the level of the dog's lip/commissure. The string was allowed to remain in the dog's esophagus for 15&#x02009;min (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="jvim70029-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1E</xref>). The dogs were monitored for any discomfort and gently restrained to limit their movement in accordance with the principles outlined by the institutional ethics committee. After 15&#x02009;min, the string was retrieved by pulling it out of the mouth at an even rate (over 2&#x02013;3&#x02009;s) per the manufacturer's recommendations (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="jvim70029-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1F</xref>).</p><p>The string was placed on the sterile thermoplastic sheet for further processing. The 0&#x02009;cm mark on the string was aligned with 0&#x02009;cm on the tape measure. The distance from the oral commissure (0&#x02009;cm) to the caudal aspect of the base of the ear was measured for each dog, and a second mark (~7&#x02013;8&#x02009;cm) was made on the string to avoid the pharyngeal portion. Per the manufacturer's recommendation, the pH indicator sticks were used to determine the esophageal portion of the string and distinguish gastric contents by blotting the string at 2&#x02009;cm intervals and comparing it against the colorimetric chart (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="jvim70029-supitem-0002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2A&#x02013;D</xref>). To harvest the esophageal section of the string, the beginning was marked about 7&#x02013;8&#x02009;cm from the 0&#x02009;cm mark, and the end was marked 2&#x02009;cm from the beginning of the gastric section (pH &#x0003c;&#x02009;4), if obtained, or from the end of the string. The esophageal section of the string was cut using the forceps and scissors in the kit provided. The esophageal section of the string was placed in the nucleic acid stabilizing solution (DNA/RNA shield, Zymo Research, Irvine, CA) and the vial was inverted 7&#x02013;8 times after securing the lid to ensure complete submergence of the string (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="jvim70029-supitem-0002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2D</xref>). The esophageal string samples were frozen within 4&#x02009;h of collection and kept at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C until analysis.</p></sec><sec id="jvim70029-sec-0011"><label>2.3</label><title>Study Description</title><p>Using the method described, esophageal biofluid samples were collected using the EnteroTracker on day 0 (baseline) for all 10 dogs.

The DNA samples were prepared for targeted sequencing with the Quick&#x02010;16S Plus Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) Library Prep Kit (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA). Primers were custom designed by Zymo Research to target the V3 &#x02013; region of the 16S rRNA gene (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA). The final library was sequenced on Illumina NextSeq 2000 (600&#x02009;cycles). Unique amplicon sequences were inferred from raw reads using Dada2 for bioinformatic analysis [<xref rid="jvim70029-bib-0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Chimeric sequences were also removed with the Dada2 pipeline. Taxonomy assignment was performed using Uclust from Qiime v.1.9.1. Taxonomy was assigned using the Zymo Research Database as a reference. Quantitative microbial data was estimated by means of a real&#x02010;time qPCR assay using a commercially available quantitative PCR assay kit (Quick 16&#x02009;S qPCR Premix; Zymo Research Corp) and primers targeting the V3&#x02013;V4 region. A commercial positive control was used as a standard (ZymoBIOMICS Microbial community DNA standard). The assay protocol consisted of an initial denaturation step at 95&#x000b0;C for 10&#x02009;min; 20&#x02009;cycles of denaturation at 95&#x000b0;C for 30&#x02009;s, annealing at 55&#x000b0;C for 30&#x02009;s, and extension at 72&#x000b0;C for 3&#x02009;min; and a final hold at 4&#x000b0;C.</p></sec><sec id="jvim70029-sec-0013"><label>2.5</label><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>A total of 10 dogs were determined to be appropriate to detect statistically significant changes in the microbiome, based on a priori power analysis [<xref rid="jvim70029-bib-0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Alpha diversity to estimate sample richness was calculated using the <italic toggle="yes">vegan</italic> package in R program (R package version 2.0&#x02010;10.2013) using the observed species, Shannon, and Simpson index metrics.

No significant differences in alpha or beta diversity or quantitative abundance were detected in the EM after short&#x02010;term omeprazole administration in healthy client&#x02010;owned dogs. The EST provides a safe and promising method for examining EM alterations in dogs with esophageal conditions or those at higher risk for aspiration or anesthesia&#x02010;related complications.</p><p>Compared to more invasive methods of esophageal sampling such as brush cytology and endoscopy, the EST offers a practical and effective alternative for EM sampling, omitting the need for general anesthesia [<xref rid="jvim70029-bib-0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. With the growing body of knowledge regarding the esophageal microbiome and its alterations in disease states in human medicine [<xref rid="jvim70029-bib-0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], a test such as the EST could fuel further research of the EM, where repeated sampling would be advantageous to assess the stability of the microbiome or its response to interventions [<xref rid="jvim70029-bib-0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. General anesthesia itself is a risk factor for gastro&#x02010;esophageal reflux, leading to consequences of esophagitis and esophageal strictures in veterinary patients [<xref rid="jvim70029-bib-0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In addition, dogs with esophageal dysmotility or megaesophagus are not ideal anesthetic candidates due to their increased risk of aspiration pneumonia [<xref rid="jvim70029-bib-0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="jvim70029-bib-0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Brachycephalic dogs are prone to gastroesophageal reflux and due to their anatomical conformation, have a higher risk of complications when undergoing general anesthesia [<xref rid="jvim70029-bib-0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. To encourage further microbiome studies in these disease groups, the EST allows for sampling with reduced risk and discomfort. In the present study, the EST was well tolerated with no adverse effects and allowed sufficient sampling of the esophageal biofluid in unsedated dogs. Bacterial profiles obtained through EST are equivalent to those obtained via endoscopic biopsies [<xref rid="jvim70029-bib-0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In addition, luminal sampling using the EST interrogates a larger surface area of the esophagus versus mucosal biopsies, thus allowing for a more comprehensive overview of EM [<xref rid="jvim70029-bib-0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Analysis of the esophageal mucosal microbiota of American individuals revealed that the most abundant genera were <italic toggle="yes">Tissierella, Lactobacillus, Streptococcus, Acinetobacter</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">Prevotella</italic> [<xref rid="jvim70029-bib-0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].

Approximately 6 genera were found to be consistent across all samples and time points, suggesting their temporal stability (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="jvim70029-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Further studies would be needed to characterize a core EM in dogs.</p><p>The use of PPIs has increased over the past decade, piquing research interest in potential adverse outcomes. As PPIs can influence the EM through pH&#x02010;dependent and pH&#x02010;independent factors [<xref rid="jvim70029-bib-0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], studies have explored the possibility of microbiome&#x02010;driven adverse effects such as PPI&#x02010;associated pneumonia, which are relevant to aerodigestive diseases [<xref rid="jvim70029-bib-0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Only a small drop in species richness was noted in subjects with a normal esophagus on PPIs in comparison to controls in another study, which concluded that PPI usage did not have a significant impact on alpha diversity measures or on the global taxonomic composition of the esophageal microbiota [<xref rid="jvim70029-bib-0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. However, a study comparing the EM from esophageal biopsy samples after 8&#x02009;weeks of PPI therapy in patients with esophagitis/Barrett's esophagus and controls revealed significant differences in the microbial communities after PPI therapy [<xref rid="jvim70029-bib-0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. One study in human medicine documented an increase in the abundance of Firmicutes and a decrease in the abundance of Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria in the esophagus after PPI therapy [<xref rid="jvim70029-bib-0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. However, another study comparing PPI users and non&#x02010;PPI users revealed no significant difference in the EM, except for an increase in <italic toggle="yes">Actinomyces spp</italic>. The same study also concluded that neither dose nor duration of PPI had any effect on the microbial community of the distal esophagus [<xref rid="jvim70029-bib-0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>This study explored the effect of short&#x02010;term omeprazole on the EM of healthy dogs. Similar to some previous human studies, this study found no significant differences in the alpha and beta diversity of the EM across the time points, suggesting no alteration to the EM after omeprazole therapy. Absolute abundance measured by qPCR provides a quantitative measurement of bacterial genes, which also confirmed the lack of changes to the EM after 2&#x02009;weeks of omeprazole therapy. While this is an investigative study, the lack of alteration was unable to prove microbiome&#x02010;associated risk for adverse effects in this cohort. Additional studies are needed in veterinary medicine to corroborate risks of PPI use in veterinary medicine, and rational use is encouraged for correct indications and to avoid overuse [<xref rid="jvim70029-bib-0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>Although there is divided evidence on the influence of PPIs on the EM, and lack of definitive association with pathology, on differential abundance analysis (DEseq2, Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="jvim70029-fig-0006" ref-type="fig">6</xref>) an increase in certain genera (i.e., <italic toggle="yes">Catonella</italic>) contained within the families of Lachnospiraceae and Clostridales, and a reduction in Comamonadaceae family (i.e., <italic toggle="yes">Lampropedia</italic>) was seen on day 15 after PPI therapy.

While there was a shift in some taxa that were significantly different, the overall community remained stable. The relevance of this change is unknown but could still indicate some effect on EM in dogs treated with PPIs.</p><p>There were some limitations to this study. This study looked at a diverse, healthy dog cohort, and while the population contained various breeds, age extremes were avoided to offset any age&#x02010;related influences [<xref rid="jvim70029-bib-0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Most dogs in the study were on a standard commercial diet, so dietary influence was unable to be studied [<xref rid="jvim70029-bib-0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p>Typically, sampling times with the EST are up to an hour in humans [<xref rid="jvim70029-bib-0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The duration of string placement selected was 15&#x02009;min to allow sufficient sampling time with minimal discomfort, given the investigative nature of the study (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="jvim70029-supitem-0004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4</xref>). More recently, shorter durations (15&#x02009;min) appear to be sufficient for esophageal sampling in humans as well (data to be published). In the present study, we utilized pH&#x02010;based identification of the esophageal segment as recommended by the manufacturer. Future studies can include imaging with radio&#x02010;opaque markers on the string or endoscopy to assess the exact location of the string within the esophagus. Oropharyngeal contamination is not seen with the EST in humans [<xref rid="jvim70029-bib-0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. While this approach has not been previously tested in dogs, further studies comparing oropharyngeal microbiota could help confirm its effectiveness in ensuring sample purity in our EST procedure.</p><p>Our study found no significant changes in the esophageal microbiome (EM) after 2&#x02009;weeks of PPI administration. This duration has previously been shown to cause alterations in the gastric and fecal microbiomes of dogs [<xref rid="jvim70029-bib-0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and was therefore expected to be sufficient for detecting changes in the EM as well. However, no such differences were observed. It is possible that the short course of omeprazole used in this study was insufficient to elicit a detectable treatment effect on the EM. Since PPI efficacy depends on binding to active H&#x02009;+&#x02009;&#x02010;K&#x02009;+&#x02009;&#x02010;ATPase enzymes, plasma concentrations are not reliable predictors of drug activity&#x000a0;[<xref rid="jvim70029-bib-0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Instead, the area under the concentration&#x02010;time curve and gastric pH profile are better indicators [<xref rid="jvim70029-bib-0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. We did not measure plasma drug levels in our current study, and the dosing regimen followed validated protocols from previous studies in healthy dogs [<xref rid="jvim70029-bib-0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="jvim70029-bib-0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. PPI therapy might have influenced pH&#x02010;based sampling; however, the esophageal microbiome (EM) obtained in this study differed substantially from the previously reported gastric microbiome in dogs [<xref rid="jvim70029-bib-0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. This distinct difference increases the likelihood that our sampling accurately captured the esophageal microbiome.</p><p>16S&#x02010;rRNA amplicon sequencing was utilized in this study as a rapid and cost&#x02010;effective method for bacterial profiling of the EM in dogs [<xref rid="jvim70029-bib-0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. However, next&#x02010;generation sequencing methods have been shown to have analytical variability and bias between protocols, bioinformatic pipelines, and laboratories, which could influence microbiome sequencing results and their comparisons [<xref rid="jvim70029-bib-0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="jvim70029-bib-0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].
