Extreme temperatures, especially very low and very high temperatures, are known to exacerbate cardiovascular disease burden. With the ongoing global climate change, understanding the impact of non-optimal temperatures on IHD burden becomes increasingly important, especially in vulnerable populations such as the older adult.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>Methods</title><p>This study used data from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021 (GBD 2021) to analyze the spatiotemporal trends of low and high temperatures on IHD burden in the older adult population (aged 60 and above) from 1990 to 2021. We used age-standardized rates (ASR), annual percentage change (EAPC), and the Bayesian age-period-cohort (BAPC) model to forecast 2050. Additionally, the geographic differences in IHD burden were analyzed using World Bank regions.</p></sec><sec id="sec3"><title>Results</title><p>From 1990 to 2021, the IHD burden in the older adult population was mainly attributed to low temperatures. However, it has increased the burden of IHD due to high temperatures, especially in tropical and low-income regions. The analysis of gender difference revealed that men are usually more affected by high temperatures, though generally, women are more sensitive to low temperatures. Forecasts are that in the future, the burden of IHD due to high temperatures will continue to rise, especially in areas with limited adaptive capacity.</p></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Although low temperature remains the most important contributor to IHD burden among the older adult, the burden attributable to high temperature is on the rise, which increases the need to address the extreme temperature fluctuation. That is more so in poor-income and tropical regions where the most vulnerable populations bear a higher risk for health. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop adaptive public health measures against the dual health risks from extreme temperatures. The findings emphasize that targeted interventions are necessary, with adjustments in regional differences and gender-specific risks to effectively address the growing health threats from climate change.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>ischemic heart disease</kwd><kwd>global burden of disease</kwd><kwd>older adult population</kwd><kwd>non-optimal temperatures</kwd><kwd>estimated annual percentage change</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>The author(s) declare that financial support was received for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.

These processes contribute to the narrowing of the coronary arteries, which impairs blood flow and exacerbates the risk of ischemic events (<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). IHD is the leading cause of death in many parts of the world and accounts for much destruction to health and quality of life throughout the world. According to the 2021 study on the Global Burden of Disease, IHD remains one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, with a great burden in low-income and middle-income countries (<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). The main clinical manifestations of IHD are angina, myocardial infarction, and heart failure. In line with aggravation of the disease, there is a growth of risks for patients as far as adverse cardiovascular events, such as myocardial infarction, development of congestive heart failure, and sudden death. A study has shown that patients with IHD have highly significant deterioration in quality of life and huge medical resources used by the patients, hence making burdens larger on an individual and on society. In recent years, the accelerated process of aging worldwide, especially the increasing proportion of people aged 60 and older, has contributed to an increased health burden from IHD. Whereas in 1990 the population aged 60-plus accounted for 9.2% of the total global population, this percentage increased to 11.7% in 2013 and is projected to reach 21.1% by 2050 (<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). As the population ages, the incidence of cardiovascular diseases rises sharply, and the burden of IHD is more pronounced among the older adult. (<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). The burden of IHD is closely linked to traditional risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, smoking, and physical inactivity. However, abnormal temperature exposure has emerged as a new health challenge, significantly impacting the global burden of IHD (<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>).</p><p>With the rising climatic changes due to greenhouse gas emission, the current interest in public health has gained high interest lately. The abnormal rise of the ambient temperature has shown to bring an immense effect on the life of a human species. According to the findings presented in &#x0201c;Lancet Countdown on Climate Change, it is seen as a huge threat to the health consequences to make 21st-century history&#x0201d; (<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Since 1981, the global annual average temperature has risen about 0.18&#x000b0;C per decade (<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). The 2019 global land and sea surface temperature was 0.95&#x000b0;C above the historical average and the second hottest on record (<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Temperature extremes-heatwaves and cold spells-linked to climate change are some of the current major global public health issues (<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Abnormal temperature is generally regarded as a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease, and epidemiological evidence indicates clearly that the extremes of high and low temperatures are strongly associated with cause-specific mortality and morbidity. High temperature can increase the heart workload due to increased blood circulation, heart rate, and blood pressure, which may trigger acute myocardial infarction and other events related to IHD (<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Conversely, low temperatures cause vasoconstriction, increase blood viscosity, and promote thrombosis, further increasing the risk of IHD (<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). As extreme temperature events caused by climate change occur more frequently, the global burden of ischemic heart disease is expected to intensify, particularly under the alternating influence of high and low temperatures, with vulnerable populations (such as the older adult and high-risk patients) facing greater health risks (<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>).</p><p>This study aims to explore the impact of abnormal temperatures on the global burden of ischemic heart disease (IHD) from 1990 to 2021, with a particular focus on gender-specific trends in the older adult population. Based on data from GBD, the regional IHD mortality rates and DALY have been analyzed, its etiological characteristics, and related gender-specific differences both at the global level and based on different regions (of classification by the World Bank). Additionally, we will predict the trend of IHD burden from 2022 to 2050, focusing on the impact of abnormal temperatures on older adult populations, female groups, and high-risk populations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec6"><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec7"><label>2.1</label><title>Data sources</title><p>This study makes use of data from the Global Burden of Disease 2021, estimating the burden of IHD amongst the older adult population (aged above 60&#x0202f;years) by gender, with non-optimal temperatures (both high and low) attributable to it (<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). The data relates to mortality rates, DALYs, and related risk factors specifically for temperature exposure categories: high temperature, low temperature, and suboptimal temperature. The analysis covers the period from 1990 to 2021 and has been stratified by income level using the World Bank&#x02019;s income classification, dividing countries into low, middle, and high-income regions, rather than the regional classification used by the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study. This approach allows for an examination of the differences in IHD burden across these income groups under extreme temperature conditions.</p></sec><sec id="sec8"><label>2.2</label><title>Data cleaning and filtering</title><p>The data was then filtered to include only relevant measures, namely DALYs and rates due to temperature exposure, which were further filtered into high temperature, low temperature, and suboptimal temperature.

Our results indicate that the burden of IHD due to low temperatures has shown a declining trend, particularly in high-income countries, primarily due to advancements in medical technology and enhanced climate adaptation capabilities. However, the burden of IHD caused by high-temperature exposure has shown a continuous upward trend worldwide, especially in low- and middle-income countries. Climate change has intensified the frequency and severity of heatwaves, posing an increasingly severe health threat, especially to the older adult population (<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>).</p><p>Particularly, in countries with high incomes, the IHD burden due to low temperatures has been reduced, while health risks from high-temperature exposure have increased incrementally (<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). This has been linked with improved health infrastructure and better adaptation to climatic changes in such regions. However, in the low-income and middle-income countries, this is not so. In the context of global rising temperatures, the burden of IHD due to high-temperature exposure has been growing year by year, especially in tropical and subtropical areas like sub-Saharan Africa and Southeastern Asia, where extreme heat events have become an emerging health threat (<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>).</p><p>It is also important to notice the significant role played by gender and age differences on the IHD burden. While the burden in the male population is higher under exposure to high temperature, females experience more significant burdens under low-temperature exposure. This can be attributed to biological differences such as fat distribution and hormone levels (<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Specifically, women are less adaptable to low temperatures, while men experience a higher cardiovascular burden in high-temperature environments due to typically higher heart rates and blood pressure. Particularly in Eastern Europe, Russia, and other cold regions, the IHD mortality rate and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) in female populations under low-temperature exposure have increased more significantly. For the older adult population, especially those aged 80 and above, the burden of IHD due to both low and high-temperature exposure is even more severe, presenting a major public health challenge for the global older adult population.</p><p>According to future projections, from 2022 to 2050, the IHD burden caused by non-optimal temperatures in the older adult population is expected to continue increasing, especially in female older adult populations. It is anticipated that high-temperature exposure will further exacerbate the IHD health burden. This trend emphasizes the long-term impact of global temperature rise and the important role of gender and age in health risks. However, while the BAPC model is suitable for projecting long-term impacts, under extreme climate change scenarios, the model&#x02019;s assumptions may affect the accuracy of the projections, mainly in terms of the incompleteness of data for some low-income countries (<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>).</p><p>Therefore, to mitigate the IHD burden, especially in low- and middle-income countries, there is a global need to strengthen climate adaptation efforts, improve public health policies, and implement intervention measures targeting the older adult population. The extreme temperature-related public health strategy in low-income regions should involve providing cooling facilities, health monitoring systems, and early warning systems. Furthermore, enhancement of basic healthcare infrastructure and better health management of older adult populations would help reduce the impact of extreme temperature on IHD burden. Besides, personalized health response strategies are needed to cope with changes in different climate zones and population characteristics toward a healthy society under climate change.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec19"><label>5</label><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study describes the global burden of IHD due to non-optimal temperature, both low and high, from 1990 to 2021, describing the disparate impacts of low and high temperatures on cardiovascular health. Low-temperature-related IHD has shown a declining trend worldwide since 1990, especially in high-income countries, where the adverse health effects of low-temperature exposure have gradually dropped with improvement in climate adaptation capacity and medical technology. However, the burden of IHD due to high-temperature exposure has continued to increase throughout the world, especially in the low- and middle-income countries where the increase in extreme climate events has exposed the older adult population to higher health risks.</p><p>Moreover, there is a clear difference in the burden of IHD from the perspective of gender and age. High-temperature exposure increases the burden among males, while in females, it increases during low-temperature exposure. The most severe burdens under both low- and high-temperature exposures were seen in the aged, particularly aged 80-plus years, thus reflecting a long-term health consequence of global climate change in the older adult population.</p><p>With the continuous increase in global temperatures, it is estimated that by 2050, the burden of IHD will continue to increase, especially the burden caused by high-temperature exposure. In view of this challenge, targeted measures should be taken by the whole world to enhance climate adaptation and guarantee the health of the older adult. The most important role that low- and middle-income countries can play in this context is to frame policies on public health, infrastructure, and health interventions regarding the older adult that would minimize the risk to health due to climate change.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We extend our gratitude to the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation for providing access to the valuable Global Burden of Disease (GBD) data.</p></ack><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="sec20"><title>Data availability statement</title><p>The original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/<xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary material</xref>, further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding authors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="ethics-statement" id="sec21"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>The GBD 2021 dataset utilized in this study is publicly available and anonymized, and no additional ethical approval was required for this study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="author-contributions" id="sec22"><title>Author contributions</title><p>LL: Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Writing &#x02013; original draft.
