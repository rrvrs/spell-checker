Many people need to contribute to systems leadership by collaborating to harness the skills of actors across government and outside of government. At times, this proposition is vague and it is difficult to know who should change or what to do. We searched the academic and grey literature for further advice on how to foster effective systems leadership.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We conducted a qualitative systematic review (2024) of peer reviewed journal articles (Web of Science) and grey literature reports (Policy Commons, Overton). Each text had to inform advice on systems leadership. We used an immersive inductive approach to identify key sources of ideas, highlight common themes, and relate the results to insights from policy theories.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>84 texts met the inclusion criteria (39 Web of Science, 34 Policy Commons, 11 Overton), then we included 80 snowballed academic and grey references (total 164). Some relate leadership to complexity theory, but most provide broad accounts of systems leadership that emphasise decentralisation and collaboration. These accounts describe high aspirations and essential skills but limited evidence from activity. Nevertheless, this literature helps us produce a coherent synthesis of common insights and advice on how to foster systems leadership.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>We identify key features of systems leadership: reject heroic top-down leadership and central control in favour of collaboration across boundaries; develop attributes (e.g. humility), mindsets (e.g. big picture), and skills (e.g. facilitation) to act in complex systems (albeit without a common view on what a complex system is); and, seek organisational and political support for this approach. Some accounts identify barriers to systems leadership and negative experiences, while others redefine such obstacles as learning opportunities.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>Plain language summary</title><p>&#x02018;Systems leadership&#x02019; describes collective action towards a common goal: harnessing the energy of many, and spanning boundaries across policy sectors or outside government. There is not &#x02013; and should not be &#x02013; a single centre of authority. Old ideas of heroic leaders are not useful when facing new reality. Policy problems are &#x02018;wicked&#x02019;. Leadership takes place in a complex policymaking system where outcomes emerge in the absence of central control, prompting collaboration to face uncertainty and ambiguity. Systems leadership requires attributes such as humility, and new mindsets and skills to foster collaboration.</p><p>This description is more aspirational and conceptual than empirical. Most describe why there should be systems leadership. Some describe its advantages (such as more effective or equitable policymaking) and what key elements would look like. Many highlight a lack of applications and the difficulty of evaluating success.</p><p>There is debate about how to describe the role and influence of systems leaders: to be humble about the limits to their influence (the new mindset), or to show their disproportionate value (to demonstrate their benefits to sceptical audiences).</p><p>There is doubt about the novelty of systems leadership. One story is of radically new ways to understand the world, to reject reductionist approaches to science and rationalist approaches to policymaking. Another is of connections to other collaborative approaches emphasising adaptability to fluid contexts and making sure that stakeholders and citizens are involved.</p><p>Part of these doubts come from the vagueness of concepts such as leadership, complex systems, mindsets, and collaboration. &#x02018;Systems leadership&#x02019; can mean too much and therefore too little. Its ambiguity has initial value &#x02013; to bring in actors with similar aims and values &#x02013; but carries the potential for disenchantment if actors find few clear benefits. Systems leaderships enthusiasts offer tangible ways to address this challenge and reframe it as an opportunity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>policy</kwd><kwd>policymaking</kwd><kwd>governance</kwd><kwd>systems leadership</kwd><kwd>complexity theory</kwd><kwd>wicked problems</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund-1" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100018693"><funding-source>Horizon Europe Framework Programme</funding-source><award-id>101137207</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>This project has received funding from the European Union&#x02019;s Horizon Europe research and innovation programme under grant agreement No [101137207](Healthy Working environments for all Ages: An evidence-driven framework [WAge]). </funding-statement><funding-statement>

<xref rid="ref-38" ref-type="bibr">Cairney &#x00026; Toomey, 2024a</xref>). It extends our search for usable evidence to inform advice on how to improve policymaking, while recognising that the idea of more effective policymaking is vague and contested. The core starting point for each review is the frequent rejection by policy scholars of &#x02018;an old story of elite policy analysis and centralised authority&#x02019; in favour of collaboration (2024a: 4). The new story argues that:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>A &#x02018;single centre of government to coordinate policymaking&#x02019; is not
<italic toggle="yes">possible</italic>, given the limits to the coordinative resources of policymakers, or
<italic toggle="yes">desirable</italic>, at least in liberal democracies seeking to distribute powers and responsibilities.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Policy problems are too complex to be amenable to simple agreed-upon solutions. They &#x02018;do not respect traditional government boundaries, and require collaborative responses across government and between governmental and non-governmental actors&#x02019;</p></list-item><list-item><p>If policymaking responsibilities are distributed across political systems, we need new ways to improve &#x02018;collaboration to foster policy coherence and policymaking integration&#x02019;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Our response to this dilemma needs to recognise two reference points: aspirational stories of how policymaking should work, and research-informed stories of policymaking reality (2024a: 8&#x02013;10, drawing on
<xref rid="ref-33" ref-type="bibr">Cairney, 2024a</xref>).</p></list-item></list><p>We draw on academic and grey literatures to seek advice from scholars and practitioners on how to connect systems leadership to this agenda. We relate systems leadership advice to stories of &#x02018;how people want policymaking to work, and how it really works&#x02019; (
<xref rid="ref-38" ref-type="bibr">Cairney &#x00026; Toomey, 2024a</xref>: 4). Aspirational stories relate leadership to requirements: to work together to improve government and democracy. Policy theory-informed studies focus on how policymaking works, to identify a gap between requirement and reality, and provoke discussion of how to respond. Combined, these stories create different demands on new advice, to inform aspiration and realistic assessment.</p><p>We described our first search for advice - on collaborative policymaking - as akin to seeking a needle in a haystack, since too few scholars and practitioners define this term far less give concrete advice. There are more grounds for optimism with &#x02018;systems leadership&#x02019; since scholars engage frequently and thoughtfully with its meaning, albeit while not defining leadership or producing a common definition of complex systems. Most definitional work begins by describing what systems leadership does
<italic toggle="yes">not</italic> mean, to signal a shift from old conceptions of charismatic individuals. It challenges a top-down model of &#x02018;hero leadership&#x02019; (
<xref rid="ref-112" ref-type="bibr">Mangan &#x00026; Lawrence-Pietroni, 2019</xref>) that: praises exceptional people at the top of organisations, describes the need for strong leaders to make hard decisions authoritatively and for their followers to carry them out, and expects to find a clear line between decisions from the top and outcomes at the bottom (
<xref rid="ref-9" ref-type="bibr">Avolio
<italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). In its place is a focus on collaboration between many actors and organisations, to reflect the complex nature of policy problems (and policymaking processes) that are not solvable by one leader or organisation and require collective action &#x02018;among different organizations, sectors, and even countries&#x02019; (
<xref rid="ref-152" ref-type="bibr">Senge
<italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>). This narrative returns us to the aspiration of &#x02018;collaborative policymaking&#x02019; then introduces concepts &#x02018;such as collaborative, distributed, dispersed, collective and systems leadership&#x02019; that might help (
<xref rid="ref-112" ref-type="bibr">Mangan &#x00026; Lawrence-Pietroni, 2019</xref>: 83).</p><p>In that context, we continue our search for &#x02018;pragmatic advice that offers hope for individual and collective responses but tempered by engagement in a system over which they do not have full understanding or control&#x02019; (
<xref rid="ref-38" ref-type="bibr">Cairney &#x00026; Toomey, 2024a</xref>: 4). We continue to &#x02018;cast our net as widely as possible, to search for any potentially relevant advice&#x02019;, including &#x02018;aspirational advice&#x02019; on what good systems leadership might look like, and &#x02018;pragmatic and context-specific accounts of what worked, for whom, and in what context&#x02019;. If a study used the phrase &#x02018;systems leadership&#x02019;, and offered or informed advice, we reviewed its findings. Further, since there is clearly a collection of terms that inform similar ideas, we snowball from included texts to explore connected approaches (including complexity leadership or complex systems leadership) and the extent to which they share the same origin story or reference points.</p><p>We summarise the wide range of advice sheltering under the umbrella term &#x02018;systems leadership&#x02019; (Results) then synthesise these findings to produce themes relevant to collaborative policymaking (Discussion). As with the first review, we find no support for a blueprint, not least because the emphasis is on agile and flexible leadership (
<xref rid="ref-112" ref-type="bibr">Mangan &#x00026; Lawrence-Pietroni, 2019</xref>), which makes &#x02018;the search for a uniform how-to-guide for collaborative policymaking &#x02026; a fool&#x02019;s errand&#x02019; (
<xref rid="ref-38" ref-type="bibr">Cairney &#x00026; Toomey, 2024a</xref>: 5). Still, it makes sense to identify a small number of practices associated with positive stories of systems leadership, including the need to collaborate across boundaries, develop attributes, mindsets, and skills to act in complex systems and seek organisational and political support for this approach.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Our aim is to produce connected reviews using a consistent method of qualitative systematic review. As such, the following description draws heavily on
<xref rid="ref-38" ref-type="bibr">Cairney and Toomey (2024a)</xref>, which adapts
<xref rid="ref-101" ref-type="bibr">Kuckertz and Block&#x02019;s (2021)</xref> guidance on describing systematic reviews then describes our response to key limitations.</p><p>
<italic toggle="yes">Rationale</italic>. We seek to understand advice on how to improve policymaking with reference to systems leadership, as part of a wider focus on effective collaboration. We present the second review for the Horizon Europe project
<italic toggle="yes">Healthy Working environments for all Ages: An evidence-driven framework</italic> (WAge). WAge&#x02019;s Work Package 1 seeks to support collaborative policymaking to foster the uptake of usable evidence, which requires us to understand how collaborative policy processes or initiatives work. Further, our WP1 explores the idea that policy may change from the &#x02018;top down&#x02019; or &#x02018;bottom up&#x02019;, and systems leadership informs both dynamics.</p><p>
<italic toggle="yes">Engagement with previous reviews</italic>. Cairney leads a team conducting a series of qualitative systematic reviews that connect key aims or strategies to policy theory insights (
<xref rid="ref-42" ref-type="bibr">Cairney

<italic toggle="yes">Research/guiding questions</italic>. Our most general guiding question was: What advice do scholars and practitioners offer on systems leadership? We used these sub-questions to guide our initial search and reflection:</p><list list-type="simple"><list-item><label>1. </label><p>How many studies use the term &#x02018;systems leadership&#x02019; to describe their object of study?</p></list-item><list-item><label>2. </label><p>How do they describe systems leadership? For example, do authors describe their pursuit of better leadership and how to do it, or study efforts in organisations relevant to policy (e.g. governments)?</p></list-item><list-item><label>3. </label><p>What factors do they describe as constraining or facilitating systems leadership?</p></list-item><list-item><label>4. </label><p>In what context does this pursuit of systems leadership take place? For example, within one government or across multiple levels? Across policy sectors? To foster collaboration between government and non-governmental actors?</p></list-item><list-item><label>5. </label><p>What findings or recommendations do they provide?</p></list-item><list-item><label>6. </label><p>To what extent are these lessons transferable to other contexts?</p></list-item></list><p>We anticipated that each included text would define systems leadership (to some extent) then offer at least one of three kinds of advice:</p><list list-type="simple"><list-item><label>1. </label><p>Aspirational: what would good systems leadership look like?</p></list-item><list-item><label>2. </label><p>General: what context-free advice do people give to foster systems leadership?</p></list-item><list-item><label>3. </label><p>Context-specific: what works, for whom, and in what context, and what lessons are transferable to other contexts? While the wording is resonant with realist review, we did not expect to find enough information to review in that way (based on our previous experiences).</p></list-item></list><p>
<italic toggle="yes">Databases and initial search terms</italic>. We began by searching for advice from one main database of peer reviewed academic texts (Web of Science, WOS) and two of the grey literature, including government, non-governmental organisation, academic and think tank reports (comparing Policy Commons, PC and Overton). We used the search term &#x02018;systems leadership&#x02019;, anticipating that it would (1) maximise coverage among texts using this term and require a high level of manual searching (which was inevitable, given our need to search manually for advice), and (2) provide partial coverage of relevant work using different terminology. We address the latter with an unusually high amount of snowballing (almost half of our total texts) to seek key sources for this field and identify some strongly connected terms (e.g. complexity leadership) while considering separate reviews for other terms (e.g. see
<xref rid="ref-270" ref-type="bibr">Aoki
<italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2024</xref> on whole of government approaches). We learned from our previous review that the addition of multiple academic databases would have rapidly decreasing returns compared to snowballing. Our initial experience with WOS and PC/Overton suggested that further broad searches would be a poor use of resources, and we found that snowballing helped to identify key academic (e.g.
<xref rid="ref-152" ref-type="bibr">Senge
<italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>) and grey sources (e.g.
<xref rid="ref-73" ref-type="bibr">Ghate
<italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2013a</xref>;
<xref rid="ref-273" ref-type="bibr">Ghate

<italic toggle="yes">Timeliness</italic>. We ran searches up to 10 July 2024 (WOS), 1
<sup>st</sup> July (PC) and 8th July (Overton).</p><p>
<italic toggle="yes">Manual searches and choices regarding initial inclusion</italic>. We used similar criteria for inclusion as our other four reviews, including publication in English and not restricting initial inclusion in relation to research method (we focused more on relevance). Our preference was to set an initially low inclusion bar to be able to immerse ourselves in the literature, identify the relevance of texts, and generate a narrative of the field to help to make sense of advice. We followed
<xref rid="ref-38" ref-type="bibr">Cairney and Toomey (2024a)</xref> to remove the need for a grey literature report to engage with policy concepts to be included (previous reviews examined levels of conceptual engagement).</p><p>Toomey conducted a manual search of each text in a two-stage process to include texts that: (1) referred to the phrase &#x02018;systems leadership&#x02019; (or close equivalent, such as system or complexity leadership) in the title, abstract, and/ or introduction, and (2) offered advice in the main text (or information to support advice, such as if describing the effectiveness of collaboration strategies) (

PC skewed to Canada (12/34), New Zealand (8), UK (6), US (4), Australia (2), which accounted for 32/34 or 94% (plus one European Commission and 1 Spain).

<italic toggle="yes">Sectors or issues</italic>. Some specific issues are discussed frequently: health and social care integration in England (academic, government agency, and think tank publications), and education improvement in Canada (the numbers are misleading because Ontario&#x02019;s Institute for Educational Leadership published many small documents). Beyond these examples, most studies related generally to issues such as the need for new forms of training, professional practice, advice for leaders, or organisational changes to support systems leadership (which made precise % coding difficult).</p></list-item><list-item><p>
<italic toggle="yes">Methods or approaches</italic>. WOS articles (39) included qualitative interview (10), case study (8), discussion or conceptual analysis (7), literature review (5), mixed methods (4) and miscellaneous approaches (e.g. describing online training or simulation). Too few PC or Overton studies describe methods to justify further analysis here (although many think tank reports offer new data based on elite interview).</p></list-item><list-item><p>
<italic toggle="yes">Definitions</italic>. Too few articles provide a clear definition of systems leadership to justify further analysis here.</p></list-item></list><p>
<italic toggle="yes">Data analysis, aggregation, and presentation</italic>. As with previous reviews, Cairney used an inductive qualitative approach to analyse each text, generate themes manually (Results), and synthesise advice from the results (Results and Discussion). As each previous review notes, &#x02018;the rules associated with this method are less prescriptive than with its quantitative equivalent, suggesting that we (a) describe each key judgement, and (b) foster respect for each authors methods and aims&#x02019; (
<xref rid="ref-36" ref-type="bibr">Cairney &#x00026; Kippin, 2022</xref>, citing
<xref rid="ref-148" ref-type="bibr">Sandelowski &#x00026; Barroso, 2007</xref>: xv). We did not perform any quantitative tests to assess risk of bias. We present a narrative systematic review (rather than qualitative coding aided by tests for inter-coder reliability).</p><sec><title>Limitations relevant to data gathering and analysis</title><p>The nature of our task
<italic toggle="yes">and limitations to our search</italic> influence our approach to data analysis and presentation. We identified five limitations in our first review (
<xref rid="ref-38" ref-type="bibr">Cairney &#x00026; Toomey, 2024a</xref>: 7), which we use to identify fewer limitations with the current review. First, although few authors define systems leadership, it is not used as loosely as &#x02018;collaborative policymaking&#x02019;. We were able to synthesise these texts to provide a broad definition with commonly described elements (Results). The more relevant limitation relates to our focus on
<italic toggle="yes">systems</italic> leadership which highlights other leadership approaches (e.g. distributed) but without presenting a full review. Second, while many studies shelter under the same umbrella term, the systems leadership literature is less disparate, and authors show how it relates to other leadership terms. Third, the systems leadership literature is more likely to offer advice, such as to recommend new training for leadership skills. Fourth, while our grey literature searches produced a low ratio of effort to reward, our larger snowballing activity helped to reveal a useful common reference to key grey texts (the 80 snowballed texts was almost as large as the 84 texts included from searches). Further, the PC/Overton process helped to reach a sense of saturation (after WOS snowballing, few new OC or Overton texts gave us additional information or insights). Fifth, while much research identifies what we don&#x02019;t know, a key message from systems leadership scholars is to embrace such uncertainty. Overall, the available research is better matched to our task than in our first review.</p><p>As with the first review, we respond in three ways: keeping the bar for inclusion low to encourage immersion in the field; snowballing to identify from key reference points, primarily by following up studies described in included texts as important sources (plus some texts from expert recommendations); and, making it explicit when we present our synthesis of insights and offer our interpretation of practical advice. This immersive approach threw up some curveballs (e.g.

Many boundaries have been constructed to serve a purpose (such as to assign resources to a well-defined organisation or aim) and endure regardless of efforts to cross them (2013: 13). Actors tell different stories about why they seek to cross boundaries, including to: foster coordination across organisations, manage the unintended consequences of creating boundaries (including policy incoherence or policymaking fragmentation), deal with complex problems that do not respect boundaries associated with government departments or policy sectors, foster &#x02018;synergies&#x02019; between actors and organisations, and pool resources to work more effectively or produce better value (2013: 13&#x02013;23). They may also pursue informal cooperation on an ad hoc or regular basis, and/or formalised coordination to &#x02018;join up&#x02019; policy or create new networks subject to incentives and performance measures to oblige cooperation (2013: 23&#x02013;36).</p><p>For example, included texts describe actors working in &#x02018;complex, multi-player environments&#x02019; (

<xref rid="ref-95" ref-type="bibr">Hunter, 2009</xref>: 203). Here, political skills combine with tenacity to not lose enthusiasm following policy failure when dealing with &#x02018;wicked issues&#x02019; (

For example, the language of systems and leadership is prevalent in aspects of Canadian education/ schools policy (albeit used generally with little mention of complexity theory). Here, the context is of school and student performance, where short-term goals for students matter, and the balance of accountability (e.g. between students, teachers, schools, and government) can be high stakes and contested (compare with

For others, it reflects the co-option of a yet another new term to maintain old aims: the delivery of top-down policies by systems leaders, or the mild impetus to do things differently without addressing imbalances of power (e.g. national-local, senior-junior, health-other, or practitioner-citizen) (2020: 34).

Collaboration may begin by coming together to establish a common vision and moral purpose, such as to facilitate more effective and equitable systems, then working together to share responsibility for its delivery. Throughout, the systems mindset involves focusing on the big picture of systemic dynamics and looking for opportunities to facilitate systems change (while being realistic about the impact of individual action). Given the value of collaboration, and the need to respond to profound uncertainty, the aim is not to assign responsibility for a small group of exceptional leaders, able to unlock systems to leverage disproportionate change. Rather, the mindset is of facilitating conversation, being curious and open-minded enough to consider multiple perspectives, and to learn from others, aided by systems leadership tools.</p></sec><sec><title>A sophisticated understanding of wicked problems and policymaking complexity</title><p>A systems mindset is essential to address complex policy problems and processes. Most of the world&#x02019;s most urgent and important policy problems are &#x02018;wicked&#x02019;, or not amenable to technocratic policy analysis and simple solutions by one centre of government. Rather, many policy actors &#x02013; across governments and inside/outside of government &#x02013; need to collaborate to generate a common understanding of problems and how to respond. This action takes place in complex systems that defy our full understanding far less control. Systems dynamics include: the same actions or ideas can be magnified or dampened; the appearance of regular patterns of behaviour belies the potential for major disruptions; and, outcomes emerging in the absence of central control. A systems mindset includes the need to anticipate such dynamics, get comfortable with uncertainty and ambiguity, and seek windows of opportunity to support systems change.</p></sec><sec><title>Systems leadership capacity</title><p>This new approach needs to be adopted by many people across systems, necessitating a profound boost to capacity. It requires the identification and communication of key principles of systems leadership, and essential roles and competencies, and to value relational attributes such as humility, self-reflection and awareness, empathy, and compassion. It requires skills training to: meaningfully delegate and enable many others (while making sure that everyone has a clear sense of purpose), facilitate collaborative discussion and action, generate new ways to evaluate and account for collective action, balance creative tension and conflict, and work effectively in political systems to navigate the political beliefs and tensions that may undermine collective action.</p></sec><sec><title>A supportive architecture</title><p>This new approach needs continuous and substantive political and organisational support to generate a systems leadership culture: giving people the time and space to train, develop, and learn; using accountability and performance management measures that encourage people to innovate and take risks then learn from trial-and-error (rather than blaming individuals for failure); and generating then maintaining a common vision or focus (such as to foster equitable policy processes and outcomes and/or focus on &#x02018;place&#x02019;) to concentrate collaborative efforts and identify agreed practices and aspirations.</p></sec><sec><title>Innovation and learning</title><p>For some, the value of systems leadership is self-evident or an attractive leap of faith, backed by learning from personal experience and shared stories of facing or overcoming challenges. For others, the ideas seem vague and aspirational without being backed by &#x02018;hard&#x02019; evidence of its real-world value. For all, the role of generating and sharing evidence is essential, to help its advocates learn from good practices, and demonstrate to other audiences that the shift in approach will produce tangible benefits.</p></sec><sec><title>Are these features merely aspirational or achievable?</title><p>It is straightforward to produce a coherent account of aspirational systems leadership but not to demonstrate its progress or achievability. We find many stories of a shift in thinking among a growing group of scholars and practitioners, but without demonstrating that it has taken off in the governments or networks where these ideas would be used. There is more written on what systems leaders should do than how to do it (
<xref rid="ref-15" ref-type="bibr">Begg, 2020</xref>: 16&#x02013;17). We find lists of what is required of policy actors facing wicked problems and policymaking complexity, accompanied by hopes for the greater effectiveness and equity of this approach, but limited evidence of the payoffs. The vague aspirational language of systems leadership exacerbates the problem: how can we demonstrate the benefits of this approach when we are not sure what it is, or how to do it? The problem grows when we see what is required to support systems leadership. The literature adds up to a shopping list of attributes, skills, strategies, principles, competences, or roles required to produce sufficient systems leadership capacity. This literature has produced the potential to create the world&#x02019;s longest leadership training course, bolstered by the maxim that any barrier to systems leadership is an opportunity to train and learn. Finally, the problem peaks when we read reflective accounts of limited progress. Some reflect that the reasons to adopt systems leadership also explain its barriers: power hoarding by central governments, the fragmentation of government or governance, and competition between organisations (or siloed action) contribute to a policymaking environment that is not conducive to new forms of collaboration or rewarding of new ways of thinking and acting (
<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>One frequent &#x02013; and reasonable &#x02013; response is to flip this narrative to describe systemic barriers as a justification for systems leadership. Further, there is also considerable evidence of progress to justify some investment in a new approach. However, these case studies of success come largely in the form of external testimonies about exceptional individuals (e.g.
<xref rid="ref-152" ref-type="bibr">Senge
<italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2015</xref> on Nelson Mandela) or the personal testimonies of systems leaders who have bought into the process (e.g.
<xref rid="ref-187" ref-type="bibr">Wenger-Trayner &#x00026; Wenger-Trayner, 2021</xref>). Further, in very few real-world accounts can we find a clear connection between the authors&#x02019; conception of complex systems and the effectiveness of a systems leadership response (one exception is by
<xref rid="ref-109" ref-type="bibr">Lichtenstein and Plowman (2009)</xref> who recognise the limitations of their small-n approach). Rather, at that stage of reflection on progress, the idea of a system becomes vague and metaphorical and the focus returns to the competencies and actions of policy actors. Whether or not we need the initial narrative of systems thinking &#x02013; translating insights from complexity theory &#x02013; to help inform or explain this action remains an open question (see also
<xref rid="ref-97" ref-type="bibr">Jackson, 2024</xref>: 32 on the incoherence of complexity theory when it connects to so many ideas). Overall, we find an approach to leadership with limited clarity that is not congruent with governance routines and lacks professional, organisational, and systemic capacity (which might be described by systems leadership advocates as a challenge worth facing).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This paper presents our second review to synthesise academic and practitioner insights to offer pragmatic advice to policymakers seeking more effective collaborative policymaking. We relate this advice to a story of policy and policymaking complexity in which policy problems
<italic toggle="yes">require</italic> meaningful collaboration by actors spread across multiple organisations and policy sectors but may struggle to secure meaningful collective action. The first review found two kinds of aspirational advice, relating collaboration to &#x02018;rationalist policy processes and the protection of democratic ideals&#x02019; (
<xref rid="ref-38" ref-type="bibr">Cairney &#x00026; Toomey, 2024a</xref>: 22). Here, we found a rejection of rationalist or technocratic ambitions as part of the systems leadership origin story. This story combines elements of many new approaches to leadership with a focus on complex systems. Here, the main aspirations are for a more inclusive and democratic collaboration in which leadership is spread across organisations and policymaking systems. It is sometimes accompanied by a sense of realism about what can be done in relation to wicked problems in policy processes that are not conducive to power distribution and collaboration.</p><p>We summarise our interpretation of useful advice as follows:</p><list list-type="simple"><list-item><label>1. </label><p>

Rather, think of systems leadership scholarship and practice as an ongoing dialogue in which there is often productive debate about how to conceptualise and respond to complexity. First, when reflecting on complexity theory, some: emphasise the need for humility in the absence of certainty or control; or seek to identify levers for disproportionate change and inspire others with stories of success. Second, when reflecting on progress so far, some tell: dispirited stories of low clarity on what systems leadership is, low congruence with business-as-usual governance, and low capacity to make a difference in fragmented policymaking systems; or, inspirational tales of individual success and opportunities for systems change. In other words, for its advocates, the limited translation of systems leadership ideas into real-world practice is a reason to redouble efforts to turn barriers into opportunities and potential into reality.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and consent</title><p>Ethical approval and consent were not required.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>No data associated with this article.</p><sec><title>Extended data</title><p>Open Science Framework: Systems leadership</p><p>This project contains the following extended data:</p><p>- Structured bibliography Qualitative Systematic Review

It focusses specifically on the application of systems leadership in government policymaking and hence may be less relevant/applicable to those seeking to apply systems leadership in other contexts, such as the role of activist groups (e.g. Extinction Rebellion or Occupy) in mobilising social change and/or global partnerships and collaboration (such as the UN Sustainable Development Goals). This is not a problem but could be spelt out more clearly in the abstract, introduction and discussion/conclusion so that readers are clear about the aims and limits of the review.</p><p> Whilst the methodology is well presented, the basis on which articles/outputs were excluded from the review (1,460 at initial screening and 260 at subsequent screening) could be explained more clearly (see Figure 1). It would also be useful to say a bit more about what you mean by a &#x02018;narrative systematic review&#x02019; (p6) and to include citations if there was a particular approach that guided your work.</p><p> The findings and analysis section of the review is comprehensive and well presented, although there are places where there are long lists of bullet points, which can be difficult to work through. Where there are repeated bulleted lists (e.g. p16-18) consider how they could be condensed and/or summarised with a connecting paragraph.</p><p> There are a few places where authors are cited who have used/summarised particular ideas rather than original sources &#x02013; e.g. Edmonstone on the quote from the Leadership Centre (p11), Waring et al. rather than Hartley and colleagues on political astuteness (p19), Talley &#x00026; Hull rather than Drath et al. on DAC (p19). There are also a few areas where certain references/sources seem to be missing &#x02013; e.g. Ernst and Chrobot-Mason (and CCL more generally) on boundary spanning leadership (p15) and Jean Hartley and colleagues on political astuteness (p19). Overall, however, these are fairly minor omissions given the scale and rather fragmented nature of the literature covered.</p><p> The discussion provides a useful synthesis of insights, as captured in Table 5. I&#x02019;m a little unsure, however, what the authors are getting at in the final sentence, which sounds rather dismissive of the potential application of systems leadership in policymaking, and I suggest that this is reviewed/revised if needed. The conclusion provides a good summary of the article, although the list of bullet points could perhaps be condensed/integrated. I also wonder if the authors have any suggestions for future research in this area and/or limitations to the generalisability of findings to other contexts, countries, issues, etc.?</p><p> Overall, this is a useful contribution to the literature on systems leadership that should be of value to academics, educators and practitioners as well as policymakers.</p><p>Are sufficient details of the methods and analysis provided to allow replication by others?</p><p>Yes</p><p>Are the rationale for, and objectives of, the Systematic Review clearly stated?</p><p>Yes</p><p>Is the statistical analysis and its interpretation appropriate?</p><p>Yes</p><p>Are the conclusions drawn adequately supported by the results presented in the review?</p><p>Yes</p><p>Reviewer Expertise:</p><p>Leadership</p><p>I confirm that I have read this submission and believe that I have an appropriate level of expertise to confirm that it is of an acceptable scientific standard.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reviewer-report" id="report49656"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.21956/openreseurope.20542.r49656</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer response for version 1</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Waring</surname><given-names>Justin</given-names></name><xref rid="r49656a1" ref-type="aff">1</xref><role>Referee</role></contrib><aff id="r49656a1">

As with the other reviews in this set, it shows greater robustness of method, excellent interpretative skills, and solid recommendations/advice for practitioners and scholars. Below I have some comments and reflections, offered in the spirit of constructive feedback, and I acknowledge that not all are necessarily relevant for this particular review.</p><p> The introduction might locate the concept and trend in a wider context beyond public policy, including the wider literature on leadership and system leadership found in the business and management literature. This could consider related concepts such as distributed leadership and shared leadership (I see these are mentioned later in the results).</p><p> I&#x000a0; very much like the premise of the carrying out these reviews and idea of distilling from the literature advice to inform better policymaking, especially as it does not aim to offer a how-to guide. There is, however, a slight (and probably irrelevant) concern in how this is presented and then becomes translated in &#x02018;what advice do scholars and practitioners offer on system leadership?&#x02019;</p><p> My thinking is as follows - advice might be generally seen as the giving of insight and recommendations; the advice offered in individual source materials might not always be be advice for policy or practitioners, but rather other scholars or researchers relevant to their broader academic debates; it might not be advice rather argument and analysis; and arguably these people might offer different advice for different audiences, such as theoretical advancement; and more importantly the insights developed through this particular review are the result of the interpretative work and synthesis of the authors. So the framing might be better: what advice can this review offer based upon the work of scholars and practitioners&#x02019;.</p><p> In terms of methods, did the screening and selection process involve any form of checking or validation with inter-rater validation, e.g Kappa score. If not this migth be a limitation.</p><p> In the first section of the findings, I would like to know more about where the different source materials were located, specifically the types of journals, the disciplinary fields they originated from and the types of conversations they were having - for example there is a difference between the management journal, a health service journal and a political science report in terms of the rationale for the output.</p><p> Looking closer at some of the ideas addressed under the section on &#x02018;what is systems leadership&#x02019; I was also left wondering whether a related question(s) might be &#x02018;when&#x02019; is systems leadership (or when not) and &#x02018;how&#x02019; - meaning that there is something in the literature (implicitly) about that differentiates system leadership also in terms of when it is needed, how it is practices as much as what it involves. This comes through in the following section on wicked problems but I wonder if it goes beyond the problem framing to other factors such as number and diversity of actors involved? But I wonder whether offering a slighting different reading in what of what, when and how might offer additional insight?</p><p> Another interesting line of think, from Keith Grint - is something around the emotional aspect of system leadership - and perhaps leadership more generally? This then made be think about system leadership as an embodied practice is different from other forms of leadership?</p><p> I would encourage greater critical reflection on the idea that systems leadership is more democratic and effective. This section rightly notes that this line stems from the more enthusiastic advocates, but there is limited evidence to these claims and in fact it is entirely plausible that the opposite could be true - in that system leadership works in non-democratic ways through the the more nefarious manipulation of the system.</p><p> The section on the wider debates on leadership is useful but it is also quite dense and covers a vast literature and series of debates but in ways that perhaps does not do justice to the ideas and debates associated with terms like distributed, collective, plural, shared leadership etc. I am not sure that this can be resolved but so maybe a more explicit caveat might help?</p><p> The section that delves into the different requirements is excellent and nicely summarises a complex literature. One dimension that seemed subsumed in this review, but seemed central to our work on political skill, was around self- and positional awareness - i.e. being aware of one&#x02019;s presentation and reception, and adaptive to the reactions of others; AND being aware of one&#x02019;s social position relative to others - after all system leadership does not evolve from a blank canvas but emerges from a rich fabric of pre-existing hierarchies and social networks.</p><p> The concluding sections offer a very clear and robust summary of the literature with some clear guidance on what system leadership might involve and how it can be enacted.&#x000a0; One final thought, I was left thinking whether there was a time we might move on from system leadership - what next - how can we move to a more stabilised and less complex environment, or does systems leadership recreate the need for itself - as a type of self-fulfilling prophecy?</p><p> Very minor point, it is stated that the review is focused on policy making but it might also mention policy implementation and service delivery, especially since system leadership spans the formulation and implementation processes.</p><p>Are sufficient details of the methods and analysis provided to allow replication by others?</p><p>Yes</p><p>Are the rationale for, and objectives of, the Systematic Review clearly stated?</p><p>Yes</p><p>Is the statistical analysis and its interpretation appropriate?</p><p>Yes</p><p>Are the conclusions drawn adequately supported by the results presented in the review?</p><p>Yes</p><p>Reviewer Expertise:</p><p>Sociology, public administration,</p><p>I confirm that I have read this submission and believe that I have an appropriate level of expertise to confirm that it is of an acceptable scientific standard.</p></body></sub-article></article>
