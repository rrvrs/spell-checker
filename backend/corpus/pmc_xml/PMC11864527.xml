Introduction
</title><p>Caesarean section (CS) rates are rising in urban hospitals in Nepal. However, the reasons behind these rising rates are poorly understood. Therefore, this study explores factors contributing to rising CS rates in two urban hospitals as well as strategies to make rational use of CS.</p></sec><sec id="sec041"><title>
Methods
</title><p>This cross-sectional mixed-methods study was conducted in 2021 in two hospitals, one public hospital and one private one in Kathmandu. The quantitative part included a record-based study of 661 births (private hospital = 276 and public hospital = 385) for the fiscal year 2018/19. The qualitative part included semi-structured interviews with 14 health professionals (doctors, nurses &#x00026; midwives) and five key informants from relevant organisations and four focus group discussions with pregnant women in antenatal clinics in two hospitals. Quantitative data were analysed using SPSS v28. Qualitative data were organised through NVivo v12 and thematically analysed.</p></sec><sec id="sec042"><title>
Results
</title><p>The overall CS rate was high (50.2%). The CS rate in the private hospital was almost double than that in the public hospital (68.5% vs. 37.1%). Previous CS was the leading indication for performing CS. Non-medical indications were maternal request (2.7%) and CS for non-specified reasons (5.7%). The odds of CS were significantly higher in the private hospital; women aged 25 years and above; having four or more antenatal clinic visits; breech presentation; urban residency; high caste; gestational age 37-40 weeks; spontaneous labour and no labour. Robson group 5 (13.9%) was the largest contributor to overall CS rate, followed by group 1 (13.4%), 2 (8.8%), 3 (4.4%) and 6 (2.9%). Similarly, the risk of undergoing CS was high in Robson groups 2, 5, 6, 7 and 9. The qualitative analysis yielded five key themes affecting rising rates: (1) medical factors (repeated CS, complicated referral cases and breech presentation); (2) socio-demographic factors (advanced age mother, precious baby and defensive CS); (3) financial factors (income for private hospitals); (4) non-medical factors (maternal request); and (5) health service-related factors (lack of awareness/midwives/resources, urban centralised health facilities and lack of appropriate policies and protocols). Four main strategies were identified to stem the rise of CS rates: (1) provide adequate resources to support care in labour and birth (midwives/trained staff &#x00026; birthing centres); (2) raise awareness on risks and benefits mode of childbirth (antenatal education/counselling and public awareness); (3) reform CS policies/protocols; and (4) promote physiological birth.</p></sec><sec id="sec043"><title>
Conclusion
</title><p>The high CS rate in the private hospital reflects the medicalisation of childbirth, a public health issue which needs to be urgently addressed for the health benefits of both mother and baby. Multiple factors affecting rising CS rates were identified in urban hospitals. This study provides insights into factors affecting the rising CS rate and suggests that multiple strategies are required to stem the rise of CS rates and to make rational use of CS in urban hospitals.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The author(s) received no specific funding for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="0"/><table-count count="0"/><page-count count="31"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All relevant data are within the paper and its <xref rid="sec033" ref-type="sec">Supporting information</xref> files.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All relevant data are within the paper and its <xref rid="sec033" ref-type="sec">Supporting information</xref> files.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Caesarean section (CS) is a lifesaving major surgical intervention in high-risk pregnancies to save mother and/or foetus, and the use of CS evolved throughout history [<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In 1985, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended a CS rate of 10-15% at population level [<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. More recently, it advocated that CS is only used when there are medical indications [<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], since CS rates higher than 10% at population level do not result in lower maternal and new-born mortality rates [<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. However, CS rates are rising worldwide, although with regional and national disparity. Globally, rates in 2000 were double (21.1% vs 12.1%) that in 2015 [<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. It is predicted that the global CS rate will increase to 28.5% in 2030 with the lowest rate (7.1%) in Sub-Saharan Africa and highest (63.4%) in Eastern Asia [<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. There are many health consequences of CS to mother (increased mortality risk, severe morbidity and a higher risk for adverse outcomes in subsequent pregnancies) and child (altered immune development, allergy, atopy, asthma, and reduced diversity of gut microbiome) [<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Moreover, CS is a financial burden for individuals, their family, and the health system/country [<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>The rates of CS are increasing rapidly in South Asia [<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], as they are in Nepal [<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The higher CS rates in urban and private hospitals are linked to &#x0201c;Too Much Too Soon&#x0201d; and the medicalisation of pregnancy and childbirth [<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Although there is a disparity in rates between urban and rural, the overall rate of CS rose three-fold from 1996 to 2016 in Nepal. In private hospitals it rose from 8.9% in 1996 to 26.3% in 2016 [<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However, the reasons behind the rising rates are not well understood. Hence, this study explores factors associated with rising rates of CS in two urban hospitals in Nepal. Specifically, this study has estimated the CS rate in study samples using the Robson groups; identified key factors contributing to a higher rate of CS and sought strategies to improve the rational use of CS.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>2. Methods</title><p>This mixed-methods cross-sectional study was conducted in 2021 in one public hospital: Paropakar Maternity &#x00026; Women&#x02019;s Hospital (PMWH) and one private one: Kathmandu Model Hospital (KMH). Both qualitative and quantitative data were collected concurrently, but quantitative and qualitative data were analysed and presented separately. Data integration was performed in the discussion [<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], weaving qualitative and quantitative findings together by themes [<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>The hospital record-based study included 661 births (public n = 385; private n = 276) for the fiscal year 16/07/2018&#x02013;15/07/ 2019. Retrospective data were collected from 1<sup>st</sup> August to 30<sup>th</sup> October 2021 from the fiscal year (16/07/2018&#x02013;15/07/2019). Samples were selected from the hospital records (discharge registers/patient records) using systematic random sampling. The sample size for the public hospital was calculated using the formula: n =&#x02009; z<sup>2</sup>p (1-p)/d<sup>2</sup>. However, for the private hospital it was calculated using the formula: 5% margin of error, 95% confidence level and representing 50% of sample proportion. An additional 10% sample was collected compensating poor/incomplete records. Selected data from hospital medical records were 4compiled in a standardised format.</p><p>The qualitative aspect of this study included interviews with 14 health professionals (seven doctors, five nurses, two midwives) working in maternity departments of the selected hospitals and five key informants from relevant organizations (two hospital directors &#x00026; one representative each from Nepal Society of Obstetrics and Gynaecologists [NESOG]; Midwifery Society of Nepal [MidSoN]; Ministry of Health &#x00026; Population Nepal [MoHP]). Similarly, four focus group discussions (FGDs), two in each hospital, were conducted with a total of 22 pregnant women (4-6 participants each FGD) at antenatal clinics. Purposive sampling was applied for both interviews and FGDs. Interviews and FGDs were conducted from 1<sup>st</sup> August 2021 to 30<sup>th</sup> October 2021 concurrently with quantitative data collection. Interview guidelines were used to facilitate interviews and FGDs. The interview and FGD tools primarily focused on the reasons for conducting and requesting CS, decision-making regarding CS, barriers and challenges to reducing its use, and strategies for promoting the rational use of CS. These tools were pretested with health workers and pregnant women in Karnali Province Hospital in Nepal in late 2019, minor modifications were made to both tools following the pilot.</p><p>Quantitative data were analysed using SPSS version 28. Statistical significance is set at p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05. Descriptive analysis of study variables, Chi-square test, logistic regressions and risk ratio are performed. The sample data were classified according to Robson 10 groups classification, based on parity and previous CSs, number of foetuses, gestational age, foetal presentation and lie, and onset of labour [<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The contribution of each group to overall CS rate were analysed and identified. For each Robson group risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval for birth by CS is calculated to estimate risk or incidence of CS in each Robson group. Qualitative data were organised using NVivo 12 and analysed thematically [<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Both qualitative and quantitative findings integrated into relevant themes or concepts through a narrative technique using weaving approach [<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>Ethical approval was obtained from the ethical review board of Bournemouth University (Ref: 26403) and Nepal Health Research Council (Ref: 3503). Additionally, approvals were granted by Institutional Review Committees of both study sites (PMWH, Ref: 59-11-2214 &#x00026; KMH, Ref: 089-076). A written consent was obtained from both interviewees and FGD participants.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec003"><title>3. Results</title><sec id="sec004"><title>3.1.

Hospitals do not want to take the risk, but neither it seems, do the women and their families:</p><disp-quote><p>
<italic toggle="yes">&#x0201c;We don&#x02019;t provide the opportunity of VBAC because it needs intensive monitoring of patient as well as hospital do not want to take risk. Previous CS falls under indication plus patient also demand it, so we do repeat CS for previous CS.&#x0201d; (P9)</italic>
</p></disp-quote><p>Another main medical factor was the complexity of cases referred from smaller units/hospitals elsewhere in Nepal. Many highlighted that both hospitals are referral centres, and many complicated cases who need CS were referred to these hospitals. Sometimes complicated cases arrived at urban hospitals from remote area by air ambulance:</p><disp-quote><p>
<italic toggle="yes">&#x0201c;&#x02026; the reason for the high caesarean section rate in this hospital is because this is a referral centre also and complications that arise in other places are referred to here through helicopter or nearby places. Since this is a main referral centre that is the reason for the high caesarean section rate.&#x0201d; (P2)</italic>
</p></disp-quote><p>Elective CS for breech presentation is a reason for the rising rate of CS. Trial of labour was not planned for primigravida with breech unless the woman is admitted in active labour with fully dilated cervix and buttock of baby is visible. However, trial of labour is offered to multigravida if their condition is deemed favourable:</p><disp-quote><p>
<italic toggle="yes">&#x0201c;Labour trial is not given for primigravida breech for first-time mom, but when they come from home if the dilation is over 10 centimetre and if the buttock of the baby is seen then we do not tell them to perform a caesarean section, but rest of the time on first-time mother receive a caesarean section.

Socio-demographic factors.</title><p>Three sub-themes were identified: (1) changing socio-demographic characteristics of women (pregnancy in advanced age and career-oriented rather than family); (2) precious baby; and (3) lack of security of service providers, legal issues and defensive CS (<xref rid="pone.0318489.s011" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>).</p><p>The socio-demographic characteristics of the obstetric population are changing. This study indicated that pregnancy at advanced age was a reason for the increasing rate of CS. Problems of infertility, diabetes and hypertension also increase with advanced age, and these are associated with CS:</p><disp-quote><p>
<italic toggle="yes">&#x0201c;&#x02026;the women who come to us are slightly older. We need to perform CS on elderly women and with many complications. So, because of this also CS rate is slightly high.&#x0201d; (P10)</italic>
</p></disp-quote><p>Women focus on their education, work, and career rather than having children. They get pregnant at a later age, when subfertility and complications increase the likelihood of CS.</p><disp-quote><p>
<italic toggle="yes">&#x0201c;&#x02026;the main reason for the increase in CS is nowadays women are more concerned about their education and career. So, they do late marriage and plan baby late, there are also subfertility cases. All these factors lead to the complications, for which CS is needed.&#x0201d; (P12)</italic>
</p></disp-quote><p>Pregnancies after infertility treatment, after many years of marriage and having a poor obstetric history may be viewed as particularly precious. Many interviewees emphasised that such babies are more likely to be delivered by CS:</p><disp-quote><p><italic toggle="yes">&#x0201c;Precious babies are also more likely to be caesarean section.

Doctors, nurses, and hospitals are criticised and may even attacked and punished if something goes wrong with the mother or baby due to vaginal birth rather than CS. Many thought that doctors perform defensive CS for self-protection to avoid verbal/physical assault and litigation:</p><disp-quote><p>
<italic toggle="yes">&#x0201c;&#x02026; If one baby dies because of conducting vaginal delivery rather than CS, Then, hospital is vandalised, and doctor is charged and court orders to both hospital and doctor. That is why doctors do not want to take risk&#x02026;&#x0201d; (K4)</italic>
</p></disp-quote></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>3.6.3. Financial factors.</title><p>Two sub-themes occurred under this theme: Income source for private hospitals and incentive for public hospitals (<xref rid="pone.0318489.s011" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>). Many interviewees highlighted that CS was a major operation which can be a good income source for private hospitals.</p><disp-quote><p>

<italic toggle="yes">&#x0201c;Upon doing caesarean section the Government of Nepal provides incentive, which is even more than that provided to normal delivery&#x02026;&#x0201d; (P2)</italic>
</p></disp-quote></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>3.6.4. Non-medical factors.</title><p>Two sub-themes emerged here: Maternal request and service providers&#x02019; attitude towards CS (<xref rid="pone.0318489.s011" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>). All women in FGDs said that the preferred mode for their forthcoming birth is a normal delivery due to the benefits for both mother and baby:</p><disp-quote><p>
<italic toggle="yes">&#x0201c;If normal delivery, it is good for both mother and baby because in caesarean section incision is done in abdomen which creates difficulty in sitting, walking. Normal delivery is natural, and caesarean section is difficult, and it is different. So, normal delivery is good for both mother and baby. Natural birth is better than incision in abdomen.&#x0201d; (FGD/P22)</italic>
</p></disp-quote><p>However, CS performed at maternal request is also one of the main non-medical factors for the rising CS rates in urban hospitals in Nepal:</p><disp-quote><p>
<italic toggle="yes">&#x0201c;&#x02026;Some of the CS are done on demand of the pregnant mothers as they do not want to give normal delivery in any condition. So, because of this also CS rate is slightly high.&#x0201d; (P10)</italic>
</p></disp-quote><p>Cord around the foetal neck (nuchal cord) is sometimes evident on ultrasound scans. It is not a standard indication for CS as it does not usually pose a threat to the foetus. If a pregnant woman learns that her baby has its cord around the neck, she may then request a CS to avoid perceived risks to baby. Doctors may consider the autonomy of women and respect their request when the cord is awkwardly positioned:</p><disp-quote><p>
<italic toggle="yes">&#x0201c;&#x02026;major reason is patient request. Even if there is no indication for example cord round neck is not indication for CS but while we explain patient about this, they themselves demand CS. I think caesarean delivery on maternal request is one of the major unnecessary CS, in that case we should also respect patient request, so we have to do it.&#x0201d; (P11)</italic>
</p></disp-quote><p>Some indicated that service providers also perceive CS as the safest option to avoid risk. Normal birth is not promoted, and CS is performed by doctors &#x02018;to be on the safe side&#x02019;:</p><disp-quote><p>
<italic toggle="yes">&#x0201c;&#x02026;normal delivery is not encouraged as much as it used to be. In case of CS, baby is safe, mother is also safe which reduces the headache of the doctors.&#x0201d; <ext-link xlink:href="http://broken-link/" ext-link-type="uri">(P7</ext-link>)</italic>
</p></disp-quote></sec><sec id="sec014"><title>3.6.5. Health-services-related factors.</title><p>Four main sub-themes are identified here: (1) lack of awareness around mode of childbirth/risk and benefits of CS and vaginal birth; (2) lack of adequate resources; (3) the centralisation of health facilities in urban Nepal; and (4) lack of appropriate policies and protocols on CS (<xref rid="pone.0318489.s011" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>). Most of interviewees highlighted that women&#x02019;s lack of awareness around mode of childbirth is one of the main factors for the rising CS rate. Interviewees described how most pregnant women were poorly informed about the risks and benefits of CS in ANC:</p><disp-quote><p>
<italic toggle="yes">&#x0201c;&#x02026;there is lack of awareness among the women themselves on the risk and complications of caesarean section, so they want to do it. Whether the caesarean section is required, or not. This type of awareness is lacking among the women as they are not well informed about it. In the hospital settings also, there is not any system to provide information on this while the women come for ANC visit. There is communication gap between the service providers and client. This is one of the main barriers to reduce CS.&#x0201d; (K3)</italic>
</p></disp-quote><p>Furthermore, it is highlighted that health workers are not able to inform pregnant women nor teach them pain relief techniques:</p><disp-quote><p>
<italic toggle="yes">&#x0201c;&#x02026;we health workers do not provide full information to them from our side and do not make them aware about the complication of caesarean section and we do not tell them much about the techniques of pain relief. This is not quite practised in Nepal and therefore caesarean section is mostly done.&#x0201d;(P2)</italic>
</p></disp-quote><p>Some interviewees highlighted that urban, educated and rich women are not aware of mode of childbirth:</p><disp-quote><p>
<italic toggle="yes">&#x0201c;Urban educated women are not aware and informed about the physiological birth. I think, that&#x02019;s why they think that birth is pathological condition. So that, they choose artificial way to bring their baby in this world... Even, women rights activists should be aware because those women who call themselves feminist or empowered women, they mostly do CS while giving birth to baby&#x02026;&#x0201d; (K3)</italic>
</p></disp-quote><p>Most interviewees emphasised that a lack of adequate resources, especially midwives or SBAs (skilled birth attendants) is another main factor for the rising CS rates, as some mentioned:</p><disp-quote><p><italic toggle="yes">&#x0201c;Main challenge is proportion of doctor/nurses with proportion of patients, so if trained midwife, SBA trained personnel are mobilised in every remote as well as urban then this may help to reduce unnecessary CS rate.&#x0201d;</italic>
<ext-link xlink:href="http://broken-link/" ext-link-type="uri">(P7</ext-link>)</p></disp-quote><p>Some interviewees highlighted that midwives who are expert for handling physiological births are lacking in Nepal:</p><disp-quote><p>
<italic toggle="yes">&#x0201c;&#x02026;We don&#x02019;t have experts (midwives) in handling natural births in Nepal. Recently our country has produced 28 midwives. It takes a minimum of 10 years for them to adopt a system-adjusted society because it is challenging for you to change the established practice to change the system...&#x0201d; (K3)</italic>
</p></disp-quote><p>Some also noted the lack of medical skill in conducting vaginal and instrumental:</p><disp-quote><p><italic toggle="yes">&#x0201c;&#x02026;we called instrumental delivery like forceps, vacuum delivery nowadays their use is very low like when I was MD</italic> [medical] <italic toggle="yes">student about 25 years ago. At that time there was vacuum delivery 6% and forceps delivery 3% - total 9% of instrumental delivery. Now, this 9% is also added to caesarean section because today&#x02019;s doctors are lacking the skills of instrumental delivery like vacuum, forceps...&#x0201d; (K4)</italic></p></disp-quote><p>The centralisation of comprehensive maternity health facilities in tertiary centres in cities is another reason for rising CS rates in urban Nepal. Many interviewees highlighted that big and/or private hospital are situated in urban areas:</p><disp-quote><p>
<italic toggle="yes">&#x0201c;The trend of caesarean section in Nepal is increasing now especially in urban areas, in big hospitals of cites, corporate hospitals in comparison to rural and remote areas&#x02026;&#x0201d; (K1)</italic>
</p></disp-quote><p>Another key issue is the lack of written protocols and policies on CS, lack of models of maternity care and respectful maternity care, lack of policy on rewards for low CS or monitoring and supervision regarding high rate of CS, lack of political commitment to implementing international recommendations (Robson classification) and lack of appropriate auditing of CS. Most interviewees said there were no written policies and protocols for CS:</p><disp-quote><p>
<italic toggle="yes">&#x0201c;There is no such a separate strategy/policy for CS in Nepal, we follow MD level book and according to the indication we do CS.&#x0201d; (K1)</italic>
</p></disp-quote><p>Hospitals in Nepal mostly follow an obstetric model of maternity care. Some interviewees importantly stressed that the lack of a midwifery model and current practice of an obstetric model of care is also a reason of increasing the CS rate:</p><disp-quote><p>
<italic toggle="yes">&#x0201c;&#x02026;doctors are trained to handle pathological conditions while being professionally trained...where there is a midwife, the midwifery is called the social model of maternity care. Similarly, the midwifery model of maternity care, women are trained to be empowered&#x02026;if professional midwives are very empowered in the country, the rate of CS is relatively low in that country.&#x0201d; (K3)</italic>
</p></disp-quote><p>One participant indicated that the lack of respectful maternity care was also a reason for unnecessary CSs in Nepal. Performing unnecessary CS is obstetric violence. However, there was no complaints system and service users are scared to raise their voice:</p><disp-quote><p>
<italic toggle="yes">&#x0201c;...There is lacking respectful maternity care&#x02026;There is not any mechanism to handle consumer rights although there is legal right. There should be a system to complain, but even clients are very fearful even to raise their voice. Unnecessarily CS is obstetrics violence, which is what is happening in Nepal, first it was in Brazil. I am blaming the system for the mindset of the society which is the big drawback of the system that brought women up.&#x0201d; (K3)</italic>
</p></disp-quote><p>The Government of Nepal has no policy to reward hospitals with lower CS rates or a system for monitoring and supervision to reduce high CS rates. Some interviewees raised the issue about lack of policy and protocol for awards to hospitals for low CS rates and monitoring of CS rate in hospitals:</p><disp-quote><p>
<italic toggle="yes">&#x0201c;&#x02026;Government has no policy to award the hospitals having caesarean section rate less than 15%. And another thing is there should be the monitoring and supervision of the hospitals in order to prevent the higher rate of caesarean section...&#x0201d; (<ext-link xlink:href="http://broken-link/" ext-link-type="uri">P2</ext-link>)</italic>
</p></disp-quote><p>A lack of political commitment to reduce CS rate was clear according to several interviewees:</p><disp-quote><p>
<italic toggle="yes">&#x0201c;&#x02026;national leader, you must be committed to implementing the standards set by the WHO.... from our Prime Minister it is impossible, then in the Ministry of Health, the ministers in the Ministry of Health also come from different backgrounds we cannot expect that from them&#x02026;... For example, WHO says use the Robson classification, but if the director of the maternity hospital cannot get support from the Government than he/she could not implement it alone, that is what the system is all about we need system to support our work&#x02026; NESOG doesn&#x02019;t seem like to have taken any initiative to control... (K3)</italic>
</p></disp-quote><p>Lack of appropriate monitoring and auditing systems can be a reason for rising CS rates. Most said that they do record CS in medical record and presented report on CS along with other maternal health statistics monthly and yearly basis:</p><disp-quote><p>
<italic toggle="yes">&#x0201c;In our hospital, there is a monthly audit &#x02026;for example, how many of the deliveries during the month are normal delivery, how many forceps, vacuum deliveries and how many caesarean sections are done, how many are done annually. We also provide this data to the Government of Nepal.&#x0201d; (K1)</italic>

All SBAs should be skilled in normal birth, and they should be placed at labour room and delivery room to support women for normal delivery as well as to facilitate birth. Most interviewees emphasised that providing SBA training to doctors and nurses and availability of adequately trained staff would be a strategy for reduction of the CS rate and the promotion of normal birth:</p><disp-quote><p>
<italic toggle="yes">&#x0201c;Skilled birth attendants have to be mobilised in every part of the country. Likewise, the service providers should be trained and skilful to provide this type of services... Along with doctors, SBAs also should have a hand in normal delivery, so the government should focus on training and mobilising SBA. In the same way there should be skilled birth attendants at labour room, delivery room to perform the normal delivery. At the hospital level we need to influence the patients for the normal delivery as well as staff themselves should be skilful.&#x0201d; (P13)</italic>
</p></disp-quote><p>Midwives should be posted in antenatal clinics, birthing centres, PNC (postnatal care) clinics, as well as in the community.

Most interviewees stressed that counselling pregnant women about normal birth from the beginning of pregnancy can play a vital role in reducing CS rates:</p><disp-quote><p>
<italic toggle="yes">&#x0201c;&#x02026;If we have counselled properly during antenatal period, the client will be prepared mentally to give normal birth&#x02026;Doctors should counsel that you have come to safe place, and you have a normal delivery. Counselling also convinces many patients, so, I think as a doctor he/she should also be a counsellor.&#x0201d; (P8)</italic>

<italic toggle="yes">&#x0201c;Education on mode of childbirth should be given to women during antenatal check-up. And their mental and physical aspect should be taken care of to prepare them.

<italic toggle="yes">&#x0201c;&#x02026;make pregnant women aware about the benefits of vaginal delivery during ANC visit. Monetary cost is also cheap, physical recovery is also quick, CS recovery takes time so normal delivery recovers quickly, all these things should be made aware during ANC visits.&#x0201d; (P10)</italic>
</p></disp-quote><p>Many interviewees stressed that pregnant women should be empowered by providing service from midwives to help women make informed decisions around the mode of their childbirth:</p><disp-quote><p>
<italic toggle="yes">&#x0201c;The first thing is that the women must be empowered themselves, there is not much human resource to empower the right of the woman and that is lacking for example the midwives&#x02026; the main thing that can be done is the empowerment of the woman to reduce the rate of caesarean section. And the number of people performing elective caesarean section in the urban sector is increasing and women need to be aware that they must be empowered so that they can make decisions for themselves.&#x0201d; (P2)</italic>

Reform policies and protocols for CS.</title><p>In this strategy, ten sub-themes were identified: (1) policies for avoiding CS for non-medical reasons and primigravidae/primary CS; (2) appropriate use of partograph for labour monitoring; (3) fixed service charge for CS; (4) rewards for, and investigations into hospitals in relation to CS rate; (5) monitoring of private hospitals; (6) use of Robson classification to enable proper comparison; (7) VBAC/trial of labour; (8) decision making around CS to be made by two consultants; (9) provision of security of service providers; and (10) commitment to implementation of international recommendations (including midwifery model of care and respectful maternity care) (<xref rid="pone.0318489.s012" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>).</p><p>Most interviewees stressed that policy should be reformed to avoid conducting CS on non-medical grounds. CS must only be done to avoid mortality and/or significant morbidity. Some interviewees also highlighted that primary CS should be avoided wherever possible:</p><disp-quote><p>
<italic toggle="yes">&#x0201c;&#x02026;you should not perform the operation during the first delivery, because if the CS was performed at the primigravida, if VBAC was not performed, then again, the caesarean section will be performed at second time.&#x0201d; (K4)</italic>
</p></disp-quote><p>Furthermore, many stressed that hospitals should avoid doing CS on request of the mother:</p><disp-quote><p>
<italic toggle="yes">&#x0201c;In private institutions we should reduce maternal requests&#x02026;&#x0201d; (P11)</italic>
</p></disp-quote><p>Some emphasized that policy for reducing unnecessary CS such as CS for non-medical reasons and primary CS should be reformed and strictly monitor it.</p><disp-quote><p>
<italic toggle="yes">&#x0201c;The first step to reducing unwanted CS is to make strict protocol&#x02026; Secondly, strict monitoring of whether the protocol has been strictly followed or not. The main thing is to reduce the unwanted CS, one had to make a protocol and strict monitoring of it&#x02026;The current policy has everything, but we do not have a system of strict monitoring. If the government alone can&#x02019;t monitor, it is better to have a separate body&#x02026;In addition, there is policy which need to be strictly implemented, there is system to provide allowances to the mother who give birth through normal delivery.&#x0201d; (K1)</italic>
</p></disp-quote><p>Compulsory use of a partograph to monitor labour in each hospital was emphasised as a strategy. Some interviewees stressed that labour in hospital should be monitored around their use of the partograph, although there was a notion that some private hospitals did not use them:</p><disp-quote><p>
<italic toggle="yes">&#x0201c;Our hospital has its own protocol. We complete partograph but I don&#x02019;t think private hospital use partograph, at least partograph should be filled.&#x0201d; (P6)</italic>
</p></disp-quote><p>Some interviewees recommended that the government should create policy to reward hospitals with high normal birth, to investigate reasons for high CS rates, to run programmes to increase morale of doctors and to promote audits to reduce unnecessary CS. Such policy reform could encourage more normal deliveries in hospitals:</p><disp-quote><p>
<italic toggle="yes">&#x0201c;&#x02026;create protocol/guideline to be followed to reduce unwanted CS... programs to increase morale of the physicians, encouraging strategy. The hospital that has more normal delivery had to be awarded. If it is encouraging there will be competition in the hospital, so more vaginal delivery can be done or in a hospital where most of the CS are done, the government should investigate the cause of more CS. Auditing can also reduce CS because when there is inquiry, then people become aware that unnecessary CS should not be done&#x02026;&#x0201d; (P10)</italic>
</p></disp-quote><p>Several stressed that the Government of Nepal should monitor private hospitals regarding high CS rates as CS should only be conducted based on indications:</p><disp-quote><p>
<italic toggle="yes">&#x0201c;Government should advocate that CS should be done only in indicated cases&#x02026;Government should also monitor the private sector and need to strengthen for doing CS in indicated cases only.&#x0201d; (K5)</italic>
</p></disp-quote><p>Some interviewees highlighted that the government should not blame private hospitals because doing a CS is an easy option to generate income for these hospitals:</p><disp-quote><p>
<italic toggle="yes">&#x0201c;Private hospitals are there for making money unless and until government sector they do not themselves question and monitor them, nothing is going to happen. That is why it is useless to blame private hospital, because we are pretty much sure they are for profit making and they don&#x02019;t get any money from government to run hospital and to run hospital they must generate fund, and to generate the fund CS is best option&#x02026;&#x0201d; (K3)</italic>
</p></disp-quote><p>Some interviewees emphasised that fees for CS must be fixed in private hospitals. The current fee for CS in the private hospitals is high but also varies across hospitals. Poor families cannot afford CS in private hospitals. Therefore, the government should set a fixed CS rate at a reasonable price and should monitor it:</p><disp-quote><p>
<italic toggle="yes">&#x0201c;&#x02026; financial aspects like in government sector CS is free, likewise if there are certain rules like only CS service fee can be charged up to that amount this will help patient to get service easily. The fee in a private hospital is very expensive for CS&#x02026;It is cheaper in some places. Doing CS for some of our poor family or lower/middle-class family is expensive. So, even if they need to do CS, they try for normal delivery. At the same time, the lives of both mother and baby may be at risk, so if the Government of Nepal makes fixed rate available to the public at a very reasonable price along with strict monitoring... those who need a CS will get CS.&#x0201d; (K1)</italic>
</p></disp-quote><p>A few interviewees suggested that the Robson criteria must be applied in all hospitals. This would enable better identification of the reasons for CS and allows cross comparison locally, regionally and internationally:</p><disp-quote><p>
<italic toggle="yes">&#x0201c;By taking the Robson protocol and analysing all the hospitals indication for CS. This should be applied in private as well. Going private is the individual choice of the patient but Robson criteria is universally accepted and approved by WHO. Now there is also a necessary to know why the CS rate is high. The root cause also comes from the criteria and if the main cause of CS is found then we can reduce the unwanted CS.&#x0201d; (P9)</italic>
</p></disp-quote><p>Many interviewees discussed the provision of protocols for VBAC and trial of labour for breech presentation. It would not only reduce CS rates, but also reduce the cost:</p><disp-quote><p>
<italic toggle="yes">&#x0201c;&#x02026;we should give a chance of trial of labour to previous CS, and this must be kept in every hospital protocol. Usually, doctors are distressed while the baby takes long time to deliver in order to be on the safe side, we want to do CS. So, it would be better if doctors try to keep calm and manage their distress and not perform unnecessary CS.&#x0201d; (P11)</italic>
</p></disp-quote><p>One interviewee highlighted the need for intensive monitoring in a trial of labour in breech presentation to reduce CS:</p><disp-quote><p>
<italic toggle="yes">&#x0201c;&#x02026;it would be better if hospital could provide intensive monitoring for the trial of labour in the case of breech and previous CS. If we do all this, then normal physiological birth can be promoted.&#x0201d; (P9)</italic>
</p></disp-quote><p>Many interviewees highlighted the provision of a safe working environment by protecting staff&#x02019;s safety and morale to help reduce defensive CS:</p><disp-quote><p>
<italic toggle="yes">&#x0201c;&#x02026;Providers also should have confidence and safety. In case of any problem during delivery, safety of the provider should be ensured. The society should also be aware if anything happens blaming doctors, attacking them should not be done. Government should provide guarantee of security and conduct different workshops to increase the morale&#x02026; This is the responsibility of the hospital as well as of government to provide safe environment for health worker to work.&#x0201d; (P10)</italic>
</p></disp-quote><p>Some interviewees also emphasised the need for the law to protect health workers if they followed protocol even in case of bad outcomes as patients&#x02019; family are often seeking revenge:</p><disp-quote><p>
<italic toggle="yes">&#x0201c;There should be a provision for safety of the doctor. If the system has followed well there, the judge does not have to make a hasty decision. If you have not followed the system, you must be punished if you have made a mistake, but even after following the system, sometimes bad results come, it does not mean that we know everything about the child inside... There should be strict law for the sake of doctors in what condition do they get exemption and punishment if any complications arise even if precaution is taken as protocol.&#x0201d; (K4)</italic>
</p></disp-quote><p>Implementing international maternity recommendations was also mentioned as a strategy by interviewees. Some emphasised that government policy should aim to reduce CS by following the WHO protocol on the provision of Respectful Maternity Care with the midwifery model of care:</p><disp-quote><p>
<italic toggle="yes">&#x0201c;The maternity department head is obstetrician, he/she should commit first to reduce unnecessary CS, they should commit that their institution CS rate should not be more than WHO standard... Department of Health Services, Family Welfare Division Head all should be committed collaboratively to reduce unnecessary CS&#x02026; from national level WHO criteria should be strictly followed. Similarly, local level government should also commit for respectful maternity care... The Ministry of Health should be conceptually clear which model exists for maternity care in the country... This should be applied in the private sector as well.&#x0201d; (K3)</italic>

So, we have to promote physiological birth giving process by producing more midwives and utilising them...&#x0201d; (P1)</italic>
</p></disp-quote><p>There is a birthing centre in the public hospital where low-risk cases are managed by SBA nurses and midwives. Similar birthing centres should be established in other hospitals.

<italic toggle="yes">&#x0201c;&#x02026;should promote the system of delivery like in our maternity hospital, low risk cases are there in birthing centre where nurses and midwives manage delivery. The caesarean section rate over there is less than 10%. Therefore, birthing centres should be established in all the places in the country where there are more than 5000 deliveries in a year, but that birthing centre should not be like which is there in the health post. There should be a birthing centre having obstetric unit where nurses, midwives can do normal physiological delivery&#x02026;&#x0201d; (K3)</italic>
</p></disp-quote><p>Moreover, intensive monitoring of labour for VBAC and trial of labour for breech presentation can promote physiological birth:</p><disp-quote><p>
<italic toggle="yes">&#x0201c;&#x02026;hospital could provide intensive monitoring for the trial of labour in the case of previous CS and breech presentation. If we do all this, then normal physiological can be promoted.&#x0201d; (P9)</italic>
</p></disp-quote><p>Some interviewees suggested that more instrumental deliveries could reduce CS rates:</p><disp-quote><p>
<italic toggle="yes">&#x0201c;We also do vacuum, forceps, instrument delivery we need to keep both mother and baby healthy&#x02026;instrumental/vacuum delivery should be performed like previously if these things are done then we can reduce CS rate.&#x0201d; (P6)</italic>
</p></disp-quote><p>Several indicated that provision of pain relief in labour can help reduce maternal request CS. However, there is still a challenge due to shortage of staff such as anaesthetists:</p><disp-quote><p>
<italic toggle="yes">&#x0201c;&#x02026;if epidural anaesthesia is provided to relieve the labour of pain. then normal delivery can be increased. Many patients are demanding painless delivery but to get painless delivery there should be good backup of anaesthetic doctors because pain management is not the scope of work of the obstetrician. However, there is a shortage of anaesthesia doctors in Nepal. Therefore, if the doctor of anaesthesia can produce and utilise it well, and then, painless delivery can be done in Nepal.&#x0201d; (K4)</italic>
</p></disp-quote><p>Some interviewees emphasised that husbands should be involved during pregnancy and childbirth, to help them understand when and how to encourage partners to go to hospital in good time:</p><disp-quote><p>
<italic toggle="yes">&#x0201c;Husbands should be involved in the time of birth as they can&#x02019;t do anything during pregnancy... in our country they don&#x02019;t have any clue about that as they know only if their wife is pregnant. So, I think change needs to start from our society as well.&#x0201d; (FGD/p12)</italic>
</p></disp-quote><p>Quality care during pregnancy can have a huge influence on the pregnant woman. Interviewees emphasised the importance of such care, including regular exercise, mental preparation and family support in promoting physiological birth.</p><disp-quote><p>
<italic toggle="yes">&#x0201c;&#x02026;Women should be mentally strong enough to give normal delivery. Normal exercise should be done regularly from the beginning.

CS rate and indications</title><p>Overall, the CS rate was high at 50.2%, and nearly twice as high in the private hospital (68.5%) than in the public hospital (37.1%). The rate of CS in the private hospital was higher than reported previously in same hospital in 2019 [<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], but so was the CS rate in the public hospital [<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>Previous CS (27.4%) was overall the most common indication for any CS, elective CS and multigravida in this study. Our qualitative data support this, as do several other studies [<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. However, a systematic review reported that previous CS is the second most common indication after foetal distress [<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The progression position of previous CS as the most common indication for overall CS in this current study could be due to the rising number of women with a history of previous CS, stressing the need to avoid unnecessary primary CS. Foetal distress was the second most common indication for overall CS [<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and the most common indication in primigravida and in the public hospital [<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. It could be due to lack of trained staff for appropriate monitoring of labour and timely management of labour, or simply not monitoring the foetal heart rate appropriately [<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p>Although a minority, some CSs are conducted for non-medical indications such as maternal request and not specified reasons as reported elsewhere [<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Severe of note, maternal request was recorded only in private hospital.</p><p>Having the cord around the baby&#x02019;s neck was an indication for 1.2% of the CS rate, and only in private hospital and as emergency CS. This proportion was lower than 5.5% reported in another study in Nepal [<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. However, the qualitative results suggested maternal requests might be higher if cord round neck is identified.</p></sec><sec id="sec022"><title>4.2. Robson classification of CS</title><p>The rates of CS are high in low-risk Robson groups 1-4. This suggests CS are being performed in low-risk pregnancies, leading to a larger group 5 in subsequent pregnancies [<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Lack of adequate labour management (i.e., staff) for constant labour monitoring could be a reason for performing CS in these groups. Therefore, an appropriate evidence-based approach for labour and childbirth assistance, in groups 1-4, can reduce the rate of CSs. For example, an innovative &#x02018;Project Appropriate Birth&#x02019; was implemented in maternity hospitals in 2017 in Brazil, successfully decreasing the overall CS rate from 62.4% to 55.6% (10.9%) and from 49.1% to 38.6% (21.4%) in Robson groups 1- 4 by using this approach [<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p><p>Robson group 5 was the largest contributor to the overall CS rates in this study and many studies [<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].

Furthermore, Robson group 1&#x00026; 2 had significantly higher risks of undergoing CS. In the public hospital, Robson group 1 was the largest contributor to overall CS rates, followed by groups 5, 2, 3 and 6. A scoping review showed that Robson groups 1-6 are key contributors to overall CS rates in South Asia [<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].

CS decision making</title><p>In this study, the doctor was usually the primary decision maker as the decision for an elective CS takes place in both hospitals in the antenatal clinic or outpatient department. Both the doctor and the pregnant women and/or her family, agree to do a CS. Decision making around emergency CS is made by the senior doctor when complications arise during labour. The role of women or their family in decision making in emergency CS appears limited to obtaining of consent. Of course, women usually rely on the expertise of doctors and their final decision on CS [<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Shared decision making is way forward not only to make informed decisions but also to reduce the use of CS [<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].</p><p>In hospitals in Nepal, communication should be improved to include all risks and benefits of both vaginal birth and CS to a pregnant woman and her family to reach informed consent. Effective communication skills (such as listening to women about their choice of childbirth mode) should be applied and more information, avoiding medical jargon, should be offered by providing pamphlets and leaflets on mode of childbirth including indications, risks and benefits of CS and vaginal birth. Moreover, informed consent includes the right to refuse or withdraw from the procedure. Hospital staff should offer individual counselling to pregnant women considering their preferences, circumstances, belief and knowledge. Concerns by pregnant women/her family should be addressed appropriately without being pressured.</p></sec><sec id="sec024"><title>4.4. Factors affecting rise of CS in urban hospitals</title><sec id="sec025"><title>4.4.1. Medical factors.</title><p>In this study, repeat CS was the key factor influencing the rising CS rate, as all women with a history of previous CS underwent a further CS. The incidence of repeat CS was equally high (30%) in Kathmandu Medical College [<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Some have argued that the lack of resources means that VBAC may not be the best alternative in a low-resource country like Nepal [<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], as there are several factors associated with successful VBAC [<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Although the chance of uterine rupture is low [<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], staff and women may perceive repeat CS as the best option. The high proportion of repeat CS reflects the idea of &#x02018;Once a caesarean section, always a caesarean section&#x02019; similar to other countries [<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>].</p><p>CS for a breech presentation was another medical factor contributing to the rising CS. Both Robson groups 6 (primigravida breech) and 7 (multigravida breech) had a 100% CS. Management of breech presentation is still debateable. External cephalic version for breech presentation may not common in Nepal, although it can promote vaginal birth [<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>].</p><p>Both hospitals are tertiary care hospitals and many complicated high-risk pregnancy cases are referred from other parts of the country. These women may need CS due to pregnancy and childbirth complications for medical indications. Both in India and Bangladesh, high-risk pregnancy is a reason for high rates of CS [<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>].</p><p>Gestation was associated with mode of childbirth; gestational age of 30-36 weeks was 0.78 times less likely to have a CS compared to full-term (37-40 weeks) in this study. Similar results have been reported in other studies [<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Planned elective CS (for breech presentation, previous CS, pregnancy after IUI/IVF) is usually reserved for term pregnancies which may explain why CS rates at term are higher. Also, preterm labours may be much shorter, with less time to decide about mode of birth.</p><p>This study suggests that induction of labour in low-risk pregnancy can reduce the rate of unnecessary CS as reported by other studies [<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], however, the rate of induction was low in our sample (11.5%). The shortage of SBAs limits the use of induction of labour because constant monitoring of labour is vital [<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. In contrast, a US study reported that the CS rate is significantly higher among women who had induced labour than those with spontaneous onset of labour [<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec026"><title>4.4.2. Sociodemographic factors.</title><p>The increasing age of first-time pregnant women is a factor in the rising CS rate. Most interviewees described how modern urban Nepalese women are getting married/starting their family later, as observed elsewhere [<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. In addition, advanced maternal age also associated with reduced success of VBAC [<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>], complications which are associated with an increased risk of CS [<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Moreover, CS is viewed as a prestigious delivery for educated, wealthy urban women [<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>], as in Bangladesh [<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>], and elsewhere in South Asia [<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The study showed that women from higher caste had significantly higher odds (OR: 1.14) of CS, as was found in India [<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Whilst so-called &#x02018;precious baby&#x02019;, those conceived after long-term subfertility or infertility treatment, are more likely to end up as a CS [<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>].</p><p>Legislation on violence against the healthcare providers was passed in 2022 in Nepal to provide a safe working environment for all health workers [<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. However, violent repercussions and demands for compensation still exist in Nepal [<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>] when a vaginal birth goes wrong. This situation has resulted in doctors carrying out defensive CS due to fear of physical assaults and litigation [<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], and a similar situation exists in Iran [<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec027"><title>4.4.3. Financial factors.</title><p>The study revealed that conducting CS is a lucrative income-stream for non-governmental or private hospitals. CS is a major operation so a high price can be charged, not only for the operation but also for the hospital bed, medications and service charges. Those who can afford the cost and are keen to give birth by CS often go to private hospitals [<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>].

Whilst in public hospitals in Nepal are receiving financial incentives from the government to enable them to conducting free CS [<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>], perhaps the higher rate of incentive for a CS encourages doctors to conduct more CS in public hospitals.</p></sec><sec id="sec028"><title>4.4.4. Non-medical factors.</title><p>Only 2.7% of all CSs were conducted for maternal request, however, these only occurred in the private hospital, representing 4.8% of all is births. It may reflect that private hospitals would accept the maternal request for financial reasons. The proportion of CS conducted at maternal request was slightly lower than reported by an earlier study (6%) in the same hospital [<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>This is very interesting since all pregnant women in the FGDs preferred to give birth vaginally. The women understood the benefits of physiological birth, but poor ANC education and a lack of respectful maternity care possibly encourages CS. Perceiving CS as a safer option is another possible reason for opting for CS. Regular consultations with doctors antenatally and trusting in their advice, may lead to women changing their choice of mode of childbirth. The main reason for requesting CS was labour pain as reported by another study in Nepal [<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and studies elsewhere [<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Pregnant women hear horror stories about labour pain from relatives and friends. Women may also request CS during labour due to not coping with pain [<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. The interviews revealed that there are few pain relief methods (e.g., use of nitrous oxide), whilst the provision of regional analgesia is uncommon in Nepal in many hospitals due to a lack of resources such as anaesthetists, facilities and awareness [<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. Moreover, an epidural seldom makes birth painless. The scoping review on non-medical reasons for CS suggested similar reasons for requesting a CS [<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In 5.7% of cases in this study the reason for CS was not specified, similar to several South Asian countries [<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Some doctors also perceive CS as safer [<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec029"><title>4.5.5. Health service-related factors.</title><p>Several health service-related factors contribute to rising CS rates in urban hospital in Nepal. The study showed that lack of appropriate antenatal counselling for pregnant mothers was a health service-related factor for rising rates of CS in urban hospitals in Nepal. They may have a lack of information or misinformation regarding childbirth [<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>] due to poor counselling antenatally on the mode of childbirth [<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>] or poor communication between doctors and women [<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Inadequate knowledge (i.e., health consequences of CS) may lead to a preference for a CS [<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>], and an inability to make an informed choice about birth [<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>].</p><p>The study showed that the probability of undergoing CS was significantly higher among women who had four or more ANC visits (OR: 1.26; AOR: 1.26) than those with fewer visits as reported elsewhere [<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. On the one hand, more ANC might be needed due to pregnancy complications that need a CS. On the other hand, more ANC visits reflect the higher educational and socio-economic status of women; both are associated with an increased risk of CS.</p><p>Properly trained midwives who can advocate for the rights of the woman, counsel and motivate for normal birth are scarce in Nepal [<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. In urban hospitals, vaginal birth may not be promoted because this mode of delivery time consuming and there is insufficient staff [<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. In addition, lack of skills in instrumental and vaginal breech birth adds to higher CS rates [<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref080" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. Tertiary and private hospitals offering comprehensive obstetric care are mostly centralised in cities [<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>], and women who prefer a CS may self-refer to these [<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref082" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. The probability of having a CS was higher in private and charitable facilities than in public facilities in Nepal [<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref083" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>].</p><p>A written protocol for CS (currently lacking in both hospitals), following international guidelines, could encourage evidence-based practice as would the reliable use of the Robson categories which force recording of reasons for each CS and therefore enable proper audit [<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref084" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>].</p><p>The current adherence to the obstetric model of care in hospital and a lack of policy promoting maternity care is adding to the rise in CS. Political commitment with evidence-based international guidelines to the midwifery model of maternity care would be a vital not only for the development of the midwifery profession in Nepal [<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref085" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>], but also, for the reduction of unnecessary CS and promotion of physiological birth [<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref086" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>].</p><p>The lack of respectful maternity care is also a reason for unnecessary CS in Nepal, the preferences and choices of pregnant women may be ignored by health professionals [<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref087" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. Respectful maternity care is recommended by the WHO [<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref088" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>], but disrespectful maternity care was witnessed in hospitals in Nepal [<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref089" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. Therefore, lack of respectful maternity care and disrespectful maternity care would encourage women to either request CS or accept advice from a doctor and opt for CS despite them preferring vaginal birth. [<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. In addition, there is no monitoring system of the CS rate by the government as private hospitals run almost autonomously, this creates a lack of accountability for private hospitals [<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref090" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>].</p><p>The study emphasised that a system for auditing CS is lacking. A systematic review highlighted that audit and feedback using the Robson classification can reduce CS rates [<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref091" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. However, it seems to be far behind in auditing CS by using Robson classification in hospitals in Nepal.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec030"><title>4.2. Strategies to reduce high CS rate in urban hospitals
</title><p>Evidence suggest that locally tailored multifaceted strategies are required to reduce CS use and increase physiological birth for healthy women and babies [<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref092" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>]. First, the provision of adequate numbers of SBAs or midwives should be a vital strategy. The Government of Nepal has been providing SBA training [<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref093" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. This training should be mandatory for all new doctors and nurses as part of continuous professional development (CPD) training. An adequate number of trained SBAs should help reduce the CS rate and promote normal birth [<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref094" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. Secondly, this study highlighted the importance of education and utilisation of midwives. Midwifery education has already been introduced in Nepal [<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref093" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref095" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>], however, there are many challenges in building an autonomous midwifery profession [<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref085" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. Thirdly, hospitals, including private hospitals, should also be obliged to establish a birthing centre where SBAs and midwives can provide the midwifery model of maternity care to reduce CS rates.</p><p>The study highlighted that antenatal health education and counselling can play a vital role in reducing the CS rate. Pregnant women should be informed clearly about the risks, benefits, indications and contraindications for CS and the benefits and risks of normal delivery. The WHO states that antenatal education is vital in reducing unnecessary CS [<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref096" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>], it can help reduce fear of childbirth and increase natural birth [<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref097" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref101" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>]. Moreover, educational intervention on the mode of childbirth for husbands and wives together can encourage natural birth [<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref102" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>]. An individual and motivating approach of midwives promotes the empowerment of pregnant women and belief in their capability to handle the birth [<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref103" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>]. Pregnant mothers should be well informed about mode of childbirth to be empowered to make informed choices [<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref104" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>].</p><p>This study emphasised that the Government of Nepal must formulate and implement robust rules and regulations for private hospital to control the use of CS and to make them accountable. Likewise, decision making for CS to be made by two consultant doctors was suggested some interviewees to reduce unnecessary CS. Evidence suggested that implementing a mandatory second opinion policy with evidence-based guidelines can reduce rates of CS [<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref105" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref106" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>]. However, decision-making on CS by two consultants may not be practical in all hospitals due to the shortage of human resources.</p><p>In terms of workplace security, a zero-tolerance policy toward workplace violence from service users can be the best protective intervention in hospitals in Nepal [<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref107" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>]. Hospitals should consider installing video surveillance, extra lighting, and alarm systems and minimising access by outsiders through identification badges, electronic keys and guards.</p><p>The study emphasised that a midwifery model of maternity care should be adopted to promote physiological birth in hospitals in Nepal for the reduction of CS rates. The midwifery, or social, model of maternity care is a women-centred holistic approach to enhance natural physiological processes, which optimise the health of mother and baby and results in individual mothers&#x02019; satisfaction [<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref108" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>]. Midwives play a key role in helping to promote a natural birth and positive birth experience. Women feel an inner strength after receiving guidance, coaching and support through the birth process by a midwife which give those women a strong motivation and encouragement to continue the natural birth process up to the most intense labour [<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref103" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>]. All pregnant women require help from a midwife but only a few need medical help from a doctor [<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref109" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>]. Low-risk pregnancy should be looked after by midwives and SBA-trained nurses in birthing centres to promote physiological birth. Normal physiological birth among low-risk women is found to be higher in midwifery-led birth settings in both primiparous and multiparous women [<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref110" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>]. Therefore, hospitals of Nepal should adopt midwife-led maternity care models [<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref111" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>].</p><p>Similarly, this study emphasised that the opportunity of VBAC must be provided in all hospitals, as success rates of VBAC have been reported to be between 60-80% [<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref112" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref114" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>]. However, several factors are associated with successful VBAC. It is only a safe option and successful if individual risk assessment is carried out prior to the VBAC [<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref113" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref114" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>]. This study also highlighted that the opportunity of trial of labour must be provided for breech. It also has training and skills implications insted of issues.</p><p>Provision of pain relief during childbirth could be an option to promote vaginal birth and to avoid CS on maternal request. Women&#x02019;s awareness of painless labour is low [<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>], and analgesia for labour pain (painless birth) is not widely offered by hospitals in Nepal. Currently, there is facility for labour analgesia service for women who are willing to have painless birth in PMWH, but this facility offers this service only to two women at a time [<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref115" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>]. Pregnant women are also not well informed about painless birth [<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>].</p><p>The study suggested that the involvement of husbands throughout pregnancy and childbirth can be a good strategy to promote physiological birth. Despite having positive desire and potential benefits, involvement of the husbands in wives&#x02019; maternity care (pregnancy and childbirth) is not recognised in Nepal due to many factors such as their availability, cultural beliefs, and traditions [<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref116" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>]. Couple-based antenatal education intervention is effective in increasing spousal support and decreasing elective CS rates [<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref117" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>]. Therefore, the health system in Nepal should focus on the inclusion of husbands in maternity care. Care during pregnancy such as regular exercise and mental preparation for normal birth and family support for normal birth could develop pregnant women&#x02019;s confidence to undergo vaginal birth. Furthermore, this study also highlighted that the quality of maternity care particularly in public hospitals should be improved in terms of respectful, dignified and person-centre maternity care.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec031"><title>5. Conclusion</title><p>The rate of CS is extremely high, particularly in the private hospital, and elective CS rates were higher than emergency (particularly in the private hospital). Most recent hospital data showed that CS rate is increasing high (41.8% in PMWH in fiscal year 2023/24) [<xref rid="pone.0318489.ref118" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>]. High CS rates reflect the medicalisation of childbirth. The emergency life-saving procedure CS is used frequently as an alternative mode for childbirth, which is an alarming public health problem, and it must be addressed urgently. Decision making around CS is usually made by the senior doctor and women and family are only involved for obtaining consent for emergency CS. Previous CS was the leading medical indication for performing CS and maternal request and not specified reasons were non-medical indications for CS. Robson group 5 was the major contributor to overall CS rate followed by group 1, 2 and 3. CS were often conducted in low-risk Robson groups (1-4). The risk of undergoing CS was higher in Robson group 2, 5, 6 and 9. Several associated factors with mode of childbirth are identified; the odds of CS were significantly higher in private hospital, women aged 25 and over, four or more antenatal clinic visits, breech presentation, urban residency, high caste, gestational age 37-40 weeks, spontaneous labour and no labour. The qualitative analysis identified five key themes (medical factors, sociodemographic factors, financial factors, non-medical factors and health service-related factors) affecting rising CS rates. Similarly, four main strategies were identified to stem the rise of CS: (1) provision of adequate resources (SBAs, midwives and birthing centres); (2) raising awareness on mode of childbirth (antenatal education and counselling); (3) reforming CS policies/protocols on CS; and (4) promoting physiological birth.</p><p>This mixed-methods study has highlighted many factors affecting to rising CS rates and offers details of factors fuelling the rise of CS in Nepal. The reasons behind the rising CS rates in urban hospitals are multifactorial. At the same time, the study has also recommended several possible strategies to make reasonable use of CS. Collective or collaborative multiple strategies are required for reduction of CS rates. The findings would be the important evidence not only for researchers but also for policy makers to reform policies regarding rational use of CS in Nepal. Provision of quality obstetric care can reduce unnecessary CS, and it must include social support during labour, appropriate labour monitoring, analgesic medication during labour and counselling or education of pregnant women around mode of childbirth, including indications, risks and benefits of CS during antenatal visits. Similarly, evidence-based practice and guidelines must be followed.</p></sec><sec id="sec032"><title>6. Limitation of the study</title><p>This study included two hospitals from Kathmandu, Nepal.

The quantitative component involved a record review of 661 births (276 from the private hospital and 385 from the public hospital) that occurred in the year 2018/19. The qualitative component included interviews with 14 health professionals (doctors, nurses, and midwives), five key informants from relevant organisations, and four focus group discussions with pregnant women attending antenatal clinics at the two study sites. Quantitative data were analysed using SPSS v28, and qualitative data were thematically analysed using NVivo v12. Data integration occurred during the discussion.</p><p>The study found a CS rate of 50.2% with higher rate in the private compared to the public hospital ( 68.5% vs. 37.1%) and previous CS was the leading indication. The following factors were associated with an increased odd of caesarean section: delivering in private hospital; aged 25 years and above; having four or more antenatal clinic visits; breech presentation; urban residency; gestational age 37- 40 weeks; spontaneous labour; and women not in labour. Robson group 5 (13.9%) was the largest contributor to overall CS rate, followed 3 by group 1 (13.4%), 2 (8.8%), 3 (4.4%) and 6 (2.9%). Similarly, the risk of undergoing CS was high in Robson groups 2, 5, 6 and 7.</p><p>Five themes related to the contributing factors for the increasing caesarean section (CS) rate and four strategies to mitigate this rise emerged from the qualitative component of the study. The five contributing factors identified were: (1) medical factors (repeated CS, complicated referral cases, and breech presentation); (2) sociodemographic factors (advanced maternal age, previous baby, and defensive CS); (3) financial factors (income for private hospitals); (4) non-medical factors (maternal request); and (5) health service-related factors (lack of awareness among midwives/resources, urban centralised health facilities, and absence of appropriate policies and protocols). The four main strategies identified by the study participants to reduce the rising CS rate were: (1) provision of adequate resources to support care during labour and birth (midwives/trained staff and birthing centres); (2) raising awareness of the risks and benefits associated with delivery methods (antenatal education/counselling and public awareness campaigns); (3) reforming CS policies and protocols; and (4) promoting physiological birth.</p><p>The authors concluded that the high Caesarean section rate in the private hospital reflected the medicalisation of childbirth, an issue of public concern that warrants urgent attention. Furthermore, the study provided insight into the contributing factors and strategies to mitigate them.</p><p>Comments</p><p>The study addresses a significant global issue, namely the rising rates of caesarean sections, due to their association with maternal morbidity and mortality. The manuscript is scientifically sound. The introduction provides a comprehensive background to the study, is well-crafted, and identifies the existing gap in the literature. The study design is appropriately aligned with the study's objectives. The methods section is clearly articulated, and there is coherence between the data analysis and the study's aims. The results section is clear and easy to follow. The discussion and conclusion sections are suitably developed. Relevant references have been appropriately cited.</p><p>The following comments are made to further improve the manuscript:</p><p>1. Grammar : The manuscript will benefit from English language editing to improve flow and reduce repetition</p><p>2. It would be beneficial to the readers if you provide additional background on the number of public and private hospitals in Nepal , the area where the study was conducted and how or why the two hospitals were selected.</p><p>3. About sample size calculation and error margin of 10% was added to the private hospital sample to compensate for incomplete records which was not the case with public hospital sample. Does this mean that public hospital records in Nepal are always complete? This seems not to be the case in most of the studies around the world. Suggest you provide an explanation regarding this decision.</p><p>4. Please include a statement on the sampling strategy for the interviews. Did you use convenient sampling technique?</p><p>5. Please provide a comment on the type of thematic analysis used in this study.</p><p>6. Results- please revise first paragraph to remove some redundancy , e.g. The overall CS rate was 50.2% with higher rate in the private (68.5%) compared to the public (37.1%) and higher rate of elective CS (55.7%, 61.9% ) compared to emergency (44.3% ,38.1%) in the public and private hospital respectively. Consider using the same approach to the rest of this section (focus on key findings and avoid repetition).</p><p>7. Please also respond to the comments from the reviewers</p><p>Thank you once more for submitting your study to PLOSONE. Looking forward to the revised manuscript.</p><p>[Note: HTML markup is below.

The objectives and findings of the study are clearly defined and written in an appropriate scientific manner. The manuscript is easy to ready and follow.</p><p>However, I have few comments:</p><p>1. Under Introduction the statement below could be better phrased:</p><p>Globally, rates in 2000 were double (21&#x000b7;1% vs 12.1%) that in 2015 [6]. It is predicted that the global CS rate will increase to 28.5% in 2030 with the lowest rate (7.1%) in Sub-Saharan Africa and highest (63.4%) in Eastern Asia [7]</p><p>2. Under methods:</p><p>a) The study method could be better elaborated, in terms of qualitative data collection. Were the interviews collected at the same as (concurrent) with data collection from the files?</p><p>b) The selection patient's file, if it could be elaborated on how the files were chosen.</p><p>c) Briefly summarising what the qualitative data questions asked</p><p>3. Under 3.5 Factors associated with mode of childbirth:</p><p>The findings and the statements quoted from participants feels more like repetition, in some of instances bringing no additional value.</p><p>For example, below under section 3.7.3 below</p><p>3.7.3 Reform policies and protocols for CS</p><p>Some interviewees recommended that the government should create policy to reward hospitals with high normal birth, to investigate reasons for high CS rates, to run programmes to increase morale of doctors and to promote audits to reduce unnecessary CS. Such policy reform could encourage more normal deliveries in hospitals:</p><p>&#x0201c;&#x02026;create protocol/guideline to be followed to reduce unwanted CS... programs to increase morale of the physicians, encouraging strategy. The hospital that has more normal delivery had to be awarded. If it is encouraging there will be competition in the hospital, so more 26 vaginal delivery can be done or in a hospital where most of the CS are done, the government should investigate the cause of more CS. Auditing can also reduce CS because when there is inquiry, then people become aware that unnecessary CS should not be done&#x02026;&#x0201d; (P10)</p><p>4. Table 1 &#x00026; 3 could be combined Table 4 &#x00026; 6 as well</p><p>Reviewer #2:&#x000a0;1. Please clarify the period and duration of the study in the abstract, similar to the manuscript, as the abstract has two different study periods (2021 &#x00026; 2018-19).</p><p>2. Kindly provide the most recent CS rate report.</p><p>3. As the authors have mentioned 14 healthcare professionals, please ensure that you mention how many doctors, nurses, and midwives specifically.</p><p>4. Do you have any questionnaires based on which the interview was conducted?</p><p>5. Was the questionnaire validated? If so, mention the same in the methodology section of the manuscript. If the questionnaire was not validated, mention the same as limitations of the study.</p><p>6. Was pre-test done for questionnaire validation? If so, what is the percentage of the population on which the pretest was performed?</p><p>7. Please provide a table of demographic characteristics of the patients included in the study.</p><p>8. Ensure to provide figure legends for the figures.</p><p>9. Please mention the ethical approval number in the main manuscript.</p><p>10. Discuss the limitations of the study.</p><p>**********</p><p>6.
