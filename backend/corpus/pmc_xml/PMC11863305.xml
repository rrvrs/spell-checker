resources (i.e. money, professionals and time) should be allocated in relation to
political goals, unstable health expenditures growth and citizens&#x02019; limitless
healthcare needs due to advances in treatments and screening procedures (<xref rid="ref029" ref-type="bibr">Seixas <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2021</xref>;
<xref rid="ref017" ref-type="bibr">Kuhlmann <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>,
2024</xref>). This crucial task of deciding on what is covered (or not covered)
is made at all levels in a healthcare system: within a pre-determined budget for
each area of care, between areas of care, on a macro level between principal and
contracted providers and even across sectors. This article focuses on primary
healthcare (PHC), which has a central multipurpose function within a publicly funded
healthcare system covering various areas and sectors.</p><p>PHC serves as a means of diminishing inequities in health by providing affordable and
accessible care for the population (<xref rid="ref031" ref-type="bibr">Starfield
<italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="ref033" ref-type="bibr">Van Lerbergerg, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="ref205" ref-type="bibr">Rasanathan <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). A review concludes
that PHC is a useful strategy in reducing pressure on the overall health systems by
acting as a gatekeeper to more expensive specialists (<xref rid="ref031" ref-type="bibr">Starfield <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2005</xref>), especially
in the pursuit of cost-effective organisation (<xref rid="ref031" ref-type="bibr">Starfield <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="ref034" ref-type="bibr">Van Weel and Kidd, 2018</xref>). PHC has gained extensive
responsibilities and has high expectations of providing a wide range of care
services to achieve political goals, such as availability, disease prevention and
patient education (<xref rid="ref034" ref-type="bibr">Van Weel and Kidd,
2018</xref>; <xref rid="ref205" ref-type="bibr">Rasanathan
<italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). Availability in terms of time
and geography, as well as the organisational structure of PHC, is important to have
a robust PHC (<xref rid="ref031" ref-type="bibr">Starfield
<italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="ref034" ref-type="bibr">Van Weel and Kidd, 2018</xref>), and it has also been argued as
vital for building and retaining the public&#x02019;s trust, so they want to continue
paying taxes to fund healthcare systems. However, studies have shown that the
context in which healthcare professionals make priorities is changed by decisions
and reforms made by politicians, regulators and policymakers (<xref rid="ref001" ref-type="bibr">Arnell, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="ref035" ref-type="bibr">Vengberg
<italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2021</xref>). Consequently, in the everyday
work of PHC healthcare professionals, deciding what is prioritised (and what is not)
does not follow a &#x0201c;one fits all&#x0201d; solution, as priorities are adapted
to fit the situation, patients' influx and previous decisions on healthcare
coverage (<xref rid="ref013" ref-type="bibr">Holm&#x000e9;r
<italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2023</xref>).</p><p>Despite PHC having a multipurpose function, not least in terms of political
strategies, the governance of PHC is still largely underexplored. However, previous
research on healthcare governance and resource allocation at large, including its
priorities, suggests that &#x0201c;real-world&#x0201d; priorities in &#x0201c;the
complex multi-layered governance context&#x0201d; (<xref rid="ref014" ref-type="bibr">Kislov <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2021</xref>) are often unformalised and
implicit (<xref rid="ref027" ref-type="bibr">Rooshenas
<italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="ref014" ref-type="bibr">Kislov <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2021</xref>) and are usually
based on historical decisions (<xref rid="ref003" ref-type="bibr">Cromwell
<italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="ref029" ref-type="bibr">Seixas <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2021</xref>). Studies on
priority setting have focused on enhancing the allocation process by developing and
improving the formal framework of priority setting and its criteria and tools (<xref rid="ref019" ref-type="bibr">Mitton, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="ref037" ref-type="bibr">Williams <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="ref014" ref-type="bibr">Kislov <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>,
2021</xref>). A systematic review (<xref rid="ref029" ref-type="bibr">Seixas
<italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2021</xref>) revealed that a wide range of
stakeholders were involved in formal priority-setting processes, including
administrators, government officials and healthcare professionals. Politicians were
involved, but their political interference was less prominent when frameworks were
more robust. Previous studies show that governance arrangements demand a more
dynamic relationship between politicians and healthcare professionals (<xref rid="ref037" ref-type="bibr">Williams <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>,
2011</xref>; <xref rid="ref007" ref-type="bibr">Garpenby and Nedlund,
2016</xref>; <xref rid="ref006" ref-type="bibr">Fredriksson
<italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2019</xref>). It has been argued that
politicians depend on guidance from experts, such as medical or economic experts,
when making priority and rationing decisions in healthcare (<xref rid="ref026" ref-type="bibr">Rodwin, 2001</xref>). This could be due to the constant changes in
structural conditions and the involvement of stakeholders with different
responsibilities and specific interests (<xref rid="ref004" ref-type="bibr">Denis
<italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="ref005" ref-type="bibr">Dickinson <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). In several
qualitative studies (<xref rid="ref005" ref-type="bibr">Dickinson
<italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="ref030" ref-type="bibr">Smith <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="ref007" ref-type="bibr">Garpenby and Nedlund, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="ref006" ref-type="bibr">Fredriksson <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>,
2019</xref>), politicians&#x02019; relational leadership is identified as a
critical strategy used in navigating in this dynamic setting. Additionally, a case
study (<xref rid="ref010" ref-type="bibr">Gille <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>,
2020</xref>) highlights the importance of political leadership when establishing
what to exclude and not include in publicly funded healthcare coverage. Political
leadership has been highlighted as essential in retaining legitimacy in times of
austerity; several qualitative studies show that processes and decisions need to be
considered both fair and trustworthy among the actors internally involved in the
process &#x02013; e.g.&#x000a0;health professionals, managers, politicians (<xref rid="ref020" ref-type="bibr">Nedlund and Bareoe, 2014</xref>) and the public
(<xref rid="ref011" ref-type="bibr">Griffiths, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="ref009" ref-type="bibr">Gibson <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2005</xref>;
<xref rid="ref025" ref-type="bibr">Robinson <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>,
2012</xref>; <xref rid="ref010" ref-type="bibr">Gille
<italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2020</xref>).</p><p>The political nature of allocating and prioritising, especially in contexts where
simple solutions are unavailable, involves stakeholders constructing
situation-specific priority-setting narratives by discursively deploying tensions
and contradictions between different rationales (<xref rid="ref014" ref-type="bibr">Kislov <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2021</xref>). Increasing budgetary
pressures may have pushed politicians, regulators and policymakers to engage more
explicitly in priority-setting procedures and healthcare coverage decisions.
Although important research has investigated the implications of prioritisation,
budget cuts, policy reforms and decisions regarding PHC and PHC professionals (<xref rid="ref002" ref-type="bibr">Carlsen and Nordheim, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="ref036" ref-type="bibr">Werntoft and Edberg, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="ref035" ref-type="bibr">Vengberg <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>,
2021</xref>; <xref rid="ref013" ref-type="bibr">Holm&#x000e9;r
<italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2023</xref>), less attention has been paid
to the role of politicians in the governance of public PHC. The aim of this study is
to explore how politicians responsible for making decisions pertaining to healthcare
coverage navigate the governance of public PHC, given the constraints of finite
resources and limitless healthcare needs. This will be disentangled in the form of
narratives based on different types of underlying rationales.</p><sec id="sec001.1"><title>Theorising governance as narratives based on different underlying
rationales</title><p>One way of understanding PHC governance is to adopt a critical interpretive
policy perspective. Following the taxonomy offered by <xref rid="ref021" ref-type="bibr">Nedlund and Nordh (2018)</xref>, various competing underlying
rationales are in play in governance and its practices. They explain that
rationales entail assumptions, norms and values that can justify a course of
action, such as in the case of governance and practice. Rationales guide what
constitutes a problem, commonly by fronting the problem&#x02019;s inherent
solution. What are regarded as appropriate solutions following one rationale
might be denoted as irrational, illogical and senseless when framed within
another. Multiple rationales run parallel to each other, although some can be
more dominating than others and occasionally totally overarching (<xref rid="ref007" ref-type="bibr">Garpenby and Nedlund, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="ref021" ref-type="bibr">Nedlund and Nordh, 2018</xref>). In
priority-setting, politicians interweave various rationales to justify their
focus on specific areas, programmes, projects or processes in priority setting
(<xref rid="ref015" ref-type="bibr">Klein, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="ref007" ref-type="bibr">Garpenby and Nedlund, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="ref014" ref-type="bibr">Kislov <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>,
2021</xref>).</p><p>In healthcare governance, stakeholders create narratives based on underlying
rationales, where different features from particular contexts and arguments are
brought to the fore (<xref rid="ref018" ref-type="bibr">Lehoux
<italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="ref021" ref-type="bibr">Nedlund and Nordh, 2018</xref>; <xref rid="ref008" ref-type="bibr">Garpenby and Nedlund, 2022</xref>). In a study on the influx of
controversial health technologies, <xref rid="ref018" ref-type="bibr">Lehoux
<italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. (2010)</xref> show that medical
specialists combined arguments based on different rationales to create a purpose
for why technologies should be used in which some assumptions
<italic>&#x0201c;</italic><italic>[</italic><italic>&#x02026;</italic><italic>]</italic>
<italic>are explicit, while others remain tacit. Some are brought forward while
others are omitted.&#x0201d;</italic> A study by <xref rid="ref008" ref-type="bibr">Garpenby and Nedlund (2022)</xref> on the interface between the
patient and different actor groups in health care, including politicians, showed
that the same actor group can connect to and display various rationales and can
also shift narratives and arguments depending on the situational context
(societal or individual and systemic or professional accounts). Following this
theoretical reasoning, politicians create narratives in their governance of PHC
and simultaneously employ different narratives based on different
rationales.</p><p>In the present study, drawing from <xref rid="ref021" ref-type="bibr">Nedlund and
Nordh&#x02019;s (2018)</xref> and <xref rid="ref018" ref-type="bibr">Lehoux
<italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>.&#x02019;s (2010)</xref> taxonomy, we use
three rationales &#x02013; scientific, clinical and cultural &#x02013; as an
analytical framework in PHC governance analysis.</p><p>Scientific rationale acknowledges positivistic science and technocratic reasoning
and emphasises the importance of facts and evidence in the discovery of
&#x0201c;truth&#x0201d; (<xref rid="ref018" ref-type="bibr">Lehoux
<italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="ref021" ref-type="bibr">Nedlund and Nordh, 2018</xref>). Knowledge achieved through
scientific studies such as clinical trials and randomised controlled studies is
held in high regard. Scientific rationale focuses on aspects related to
evidence, such as collecting enough data to determine the effectiveness of a
therapy and ensuring studies are carried out to a high standard (<xref rid="ref018" ref-type="bibr">Lehoux <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>,
2010</xref>). Policies within this rationale are regarded as value-free.
Scientific rationale is also driven by ideas such as economic reasoning in terms
of cost-effectiveness, streamlining and optimisation. Furthermore,
technical/technocratic solutions or better scientific knowledge may solve social
and political problems (<xref rid="ref021" ref-type="bibr">Nedlund and Nordh,
2018</xref>). This knowledge is held by individuals or institutions claiming
expert knowledge who also significantly influence the cause of action (<xref rid="ref021" ref-type="bibr">Nedlund and Nordh, 2018</xref>).</p><p>A clinical rationale emphasises clinical relevancy, feasibility, standardisation
of care and practices and clinical know-how. <xref rid="ref018" ref-type="bibr">Lehoux <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. (2010)</xref> describe that even
effective treatments/innovations supported by robust scientific evidence might
not be used for patients for various reasons. For instance, the side effects
could restrict patients from participating in their everyday lives, or there
could be issues including such treatments in care units, as units might lack
necessary medical specialists or require extensive training for professionals to
learn the skillset necessary (<xref rid="ref018" ref-type="bibr">Lehoux
<italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). Additionally,
standardisation of clinical practices or guidelines is essential to ensure
quality of care. <xref rid="ref021" ref-type="bibr">Nedlund and Nordh
(2018)</xref> do not distinguish between scientific and clinical rationales.
Still, they describe (referring to <xref rid="ref032" ref-type="bibr">Stone,
1986</xref>) how clinical reasoning is a way of examining individuals,
comparing fixed characteristics and making determinations &#x02013; commonly
based on clinical decision-making about who is entitled to get services. As
such, clinical reasoning functions as a means of gatekeeping. Hence, a clinical
rationale is concerned with assessing and classifying potential patients based
on health states. In contrast to scientific rationale, healthcare
professionals' judgement and proficiency (their &#x0201c;clinical
know-how&#x0201d;) are acquired through clinical experience and practice.</p><p>A cultural rationale encompasses the beliefs, norms, values, desirability and
expectations in society and confers messages about the capacity of society to
solve collective problems (<xref rid="ref021" ref-type="bibr">Nedlund and Nordh,
2018</xref>) and is, therefore, considered in healthcare governance.
Cultural values, such as solidarity, ideas about contributing to common welfare
by paying taxes and responsibility for how taxes are allocated, can also be
included within a cultural rationale (<xref rid="ref021" ref-type="bibr">Nedlund
and Nordh, 2018</xref>). <xref rid="ref018" ref-type="bibr">Lehoux
<italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. (2010)</xref> refer to this rationale as
&#x0201c;social&#x0201d;, explaining that even scientifically proven effective and
feasible innovations may not be adopted due to cultural norms, ideologies,
stigmas or religious connotations. They explain that politicians might hesitate
to provide treatments and screening because such decisions could prove
controversial. The cultural rationale behind potential stigmas related to how
specific health diseases/treatments, as well as historical instances of
healthcare institutions' abuse of power, influence who should get what
services (<xref rid="ref018" ref-type="bibr">Lehoux
<italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="ref021" ref-type="bibr">Nedlund and Nordh, 2018</xref>). Aspects that consider
inequity, such as whether a service is available to everyone or only for those
who can afford it, are also prominent. Commonly, the role of politicians in PHC
governance has been presented as being the citizens&#x02019; representatives, a
narrative based on a cultural rationale.</p></sec><sec id="sec001.2"><title>The Swedish healthcare context</title><p>This present study is conducted in Sweden, where taxes fund public healthcare. In
the Swedish healthcare system, 21 regional healthcare authorities are the main
providers responsible for governing the provision of healthcare for their
citizens at hospitals and PHCs. A total of 290 municipalities also provide PHC
in inpatient settings, such as in nursing homes and through home care. Regions
and municipalities have locally elected politicians and independent powers of
taxation, which grants them considerable autonomy and empowers regional
politicians to govern healthcare in alignment with what they see as best for
their citizens. For PHC, regional politicians formulate explicit goals and
requirements that care units must fulfil. Politicians at the national level have
the power to exercise and govern healthcare through legislation, regulation,
financial incentives, agreements and agenda-setting.</p><p>The Swedish healthcare system aims to achieve good and equitable health in the
population by prioritising publicly financed resources. Sweden is one of the
only a few countries (<xref rid="ref028" ref-type="bibr">Sabik and Lie,
2008</xref>) that have explicit ethical prioritisation principles on how to
allocate resources and has stipulated this in law since 1997 (<xref rid="ref043" ref-type="bibr">Government bill, 1996</xref>; <xref rid="ref012" ref-type="bibr">Health and Medical Services Act, 2017</xref>).
According to Swedish law, the <italic>human dignity principle</italic> is an
overriding principle, stating that all people have equal value and the same
right to care, regardless of personal characteristics or their function within
society. The <italic>need solidarity principle</italic> implies that those in
greater need &#x02013; those with more severe diseases and worse quality of life
&#x02013; should be granted a more significant portion of common healthcare
resources. Finally, <italic>the cost-effectiveness principle</italic> (lexically
ordered) stresses the need for a reasonable relationship between a
treatment&#x02019;s cost and its effects. These principles serve as a basis for
how common resources should be distributed. They are meant to guide
professionals, managers and national, regional and local politicians in
prioritising and rationing decisions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Method</title><p>We applied a qualitative explorative design. Data are based on individual interviews
with regional, locally elected politicians responsible for providing healthcare
services. These politicians were members of regional political boards or committees
directly influencing PHC resource allocation, such as implementing new digital
entryways for patients seeking PHC or changing the financial compensations. To
increase variation in data, purposive sampling in the recruitment of politicians was
performed by recruiting participants from different political parties in three
regional healthcare authorities, with variations in size (250,000&#x02013;450,000
registered inhabitants), organisational structures and available healthcare
services. All participants were recruited through their public email addresses that
were obtained from their political parties or the region&#x02019;s official webpage.
The email contained an information letter and contact information. Two reminder
emails were sent, and one follow-up phone call was conducted one week after the last
email reminder. In total, 15 politicians (10 men and 5 women) were interviewed from
September 2022 to January 2023.</p><p>A semi-structured topic guide with open-ended questions covering areas such as PHC
assignment, health coverage, political control and the influence of political
decision-making on healthcare practice through resource allocation and re-allocation
was designed. Interviews were conducted online (14) and face-to-face (1). Each
interview lasted between 40 and 85&#x000a0;min and was recorded and transcribed
verbatim. The transcribed text was analysed using abductive thematic content
analysis in accordance with <xref rid="ref024" ref-type="bibr">Ritchie
<italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>.&#x02019;s (2003)</xref> &#x0201c;framework
approach&#x0201d;. The research team includes a doctoral student (first author) and
three senior researchers with extensive experience in qualitative methods,
healthcare and policy research.</p><p>The first author (SH) became familiarised with the data by reading the transcripts
several times. Text relevant to the study&#x02019;s aim was highlighted and initially
coded into scientific, clinical or cultural rationales (<xref rid="ref018" ref-type="bibr">Lehoux <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="ref021" ref-type="bibr">Nedlund and Nordh, 2018</xref>). Within each
rationale, three themes were inductively identified: goals/commissions, problematic
situations and preferred solutions. From the first draft, written by SH, tensions
between the narratives and within the rationales were identified and discussed with
AN. The analysis and the manuscript text were revisited and developed in an
iterative process with all authors to ensure the consistency and trustworthiness of
the analysis. The participants responsible for the quotes in
&#x0201c;Findings&#x0201d; have been pseudonymised (P1&#x02013;P15) to protect
confidentiality. According to Swedish legislation (<xref rid="ref041" ref-type="bibr">Ethical Review Act, 2003</xref>), ethical approval is not needed
for ethical human research, as the study did not include any intervention or
sensitive data. The 2014 Declaration of Helsinki guided the study&#x02019;s ethics
(<xref rid="ref042" ref-type="bibr">General Assembly of the World Medical
Association, 2014</xref>). Before the interviews, all politicians received
written information about the research and their rights, stipulating that their
participation was voluntary and that they were free to withdraw at any time. They
were assured of pseudonymisation. Participants verbally consented to participate
before starting the interviews.</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Findings</title><p>The findings follow the theoretical framework, addressing scientific, clinical and
cultural rationales. Within each rationale, three themes emerged (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;1</xref>): (1) goals and commissions
consist of politicians' views or understanding of what PHCs or politicians
must provide for the healthcare system or society and why; (2) problematic
situations consist of situations that politicians identify as problematic in their
role governing PHC and (3) preferred solutions consist of ideas, perspectives or
solutions needed to ease some of the problematic situations related to PHC
governance. The three themes are presented as narratives based on each
rationale.</p><sec id="sec003.1"><title>Primary healthcare governance narratives based on scientific
rationale</title><p>Politicians described PHC as playing a central role in healthcare and referred to
laws that obligate PHC to coordinate patient care with the municipality and
maintain patient continuity. They also argued that, from an economic
perspective, it is better for patients first to visit PHC since it prevents the
use of much more expensive specialist care (hospital care). Politicians viewed
healthcare professionals as experts in maintaining the central role of PHC
(gatekeeper to the rest of healthcare) because of their knowledge regarding when
referrals to other healthcare specialists are necessary.<disp-quote><p>&#x02026;
they [healthcare officials and the regional board] are pretty much in
agreement that primary healthcare is the first line of care, it&#x02019;s
a relatively cheap form of care, and it should be easy to get in touch
with &#x02013;P3</p></disp-quote><disp-quote><p>&#x02026; but we still
have the responsibility to make sure the money is sufficient &#x02026; to
ensure that we&#x02019;ll achieve the results we have promised &#x02026;
&#x02013;P13</p></disp-quote></p><p>The governance of PHC was described as being managed through reimbursement models
by financially compensating for specific measures or results that were of
interest. Politicians highlighted boundaries in their ability to govern,
stipulated either by national-level politicians, the region&#x02019;s political
and organisational structure or the politicians' power to adjust
reimbursement models. For instance, politicians emphasised that financial
compensation was applied to motivate PHC organisations to work towards their
(the politicians') goals for PHC and achieve good quality of care.
Nationally set goals and financial compensation affect regional PHC governance.
For instance, national directions were often understood as <italic>&#x0201c;not
freely chosen work&#x0201d;</italic> (P10) &#x02013; whether or not they were
stipulated by law &#x02013; and politicians acknowledged it changed regional
goals, especially if the national directions/goal fulfilments were combined with
financial compensation. PHC governance was tightly entwined with
politicians' ability to adjust their region&#x02019;s reimbursement
models. Politicians described not having the power to make demands or withhold
financial compensation for those PHC practices that did not fulfil official
requirements. In contrast, other politicians expressed that they could
<italic>&#x0201c;rule with both a stick and a carrot&#x0201d;</italic> (P14)
by not reimbursing unfulfilled goals or adding monetary compensation for goals
that are of specific interest to them.<disp-quote><p>&#x02026; Well, then we put
money toward it and decided &#x02026; that the care units may not be
reimbursed for any number of listed patients with a physician [in PHC],
and that's our way of reducing the number of listed patients per
physician &#x02013;P14</p></disp-quote></p><p>In this narrative, any issues with PHC governance are referred to as
&#x0201c;challenges&#x0201d;. For instance, good accessibility rates for PHC were
challenged by politicians' lack of freedom to employ personnel or compete
for staff against other regions by offering higher wages because they lack
financial resources. Meanwhile, solutions were attributed to freeing up time,
which could compensate for staffing issues or poor PHC accessibility by
streamlining administration, implementing new technical advancements and
changing laws. For instance, instead of sending summons digitally, ordinary mail
could save time.</p><p>Other time-saving solutions included allowing patients to book their own
appointments digitally, contact their PHC centre through chat functions and
allow PHC operations to offer <italic>&#x0201c;net-based visits&#x0201d;</italic>
(P7) through video. Additionally, national-level politicians could, by changing
the law, contribute to more effective use of PHC professionals time. One
politician explained how the existing law allowed general physicians to recover
for 48&#x000a0;h after weekend duties. However, some physicians use this recovery
time to work in other regions or private alternatives, while the ordinary
region&#x02019;s PHC operations remain understaffed.<disp-quote><p>&#x02026; which
means that when physicians go on call on a weekend &#x02026; they get a
lot of free time, and the idea with that [free time] is for them to
recover &#x02026; but it doesn't work that way &#x02026; then they
go out and work somewhere else, in another region
&#x02013;P6</p></disp-quote></p><p>Individuals who were viewed as knowledgeable &#x0201c;experts&#x0201d; had a strong
influence on long-term political decisions. These individuals were described as
having a good reputation, being respected in their field of work, having had a
long, successful career or having a wealth of personal knowledge. Politicians
problematised how transferring decision-making to individuals seen as
&#x0201c;experts&#x0201d; could lead to a narrowed focus. Referring to their
experiences governing during the COVID-19 pandemic, politicians stated that they
trusted their infection control physician&#x02019;s advice on how to proceed with
the vaccination regime for the region. However, they acknowledged that the
expert focused solely on reducing the spread of
infection.<disp-quote><p>&#x02026; there&#x02019;s always a political
dimension, and I think it can be difficult: that politically we should
have, maybe, been a little more involved and made decisions &#x02026;
although &#x02026; it is difficult. Because I very much trust the
professionals who give us advice, or who say &#x02018;let&#x02019;s do it
this way&#x02019; &#x02013;P3</p></disp-quote><disp-quote><p>&#x02026; and
we end up in this, it's a medical assessment, and no politician
can do that -P9</p></disp-quote></p><p>In this narrative, financial compensations mandated by national-level politicians
are described favourably. For instance, the measure of the national waiting-time
guarantee, which guarantees citizens a PHC appointment within a set timeframe,
was emphasised as a crucial, well-designed indicator because it triggers
multiple actions and leads to evaluation. However, politicians problematised the
waiting-time guarantee against prioritising resources according to the need and
solidarity principles and acknowledged there is a conflict, as patients with
less severe healthcare needs are not necessarily those waiting the longest.
Moreover, it is easy for care units to <italic>&#x0201c;trick&#x0201d;</italic>
(P9) measurements to get good results (and financial compensation) by changing
organisational structures, patient flow or processes. One politician explained
how some PHC care units only made appointments one day at a time; when the daily
ratio is exhausted, patients are asked to call back the following day. Patients
would be registered as having had no waiting time, <italic>&#x0201c;but I would
say they had waited for two days&#x0201d;</italic> (P8). Politicians stated
that it is an <italic>&#x0201c;important, democratic question&#x0201d;</italic>
(P2) of what is measured and compensated for in PHC, as &#x0201c;<italic>we might
not measure what we need to measure&#x0201d;</italic> (P2).</p></sec><sec id="sec003.2"><title>Primary healthcare governance narratives based on clinical rationale</title><p>In the clinical narrative, PHC&#x02019;s role is described from a medical and
clinical perspective; PHC plays a central role in providing medical assistance
to patients, which helps to avoid placing unnecessary, non-medically motivated
burdens on units at higher healthcare levels. Moreover, politicians explained
that because large volumes of care throughout life will be managed in PHC, PHC
plays a coordinating role for patients.<disp-quote><p>&#x02026; but I imagine
that it will be the big trawler that goes across the sea and pulls up as
much as possible. And that is the basic idea; that primary care should
sort and triage &#x02013;P15</p></disp-quote></p><p>According to politicians, a lack of resources decreases PHC accessibility and
affects how patients seek care, which obstructs goal fulfilment. Politicians
argued that patients sought care at higher healthcare levels instead of waiting
a little longer. However, they described that healthcare professionals also
contributed to poor use of resources by over-referring patients to higher
healthcare levels, such as to the emergency room (ER). Explanations for
healthcare professionals' behaviour were that they did not know the
patient, had limited work experience in general at that specific healthcare
centre or had a large turnover of rental staff. On the contrary, even
experienced healthcare professionals could refer patients to the ER for
convenience instead of handling them themselves. According to politicians,
healthcare professionals could understand the impact patients' healthcare
needs would have on their own workload. Organisational structures could also
contribute to patients being helped at the wrong healthcare levels. One
politician explained that after-hours PHC is non-strategically placed next door
to the ER and that some patients seek care at the ER since it takes them the
same amount of time to get to the hospital. Additionally, healthcare
professionals' work coordinating patients&#x02019; healthcare was
complicated by the statutory confidentiality, which exists between
municipalities and regions.<disp-quote><p>&#x02026; yes, it could be out of
convenience, too. You think &#x02018;that //if I start this, I understand
that it will be a lot&#x02019; &#x02026; And then I might as well [refer
patients to the ER] &#x02026;
&#x02013;P3</p></disp-quote><disp-quote><p>&#x02026; but it is difficult
to work operationally, so to speak, in cooperation with, for example,
student health &#x02026; which should really be the first contact for our
children and young people, but then &#x02026; there are still two
different authorities, two different legislations which makes a sort of
wall between them [regional and municipalities authorities]
&#x02013;P9</p></disp-quote></p><p>In the clinical narrative, the impact of governance and resource use could be
increased with improvements to clinical operations, for instance, by changing
structures, processes or managers. Politicians explained that PHC struggled with
accessibility through the telephone, as patients could not reach their providers
when they called. They suggested that clinical operations could increase
accessibility by offering daily drop-in times without telephone pre-assessment,
as patients could be attended to directly. Politicians believed that if patients
could seek care whenever they wanted, some would wait longer at home and perhaps
even recover independently, not needing medical assistance at all. Moreover,
having &#x0201c;<italic>good managers</italic>&#x0201d; (P7) and
<italic>&#x0201c;strong leaders&#x0201d;</italic> (P8) was highlighted as
necessary and even crucial for successful governance. Politicians exemplified
how some PHC operations finally fulfilled their political goals and succeeded in
establishing good practices by changing managers.<disp-quote><p>&#x02026; how
important it is to have a good manager &#x02026; Because if you
didn't have that presence in management on the business floor, it
really didn't work when there was such an overload in the
organisation &#x02013;P15</p></disp-quote></p><p>In the clinical narrative, difficulties in governance relate to a lack of
political oversight regarding the organisation and its operational focus.
Therefore, healthcare professionals' feedback on the impact of political
decisions on clinical operations was described as essential. Politicians
emphasised the necessity of feedback to avoid neglecting patients who needed
more time getting undressed, examined or treated to shape realistic compensation
models. According to the politicians, the need for feedback became especially
prominent during COVID-19; since professionals were focused on
<italic>&#x0201c;</italic><italic>managing another day&#x0201d;</italic> (P4),
politicians' insights into operations were minimal. Additionally,
politicians were concerned with how local- and national-level political
decisions impact clinical operations. For instance, state grants meant to reduce
waiting times for patients' initial psychiatric appointments yielded
impressive statistics for first-time visits. Still, patients had to wait up to
two years before treatment could start. According to politicians, these state
grants would affect their region&#x02019;s resource allocation and clinical
operations, as long-term financing ended up being a regional responsibility due
to the grant&#x02019;s short validity time. These state grants were often not
applied for due to their overly detailed focus, which, according to politicians,
would not work in practice. However, state grants with less specificity (like
those used during COVID-19) would be more beneficial for regions and could avoid
detail management at the local level.<disp-quote><p>&#x02026; so, large and wide
is fine, but for God's sake, don't make sure we have more
details in this governance [state grants] &#x02026; because it &#x02026;
doesn't work in practice when it looks different, and there are
different needs &#x02026; it could be that this region has already worked
very well [and cannot be granted the money]
&#x02013;P2</p></disp-quote></p></sec><sec id="sec003.3"><title>Primary healthcare governance narratives based on cultural rationale</title><p>In this narrative, PHC plays a central role in relation to the idea that the
political mission is to be responsible for all citizens. Politicians emphasised
that their responsibility and political mission is to govern while keeping all
citizens in mind, not only patients. For instance, politicians argued that PHC
is important in preventing citizens from getting sick by offering preventive
measures. According to politicians, citizens also have a personal responsibility
to engage in self-care to prevent sickness.<disp-quote><p>I think that primary
care also plays a fairly large role in the preventive and outreach work
of the healthcare system when it comes to public health and public
health issues &#x02013;P5</p></disp-quote></p><p>Politicians have a civic starting point for ideas or solutions that could be
beneficial. For instance, they expressed concern for how comorbid patients are
treated, as they tend to be sent around in the healthcare system as
<italic>&#x0201c;ping-pong balls&#x0201d;</italic> (P4). Moreover,
<italic>&#x0201c;from a citizen&#x02019;s perspective&#x0201d;</italic> (P2),
PHC must be easily accessible, as a simple phone call could suffice to achieve a
sense of security for the caller. By adapting opening hours to its community and
enabling access to care through digital means for faraway citizens,
accessibility can be achieved. Politicians included inclusivity as one
accessibility aspect. They argued that information should be accessible in
various forms rather than only online or via text, as not all citizens are
technically knowledgeable or literate. Moreover, politicians emphasised that PHC
facilities should be included in municipal city planning when building new
neighbourhoods to be where citizens are and to fulfil their central role. They
highlighted the importance of continuity through a
<italic>&#x0201c;stable&#x0201d;</italic> healthcare contact that knows
patients and their families.<disp-quote><p>&#x02026; yes, but it is how we are
citizens of a society, and one part is about the municipality that has
municipal healthcare, and for the regions, it&#x02019;s about healthcare
[regions are responsible for healthcare in municipalities], and citizens
are caught in between &#x02013;P13</p></disp-quote></p><p>In the cultural narrative, human interaction is a vital form of PHC governance,
and according to politicians, transparency in governance is achieved through
dialogues with citizens, municipalities, members of the same and other parties.
However, based on politicians' experiences governing during the COVID-19
pandemic, the strained situation forced regions, municipalities and politicians
across all political parties to cooperate and <italic>&#x0201c;just solve
things</italic>&#x0201d; (P1), and more extensive political discussions were
put on hold. Even though all political meetings were held digitally, politicians
emphasised they could not fully compensate for the lack of face-to-face
conversations, as people were not as talkative <italic>&#x0201c;through Zoom as
in real life&#x0201d;</italic> (P1) and meeting spots that facilitated
spontaneous dialogues vanished when everybody worked remotely. Politicians
emphasised that as the dialogues stopped, the power to govern was transferred to
the officials. They further elaborated that even though officials informed them
of a citizens' perspective about how things were in healthcare, they had
difficulty grasping the whole picture, as they understood the information to be
filtered.<disp-quote><p>&#x02026; as a politician, going around the care
units and asking for things, that is, quite literally &#x02026; setting
up meetings with people and asking questions, it&#x02019;s an
underestimated form of governance &#x02026; and perhaps it is a means of
control that we underestimate &#x02026; because it's not like this
formally, // &#x02026; there are no protocols
&#x02013;P4</p></disp-quote></p><p>According to the politicians, national-level governance is welcomed if it
strengthens citizens&#x02019; rights and promotes health equity without
transferring power to the state. The law stipulating a patient&#x02019;s right to
choose a healthcare provider was exemplified as a good example of national-level
governance. Other <italic>&#x0201c;reasonable&#x0201d;</italic> (P5)
national-level decisions are those that promote equity between the 21 healthcare
regions. In contrast, politicians emphasised risks, given national-level
politicians&#x02019; 2023 election promises to nationalise healthcare. According
to politicians, knowledge about local society, experiences, traditions and local
collaborations and citizen assembly work is essential to adapt healthcare to
citizens&#x02019; needs, but with nationalised healthcare, everybody would be
required to do things the same way, and health equity could be
thwarted.<disp-quote><p>&#x02026; there&#x02019;s not the same tradition,
and then to demand that everyone should sort of do this in the same way,
which easily happens when the state is giving an assignment, I think
there is a risk, a big risk with that &#x02013;P5</p></disp-quote></p><p>In this narrative, political initiatives can help PHC uphold its goal and include
other community areas that might extend outside the borders of healthcare. For
instance, politicians described that to secure and increase the long-term
foundation of healthcare professionals, some parts of the medical education
programme were expanded to their region, as <italic>&#x0201c;those who move to
university usually do not move back home</italic>&#x0201d; (P1). Other
initiatives included facilitating entertainment services or helping certain
stores open up to attract people to settle in smaller cities. However, they
emphasised that such political initiatives do not always work due to fear of
consequences: for the citizens or for themselves as politicians. For instance,
there will probably not be any change in the law allowing general physicians to
recover for 48&#x000a0;h after weekend duties because national-level politicians
fear the social consequences that will follow a physician&#x02019;s strike,
<italic>&#x0201c;and we all know who will get the sympathy&#x0201d;</italic>
<italic>(</italic>P6). Additionally, politicians state that they must support
those who have made tough choices when setting priorities, even though citizens
might express discontent and not re-elect them.<disp-quote><p>&#x02026; and
that's where politics has to be fully supported &#x02026; there
have actually been times when the patients don't get what they
want, complaint to politicians who then do not support [the managers],
but back down, saying &#x02018;and yes, but of course, this patient
should have the right to this and that&#x02019; and that's not
okay &#x02013;P10</p></disp-quote></p><p>In the cultural narrative, all issues related to prioritisation concern aspects
of health equity. Politicians highlight that not everybody can enjoy PHC
services, as complicated processes might require active patients to complete all
steps. They acknowledge that in their role as politicians, it might be necessary
to express opinions on how PHC clinical operations organise themselves to make
healthcare services accessible for all citizens. Moreover, politicians
acknowledge that offering preventive care &#x02013; when resources should be
prioritised according to healthcare needs, creates an issue, as healthy citizens
compete with already-ill patients, what is to be considered illness or disease
is not always clear, and the threshold determining when healthcare is needed is
uncertain.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Discussion</title><p>This study contributes to the knowledge about governance of public PHC by
demonstrating how politicians lean on various rationales (scientific, clinical and
cultural rationales) in PHC governance. It sheds light on nuances in
politicians&#x02019; governance and reveals how politicians, due to budgetary
pressure, are pushed to govern PHC with strategies not only based on historical
decisions. Moreover, it illustrates tensions within and between different rationales
when prioritising resources according to healthcare needs.</p><p>Our research illuminates the political role of navigating diverse narratives and,
consequently, different strategies for handling similar problematic situations.
Within all narratives, a lack of personnel was described as the main reason PHC has
difficulties upholding its goal/commission of being the frontline of healthcare
services. However, within each rationale, attention is directed to different
solutions, such as technical advances (scientific), organisational improvements
(clinical) and expanding medical education (cultural). Hence, these preferred
solutions require politicians to use different strategies, as the solutions are
feasible within different time spans and require different levels of involvement,
dialogues and agreements with various stakeholders or authorities to succeed. Other
researchers (<xref rid="ref004" ref-type="bibr">Denis
<italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2001</xref>) have pointed out that political
change is driven by cyclical or sporadic patterns. Our research complements these
findings by showing that navigating narratives and strategies also follows political
temporality and cycles. It shows that, at times, it might be more tactical for
politicians to use different narratives or to not introduce preferred solutions that
could entail major consequences when it is time to determine PHC budgets, as
external and internal opinions carry weight.</p><p>Tension exists between narratives and within and between rationales. For instance,
within the scientific rationale, there is tension regarding the use of financial
incentives combined with certain indicators to motivate care units to align with
important political goals. Assessments might be essential when concluding that
political decisions are carried out and in retaining the public&#x02019;s trust in
welfare (<xref rid="ref010" ref-type="bibr">Gille <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>,
2020</xref>). On the other hand, only depending on what aspects of care are
measured and financially compensated (<xref rid="ref035" ref-type="bibr">Vengberg
<italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>., 2021</xref>) could crowd out greater
healthcare needs, potentially undermining the achievement of equitable care and the
population&#x02019;s good health and eventually harming public trust. However, the
narrative based on the clinical rationale suggests that politicians balance these
tensions through feedback from healthcare professionals by shaping financial
incentives that mirror everyday work to prevent systematic crowding out of patients
who require more time to be examined or treated. The&#x000a0;clinical and cultural
rationales exemplify tensions between the two solutions. For instance, the clinical
rationale focuses on change and improvements in organisational processes and
structures, while the cultural rationale focuses on who benefits from the
organisational improvements in terms of fulfilling political goals and adhering to
the budget, compromising equality. Previous studies have shown that the operational
aspects of care units matter when it comes to who eventually gets access to care
(<xref rid="ref036" ref-type="bibr">Werntoft and Edberg, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="ref013" ref-type="bibr">Holm&#x000e9;r <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>,
2023</xref>). Our finding implies that politicians must voice their concerns
regarding solutions driven by care units affecting how patient groups are
prioritised (or not prioritised). Politicians also need to monitor how such
solutions affect the pre-determined budget.</p><p>Politicians' power to govern healthcare coverage can be limited, even with
various governance strategies available. Relational leadership has been emphasised
as a key role in priority-setting (<xref rid="ref023" ref-type="bibr">Reelder
<italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="ref037" ref-type="bibr">Williams <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2011</xref>), as
politicians might need to use different strategies to address the power dynamic
within healthcare (<xref rid="ref004" ref-type="bibr">Denis
<italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="ref007" ref-type="bibr">Garpenby and Nedlund, 2016</xref>). Our findings complement these
assumptions and show how politicians use different narratives, addressing different
stakeholders, medical experts (scientific), healthcare professionals/managers
(clinical) and the public (cultural) to keep their decision-making power. These
narratives are useful for addressing various priority-setting dilemmas. Politicians
might end up as bystanders due to leaning on experts (<xref rid="ref026" ref-type="bibr">Rodwin, 2001</xref>); however, as shown in our study, this may also
be the case in&#x000a0;situations where feedback from care units and dialogues with
citizens are lacking. Hence, relational leadership seems important in political
governance so that decisions are based on the best available knowledge, create a
good working situation for healthcare professionals and are best for long-term
healthcare resourcing.</p><p>A noticeable finding is that there seem to be tensions between various political
responsibilities: being accountable for all citizens and maintaining their trust in
welfare by allocating common resources to those with greater healthcare needs and
promoting preventive measures for healthy citizens &#x02013; who compete for the same
finite resources as healthcare measures for patients &#x02013; all while staying
within the pre-determined budget. Our research suggests that politicians attempt to
navigate these equal responsibilities via different narratives in a political
temporality.</p><sec id="sec004.1"><title>Methodological considerations</title><p>In qualitative research, purposive sampling is an appropriate technique when
recruiting participants with different experiences governing various political
organisations, ensuring data richness (<xref rid="ref022" ref-type="bibr">Patton, 2014</xref>). The findings' credibility is enhanced by the
thorough description of the participants, the topic guide and the data
collection and analysis processes (<xref rid="ref022" ref-type="bibr">Patton,
2014</xref>; <xref rid="ref016" ref-type="bibr">Korstjens and Moser,
2018</xref>). We consider that our research group&#x02019;s methodological
and subject competence and the constant movement between data, analysis and
writing strengthen the study&#x02019;s credibility (<xref rid="ref024" ref-type="bibr">Ritchie <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). The
results from our qualitative methods can be used in future studies to develop
quantitative studies to capture a larger sample. We consider the findings to be
transferable to other democratic healthcare systems that offer public PHC.
Moreover, we acknowledge that the rationales might be weighted differently in
different healthcare systems.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our study provides insights into how PHC&#x02019;s multipurpose function implicates
tensions between politicians' different responsibilities regarding healthcare
coverage, such as prioritising and distributing common resources and maintaining the
public&#x02019;s and staff&#x02019;s trust. Our study shows how politicians navigate
various coexisting rationals with some being more dominant than others and where
tensions also exist between them. In this balancing act, they create narratives
addressing different stakeholders and priority-setting dilemmas, reflecting the
diverse rationales. It displays the complexity of the political role, how different
narratives are used to address priority-setting dilemmas and how governance must be
adjusted to the context, especially in PHC. Our study reveals that politicians play
a crucial role in PHC governance and priorities, balancing rationales that might
otherwise become overly dominant.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was funded by the Swedish National Centre for Priorities in Health. Open
