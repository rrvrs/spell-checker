The motivational state that often underlies such boomerang effects is known as reactance (<xref rid="bibr12-00936502241306707" ref-type="bibr">Brehm, 1966</xref>). To better understand this phenomenon, communication researchers have devoted considerable attention to identifying message features likely to instigate reactance (<xref rid="bibr64-00936502241306707" ref-type="bibr">Ratcliff, 2021</xref>; <xref rid="bibr65-00936502241306707" ref-type="bibr">Reynolds-Tylus, 2019</xref>; <xref rid="bibr66-00936502241306707" ref-type="bibr">Rosenberg &#x00026; Siegel, 2018</xref>).</p><p>Most such work has focused on <italic toggle="yes">verbal</italic> message features, such as forceful language, leaving open the question of how <italic toggle="yes">visual</italic> message features might induce reactance. This is unfortunate given that imagery has become the dominant element in modern persuasive campaigns (<xref rid="bibr42-00936502241306707" ref-type="bibr">Kjeldsen, 2012</xref>). From these circumstances, two questions emerge: Do variations in imagery have the potential to instigate reactance? If so, what kinds of visual message features threaten people&#x02019;s freedom to choose and, by doing so, arouse reactance?</p><p>This research considered three message features that might be seen as a constraint on choice: low- versus eye-level camera angle, visual antithesis versus thesis (i.e., juxtaposition of contrasting images vs. a single image), and facial expression of anger versus happiness. In what follows, we discuss the context of the investigation, review the theory of reactance, derive hypotheses, and consider a person-level moderator (i.e., political orientation), before presenting two experiments designed to test the veracity of our thinking.</p><sec id="section1-00936502241306707"><title>Context: Pro-environmental Appeals</title><p>Despite the millions of francs spent annually to convince Swiss residents to lower their CO2 emissions, most do not view the issue as a priority. Instead, they report a willingness to accept limits on consumption and mobility only if those restrictions are compatible with their lifestyle and do not affect their personal freedoms (<xref rid="bibr74-00936502241306707" ref-type="bibr">SRG SSR, 2017</xref>). Although 81% indicated that they would pay higher prices for local and seasonal products, only 43% were willing to reduce their living space, and only 40% were willing to give up their car. A reluctance to make personal sacrifices may help explain why the distance travelled by cars and motorcycles in Switzerland skyrocketed by 26% since 2000, leading to a substantive increase in greenhouse gas emissions (Federal Office for the Environment FOEN, 2021). Because this is a rich, pressing, and consequential topic, our research examined messages that urged Swiss residents to reduce their carbon footprint.</p></sec><sec id="section2-00936502241306707"><title>Reactance Theory</title><p>The theory of reactance consists of four causally-ordered components (<xref rid="bibr12-00936502241306707" ref-type="bibr">Brehm, 1966</xref>). The notion of <italic toggle="yes">freedom</italic> assumes that, to varying degrees, human ability to choose is unconstrained. Anything that makes it more difficult to exercise one&#x02019;s freedom to choose constitutes a <italic toggle="yes">threat to freedom.</italic> Social pressure, in the form of attempted persuasion, is the threat to freedom of greatest interest to communication science.</p><p><italic toggle="yes">Reactance</italic> describes the &#x0201c;the motivational state that is hypothesized to occur when a freedom is eliminated or threatened with elimination&#x0201d; (<xref rid="bibr13-00936502241306707" ref-type="bibr">Brehm &#x00026; Brehm, 1981</xref>, p. 37). Reactance was initially conceptualized as a hypothetical construct that could not be measured directly (<xref rid="bibr13-00936502241306707" ref-type="bibr">Brehm &#x00026; Brehm, 1981</xref>). However, <xref rid="bibr23-00936502241306707" ref-type="bibr">Dillard and Shen (2005)</xref> showed that reactance could be operationalized as a single construct that involves anger and critical cognitions. The underlying assumption is that people respond to freedom-threatening messages with negative feelings toward the message (i.e., anger) and cognitions critical of the message (i.e., counter-arguing or some variant thereof). Empirical findings corroborate this conceptualization (<xref rid="bibr62-00936502241306707" ref-type="bibr">Rains, 2013</xref>).</p><p>When people feel that their freedom to choose is threatened, they become motivated to re-establish that freedom or prevent any further loss of that freedom. People may choose direct or indirect <italic toggle="yes">restoration</italic> strategies to regain a sense of autonomy. Direct restoration involves performing the forbidden behavior. Indirect restoration can take a variety of forms including derogating the source of threat (<xref rid="bibr62-00936502241306707" ref-type="bibr">Rains, 2013</xref>), denying the threat (<xref rid="bibr85-00936502241306707" ref-type="bibr">Worchel et al., 1976</xref>), or rejecting the message and its advocacy (<xref rid="bibr30-00936502241306707" ref-type="bibr">Gardner &#x00026; Leshner, 2016</xref>). Overall, the theory of reactance can be conceptualized as a two-step sequence (threat &#x02192; reactance &#x02192; [counter]persuasion) in which the effects of threat on persuasion are fully mediated by reactance (<xref rid="bibr59-00936502241306707" ref-type="bibr">Quick &#x00026; Stephenson, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bibr62-00936502241306707" ref-type="bibr">Rains, 2013</xref>). These two propositions have been demonstrated to hold in many investigations (<xref rid="bibr62-00936502241306707" ref-type="bibr">Rains, 2013</xref>).

This is unfortunate in light of the widespread incorporation of images into persuasive messages (<xref rid="bibr42-00936502241306707" ref-type="bibr">Kjeldsen, 2012</xref>) and the evidence that imagery can influence cognition and emotion (i.e., the components of reactance) (<xref rid="bibr68-00936502241306707" ref-type="bibr">Seo &#x00026; Dillard, 2019a</xref>, <xref rid="bibr69-00936502241306707" ref-type="bibr">2019b</xref>). One exception is the handful of anti-smoking studies that focus on the use of gruesome images to illustrate the severity of the consequences of smoking. They depict the hazards of smoking, for instance, by showing diseased lungs or an intubated patient dying of lung cancer (<xref rid="bibr77-00936502241306707" ref-type="bibr">U.S. Food &#x00026; Drug Administration (FDA), 2020</xref>). Such imagery has been linked to a variety of outcomes including threat to freedom (<xref rid="bibr33-00936502241306707" ref-type="bibr">Hall et al., 2018</xref>), anger (<xref rid="bibr28-00936502241306707" ref-type="bibr">Erceg-Hurn &#x00026; Steed, 2011</xref>), reactance (<xref rid="bibr33-00936502241306707" ref-type="bibr">Hall et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="bibr47-00936502241306707" ref-type="bibr">LaVoie et al., 2017</xref>), and decreased persuasion (<xref rid="bibr33-00936502241306707" ref-type="bibr">Hall et al., 2018</xref>). This set of studies make a clear and important contribution to persuasion science. Perhaps even more could be learned by examining reactance effects in a broader range of image variations.</p></sec><sec id="section4-00936502241306707"><title>Imagery and Reactance</title><p>One challenge to studying imagery is classification. Images vary on a myriad of dimensions, which allows for an equal number of classification schemes (e.g., <xref rid="bibr58-00936502241306707" ref-type="bibr">Peterson et al., 2021</xref>). To reduce this to a tractable number, we selected image variations that conformed to three criteria. (a) To ensure breadth, image features were chosen based on their conceptual distinctiveness. Building on social semiotics (<xref rid="bibr46-00936502241306707" ref-type="bibr">Kress &#x00026; van Leeuwen, 2006</xref>), we differentiated image features based on visual content information (i.e., the denotative and connotative meanings of an image), visual relational information (i.e., the relationship that is implied between the image and the audience), and compositional information (i.e., the aspects that are highlighted and made salient through visual arrangement). (b) To ensure external validity, we selected only image features that are in common use.<sup>
<xref rid="fn1-00936502241306707" ref-type="fn">1</xref>
</sup> (c) Because the smoking studies (<xref rid="bibr28-00936502241306707" ref-type="bibr">Erceg-Hurn &#x00026; Steed, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bibr33-00936502241306707" ref-type="bibr">Hall et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="bibr47-00936502241306707" ref-type="bibr">LaVoie et al., 2017</xref>) had already explored gruesome, graphic images of individuals, we did not consider comparable photos used in environmental communication (e.g., a photo used in a campaign of the World Wildlife Fund showing a human with a fish head, suggesting that climate change will drastically change humanity). This subjective, but thorough process identified the three image features that comprise the focus of this study. We turn to them next, moving from the most subtle to the most obvious.</p><sec id="section5-00936502241306707"><title>Camera Angle</title><p>The first variation was camera angle, a feature that conveys information about the relationship between the image and the audience (i.e., visual relational information). Along with <xref rid="bibr46-00936502241306707" ref-type="bibr">Kress and van Leeuwen (2006)</xref>, we believe that images that contain people imply a social relationship between the model(s) and the viewer. Relatedly, many scholars have characterized human relationships in terms of two or three dimensions (<xref rid="bibr10-00936502241306707" ref-type="bibr">Bochner &#x00026; Kaminski, 1974</xref>; <xref rid="bibr24-00936502241306707" ref-type="bibr">Dillard et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bibr57-00936502241306707" ref-type="bibr">Osgood et al., 1957</xref>). The horizontal dimension is usually interpreted as affiliation or solidarity, ranging from liking/respect to disliking/disrespect.</p><p>The vertical dimension represents power, where high placement on the dimension indicates dominance, low placement corresponds with submission, and eye-level placement implies equality (<xref rid="bibr46-00936502241306707" ref-type="bibr">Kress &#x00026; van Leeuwen, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bibr52-00936502241306707" ref-type="bibr">Macken-Horarik, 2004</xref>). This interpretation is echoed by film theorists and borne out by empirical studies showing that variation in vertical camera angle corresponds with changes in perceived dominance (<xref rid="bibr20-00936502241306707" ref-type="bibr">Cores-Sarr&#x000ed;a et al., 2022</xref>). Specifically, speakers are rated as more potent when shown from a low camera angle (vs. eye level or high angle) (<xref rid="bibr53-00936502241306707" ref-type="bibr">Mandell &#x00026; Shaw, 1973</xref>; <xref rid="bibr71-00936502241306707" ref-type="bibr">Sevenants &#x00026; d&#x02019;Ydewalle, 2006</xref>) and as more influential (<xref rid="bibr39-00936502241306707" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al., 2002</xref>) and knowledgeable when depicted from a low angle (vs. high angle) (<xref rid="bibr76-00936502241306707" ref-type="bibr">Tiemens, 1970</xref>). At the same time, a lower camera elicits a range of judgments that are known to cause backfire effects (<xref rid="bibr6-00936502241306707" ref-type="bibr">Baranowski &#x00026; Hecht, 2018</xref>; <xref rid="bibr37-00936502241306707" ref-type="bibr">Hoffmann et al., 2023</xref>; <xref rid="bibr55-00936502241306707" ref-type="bibr">McCain et al., 1977</xref>), such that speakers appear as more aggressive (<xref rid="bibr45-00936502241306707" ref-type="bibr">Kraft, 1987</xref>) and more threatening (<xref rid="bibr29-00936502241306707" ref-type="bibr">Fauville et al., 2022</xref>). Although these studies focus on interpersonal communication and news contexts, it is reasonable to anticipate similar effects in the realm of persuasion. When coupled with a verbal advocacy, a low camera angle&#x02014;where a model looms over the viewer&#x02014;signals the intent of the model to control the viewer (see <xref rid="fig1-00936502241306707" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>).

Because anger is the emotional response to the presence of an obstacle (<xref rid="bibr48-00936502241306707" ref-type="bibr">Lazarus, 1991</xref>), an angry expression casts the viewer as a barrier to change, and the model as an agent committed to overcoming that barrier. The interpersonal relationship expressed by the message is fundamentally oppositional and choice-limiting.

Participants were exposed to both conditions of each message feature. The randomization process was structured as follows: Participants saw the three message features in random order [i.e., camera angle, (anti)thesis, facial expression]. Within each message feature, participants were randomly assigned to either the high threat condition [i.e., low shot, antithesis present, angry face] or the low threat condition [i.e., eye level shot, antithesis absent, happy face], and then the alternative condition. In this way, every participant provided data for both threat conditions for each message feature. For example, a participant who was randomly assigned to the camera angle condition was randomly assigned to the low angle condition first and then to the eye level angle condition. Once that condition was completed, the participant was randomly assigned to either the antithesis or emotion feature, then to both conditions within that message feature in random order. This process was repeated once more for the one remaining message feature.

Model 1 constrained all instances of the same conceptual path to be equal (<xref rid="fig3-00936502241306707" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>).

Conversely, in Model 4b, reactance&#x02009;&#x02192;&#x02009;PE was constrained to be equal across conditions, and two estimates were given for the threat&#x02009;&#x02192;&#x02009;reactance path in antithesis versus remaining image types.

In particular, treating the reactance process as distinct across three image types (Model 5) or across six images (Model 6), or freeing the equality constraints on threat&#x02009;&#x02192;&#x02009;reactance and reactance&#x02009;&#x02192;&#x02009;PE paths on the basis of Model 4a, did not result in substantive improvements in fit.

We constructed Model 7 by modifying the equality constraint on PO&#x02009;&#x02192;&#x02009;threat in Model 4a into constraints that set this path to be equal between messages that included more threatening visual cues (low angle, antithesis, angry facial expression) and between those that did not (eye level, thesis, happy facial expression), respectively.

After completing this condition, the participant was randomly assigned to the emotion variable, followed by a random assignment to the low-threat condition. Subsequently, she saw the two angry face ads, presented in random order.

This was appealing for its operational simplicity and because it so readily mapped onto structural models of interpersonal relationships. The within-person findings of both experiments were compatible with the characterization of low camera angle as &#x0201c;a subtle threat cue&#x0201d; (<xref rid="bibr27-00936502241306707" ref-type="bibr">Elliot et al., 2011</xref>, p. 1340) and with the notion that vertical angle can be understood as a dominance bid.</p><p>Nevertheless, it is obvious that our work barely scratched the range of theoretical possibilities implied by dimensional conceptualizations of interpersonal relationships. A straightforward extension of the current studies might employ images that vary along the full range of the vertical-power dimension. This would include a high camera angle (from the viewer&#x02019;s perspective), that signals a position of viewer power and implies a correspondingly low level of perceived threat to freedom. Further, the dimensional models identify a horizontal solidarity/affiliation axis that deserves attention too (<xref rid="bibr10-00936502241306707" ref-type="bibr">Bochner &#x00026; Kaminski, 1974</xref>; <xref rid="bibr57-00936502241306707" ref-type="bibr">Osgood et al., 1957</xref>). The theoretical mapping of camera angle onto the horizontal (vs. vertical) dimension is less intuitive. Creating testable predictions may require factoring in context or the emotional expression of the model. Finally, model-viewer proximity might be conceptualized as the often-recovered third dimension of relationships, which travels under labels such as immediacy and involvement (<xref rid="bibr2-00936502241306707" ref-type="bibr">Andersen et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bibr16-00936502241306707" ref-type="bibr">Cegala et al., 1982</xref>). If proximity functions to amplify relational judgments, as suggested by one theory (<xref rid="bibr24-00936502241306707" ref-type="bibr">Dillard et al., 1999</xref>), we should expect it to interact with the location of the model on the vertical and/or horizontal dimensions.</p></sec><sec id="section38-00936502241306707"><title>(Anti)thesis</title><p>Our second image variation focused on the juxtaposition of contrasting images. We expected that anti-thesis (vs. thesis) would be seen as choice restrictive because it limits the decision space to a binary, instantiated as two opposing images: One versus the other. Antithesis was compared to the single image condition (i.e., thesis), which implies some ill-defined, but open-ended decision space: One image versus whatever else comes to mind, including nothing. Findings from both experiments support this prediction, which aligns roughly with the position that reactance is a function of the proportion of freedoms that are threatened (<xref rid="bibr83-00936502241306707" ref-type="bibr">Wicklund, 1974</xref>, chapter 6). We say &#x0201c;roughly&#x0201d; because the mathematics of proportions are not suited to open-ended decision spaces; Proportions are point estimates, not ranges. Knowledge of how message recipients subjectively conceive of the options implied by a thesis image would speak to the how-to-compute-a-proportion problem. The issue can be expressed in this way: As researchers, we want to compute a proportion so that we can test Wicklund&#x02019;s prediction. To do this we need specific values for the numerator and denominator, something that is made difficult by the open-ended nature of thesis images. A message that says only &#x0201c;Choose door #1&#x0201d; (the numerator) does not reveal how many other doors might exist. Does the viewer conceive of the decision as choose door #1 versus not? Or as door #1 versus some large, but unspecified number of alternative doors? Only by gaining insight into how viewers fill in the missing denominator can we test the prediction that reactance is determined by the proportion of freedoms that are threatened.</p><p>It is also worth mentioning that antitheses can be accomplished in many ways &#x02013; contrasting colors, forms, shapes, angles, lights, as well as visual content (<xref rid="bibr22-00936502241306707" ref-type="bibr">Davison, 2002</xref>). To simplify inquiry, we offer a person-focused mini-theory of antithesis, premised on the fact that anti thesis messages have two parts. The <italic toggle="yes">options component</italic> illustrates and contrasts possible states. In <xref rid="fig2-00936502241306707" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>, the traffic image and the train image are the options. They vary individually in terms of <italic toggle="yes">plausibility</italic>, that is, the degree of perceived correspondence with the real world. Is the image a believable representation or is it biased, extreme, or unrepresentative?</p><p>The images also vary jointly in terms of <italic toggle="yes">discrepancy</italic> or the subjective distance between the two. An antithesis might display alternatives that are similar to one another or starkly different. We expect that plausibility is inversely related to perceived threat to freedom, such that the more biased, extreme, or unrepresentative an option, the greater the perceived threat to freedom. In contrast, we anticipate that discrepancy is directly associated with threat, such that the greater the contrast between the alternatives, the more people feel threatened in their autonomy.</p><p>The <italic toggle="yes">directive component(s)</italic> articulate(s) the preferred and/or nonpreferred choice. <xref rid="fig2-00936502241306707" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> contains two directives, one that says Yes (i.e., the checkmark) and one that says No (i.e., the X). Logically, either one alone would be sufficient to make the same point and might induce less perceived threat. Or the use of a question might steer message recipients toward the preferred option more subtly and with reduced threat (e.g., &#x0201c;Which would you choose?&#x0201d;). Further, we might expect that perceived threat would be heightened by more directives, exclamatory markers (e.g., larger fonts, capital letters, or exclamation marks), and certain colors (<xref rid="bibr3-00936502241306707" ref-type="bibr">Armstrong et al., 2021</xref>, for evidence of color effects). Though our thinking here goes well beyond the data, we hope that these concepts provide traction for future inquiry.</p></sec><sec id="section39-00936502241306707"><title>Models&#x02019; Emotional Expression</title><p>The third image variation turned attention to the photo models. In this case, we considered emotional expression, a content property of the image that communicated an agent-versus-obstacle relationship in the anger condition and an agent-versus-acceptance position in the happy condition. Results were consistent with expectations: The anger expression elicited higher levels of perceived threat than the happy expression.</p><p>There are many forms of emotional expression not included in our research and a correspondingly large number of avenues for future research. For example, the view that emotional expressions are culturally invariant holds that there are six basic facial expressions: Surprise, fear, disgust, anger, happiness, and sadness (<xref rid="bibr26-00936502241306707" ref-type="bibr">Ekman &#x00026; Friesen, 1971</xref>). While we take no position here on the number or the invariance of these expressions, future research should consider comparisons beyond anger and happiness. The basic emotions position is complemented (some would say opposed) by evidence that comprehension of emotional expression depends on various contextual cues: (a) the pre-message affective state of the viewer, (b) culturally-meaningful background imagery, as well as (c) verbal labeling of the expression itself (<xref rid="bibr7-00936502241306707" ref-type="bibr">Barrett et al., 2011</xref>). It should be noted that these are <italic toggle="yes">categories</italic> of context cues, each of which contain myriad variations. Together the two positions point toward a rich array of opportunities for researching expressions and reactance.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section40-00936502241306707"><title>Political Orientation</title><p>Around the globe, contemporary conservative political discourse emphasizes the notion of personal freedom &#x02014; an observation that suggests that conservatives may be more inclined than liberals to see any persuasive message as autonomy-threatening. And while our messages were focused only on climate change, we did find a propensity for right-leaning people to feel more threatened than left-leaning persons. This is consistent with other research showing conservatives to be more resistant to persuasion generally (<xref rid="bibr51-00936502241306707" ref-type="bibr">Ma et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="bibr87-00936502241306707" ref-type="bibr">J.

To the extent that this result generalizes beyond our study, it is good news for pro-environmental message designers. Although conservatives may still tilt away from pro-environmental action, any concern that visual variations will alienate them disproportionately may be misplaced. If true, limited resources for climate-related persuasion need not be used to develop specialized campaigns that are adapted to uniquely reactance-prone audiences. However, given the power of political identity in shaping responses to climate change, additional research is needed.</p></sec><sec id="section41-00936502241306707"><title>The Core Reactance Process</title><p>This project is one of many that confirm the two-step sequence in which perceived threat causes increases in reactance and that reactance brings about diminished persuasion (<xref rid="bibr59-00936502241306707" ref-type="bibr">Quick &#x00026; Stephenson, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bibr62-00936502241306707" ref-type="bibr">Rains, 2013</xref>). Our results go beyond pure replication by making two methodological contributions to that body of work. One is the explicit testing and elimination of alternative causal orderings of threat, reactance, and persuasion (<ext-link xlink:href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/suppl/10.1177/00936502241306707" ext-link-type="uri">Supplemental Appendix</ext-link>: Study 1). We are not the first researchers to do this (cf., <xref rid="bibr63-00936502241306707" ref-type="bibr">Rains &#x00026; Mitchell Turner, 2007</xref>), but strong evidence of mediation requires multiple investigations. Repeated rejection of rival models is one way in which the case for statistical mediation is advanced (e.g., <xref rid="bibr41-00936502241306707" ref-type="bibr">Iacobucci et al., 2007</xref>). We suggest making evaluation of alternative models a standard practice (see <xref rid="bibr88-00936502241306707" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al. (2024)</xref> for a more extensive treatment of this issue).</p><p>Framing the second contribution begins with the premise that confidence in scientific conclusions is increased when the same results are obtained across a variety of conditions. If an effect is observed in multiple laboratories (vs. one) or by multiple studies (vs. one), this diversity strengthens our confidence in the finding. Of course, this principle applies to other research designs as well. To the best of our knowledge, our experiments are among the first to examine the reactance process using something other than between-persons design (for another see <xref rid="bibr30-00936502241306707" ref-type="bibr">Gardner &#x00026; Leshner (2016))</xref>. To clarify the value added by our project, it is helpful to compare the effect sizes with those reported in <xref rid="bibr62-00936502241306707" ref-type="bibr">Rains&#x02019; (2013)</xref> meta-analysis: .37 for threat&#x02192;reactance (vs. .37 to .48 in Study 1) and &#x02212;.30 for reactance&#x02009;&#x02192;&#x02009;persuasion<sup>

</sup> (vs. &#x02212;.21 to &#x02212;.52 in Study 1). Even though the two sets of results derive from different research designs, which embody different configurations of threats to internal validity, they are quite similar. When comparable findings derive from diverse designs, we should have increased faith that they reflect a durable feature of human behavior. More detail on the risks and benefits of our design is given in the <ext-link xlink:href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/suppl/10.1177/00936502241306707" ext-link-type="uri">Supplemental Appendix</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec id="section42-00936502241306707"><title>Strengths and Limitations</title><p>The most notable limitation of this report concerns our focus on a single advocacy domain, that is, environmental advocacy. Further research is needed to verify if the results generalize to other domains such as health or social justice.</p><p>Second, while our two experimental studies demonstrate that images have the potential to evoke reactance, we should note that this assertion does not hold for every member of our sample. For instance, roughly 35% (500/1,440) of our sample in Study 1 indicated that they experienced a value of 0 for threat and for reactance. In other words, approximately 65% <italic toggle="yes">did</italic> experience reactance and 35% <italic toggle="yes">did not</italic> (<ext-link xlink:href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/suppl/10.1177/00936502241306707" ext-link-type="uri">Supplemental Figure S1</ext-link>). To some readers, the latter value may appear large. In our view, it is remarkable that single-frame, still images were able to induce reactance in 2/3&#x02009;s of participants.<sup>

</sup></p><p>Third, in both studies we utilized a design that put every participant in several cells. This greatly increased our ability to detect differences and it addressed the problem of causal heterogeneity (<xref rid="bibr14-00936502241306707" ref-type="bibr">Bullock et al., 2010</xref>). The price of these benefits was the possibility of carryover effects, and there was some evidence of small effects in both experiments (the <ext-link xlink:href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/suppl/10.1177/00936502241306707" ext-link-type="uri">Supplemental Appendix</ext-link> provides a detailed treatment of this issue). However, controlling for such effects in Study 2 did not change either the significance or the direction of the visual message effects under study. Moreover, our designs randomized participants to all possible orders. To the extent that carryover effects were present, they should have been equally distributed across conditions and, therefore, not a systematic source of bias. And because all participants were evenly allocated to all orders, there was no possibility that carryover effects associated with any particular order was unequally weighted relative to any other order.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section43-00936502241306707"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Why do people resist persuasion?

Hence, we elaborate our reasons for eliminating one item from the <xref rid="bibr23-00936502241306707" ref-type="bibr">Dillard and Shen (2005)</xref> scale. We believe that when two conditions hold, a scale may be reduced in length without appreciable loss of validity. The first requires evidence that the items are substitutable methods of assessing a single latent construct. Such evidence is generally gleaned from some form of factor analysis. If that analysis demonstrates the unidimensionality of the item set, and the factor loadings do not differ by more that would be expected by sampling error, then any item or items (from the existing scale) can be eliminated to produce a short form. The second criteria, and the countervailing constraint, is reliability. One does not want to eliminate so many items that the item set becomes unreliable. But, the expected reliability of a reduced item set can be estimated from prior data using the Spearman-Brown prophecy formula. For example, if we take the mean alpha (.93) for the four-item threat scale reported in <xref rid="bibr23-00936502241306707" ref-type="bibr">Dillard and Shen (2005)</xref>, the prophecy formula predicts that a three-item scale will produce an alpha of .91.

Previous research and the present paper have conceptualized reactance as a relative phenomenon, viewing it as a continuous variable that can range from zero to some higher value and that indicates the <italic toggle="yes">degree</italic> of reactance experienced by a participant. An alternative view is that experiencing <italic toggle="yes">some</italic> anger and <italic toggle="yes">some</italic> critical thoughts does not automatically qualify as reactance (e.g., just as feeling a bit uncomfortable when spotting a spider does not automatically qualify as arachnophobia). This perspective favors an absolute (or clinical) approach to reactance, where individuals are only considered reactant if they surpass some specific threshold. We are not aware of any reactance research that has developed this threshold idea. It may be worth considering whether it is meaningful to embrace the idea or a reactance threshold and, if so, what numerical value it should take. Additionally, clarification may be needed on what to call the psychological state when individuals experience some anger and critical cognitions, but remain below the threshold. As the relative and absolute approaches have their merits but are based on different conceptual foundations, we encourage future thinking that specifies the problem and the solution(s) more precisely.</p></fn></fn-group></notes><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bibr1-00936502241306707"><mixed-citation publication-type="webpage">
