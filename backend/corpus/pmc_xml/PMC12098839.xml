While proteomics offers insights into aging mechanisms, prior studies are limited in proteome coverage and lifespan range. To address this, we integrate the Orbitrap Astral Mass Spectrometer with the multiplex tandem mass tag (TMT) technology to profile the proteomes of cortex, hippocampus, striatum and kidney in the C57BL/6JN mice, quantifying 8,954 to 9,376 proteins per tissue (12,749 total). Samples spanned both sexes and three age groups (3, 12, and 20 months), representing early to late adulthood. To improve TMT quantitation accuracy, we develop a peptide-spectrum match-based filtering strategy that leverages resolution and signal-to-noise thresholds. Our analysis uncovers distinct tissue-specific patterns of protein abundance, with age and sex differences in the kidney and primarily age-related changes in brain tissues. We also identify both linear and non-linear proteomic trajectories with age, revealing complex protein dynamics over the adult lifespan. Integrating our findings with early developmental proteomic data from brain tissues highlights further divergent age-related trajectories, particularly in synaptic proteins. This study provides a robust data analysis workflow for Orbitrap Astral&#x02013;based TMT analysis and expands the proteomic understanding of aging across tissues, ages, and sexes.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="web-summary"><p id="Par2">Deeper proteome coverage empowers new biological insights.

Though there have been some studies of aging in murine models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, age-related changes at the protein level are less understood, and display poor correspondence with transcript-level aging changes across a range of murine tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. A recent discovery-based proteomic study in 10 tissues from C57BL/6J&#x02009; mice revealed age differences between adult (8 months) and late midlife ages (18 months)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Surprisingly, brain tissues had relatively fewer age and sex differences than other tissues. However, this study provided a limited map of age differences with only two age groups and approximately only 5000 proteins quantified in each tissue. We hypothesized that the lack of detected age differences in brain tissues was due in part to insufficient proteome coverage and insufficient variability in surveyed age groups.</p><p id="Par4">The dynamic range of the proteome is vast, with the cellular proteome spanning seven orders of magnitude<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Fractionation reduces sample complexity and thereby enables greater peptide and protein coverage in proteomic analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. However, the identification and quantitation of many low-abundance peptides still suffer from the limited sensitivity of mass spectrometers. In the Orbitrap Astral mass spectrometer, the Asymmetric Track Lossless (Astral) analyzer enables up to 200&#x02009;Hz acquisition of high-resolution accurate mass (HRAM) MS/MS spectra. The parallel acquisition using the Orbitrap and Astral analyzers permits full scans with a high dynamic range and resolution and fast and sensitive HRAM MS/MS scans, expanding proteome coverage and ensuring quantitative accuracy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>.

The high sensitivity of the Astral analyzer also enables the separation of TMTpro reporter ions and the utilization of TMTpro 18-plex for sample multiplexing. Moreover, limited previous studies have shown the use of TMT on the Orbitrap Astral Mass Spectrometer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Here, we integrate the Orbitrap Astral Mass Spectrometer with TMT technology to enable a multiplexed proteomic analysis with increased proteome coverage. To improve the age dimension resolution, we profile the proteomes of three brain tissues (cortex, hippocampus and striatum) from male and female mice aged 3, 12, and 20 months, representing approximately young adulthood to early late life (~20&#x02013;60 years in humans). In addition to the brain tissues, the kidney with its extensively characterized sex differences<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> is included. To enhance quantitative accuracy, we develop a rigorous peptide-spectrum match-based filtering strategy using resolution and signal-to-noise thresholds and quantify ~9000 proteins per tissue. Our analysis reveals distinct tissue-specific patterns of protein abundance. The dataset highlights both age and sex differences in the kidney, while revealing age differences but limited sex differences in brain tissues. Notably, we identify both linear and non-linear (<italic>i.e</italic>., continuous and non-continuous) proteomic changes with age, revealing complex protein dynamics over the lifespan. We integrate our dataset with early developmental proteomic data from brain and kidney tissues, and further highlight divergent age-related trajectories, particularly in brain synaptic proteins. This study broadens the proteomic landscape of aging and highlights the exceptional capability of the Orbitrap Astral Mass Spectrometer to capture age-related molecular changes with remarkable depth.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p id="Par6">For each tissue, three replicates of male and female C57BL/6JN mice at the ages of 3, 12, and 20 months were multiplexed in a TMTpro 18-plex (Supplementary Data&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">1</xref>).

Reporter ion intensities from a single scan for the peptide GTGASGSF from Histone 1.5 are shown as an example (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b&#x02013;d</xref>). Instead of 18 reporter ions, 12 peaks were detected in the reporter ion m/z range, with twelve of the carbon and nitrogen isotope versions of the TMTs coalesced into six peaks (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>, Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1a</xref>). As an example, the peak merged identified with m/z 130.1386 is 0.0038&#x02009;Da to the right of 130&#x02009;N and 0.0025&#x02009;Da to the left of 131&#x02009;C (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). Using 0.001&#x02009;Da peak match tolerance (PTM) window for reporter ion quantitation resulted in the quantitation of 3 reporter ions (dark green) compared to 12 reporter ions using 0.003&#x02009;Da PTM window. However, this adjustment failed to mitigate the impact of the inaccurate peptide quantitation on the protein quantitation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>). This erroneous quantitation of this peptide led to a distortion of the quantitation of Histone 1.5. Removing this peptide from protein quantitation revealed an age effect on protein H1.5 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>). Detector saturation caused by high-intensity ions (<italic>i.e.</italic>, ion saturation) has been widely reported in time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometers and has also been observed in other mass spectrometry platforms, including triple quadrupoles and trap-based instruments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. In this study, we hypothesized that the low resolution resulting from ion saturation contributed to the inaccurate quantification of TMT reporter ions.</p><p id="Par8">To systematically investigate the saturation effects in these datasets, we developed a C# program to extract the resolution of each TMT reporter ion in each scan. The program recorded the resolution, intensity, and noise of each reporter ion with a peak match tolerance of 0.001&#x02009;Da for each MS2 spectrum from the raw file, enabling detailed downstream analysis. Subsequently, the resolutions of the 18 TMT reporter ions associated with peptides used for protein quantitation were analyzed (10.6084/m9.figshare.28016501). A resolution of 45&#x02009;K is required to distinguish the carbon and nitrogen isotopologs of the TMT tags, which have a mass difference of 0.006 Da<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. To assess the impact of resolution, the log<sub>10</sub> ratio of the total signal-to-noise (S/N) across 18 channels for each MS2 spectrum was plotted for the four tissue types, focusing on cases where any of the 18 reporter ions fell below the 45&#x02009;K resolution threshold (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). The results revealed a bimodal distribution in resolution corresponding to low and high S/N groups. Less than full resolution (<italic>i.e</italic>., poor resolution) in the low-S/N group was attributed to low-intensity ions, whereas poor resolution in the high-S/N group was attributed to ion saturation. We investigated further whether detector saturation was an issue in TMT datasets collected using&#x000a0;an Orbitrap analyzer. We downloaded raw files from PXD018886<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> and PXD032843<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>, checked the MS2 and MS3 data collected in&#x000a0;an Orbitrap analyzer, and detected no PSMs with saturated effects, indicating that this is a specific issue to the Orbitrap Astral analyzer. We next tested whether reducing the sample input would alleviate this problem by injecting approximately half the amount used in the original analysis of hippocampus tissue. This resulted in a reduced number of quantified peptides and fewer peptides with S/N greater than 1440 across 18 channels (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1b</xref>). The number of PSMs with any of the resolutions of TMT reporter ions below 45&#x02009;K decreased from 10,572 to 2963, still impacting 1383 proteins. Additionally, the number of quantified proteins dropped from 9370 to 8762 (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1c</xref>). We also tested lower injection amounts, however, the PSMs with low resolution could not be fully eliminated (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1d&#x02013;f</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><title>Impact of resolution and Signal-to-Noise (S/N) Filtering on peptide and protein quantitation.</title><p><bold>a</bold> The log<sub>10</sub> ratio of the total S/N across 18 channels for each MS2 spectrum with any resolution below the 45&#x02009;K threshold was plotted for four tissues, showing a bi-modal distribution for low and high S/N. <bold>b</bold> The intensity distribution of each MS2 spectrum after resolution-based filtering. <bold>c</bold> Resolution and S/N filtering effects on peptide and protein quantitation.

Filtering based on an S/N threshold of 1400 removed peptides from 7151, 7434, 8009, and 7862 proteins.

Additionally, applying a resolution cutoff of 45&#x02009;K removed peptides from 2176, 1905, 2341, and 2305 proteins in the cortex, hippocampus, striatum, and kidney tissues, respectively.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41467_2025_60022_Fig2_HTML" id="d33e479"/></fig></p><p id="Par9">To assess how resolution and signal-to-noise (S/N) could influence the detection of quantitative differences due to biological factors of interest, we tested for differences between age groups and sex using regression (Methods) in peptides and proteins (summed from their component peptides). Peptides with low resolutions and low intensities were associated with significant differences (<italic>i.e</italic>., effects) (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2a, b</xref>). Comparing the regression coefficient for a protein to the coefficients for its peptides revealed a low correlation for low S/N peptides, which had coefficients closer to zero and thus would likely bias protein abundance towards the null of no detectable differences (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2c&#x02013;f</xref>). The measurement of low-intensity peptides is more likely to be compromised by noise and interference. Excluding these peptides with low resolutions and low intensities improves the accuracy of protein quantitation and facilitates the detection of biologically relevant quantitative differences<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par10">To avoid bias from low-S/N and low-resolution peptides, we estimated abundance levels for each protein from its component peptides after filtering out peptides that did not have full resolution and S/N lower than 1440 for 18 samples. The protein abundance estimate for an individual was then the sum of their S/N levels for the high confidence peptides. ~6% of all the PSMs were removed by resolution filtering, while ~20% of all the PSMs were removed due to being of low intensity. The resolution and intensity filtering led to ~2.5% and 9%&#x02013;10% drop in the number of unique peptides, respectively (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b, c</xref>).

To test whether the greater number of proteins with age differences in our study were systematically driven by the increased detection of low-abundance proteins, we compared the S/N of proteins unique to our study with those quantified in both studies. We found that most proteins detected with age differences in our study were quantified in both studies.

These findings suggest that the identification of more proteins with age differences in our study is likely a result of both improved statistical power due to observing a greater dynamic range of ages (three age groups rather than two) and improved proteome coverage. Despite the difference in the number of proteins with detected age differences, we observed consistent age coefficients for proteins with detected differences in either study (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>).

CSAD exhibited a consistently increasing trend in females but a decreasing trend in males across the age groups. In contrast, AKR1C13 showed a steady increase in males, while females displayed a non-monotonic up-down pattern, which only becomes evident with the broader age range. The inclusion of three distinct age groups in our study provided the resolution to capture non-linear age dynamics that would be impossible to detect with only two age groups.

Fundamental differences remain between the studies (<italic>e.g</italic>., different institutions at different times, sister sub-strains of mice, differences in tissue collection, and DIA vs TMT proteomics). PCA revealed similarities and differences in the distribution of variation across the the present study, Takasugi et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, and Wang et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. In Wang et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, the first three principal components accounted for 91.8% of the total variation (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7a</xref>), compared to 97.5% (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4d</xref>) and 98.2% (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7d</xref>) for the adulthood studies. Despite this, the contributions of tissue, age, and sex to variation differed slightly among the studies. In Wang et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, PC1 primarily separated brain and kidney, while PC2 distinctly separated age groups (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7b</xref>), with the youngest age group (1 week) showing a marked separation from the older age groups (1 and 2 months). By contrast, in the adult studies, age variation appeared more continuous (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4f</xref> and Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7e</xref>). On the other hand, sex strongly correlated with PC5 (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7c</xref>). Interestingly, compared to adulthood in the present study, age explained a larger proportion of overall variation during early development, whereas sex variation was more prominent in adulthood. Additionally, age-related changes during early development appeared distinctly less continuous (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b</xref>) compared to age trends observed in adulthood (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a, b</xref>). Taken together, this suggests protein levels have more extreme changes early in development (between 1 week and 1 month) which become more linear during adolescence and adulthood.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><title>Comparison to early development protein data reveals distinct aging patterns from adulthood.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Diagram of the age groups observed across Wang et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> and present study. <bold>b</bold> BIC comparison of continuous and non-continuous model fits of the age term for significant age differences (FDR&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.1).

In the kidney, we observed weak concordance for age coefficients (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8a, b</xref>) but strong concordance for sex coefficients between early development and adulthood, particularly if the difference was statistically significant (FDR&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;10%) in both studies (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6c, d</xref>). Interestingly, sex differences that were only statistically detected&#x000a0;in adulthood data showed moderate concordance with early development data, while differences unique to the earlier developmental data exhibited much lower concordance. These findings suggest that many sex differences in adulthood are initiated early in development but become more pronounced in adulthood, potentially coinciding with sexual maturity. One example is SLC22A19 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6e</xref>), an organic anion transporter known to have higher expression in females<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>,&#x000a0;which does not exhibit this pattern until 2 months and&#x000a0;then becomes more pronounced later in adulthood (~12 months-old). In the brain, sex differences were relatively sparse in both studies. Moreover, those identified differences were largely inconsistent in direction between early development and adulthood (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8c</xref>), suggesting a more complex or variable progression of sex differences in brain tissues across the lifespan.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Complex age dynamics of synapse-related proteins throughout lifespan in brain tissues</title><p id="Par27">Next we compared the Wang et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> brain data to all three brain tissues (cortex, hippocampus, and striatum) in the present study (striatum in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6f</xref>; all brain tissues in Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8d</xref>). We note that the continuous age coefficient is a less accurate summary for early development given the extensive non-continuous age differences observed. Notably, far more age differences were detected in the early developing brain, and these did not strongly correlate with adult brain age differences. Even when a protein&#x02019;s age difference was statistically significant in both studies (FDR&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;10%), many showed discordant patterns, with the direction of change often reversed between early development and adulthood (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6g</xref> for striatum). One notable pattern within proteins exhibiting a potential reversal over the lifespan&#x02014;specifically an increase in abundance during early development paired with a decrease in adulthood&#x02014;was enriched for genes associated with synapse biology (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6h, i</xref>). This observation is highly consistent with synapse density across lifespan as measured through deep synaptome profiling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. To incorporate geriatric mouse data, we further filtered to brain proteins with both an upward aging trend in Wang et al. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> and downward trends in the present study and Takasugi et al. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, particularly in the geriatric age group (30 months-old).

This approach enabled us to overcome previous limitations in proteome coverage and depth and boost the quantified protein number significantly, yielding insights into tissue-specific, age-related, and sex-based protein abundance patterns. During our analysis, we discovered that ion saturation in the Astral analyzer during TMT reporter ion quantitation can lead to inaccuracies, potentially resulting in the false discovery of biological effects. This issue is specific to the TMT and Orbitrap Astral combination and does not affect other DDA or DIA applications using other mass spectrometers. It can be mitigated by injecting less material; however, this approach may reduce the depth of protein quantitation. To address the challenge, we developed and applied a stringent peptide filtering strategy based on resolution and signal-to-noise (S/N) thresholds specifically tailored for the TMT datasets generated on the Orbitrap Astral system. Although the filtering process resulted in a 20% reduction in the total number of peptides and a 15% decrease in unique peptides, the impact on protein quantitation was minimal, with only a&#x02009;~&#x02009;5% reduction in the total number of quantified proteins (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>). However, the filtering process influenced a significant proportion of proteins. Resolution-based filtering affected more than one-third of all quantified proteins, while saturated ions impacted over 20%, and S/N filtering impacted ~80% of the quantified proteins (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>). Despite these reductions, the filtering strategy effectively mitigated biases associated with low-abundance and low-resolution peptides. This improvement in data quality enhanced the accuracy of protein quantitation, enabling us to capture complex molecular changes linked to aging with greater confidence. Our strategy provides the proteomics community with a robust approach for analyzing TMT datasets generated with the Orbitrap Astral Mass Spectrometer. Additionally, we recommend performing weekly Astral resolution checks and evaluating the resolution of TMT reporter ions acquired with the Orbitrap Astral Mass Spectrometer before proceeding with further data analysis to ensure optimal data accuracy and reliability. For TMT experiments with limited injection material, such as single-cell proteomics, we also recommend checking the resolutions of the TMT reporter ions, given the substantial dynamic range of protein abundance in cellular and tissue samples.</p><p id="Par29">We profiled both sexes across three distinct age groups (3, 12, and 20 months) and provided a comprehensive view of proteomic changes from young adulthood to early late life. We observed distinct tissue-based proteomic trends, notably the sex differences in the kidney as contrast to the minimal sex influence in brain tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. This finding aligns with the known susceptibility of the kidney to sex-linked aging effects. Compared to previous studies, the wider dynamic range of ages included in this study improved statistical power and enabled the identification of more proteins with sex and age differences (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>).</p><p id="Par30">From a discovery perspective, this study also identified compelling examples that can be further investigated to elucidate underlying aging mechanisms. One such example is AKR1C13, which exhibits a non-monotonic up-down pattern in female mice, a trend that only becomes apparent with our broader age range (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3f</xref>). AKR1C13 is an NADP(H)-dependent oxidoreductases belonging to the aldo-keto reductase (AKR) family<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>; It has broad substrate specificity for 20&#x003b1;-, 17&#x003b2;- and 3&#x003b1;-hydroxysteroids, and non-steroidal alcohols<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. The increased level of AKR1C13 in adult female mice may indicate a heightened demand for lipid metabolism. In contrast, the decreased level of AKR1C13 in aged female mice could contribute to the accumulation of lipid peroxidation products, elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS), and increased oxidative damage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. This study functions as a quantitative protein resource for the aging-focused research community. We have made our data and processed results available to the aging research community, accessible online. It allows for querying of proteins of interest, facilitating deeper exploration of the dataset. Results can also be integrated with other complementary studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> to produce higher confidence candidates for deeper interrogation.</p><p id="Par31">Prior aging studies have revealed complex non-continuous transcriptional aging trends, such as Schaum et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, which profiled 10 age groups. Having three adult age groups in the present study, four adult age groups from Takasugi et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, and three early development age groups from Wang et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, allowed us to more deeply characterize age trends than previous aging proteomic studies. We observed the presence of non-continuous age-related protein trajectories, emphasizing the complexity of aging at the molecular level. Expanding the dynamic range of age within a study to broadly encompass the entire murine lifespan would enable more complex models that capture highly non-continuous dynamics. Based on three age groups per sample population, the minimum number of groups to assess deviation from a continuous trend, our comparisons of developmental and adulthood aging dynamics revealed at times opposite trajectories, such as for proteins involved in synaptic functions. This highlighted that the aging process not only involves a linear accumulation of changes but also complex reversals and non-linear patterns across the lifespan. Our power to capture these patterns is limited when comparing independent studies and motivates future studies with more age groups and tissues within a single study.</p><p id="Par32">While this study provides valuable insights into age-associated proteomic changes, it also has some limitations. First, our analysis was limited to four tissues. Expanding the study to a broader range of tissues could provide a more comprehensive view of proteomic aging processes across the body. Second, we applied a stringent cutoff to filter low-intensity ions, which, while necessary for ensuring quantitation accuracy, may have excluded biologically relevant peptides. This approach might result in a minor loss of depth and could overlook subtle yet meaningful proteomic variations that contribute to the aging process. This study focused primarily on protein abundance changes. Including post-translational modification (PTM) analysis in future research would offer a deeper regulatory perspective on aging, providing insights into protein functionality and interaction that abundance data alone cannot capture. Future studies addressing these limitations could build on these findings to achieve a more integrated and translatable understanding of proteomic dynamics in the process of aging. In terms of statistical analysis, comparing findings across studies is always subject to the factors that differ among the studies. Our statistical approach using summary statistics rather than full data integration help mitigate potential issues, but it is important to keep in mind that these studies survey different sub-strains of C57BL/6, encompass different age groups, and were performed at different institutions using differing mass spectrometry approaches.</p><p id="Par33">Overall, this work provides a robust analysis framework for TMT datasets generated using Orbitrap Astral mass spectrometer, illustrating the potential of this advanced proteomic technology for mapping age-related molecular alterations across tissues. We expanded the proteomic landscape of aging by increasing the extent of protein quantitation across a wider range of lifespan, highlighting the need for further research to explore these age-related protein dynamics, particularly the roles of synaptic proteins in the aging processes and age-associated disease conditions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec14"><title>Tissue collection</title><p id="Par34">All animal protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute (AUF 23-084 and AUF 24-069) and were conducted in compliance with all relevant ethical regulations.
