This study aimed to evaluate the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of inactivated bivalent vaccine formulations incorporating the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 strain (ERAGEM) with either Delta or Omicron (BA.5) variants. Methods: Bivalent vaccine formulations were prepared using beta-propiolactone-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 antigens and administered to K18-hACE2 transgenic mice. Following prime and booster immunizations, neutralizing antibody titers and viral loads were assessed through ELISA, microneutralization assays, and quantitative PCR. Mice were challenged with the respective variants, and the survival rates, temperature, and body weight changes were monitored for 21 days. Results: Both vaccine formulations elicited significant increases in neutralizing antibody titers post-booster immunization. The ERAGEM + Delta group demonstrated geometric mean titers (GMTs) of 6938.1 and 4935.0 for the ancestral and Delta variants, respectively, while the ERAGEM + Omicron (BA.5) group achieved GMTs of 16,280.7 and 24,215.9 for the ancestral and Omicron (BA.5) variants. Complete survival (100%) was observed in all the vaccinated groups post-challenge, with no detectable viral titers in the lungs and substantial reductions in the nasal turbinate viral loads compared to the unvaccinated controls. Conclusions: The bivalent inactivated vaccines demonstrated strong immunogenicity and complete protection against severe disease in preclinical models. These findings indicate the potential of bivalent vaccine strategies in addressing antigenic diversity and preparing for future pandemics caused by rapidly evolving pathogens.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>SARS-CoV-2</kwd><kwd>bivalent vaccine</kwd><kwd>inactivated vaccine</kwd><kwd>immune response</kwd><kwd>pandemic preparedness</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>Council of Higher Education (Y&#x000d6;K)</funding-source><award-id>TSA&#x000dc;-2022-12160</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>This research was funded by the Council of Higher Education (Y&#x000d6;K) under the Research Universities Support Program (ADEP) (Erciyes University Scientific Research Projects Unit (BAP), grant ID 12160 and project code TSA&#x000dc;-2022-12160).</funding-statement></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-vaccines-13-00169"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Coronaviruses represent a diverse family of enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses, distinguished by their extensive genomes of approximately 30 kilobases, making them among the largest known RNA viruses [<xref rid="B1-vaccines-13-00169" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. These viruses are characterized structurally by their spike (S) proteins, which exhibit a crown-like appearance under electron microscopy and mediate viral entry into host cells via the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor [<xref rid="B2-vaccines-13-00169" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-vaccines-13-00169" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Other structural proteins, including membrane (M), envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins, are crucial for viral assembly, release, and RNA binding, respectively. [<xref rid="B1-vaccines-13-00169" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Coronaviruses are divided into four genera&#x02014;<italic toggle="yes">Alphacoronavirus</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Betacoronavirus</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Gammacoronavirus</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">Deltacoronavirus</italic>&#x02014;each associated with distinct host ranges and pathogenic profiles [<xref rid="B4-vaccines-13-00169" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-vaccines-13-00169" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Among these, Betacoronaviruses include highly pathogenic species such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 (SARS-CoV-1), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic [<xref rid="B6-vaccines-13-00169" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-vaccines-13-00169" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>SARS-CoV-2, first identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, rapidly became a global threat due to its efficient human-to-human transmission [<xref rid="B8-vaccines-13-00169" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The rapid evolution of SARS-CoV-2 has posed a significant challenge to global public health, leading to the emergence of multiple variants of concern (VOCs) [<xref rid="B9-vaccines-13-00169" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-vaccines-13-00169" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The urgency of the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated vaccine development, with several platforms rapidly advancing through clinical trials. Nucleic acid vaccines (DNA and RNA) and viral vector vaccines have emerged as leading candidates due to their adaptability and ability to induce strong immune responses. RNA vaccines developed by Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech, which encode the spike protein, have shown high efficacy in clinical trials [<xref rid="B11-vaccines-13-00169" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-vaccines-13-00169" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Similarly, viral vector vaccines, such as AstraZeneca&#x02019;s ChAdOx1 and Johnson &#x00026; Johnson&#x02019;s Ad26, have demonstrated promising results in eliciting both humoral and cellular immunity [<xref rid="B13-vaccines-13-00169" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-vaccines-13-00169" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Subunit vaccines, such as those developed by Novavax, utilize adjuvanted spike proteins to enhance immunogenicity, yielding strong antibody responses in clinical studies [<xref rid="B15-vaccines-13-00169" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Additionally, inactivated vaccines, such as those from Sinopharm, Sinovac, and TURKOVAC, have also shown promise; these vaccines, which use chemically inactivated SARS-CoV-2, have demonstrated safety and the ability to induce an immune response [<xref rid="B16-vaccines-13-00169" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-vaccines-13-00169" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-vaccines-13-00169" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-vaccines-13-00169" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>The rapid evolution of SARS-CoV-2 variants and the reduced efficacy of existing vaccines underscore the urgent need for next-generation vaccine platforms that are capable of addressing these challenges. This evolution is driven by a combination of genetic characteristics, host interactions, environmental pressures, and specific mutational events [<xref rid="B20-vaccines-13-00169" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-vaccines-13-00169" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Among these, mutations in the viral spike protein, a critical structure that binds to the ACE2 receptor in human tissues, have been particularly impactful. These mutations enhance viral infectivity and facilitate immune evasion, significantly increasing transmissibility and enabling the virus to bypass neutralizing antibodies [<xref rid="B20-vaccines-13-00169" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B22-vaccines-13-00169" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The high human-to-human transmission efficiency, coupled with super-spreading events, has further amplified the virus&#x02019;s global dissemination and mutation accumulation [<xref rid="B23-vaccines-13-00169" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24-vaccines-13-00169" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. SARS-CoV-2 variants have demonstrated diverse genetic adaptations, with key VOCs exhibiting unique mutational profiles that influence their transmissibility and immune escape capabilities. The Alpha variant (B.1.1.7), first identified in the UK in September 2020, became dominant due to its increased transmissibility, driven by mutations such as N501Y and D614G, which enhance infectivity and stabilize the spike protein [<xref rid="B25-vaccines-13-00169" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-vaccines-13-00169" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The Beta variant (B.1.351), detected in South Africa in May 2020, raised significant concerns about immune evasion through mutations such as K417N and E484K, which impair antibody binding and neutralization [<xref rid="B27-vaccines-13-00169" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Similarly, the Gamma variant (P.1), identified in Brazil in November 2020, shares immune-evasive mutations with Beta, further enhancing its transmissibility [<xref rid="B28-vaccines-13-00169" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B29-vaccines-13-00169" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The Delta variant (B.1.617.2), first reported in India in October 2020, exhibited mutations such as L452R and P681R, contributing to its rapid global spread and immune evasion [<xref rid="B30-vaccines-13-00169" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B31-vaccines-13-00169" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Most recently, the Omicron variant (B.1.1.529), identified in South Africa in November 2021, demonstrated extensive spike protein mutations, significantly enhancing transmissibility and immune escape. Omicron&#x02019;s subvariants have introduced additional mutations that increase ACE2 binding affinity and immune evasion [<xref rid="B32-vaccines-13-00169" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B33-vaccines-13-00169" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B34-vaccines-13-00169" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="B35-vaccines-13-00169" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p><p>Multivalent vaccine strategies, which target multiple viral strains, hold great potential for providing broad-spectrum protection against the diverse and continuously evolving variants of SARS-CoV-2. The aim of this study is to develop and evaluate a bivalent inactivated vaccine that targets distinct SARS-CoV-2 variants to achieve enhanced and broad-spectrum immunological protection. This study focuses on formulating bivalent vaccines that incorporate antigens from the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 strain in combination with either the Delta or Omicron (BA.5) variants. The objective is to broaden the immune response and enhance protection against multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants. By addressing the limitations of existing monovalent vaccines, this study aims to demonstrate the critical role of bivalent vaccine strategies in eliciting wide-ranging immunity. Such an approach is essential for controlling the evolving epidemiology of COVID-19 and mitigating the impact of emerging variants, ensuring comprehensive protection against the dynamic challenges posed by SARS-CoV-2.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-vaccines-13-00169"><title>2.

Discussion</title><p>The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected global public health and has led to widespread social, cultural, and economic disruptions [<xref rid="B38-vaccines-13-00169" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Since its initial identification in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, the virus has spread worldwide, resulting in millions of infections and widespread disruptions. By 2024, over 775 million confirmed cases and more than 7 million deaths had been reported globally, highlighting the extensive public health and societal burden of the pandemic [<xref rid="B39-vaccines-13-00169" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. In response to the devastating impacts of the pandemic, scientists worldwide rapidly initiated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development. During the COVID-19 pandemic, multiple vaccine platforms were established to address the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. These included inactivated, mRNA, viral vector, and protein subunit vaccines, each contributing to the global vaccination effort [<xref rid="B40-vaccines-13-00169" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="B41-vaccines-13-00169" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="B42-vaccines-13-00169" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="B43-vaccines-13-00169" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Among these platforms, inactivated vaccines were extensively deployed worldwide and demonstrated significant efficacy in reducing severe disease and hospitalizations caused by COVID-19 [<xref rid="B16-vaccines-13-00169" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B18-vaccines-13-00169" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In Hong Kong, a three-dose regimen of CoronaVac (SinoVac, 3 &#x000b5;g) achieved 97.9% protection against severe or fatal outcomes [<xref rid="B44-vaccines-13-00169" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Similarly, in Chile, the same three-dose schedule reduced COVID-19-related hospitalizations by 78.8% [<xref rid="B45-vaccines-13-00169" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. In March 2020, during the early phase of the pandemic, our group successfully isolated the SARS-CoV-2 virus, subsequently designated as ERAGEM [<xref rid="B36-vaccines-13-00169" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="B37-vaccines-13-00169" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. This isolate served as the foundation for the inactivated vaccine, initially named ERUCoV-VAC and later rebranded as TURKOVAC. TURKOVAC was developed using &#x003b2;-propiolactone-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 combined with aluminum hydroxide as an adjuvant. The vaccine demonstrated strong immunogenicity and a favorable safety profile in phase I, II, and III clinical trials. Phase III data established its non-inferiority to CoronaVac in reducing symptomatic COVID-19 cases and severe disease outcomes [<xref rid="B18-vaccines-13-00169" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-vaccines-13-00169" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In 2021, TURKOVAC received emergency use authorization in T&#x000fc;rkiye, marking a significant advancement in the global effort to combat the pandemic.</p><p>Despite the World Health Organization&#x02019;s declaration of the end of the COVID-19 pandemic in May 2023, SARS-CoV-2 continues to pose challenges due to its rapid evolution, driven by high mutation rates, recombination events, and selective pressures [<xref rid="B20-vaccines-13-00169" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-vaccines-13-00169" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. VOCs, such as Delta and Omicron, have acquired mutations in the spike protein, particularly in the receptor-binding domain, enhancing infectivity, transmission efficiency, and immune evasion [<xref rid="B35-vaccines-13-00169" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="B46-vaccines-13-00169" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. These dynamics have reduced the effectiveness of first-generation vaccines designed to target the ancestral strain [<xref rid="B31-vaccines-13-00169" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B47-vaccines-13-00169" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Our study addressed these challenges by evaluating bivalent inactivated vaccines combining antigens from the ancestral ERAGEM strain with the Delta or Omicron (BA.5) variants. The findings from our study demonstrate that the bivalent inactivated vaccines effectively elicited strong immune responses and conferred complete protection after the challenge with the ancestral strain and the Delta and Omicron (BA.5) variants of SARS-CoV-2.</p><p>The variants selected for this study included the ancestral strain (ERAGEM), Delta, and Omicron (BA.5). The ancestral strain was chosen as it represents the original SARS-CoV-2 virus first identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 [<xref rid="B48-vaccines-13-00169" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. This strain has served as the foundation for most vaccine formulations developed to date, contributing to a well-documented and robust immune response in the global population [<xref rid="B49-vaccines-13-00169" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Incorporating the ancestral strain in a bivalent vaccine is expected to strengthen the immunological response and provide a comprehensive base for broader protection [<xref rid="B40-vaccines-13-00169" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The Delta variant was selected for its high transmissibility and its association with severe clinical outcomes, which have posed significant challenges to public health systems [<xref rid="B30-vaccines-13-00169" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Delta has also acted as a genetic precursor to several subsequent variants, making its inclusion critical for mitigating severe disease outcomes and offering potential cross-protection against genetically related variants [<xref rid="B31-vaccines-13-00169" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The Omicron (BA.5) variant was prioritized because it was responsible for one of the most widespread infection waves during the study period. While numerous Omicron sublineages have been circulating globally, the Omicron (BA.5) sublineage emerged as the dominant variant, making it a key target for vaccine development at that time [<xref rid="B21-vaccines-13-00169" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Its widespread prevalence and its ability to escape immune defenses established by previous infections or vaccinations indicate the importance of incorporating Omicron (BA.5) into the vaccine formulation to enhance its relevance and efficacy against contemporary variants.</p><p>In this study, both vaccine formulations, ERAGEM + Delta and ERAGEM + Omicron (BA.5) achieved 100% survival in K18-hACE2 transgenic mice following challenges with their respective variants, demonstrating their efficacy in preventing severe disease outcomes (<xref rid="vaccines-13-00169-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). In the ERAGEM + Delta group, the endpoint antibody and neutralization titers against both the ERAGEM and Delta variants increased significantly after the prime-boost regimen, indicating a robust and broad immune response (<xref rid="vaccines-13-00169-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>A and <xref rid="vaccines-13-00169-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>A). Similarly, the ERAGEM + Omicron (BA.5) bivalent vaccine elicited substantial increases in GMTs for both ERAGEM and Omicron (BA.5), suggesting enhanced immunogenicity across these variants (<xref rid="vaccines-13-00169-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>B and <xref rid="vaccines-13-00169-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>B). Furthermore, no detectable viral titers were observed in the lungs of vaccinated mice challenged with either ERAGEM or the respective variant strains, confirming effective pulmonary protection (<xref rid="vaccines-13-00169-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). Significant reductions in the viral titers and RNA copy numbers in the nasal turbinates of the vaccinated groups compared to the controls further support the ability of bivalent vaccines to limit viral replication in the upper respiratory tract (<xref rid="vaccines-13-00169-f007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p>This study evaluates the efficacy of bivalent vaccine formulations, ERAGEM + Delta and ERAGEM + Omicron (BA.5), in providing protection against SARS-CoV-2 variants. When compared to the findings of a study conducted by our group in 2021 [<xref rid="B37-vaccines-13-00169" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], which focused on a monovalent vaccine targeting the ancestral strain (ERAGEM), key similarities and potential advantages of the bivalent approach emerge. In terms of survival, both studies reported 100% survival in K18-hACE2 transgenic mice following challenges with the ancestral strain. Neutralizing antibody responses also provide an interesting point of comparison. In Pavel et al., the monovalent vaccine elicited a GMT of 157 against the ancestral strain following the booster dose. In our study, the ERAGEM + Omicron BA.5 bivalent vaccine achieved a GMT of 228.1 against the ancestral strain, while the ERAGEM + Delta vaccine elicited a comparable GMT of 157.1. While these results suggest that the bivalent vaccine formulations may generate immune responses at least equivalent to those for the monovalent vaccine against the ancestral strain, further studies are needed to confirm whether the inclusion of variant antigens enhances immunogenicity.</p><p>Although research on inactivated bivalent vaccines combining the ancestral (Wuhan) strain with Delta or Omicron variants is limited, recent studies have demonstrated the advantages of bivalent vaccines across different platforms. The bivalent mRNA-1273.214 booster demonstrated significantly higher neutralizing antibody titers against the Omicron sublineages, including the BA.4 and BA.5 variants, with the geometric mean ratios (GMRs) showing substantial improvement [<xref rid="B50-vaccines-13-00169" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Similarly, the inactivated bivalent formulations in this study induced significant levels of neutralizing antibodies, with a noticeable increase observed after the booster dose. Booster administration plays a crucial role in enhancing the breadth and strength of cross-neutralization, as evidenced by the GMTs achieved against both the ERAGEM and variant-specific antigens. These findings are consistent with those of Liu et al., who demonstrated that inactivated vaccines can induce broadly neutralizing responses, even against immune-evasive sublineages. Similar to our findings, Wang et al. developed a bivalent RBD-based vaccine targeting the Wuhan-1 and Omicron BA.1 variants. This vaccine elicited durable antibody responses, including IgG and IgA, capable of neutralizing both the ancestral and variant strains and provided complete protection against nasal infection and disease in preclinical models [<xref rid="B51-vaccines-13-00169" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="B52-vaccines-13-00169" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Ying et al. also showed that a bivalent vaccine targeting the ancestral and Omicron BA.5 variants effectively protected against diverse variants, such as WA1/2020 D614G, BQ.1.1, and XBB.1.5, with no observed mortality in animal models [<xref rid="B53-vaccines-13-00169" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Other studies emphasize the advantages of bivalent formulations in overcoming the antigenic variability of SARS-CoV-2. Li et al. demonstrated that bivalent mRNA vaccines incorporating the Delta and Omicron antigens elicited high neutralizing antibody titers against multiple strains, including variants not explicitly targeted by the vaccine [<xref rid="B52-vaccines-13-00169" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Collectively, these findings demonstrate the critical role of bivalent vaccine formulations in overcoming the challenges posed by SARS-CoV-2 variants by generating robust, broad-spectrum immunity and offering protection across diverse viral strains.</p><p>While mRNA- and vector-based vaccines have received significant attention, our study highlights the distinct advantages of inactivated vaccine technology. This platform is built on a long-standing, reliable foundation with a strong safety record. Inactivated vaccines are compatible with existing production systems, making them highly accessible and practical for countries with limited resources. Unlike mRNA vaccines, which demand advanced manufacturing processes and ultra-cold storage, inactivated vaccines offer a more straightforward solution. Moreover, inactivated vaccines require only standard refrigeration (2&#x02013;8 &#x000b0;C), which reduces the logistical hurdles often associated with mRNA vaccines that need storage at &#x02212;20 &#x000b0;C or below. This characteristic makes inactivated vaccines an excellent option for large-scale distribution in regions with limited infrastructure or cold-chain capacity. Our research leverages these advantages by incorporating the regionally relevant ERAGEM SARS-CoV-2 isolate, ensuring its applicability to local epidemiological conditions. Paired with a comprehensive evaluation of immune responses against the Delta and Omicron (BA.5) variants, this approach addresses urgent public health needs while providing a viable framework for vaccine development in similar settings. By combining a targeted vaccine design with a globally scalable production platform, our work underscores its relevance and distinct contribution to the ongoing efforts to combat COVID-19.</p><p>One limitation of this study is the absence of monovalent vaccine groups, such as those targeting only the ancestral strain or specific variants such as Delta or Omicron (BA.5). Including such groups would have allowed for a direct comparison with the bivalent vaccine providing a clearer assessment of the advantages of bivalent formulations in eliciting broader immune responses and protection against a range of SARS-CoV-2 variants. Although this limitation does not diminish the significance of our findings, it represents an area for future research. Comparative studies incorporating both monovalent and multivalent vaccine groups could further validate the broader protection observed with bivalent vaccines. One of the other limitations of this study is the lack of direct evaluation of T-cell-mediated immune responses, which are increasingly recognized as critical in controlling SARS-CoV-2, particularly in mitigating severe disease outcomes. However, in our previous study using a monovalent inactivated vaccine based on the ancestral strain, we demonstrated that it primarily elicited humoral immunity while also inducing moderate cellular immune responses [<xref rid="B37-vaccines-13-00169" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. These findings suggest that the bivalent inactivated vaccines evaluated in this study may similarly stimulate cellular immunity, complementing the robust neutralizing antibody responses observed. Further investigation is needed to fully characterize the cellular immune mechanisms activated by these formulations, as such insights are essential for understanding their comprehensive protective potential.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec5-vaccines-13-00169"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>In summary, this study demonstrates that inactivated bivalent vaccine formulations are capable of eliciting robust immune responses, reducing viral replication, and providing complete protection in preclinical models. These findings highlight their potential as a highly effective strategy for addressing the challenges posed by both ancestral and emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants, offering broad-spectrum immunity and significant protection against diverse viral strains. Future pandemics and outbreaks caused by rapidly mutating viruses are an inevitable global challenge. In this context, bivalent and multivalent vaccines play a pivotal role in ensuring preparedness for such events. By incorporating antigens from multiple strains, these vaccines can provide comprehensive protection against both known and emerging variants, reducing the health, social, and economic impacts of future pandemics.</p></sec><sec id="sec6-vaccines-13-00169"><title>6.
