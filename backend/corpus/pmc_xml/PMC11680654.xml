Yet, it is unclear whether the same learning processes underlie learning from these different stimulus types. In two preregistered experiments (N = 50 each), we assessed whether abstract and concrete stimuli yield different reinforcement-learning performance and whether this difference can be explained by verbalization. We argued that concrete stimuli are easier to verbalize than abstract ones, and that people therefore can appeal to the phonological loop, a subcomponent of the working-memory system responsible for storing and rehearsing verbal information, while learning. To test whether this verbalization aids reinforcement-learning performance, we administered a reinforcement-learning task in which participants learned either abstract or concrete stimuli while verbalization was hindered or not. In the first experiment, results showed a more pronounced detrimental effect of hindered verbalization for concrete than abstract stimuli on response times, but not on accuracy. In the second experiment, in which we reduced the response window, results showed the differential effect of hindered verbalization between stimulus types on accuracy, not on response times. These results imply that verbalization aids learning for concrete, but not abstract, stimuli and therefore that different processes underlie learning from these types of stimuli. This emphasizes the importance of carefully considering stimulus types. We discuss these findings in light of generalizability and validity of reinforcement-learning research.</p><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.3758/s13423-024-02506-3.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Reinforcement learning</kwd><kwd>Verbalization</kwd><kwd>Cognitive processes</kwd><kwd>Interference</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Psychonomic Society, Inc. 2024</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">In reinforcement-learning studies, people learn which stimulus yields the highest reward. These stimuli are usually abstract such as foreign language characters (e.g., Daw et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2011</xref>; Frank et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2004</xref>; Pessiglione et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2006</xref>) or fractals (e.g., Gl&#x000e4;scher et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2010</xref>). To study reinforcement-</p><p id="Par3">learning processes in developmental and aging populations, abstract stimuli are often replaced by concrete pictures of, for example, everyday objects (e.g., Eppinger et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2009</xref>; Eppinger &#x00026; Kray, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2011</xref>; van de Vijver et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2015</xref>; van den Bos et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2009</xref>; Xia et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2021</xref>). This raises the question of whether the same learning processes underlie reinforcement learning of abstract and concrete stimuli. In the current preregistered study, we therefore tested whether abstract and concrete stimuli yield different reinforcement-learning performance, and whether potential differences are due to verbalization.</p><p id="Par4">A recent reinforcement-learning study (Farashahi et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2020</xref>) showed superior learning for concrete as compared to abstract stimuli. However, the mechanism underlying this superior learning remains understudied. A potential mechanism is verbalization, that is, naming stimuli while learning, as it is hypothesized to modulate otherwise non-verbal cognitive processes (Kray et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2015</xref>; Lupyan, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2012</xref>). Specifically, verbalization may aid reinforcement-learning performance as it helps keep information in working memory. According to Baddeley&#x02019;s classic working-memory model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">1986</xref>; for a more recent review, see Baddeley &#x00026; Hitch, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2019</xref>), a part of the working-memory system, called the phonological loop, temporarily stores verbal information and rehearses this information through inner speech. If stimuli are easier to encode phonologically, it is easier to appeal to this phonological loop while learning. We argue that concrete stimuli are easier to name than abstract ones, which makes them easier to encode phonologically, subsequently resulting in better reinforcement-learning performance for concrete than for abstract stimuli.</p><p id="Par5">In support of this idea, there is ample evidence for a general role of working memory in reinforcement learning, that is, that people tend to rely on working memory (as opposed to associative reinforcement learning) when the number of things to learn fall within people&#x02019;s working-memory capacity (e.g., Collins, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2018</xref>; Collins &#x00026; Frank, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2012</xref>). In addition, experimental studies already showed that verbalization can aid performance in various (otherwise non-verbal) cognitive processes, including working memory (Forsberg et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2020</xref>; Souza &#x00026; Sk&#x000f3;ra, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2017</xref>), category learning (Lupyan et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2007</xref>; Lupyan &#x00026; Casasanto, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2015</xref>; Minda &#x00026; Miles, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2010</xref>; Vanek et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2021</xref>; Waldron &#x00026; Ashby, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2001</xref>; Zeithamova &#x00026; Maddox, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2006</xref>; Zettersten &#x00026; Lupyan, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2020</xref>), and motor learning (Gidley Larson &#x00026; Suchy, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2015</xref>). Two recent studies (Radulescu et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2022</xref>; Yoo et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2023</xref>) addressed whether verbalization can also aid reinforcement learning. Yoo and colleagues (2023) showed that people performed worse in a condition in which concrete pictures represented the same object than in a condition in which the pictures represented different objects, concluding that verbal discriminability (i.e., distinguishable stimulus names) is particularly important for learning. Similarly, Radulescu and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2022</xref>) showed that people performed worse in a condition in which stimuli were difficult to verbalize than in a condition in which they were easy to verbalize (see also Waltz et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2007</xref>). Both studies drew conclusions about the effects of verbal processes on learning based on indirect measures of verbalization, that is, they relied on the assumption that verbalization was affected differently in different conditions. We implemented a direct measure of the effects of verbalization on learning. Specifically, we adopted a dual-task design in which people learned abstract and concrete stimuli while verbalization was either hindered or unhindered. Such a dual-task design allows one to assess whether a certain cognitive process plays a larger role in one condition than in another (Pashler, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">1994</xref>). As we were specifically interested in whether verbalization plays a larger role when learning concrete stimuli than when learning abstract stimuli, we adopted a dual task that suppresses verbalization, that is, we let participants count to three. Doing this while learning, a procedure commonly applied when investigating the effects of verbalization (Nedergaard et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2023</xref>), suppresses participants&#x02019; ability to rehearse verbal information in their phonological loop (e.g., Baddeley &#x00026; Larsen, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2007</xref>; Miyake et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2004</xref>), precluding them from using verbalization to aid learning.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Experiment 1</title><p id="Par6">We primarily hypothesized an interaction effect between stimulus type and verbalization condition on accuracy, that is, that the detrimental effect of hindered verbalization would be more pronounced for concrete compared to abstract stimuli. In addition, we expected main effects of both stimulus type and verbalization condition on accuracy. That is, better learning for concrete compared to abstract stimuli (Farashahi et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2020</xref>) and better learning in the unhindered verbalization condition because it only requires performing a single task (Pashler, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">1994</xref>). We also expected to observe these effects in interaction with trial, that is, that hindered verbalization would especially lead to slower learning for concrete stimuli (stimulus type x verbalization condition x trial interaction), that learning would be faster for concrete than abstract stimuli (stimulus type x trial), and that learning would be faster in the absence compared to the presence of the verbalization task (verbalization condition x trial).</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Method</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Preregistration</title><p id="Par7">All procedures and analyses were preregistered within the Open Science Framework as <italic>Reinforcement learning of abstract vs concrete stimuli</italic> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/qwu3g">https://osf.io/qwu3g</ext-link>).

As such, a total of 68 participants were recruited through the University of Amsterdam. A total of 18 participants were excluded, either because they did not perform the verbalization task correctly (either forgetting to count on more than six beats in a row or more than 25 beats in total, as checked by a present experimenter; <italic>n</italic> = 16) or because of technical failures (<italic>n</italic> = 2). We did not exclude any participants based on their learning performance because we anticipated that if hindered verbalization would affect learning in abstract stimuli, performance in this condition could drop to chance level. Thus, the final sample consisted of 50 participants (24 female, one other<italic>, M</italic><sub><italic>age</italic></sub> = 21.5 (3.0) years, range: 18&#x02013;33 years). We only recruited participants without experience with the Hiragana alphabet or character-based languages to minimize individual differences in the ability to verbalize these abstract stimuli. We reimbursed participants when they completed the long-term retention task within 36 h after testing (see section <italic>Reinforcement-learning task</italic>) and, as preregistered, performed analyses on data from these participants (<italic>n</italic> = 44).</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Reinforcement-learning task</title><sec id="FPar1"><title>Experimental design</title><p id="Par9">We adopted a 2 x 2 within-subjects design in which we manipulated stimulus type (i.e., abstract vs. concrete) and verbalization condition (i.e., hindered vs. unhindered). Each participant performed one block of each combination (four blocks in total) in a randomized order with one constraint: only one of the manipulations changed between two subsequent blocks. For example, an abstract block with verbalization task was followed by either a concrete block with verbalization task (different stimulus type) or an abstract block without verbalization task (different verbalization condition). Each block was followed by a testing block (short-term retention). After 24&#x02013;36 h participants again performed a testing block (long-term retention).</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Task design</title><p id="Par10">As illustrated in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, in each learning block, we presented participants with four new stimulus pairs from which they learned the stimulus with the highest expected value, that is, the correct stimulus, based on feedback. Specifically, we instructed participants that their goal was &#x0201c;to win as many points as possible by clicking on one of the stimuli&#x0201d; and told them that the more points they earned, the higher the monetary bonus they would receive. The stimuli in a pair were fixed across the trials of a block and each pair was presented 16 times (64 trials per block, four blocks, resulting in a fixed total of 256 trials for all participants). The order of the pairs was randomized per four trials such that pairs were presented a maximum of twice in a row. In two of the four blocks (i.e., the unhindered verbalization blocks), participants heard a metronome (80 bpm) but did not have to say anything. In the other two blocks (i.e., the hindered verbalization blocks), we instructed participants to say &#x0201c;1, 2, 3&#x0201d; repeatedly out loud on the beat of the metronome during learning. This articulatory-suppression manipulation hinders verbalization by occupying the phonological loop (Baddeley et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">1984</xref>; Emerson &#x00026; Miyake, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2003</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Example trial sequence of the reinforcement-learning task. <italic>Note</italic>. In the learning task, each trial started with a fixation cross for 500&#x02013;1,000 ms, jittered in steps of 50 ms, to make the metronome beats and the timing of the stimulus pair uncorrelated. Hereafter a pair was presented from which the participant chose one within either 2,500 ms (Exp. 1) or 1,500 ms (Exp. 2). Once a participant chose, feedback was presented for 1,500 ms; hereafter a fixation cross signaled the next trial. If a participant failed to choose within the response window, &#x0201c;Too late! Respond faster!&#x0201d; appeared on the screen for 1,500 ms. These trial sequences were the same across the two experiments (except for the response window) and across the verbalization conditions. Timed-out responses were excluded from all analyses.&#x000a0;In Experiment 1, the percentage of timed-out responses ranged between 0% and 3.1% across participants with 0.6% on average. In Experiment 2, it ranged between 0.4% and 10.2% across participants with 3.9% on average. In both experiments, including these timed-out responses as incorrect responses did not alter the pattern of results; significance only changed for a secondary interaction (i.e., between verbalization condition and trial) in Experiment 2 (see OSM Table <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">II</xref>)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13423_2024_2506_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p id="Par11">Immediately after each learning block, a testing block followed.

As such, performance in testing blocks did not count towards their reimbursement. The testing block was self-paced (i.e., without response deadline).

To only select stimuli with similar verbalizability and to assess whether the abstract stimuli were indeed harder to verbalize than the concrete ones, we conducted a pilot study in which we asked participants to come up with a name for the stimuli and to indicate how difficult it was to do so. To select stimuli that were similarly difficult to discriminate, we also asked participants to rate how similar they found the stimuli in a pair.

This on-site experiment took approximately 30 min. At the end of the on-site experiment, participants saw the bonus they earned on the screen, were asked how they experienced the experiment (both on-screen and by the experimenter), and were informed about the long-term retention task. After 24 h, participants received a link to this task via email. They were instructed to complete it at home within 12 h (i.e., 24&#x02013;36 h after the learning task). If participants did not complete the long-term retention task in time, they received &#x020ac;5 or course credits as reimbursement. If participants did complete the task in time, they received the reimbursement plus a bonus equal to the number of points won in the learning task divided by the number of trials (i.e., 256). This resulted in a bonus between &#x020ac;0 and &#x020ac;10 (<italic>M</italic><sub><italic>bonus</italic></sub> = &#x020ac;1.39 (&#x020ac;0.95)). We told participants that winning more points would lead to a higher reimbursement, but they were unaware of the formula used to convert points into money.

To do so, we administered a reinforcement-learning task in which participants learned either type of stimuli while we hindered verbalization or not. Most importantly, our results showed that hindering verbalization interfered more with learning concrete than with learning abstract stimuli, as reflected in response times in Experiment 1, in which the response window was long, and in choice accuracy in Experiment 2, in which the response window was short. The results thus suggest that people rehearse stimulus names while learning stimuli that are easy to verbalize, which in turn aids their learning.</p><p id="Par34">Our main result, that is, a more pronounced detrimental effect of hindered verbalization on concrete than abstract stimuli, corroborates recent studies suggesting that learning is difficult when stimuli are verbally difficult to discriminate (Yoo et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2023</xref>) and that stimuli that are easy to verbalize are easier to learn than difficult-to-verbalize ones (Radulescu et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2022</xref>). We extend these findings by directly showing that verbalization underlies this superior learning for verbalizable stimuli and by showing that this effect is specific to learning, not to retention. As our data showed that participants learned in all conditions (i.e., when verbalization was both hindered and unhindered, and for both abstract and concrete stimuli) and that hindered verbalization only affects learning for concrete stimuli, this implies that only reinforcement learning underlies learning abstract stimuli, whereas both reinforcement learning and verbalization underlie learning concrete stimuli. Our main result thus provides additional evidence that working-memory processes are involved in reinforcement-learning tasks (Collins &#x00026; Frank, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2018</xref>; Yoo &#x00026; Collins, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2022</xref>), at least in concrete stimuli.</p><p id="Par35">This finding has far-reaching implications for the reinforcement-learning field and related fields that use various stimulus types. Specifically, it suggests that studies using different types of stimuli may be incomparable, affecting the generalizability of results. For instance, brain processes associated with learning abstract stimuli (e.g., Daw et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2011</xref>; Frank et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2005</xref>; Palminteri et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2015</xref>; Pessiglione et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2006</xref>) may not be generalizable to such processes associated with concrete stimuli (e.g., Eppinger et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2008</xref>; van den Bos et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2009</xref>). Also, this finding suggests that stimulus choice affects the validity of results. For instance, when a study using concrete stimuli finds developmental effects on learning, it is unclear which development it measures: the development of reinforcement-based learning, or the development of verbalization, an ability shown to increase from childhood to young adulthood (Yeates, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">1994</xref>) and to decrease again in older adulthood (Au et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1995</xref>; Zec et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2007</xref>). We therefore believe it valuable to assess the comparability of existing studies by performing meta-analyses in which stimulus type is included as fixed or random effect (Yarkoni, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2022</xref>).</p><p id="Par36">Our main questions pertained to the differential role of verbalization in learning different types of stimuli. Other results are worth discussing as well. In line with previous studies, we found that learning was easier for concrete than abstract stimuli (Farashahi et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2020</xref>). Using our dual-task design, we showed that concrete stimuli are easier to verbalize and therefore easier to learn. However, there may be coexisting explanations of this stimulus-type effect. First, results from a pilot study showed that the abstract stimuli were less discriminable than the concrete ones (see OSM Text <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">I</xref>). It could thus be that the concrete stimuli were easier to learn because the two concrete stimuli in a pair were visually more discriminable than the two abstract ones, as previously shown to affect learning (Schutte et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2017</xref>). Second, we used everyday objects as concrete stimuli while we excluded participants that were familiar with the Hirigana alphabet (our abstract stimuli) prior to testing. As such, superior learning for concrete stimuli could be explained by higher familiarity (e.g., Epstein et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">1960</xref>; Stern et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2001</xref>). It is beyond the scope of the paper to further investigate which reason applies because we purposely stuck to stimuli commonly used in the literature and because we were mainly interested in the processes underlying learning from abstract and concrete stimuli, that is, in the interaction between stimulus type and the verbalization task. However, future studies could try to replicate our results using different designs. For instance, by replacing the characters by more discriminable fractals (see, e.g., Gl&#x000e4;scher et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2010</xref>) or by comparing hindered verbalization effects between abstract and concrete stimuli after familiarizing participants with the stimuli (see, e.g., Radulescu et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2022</xref>).</p><p id="Par37">We also found that participants learned better when they were not required to perform the verbalization task while learning. This is in line with a large literature on dual-task interference, suggesting that people have a hard time performing two tasks concurrently (e.g., Pashler, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">1994</xref>).</p><p id="Par38">Although non-significantly, our results suggested that the verbalization task not only interfered with learning concrete stimuli, but also with learning abstract ones. It is unclear whether this is because of general dual-task interference or because people specifically tend to verbalize abstract stimuli. Judging from participants&#x02019; comments after they completed the experiment, it seems like the latter explanation holds: participants indicated they tried to verbalize the abstract stimuli, but were less able to do so as compared to the concrete ones, making it harder to learn them. To experimentally test this, future studies could add a condition in which participants perform a concurrent task that does not involve verbalization &#x02013; for example, a foot-tapping task (e.g., Emerson &#x00026; Miyake, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2003</xref>)&#x000a0;&#x0feff;&#x02013; and compare task effects across the three tasks. If people learn worse from abstract stimuli because they concurrently perform a second task, one would expect interference from both the verbalization and the foot-tapping task. If people learn worse from abstract stimuli because they cannot use verbalization to aid learning, one would only expect interference from the verbalization task.</p><p id="Par39">Relatedly, because we administered one type of dual task, one may argue that the observed dual task interference was due to a process other than verbalization. First, one could argue that interference was merely due to general task interference. This account, however, does not explain our result that the dual task interfered more with learning concrete than abstract stimuli. Second, one could argue that interference was due to the dual task taking up general working-memory capacity instead of verbalization per se. However, as we used the same number of stimuli in both abstract and concrete conditions, this account also does not explain why the dual task interfered more with learning concrete than abstract stimuli. Third, one could argue that the concrete stimuli were visually more complex than the abstract ones and that interference was due to the dual task taking up visual instead of verbal working memory. However, as the dual task did not involve visual information, it is very unlikely that it interfered with visual storage. Fourth, one could argue that the dual task interfered with learning through long-term memory. That is, it could be that learning concrete stimuli requires learners to retrieve information from long-term memory more so than learning abstract stimuli, and that the dual task interferes with this process. As we used everyday objects as concrete stimuli, it could indeed be that learners take advantage of the familiarity of these objects and thus appeal to their long-term memory during learning. This would, however, not affect learning as this process doesn&#x02019;t help them retrieve which stimulus is the correct one and can thus also not explain our main result.</p><p id="Par40">Results from a pilot study, in which we assessed the verbalizability of the considered abstract and concrete stimuli, showed that, in general, concrete stimuli were easier to verbalize than abstract ones (see OSM Fig. <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">II</xref>). Yet, exploratory analyses did not indicate effects of the degree of verbalizability on learning (see OSM Text <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">II</xref>). It may be that this was because the stimuli within each stimulus type had similar degrees of verbalizability. To further investigate the effect of verbalization on learning, it may be worthwhile to investigate the effect of the degree of verbalizability in concrete stimuli. For instance, by administering a set of concrete stimuli with differing degrees of verbalizability. It may be that the effects of verbalization increase with the verbalizability of the concrete stimuli. However, it may also be that verbalizability only aids learning to a certain degree.</p><p id="Par41">Finally, to investigate whether the same processes underlie learning from abstract and concrete stimuli, we adopted a dual-task design in which we hindered verbalization. Specifically, we occupied participants&#x02019; phonological loop (by letting them count while playing), making it more difficult for them to use verbalization to aid learning. In future studies, one may apply computational modeling to assess the origins of the differential effect of hindered verbalization on learning from the two types of stimuli. Ideally, one would want to disentangle the different components of the working-memory system by formulating computational models that separate general working-memory processes from verbal and visual processes. This would allow one to draw conclusions about the specific contributions of the different working-memory systems to learning without administering a concurrent verbalization task. However, to our knowledge, only models assessing general working-memory processes (e.g., Collins &#x00026; Frank, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2012</xref>) have been developed for reinforcement-learning data, not models specifically explaining verbal working-memory processes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par42">To conclude, our results suggest that learning concrete stimuli involves verbalization in addition to basic reinforcement learning. These findings emphasize the importance of carefully considering which stimuli to use in order to ensure the generalizability of results and to validly answer research questions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>Below are the link to the electronic supplementary material.<supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM1"><media xlink:href="13423_2024_2506_MOESM1_ESM.docx"><caption><p>Supplementary file1 (DOCX 22.7 KB)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></p><p>
