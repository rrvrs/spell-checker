Eight patients had a disease duration &#x0003c;2 years, and 35 patients presented with UMN symptoms localized to 1 region (1 bulbar, 34 legs). Change of initial diagnosis occurred in 14% of patients with PLS, and 49% of patients presenting with UMN symptoms in 1 region progressed to PLS. Seven patients developed amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and for 7 patients, diagnosis was revised to hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP). Survival was shorter for patients with a disease duration &#x0003c;4 years. In the probable PLS group, 33% converted to ALS. Converters had a steeper Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale slope (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.023) and shorter symptom duration (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) at inclusion. Of patients presenting with leg symptoms, diagnosis was revised between T2 and T3 in 29%. Introducing a 4-year minimal disease duration for PLS diagnosis and categorization based on regions involved resulted in 86% of PLS diagnoses remaining within the PLS category, 5% transitioning to ALS (slow variant), and 9% to HSP. Survival was longest for patients presenting with symptoms confined to arms and legs or legs only, followed by those with bulbar involvement at baseline, while patients with disease durations between 6 months and 4 years exhibited the shortest survival.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Our findings suggest that a diagnosis of PLS should be deferred until 4 years after symptom onset because shorter durations correlate with higher ALS conversion rates and shorter survival.

Although PLS is a disabling disorder, it is not necessarily life-shortening, with survival often exceeding 15 years.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> The most common patterns of onset and progression are bulbar onset with later progression to the arms and legs, relatively symmetrical onset in the legs with progression to the arms and bulbar region, or markedly one-sided onset and progression, also known as Mills syndrome.</p><p>PLS is diagnosed by exclusion and, therefore, challenging because the initial differential diagnosis is broad, including conditions such as metabolic myelopathies (adrenomyeloneuropathy), primary progressive multiple sclerosis, Alexander disease, autoimmune diseases (anti-amphiphysin antibodies), infections (human T-lymphotropic virus types 1 and 2, syphilis), and paraneoplastic syndromes (e.g., in patients with breast cancer).<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Most conditions in this differential diagnosis can be demonstrated through imaging and genetic and laboratory testing. In patients where ancillary investigations turn out negative, a relatively short, but phenotypically overlapping, list of diagnostic considerations remains, mainly consisting of neurodegenerative diseases: PLS, UMN-predominant presentations of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), (sporadic) hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP), and PLS-progressive supranuclear palsy.</p><p>In many patients, the diagnosis becomes clear over time as additional signs and symptoms develop. For instance, signs of lower motor neuron involvement may become apparent, indicating that the diagnosis is ALS rather than PLS. Therefore, the various diagnostic criteria for PLS have emphasized a minimum symptom disease duration (varying from 2 to 4 years), in which the clinical phenotype should remain a pure UMN disorder.<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> For patients, this unfortunately means that there is an extended period of diagnostic uncertainty.</p><p>The latest diagnostic criteria for PLS, published in 2020, require progressive UMN involvement for 2 years in at least 2 of 3 regions (bulbar, upper extremity, lower extremity), a minimum age of 25 years at diagnosis, and the absence of both sensory symptoms and lower motor neuron degeneration, and that alternative diagnoses have been ruled out. There are 2 categories: &#x0201c;probable PLS (P-PLS),&#x0201d; with a disease duration of 2&#x02013;4 years, and &#x0201c;definite PLS (D-PLS),&#x0201d; with a disease duration of 4 years or longer. Patients with progressive UMN involvement in 1 region are not considered to have PLS. The criteria do not provide guidance on how long patients with UMN involvement in 1 region should be followed or when PLS can be dismissed as diagnosis.<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup></p><p>The current criteria are based on international consensus but have not been validated extensively. In this study, we present long-term follow-up data from a cohort of patients in whom PLS was considered to be the most likely diagnosis. We subsequently applied the 2020 PLS diagnostic criteria to this cohort with the primary objective of validating the diagnostic accuracy of the 2020 consensus criteria.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Patient Inclusion and Follow-Up</title><p>The study population was recruited between November 2002 and March 2005. During this period, all Dutch neurologists and 1 large referral center for MND in Belgium (Leuven) were requested to enroll patients suspected of having PLS in this study.</p><p>The inclusion criteria for our study were as follows: (1) a gradually progressive UMN syndrome, (2) age at onset 18 years or older, (3) disease duration of at least 6 months, and (4) no evidence for an alternative diagnosis based on ancillary investigations.</p><p>The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) positive family history for ALS or HSP at inclusion, (2) sensory signs, (3) cerebellar or extrapyramidal signs, or (4) LMN involvement at inclusion. Regarding LMN involvement, we accepted patients with mild focal amyotrophy of the interosseous muscles of the hands, or of the anterior tibial or calf muscles, or fasciculations in muscles without weakness or atrophy. Patients were excluded if the EMG criteria for ALS were met at inclusion (evidence of both chronic neurogenic change and acute denervation, as defined in the revised El Escorial criteria [rEEC]).<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup></p><p>Medical records were reviewed, and all patients were evaluated by F.B. and L.v.d.B. (visit T1). Patients were followed at 9-month intervals for a total of 3 years after enrollment (visit T2 was at 3 years of follow-up), hereby ensuring that all participants had a minimum symptom duration &#x0003e;3 years, as required by the relevant diagnostic criteria for PLS at that time.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Visit T3 took place 10 years after visit T2 and was performed by B.d.V. Patients who were unwilling or unable to participate in the clinical follow-up were contacted by telephone.</p><p>At each visit, a history was taken and a neurologic examination was performed to determine which regions (as defined in the rEEC) were affected.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> The bulbar region was considered affected if pseudobulbar dysarthria and/or dysphagia was present. The arms and legs were considered to be affected if there was at least one of the following findings on neurologic examination: spasticity (defined as a modified Ashworth Scale score &#x02265;2),<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> obvious loss of dexterity due to spasticity, pathologic hyperreflexia (defined as Institute of Neurological Diseases and Stroke myotatic reflex scale score 4 or 5 or extensor plantar response),<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> or UMN related paresis &#x02265;Medical Research Council grade 4.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup></p><p>The degree of disability was measured using the Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS) or ALSFRS-revised (ALSFRS-R) from 2007 onward.<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> The rate of functional decline was calculated by the number of points lost on the ALSFRS or ALSFRS-R divided by disease duration in years (assuming a maximum score at onset).</p><p>Survival status of patients was obtained on August 31, 2023.</p><p>For patients who were deceased, the date of death and (when available) cause of death were obtained. Causes of death were subsequently categorized as either related, possibly related, unrelated to PLS, or unknown. We considered severe disability with secondary nutritional problems, pulmonary infections due to aspiration in patients with bulbar symptoms, and euthanasia as PLS-related. Cause of death was regarded as possibly PLS-related if patients died from conditions that could be viewed as complications of PLS, such as infections or falls. If cause of death was clearly attributable to a different condition (for example, cancer), deaths were categorized as unrelated to PLS. Finally, for some patients, we were unable to retrieve the cause of death, resulting in the category &#x0201c;unknown.&#x0201d; All causes of death were independently categorized by B.d.V. and E.d.B. Discrepancies were discussed and labeled according to consensus.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Standard Protocol Approvals, Registrations, and Patient Consents</title><p>All patients provided informed consent to participate.

Patients who fulfilled the criteria for either P-PLS (disease duration 2&#x02013;4 years) or D-PLS (disease duration &#x02265;4 years)<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> and patients who did not meet the current criteria were categorized as &#x0201c;undetermined&#x0201d; (those with a disease duration between 6 months and 2 years), &#x0201c;bulbar only&#x0201d; (restricted UMN bulbar symptoms with a disease duration &#x02265;2 years), and &#x0201c;lower limbs only&#x0201d; (UMN symptoms restricted to the lower limbs with a disease duration &#x02265;2 years), which is a phenotype most accurately described as an insidiously progressive spastic paraplegia.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Genetic Testing</title><p>At the time of enrollment in the study, the availability and extent of genetic testing was limited. At inclusion, all patients were screened for the HSP genes considered to be most relevant at that time (<italic toggle="yes">Spastin</italic> [<italic toggle="yes">SPG4</italic>], <italic toggle="yes">Paraplegin</italic> [<italic toggle="yes">SPG7</italic>], and <italic toggle="yes">BSCL2</italic> [<italic toggle="yes">SPG17</italic>]).

All DNA samples of patients without bulbar symptoms were, therefore, tested again in 2018 for variants in an updated panel of HSP genes (n = 48) using next-generation sequencing (eTable 1).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Statistical Analyses</title><p>Differences in clinical characteristics between groups at inclusion were tested using the Pearson &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test, independent-samples <italic toggle="yes">T</italic> test, Mann-Whitney <italic toggle="yes">U</italic> test, and analysis of variance (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The ALSFRS was used to estimate the rate of decline of functional status during follow-up. In our study, the ALSFRS was initially applied and later replaced by the ALSFRS-R. To permit analyses of both the ALSFRS and ALSFRS-R, we omitted the 2 items only present in the ALSFRS-R: orthopnea and the need for ventilatory support. To estimate the rate of decline of functional status during follow-up (ALSFRS), linear mixed-effects models were used. Kaplan-Meier methods and log-rank tests were used to study survival data.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Clinical Characteristics at Baseline of 86 Patients

At inclusion, 50% met the criteria for PLS, 41% had only UMN symptoms in 1 region, and 9% had a disease duration between 6 months and 2 years. When following the patients over time and applying the current consensus criteria, 14% of the patients who initially met the criteria for PLS ended up with another diagnosis (ALS or HSP). When looking at the newly added category of P-PLS specifically, 33% converted to ALS within 3 years of follow-up.</p><p>The aims of the 2020 consensus criteria for PLS were to reduce diagnostic delay, optimize therapeutic trial design, and catalyze the development of disease-modifying therapy.<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> To achieve these objectives, it is crucial to demonstrate that these criteria indeed yield high diagnostic accuracy and, therefore, that validation studies are performed.</p><p>Thus far, only 1 validation study has been undertaken in a German cohort of patients, diagnosed with PLS based on expert opinion, and to which the current consensus criteria were applied retrospectively.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> This study reported diagnosis at baseline and at the last follow-up with a median disease duration of 6.1 years (interquartile range 4.1&#x02013;12.1) for 41 patients. There were 3 categories: those not meeting the consensus criteria (n = 22), those with P-PLS (n = 9), and those with D-PLS (n = 10).</p><p>Of the 22 patients in the &#x0201c;consensus criteria not met&#x0201d; group, 4 developed ALS and 1 was found to have nonprogressive spastic monoparesis of the left leg, later attributed to myelopathy associated with spinal epidural lipomatosis (21 years after symptom onset). Nine patients did go on to develop PLS, and 8 patients still had a clinically pure UMN phenotype that did not meet the criteria.</p><p>The diagnosis was not revised for any of the 19 patients meeting the criteria for P-PLS or D-PLS. Hence, the authors conclude that the consensus criteria revealed high diagnostic certainty and prognostic significance.</p><p>Although the German validation study found high diagnostic certainty, it is important to note that the population size was modest and that previous studies have found that patients who would fulfill P-PLS or D-PLS criteria developed ALS at later time points. For instance, Gordon et al.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> found that 13 patients with PLS from a cohort of 29 (45%) received the diagnosis ALS (77% before 4 years and 23% after 4 years), and Paganoni et al.<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> found that 2 of 250 patients (0.8%) who fulfilled the Pringle criteria were diagnosed with ALS during follow-up in a large retrospective registry (NEALS). In our study, we found that 8% of patients with D-PLS and 33% of those with P-PLS went on to develop ALS.</p><p>Considering that patients with both P-PLS and D-PLS went on to develop ALS and patients from the category lower limbs only progressed to PLS, we explored whether adaptations to the diagnostic criteria would lead to higher diagnostic accuracy and more prognostic value by implementing the following adjustments:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Classifying patients according to involved regions that would allow the categories to more accurately reflect the phenotypes, including survival.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Extending the minimum duration of UMN involvement to 4 years, instead of 2 years, as a requirement for diagnosing PLS, with the objective of minimizing the number of patients converting to ALS.</p></list-item></list></p><p>Applying these adjustments results in 4 different groups: (1) &#x0201c;PLS bulbar involvement&#x0201d; for patients with UMN symptoms of the bulbar region (other regions may also be involved); (2) &#x0201c;PLS upper and lower limbs&#x0201d;; (3) &#x0201c;spastic paraplegia&#x0201d; (for those with UMN involvement limited to the lower limbs); and (4) &#x0201c;UMN disease (UMND)&#x0201d; a term we propose for patients with a progressive UMN syndrome and a disease duration &#x0003c;4 years.</p><p>Application of the adapted criteria would initially classify a lower percentage of the cohort as PLS (44% vs 50%). However, this would result in similar numbers after 3 years of follow-up (&#x000b1;68%) and, importantly, a lower conversion rate to ALS (8% vs 12%) (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). It is important to note that in the patients who converted to ALS under the adapted criteria, the diagnosis was based on needle-EMG findings, but not on clinically evident LMN signs. Moreover, all these patients had long survival (13&#x02013;23 years since onset).</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Diagnosis at Each Time Point Based on the Adapted Criteria</title><p>The numbers represent the number of patients per category at each time point.

Application of the current criteria shows that survival is significantly shorter for the undetermined and P-PLS groups compared with the D-PLS and the lower limbs only groups. It seems this shorter survival in the undetermined and P-PLS groups can be attributed to a higher rate of conversion to ALS (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). With the proposed adaptations, there are 3 clearly distinct survival curves for the UMND, PLS with bulbar involvement, and spastic paraplegia groups. The PLS upper and lower limbs group is small, but the survival curve is also clearly distinct from the UMND group (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Survival Curves According to 2020 PLS Consensus Criteria and Regional Categorization</title><p>(A) Kaplan-Meier curves for the different diagnostic groups included in this study according to the current consensus criteria. There is a statistically significant shorter survival for the P-PLS and undetermined groups compared with the D-PLS and lower limbs only groups.

Because there was only 1 patient with bulbar involvement restricted to the bulbar region, this case was not included in the figure.

As a result, the estimates of conversion rates to ALS have been variable and are likely inaccurate. Therefore, larger studies on conversion rates to ALS are clearly warranted, as well as more detailed analysis of which factors are associated or predictive of conversion. In this study, ALSFRS decline and symptom duration were the most important factors. However, additional factors, such as EMG changes and serum/CSF neurofilaments, should also be interrogated in future studies.</p><p>Both our study and the German validation study enrolled patients who initially did not meet the criteria but did do so during follow-up.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> The current criteria do not provide guidance on how long patients should be followed. This could potentially cause the diagnosis of PLS to be missed in patients in whom spread of UMN signs to additional body regions is slow. Conversely, there are patients with predominant UMN signs that remain restricted to the lower limbs for well over a decade and who do not meet PLS criteria. They have negative family histories and DNA testing for HSP and do not fall into a clear diagnostic category. These cases are perhaps also best labeled according to their phenotype, spastic paraplegia.</p><p>In summary, this study provides long-term follow-up data (&#x0003e;10 years) on a large cohort of patients with PLS. Using these data, we performed a validation study of the current consensus criteria, which demonstrates several key points for potential improvement and where additional research is needed. First, extending the minimally required duration of a pure UMN phenotype to 4 years would lower the rate of patients with PLS converting to ALS. Given the limited number of patients in our cohort with a disease duration of 2&#x02013;4 years, our study does not specifically address the optimal time cutoff for diagnosing PLS.</p><p>Larger studies on the frequency and timing of the emergence of LMN signs in patients with pure UMN syndrome are required. A better understanding of which factors are predictors of conversion (such as ALSFRS slope) could potentially also be integrated into the updated criteria. This study also demonstrates that long-term follow-up of patients is crucial because patients who initially do not meet PLS criteria may do so at later time points. In our view, updated criteria should contain guidance on how follow-up should be structured. Finally, we propose that classifying patients according to involved body regions, rather than only on disease duration, holds more prognostic value.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>The authors are thankful for the cooperation of all the patients, the referring neurologists, and the Dutch patient support organization for neuromuscular diseases (Vereniging Spierziekten Nederland).</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p>Editorial, page <related-article xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" related-article-type="commentary" id="ra2" vol="104" page="e213685" xlink:href="40388676" ext-link-type="pubmed">e213685</related-article>
