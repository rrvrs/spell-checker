Ten semi-structured interviews gauged how Black pastors understood their role in increasing vaccine use in their communities. Seven themes emerged from analysis: creating awareness of change; establishing a connection; seeking to understand; encouraging the new behavior; leveraging the power of interpersonal communication; maintaining support; and providing future assistance.

Blacks&#x02019; risk was the highest [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], Blacks were more likely to be diagnosed with COVID-19; 2.5 times more likely to be hospitalized; and nearly twice as likely to die from COVID-19 compared to Whites. In South Carolina, Black men and the elderly experienced higher rates of death and hospitalization for COVID-19 than did other residents [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Blacks were more susceptible to COVID-19 for several reasons, including living in congested areas, not being able to telework, and high rates of chronic conditions [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p id="P5">In response to these COVID-19 disparities, national public health efforts prioritized making COVID-19 testing and vaccination more accessible and affordable for high-risk populations [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, rates among Blacks remained low due to mistrust [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Mansfield et al. [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] found concerns about the COVID-19 vaccine among Blacks living in Los Angeles based on historical medical mistreatment and racism.</p><p id="P6">In South Carolina, more than 75% of COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths were among those who were not fully vaccinated by July 2021, although an estimated half of the population had had at least one dose of the vaccine [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. As of 2022, the percentage of South Carolinians fully vaccinated increased to 58% [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p id="P7">Many newspaper headlines and television news stories across the country described the impact of Black pastors in increasing vaccine uptake among their congregants and local communities. For example, the New York Times reported &#x0201c;&#x02018;A Safe Space&#x02019;: Black Pastors Promote Vaccinations from the Pulpit&#x0201d; p. 1 [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], and U.S. News and World Report ran &#x0201c;To Save Their Communities, Black Ministers Preach the Gospel about the COVID-19 Vaccine&#x0201d; p. 1 [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Their recognition of the importance of pastors of Black churches as trusted voices to help increase COVID-19 vaccine rates in the Black community is no surprise. The Black church has long been an effective ally in combating various diseases, suggesting pastors may be change agents in promoting good health [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. A host of research studies attests its reach to the Black community and promotion of a holistic approach to healthcare [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Some studies suggest that faith-based programs can help to increase physical activity among Blacks [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and create more awareness about diseases, such as high blood pressure and diabetes [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], to help with weight loss and management [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p id="P8">Studies published since the onset of COVID-19 show Black pastors confronting the pandemic. One study found that Blacks who identify with the &#x0201c;Black Protestant tradition&#x0201d; and attend church at least once each month were more likely to be vaccinated for COVID-19; over 50% of survey respondents indicated that their pastors encourage inoculation for the virus [<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Dada et al. [<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] discussed the importance of Black pastors partnering with other trusted members in the Black community, such as Black medical providers, to increase COVID-19 vaccination rates. Furthermore, the National Black Church Initiative (NBCI), a collaboration between Black and Latino churches, partnered with the CDC in 2021 to help increase COVID-19 vaccination rates. These churches became established community vaccination clinics [<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p id="P9">In 1962, E. M. Rogers first proposed the &#x0201c;diffusion of innovations theory&#x0201d; to better understand how using change agents, or influential and effective sources, to disseminate information encourages the adoption of new ideas or behaviors (Rogers, 2003). &#x0201c;The innovation is an idea, practice, or object perceived as new by an individual or other unit of adoption. The diffusion process typically involves both mass media and interpersonal communication channels&#x0201d; p. 415 [<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. A change agent is part of the interpersonal communication channels, &#x0201c;[a]n individual who influences clients&#x02019; innovation-decisions in a direction deemed desirable by a change agency. &#x02026;Change agents often use opinion leaders in a social system as their lieutenants in diffusion activities&#x0201d; p. 27 [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The innovation may be adopted faster if effective communication of the message connects recipients with the overall idea [<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The &#x0201c;sequence of change agents&#x0201d; describes the different stages of communication that change agents can use to get people to accept the new product or behavior. This paper uses these ideas to elucidate Black pastors&#x02019; position as change agents in disseminating information about COVID-19 vaccinations.</p><p id="P10">More specifically, the theory&#x02019;s communication domain guides this qualitative analysis and the organization of themes. Pastors are conceived as change agents because they worked with different local, state, and/or health agencies to disseminate information and/or provide opportunities to administer the COVID-19 vaccines at their churches or local community vaccination sites. The study focuses on the &#x0201c;the sequence of change agent roles&#x0201d; described in Rogers p. 369 [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] as it pertains to pastors of predominantly Black churches in South Carolina.</p></sec><sec id="S2"><label>2.</label><title>Methods</title><p id="P11">This paper is part of a larger study that explored the communication channels pastors of predominantly Black churches in South Carolina used in response to COVID-19 and vaccination [<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The churches were located in both rural and urban areas. We used a qualitative, phenomenological design that allowed us to understand how pastors worked with their congregations and surrounding communities to increase awareness about COVID-19 vaccines and to promote vaccination [<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The lead author&#x02019;s Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved the study.</p><p id="P12">The interview guide consisted of eleven questions adapted from a study on the communication channels used in the Black church to discuss HIV/AIDS [<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Here, the questions focused on background information about the churches and dissemination practices the Black pastors used to create awareness of COVID-19 testing and vaccinations. The validity and reliability are addressed through the use of a similar questionnaire that addresses a health topic among a comparable population.</p><sec id="S3"><label>2.1.</label><title>Sample</title><p id="P13">We used snowball sampling to identify and contact pastors at predominately Black churches in South Carolina. By asking for referrals from each pastor, we found 10 pastors who agreed to participate in the study. The number of participants contacted was less than 15. It was a challenge to speak with pastors who fit the demographics of the study. Because of the pandemic, many churches did not have someone in the office. Data saturation could be reached with sample sizes ranging from six to eight participants [<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Data saturation was achieved at 10 participants for this study, which is still considered acceptable. There was not a specific rule for deciding on saturation. However, according to Morse [<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], when a researcher is conducting &#x0201c;a phenomenological study and interviewing each person many times, one has a large amount of data for each participant and therefore needs fewer participants in the study (perhaps only 6 to10)&#x0201d; (pp. 4&#x02013;5). For this study, the researchers did not interview the participants more than once, but the interviews were in-depth based on the questions and provided enough information.</p><p id="P14">Study design used semi-structured interviews, but the set questions allow discussion of new ideas resulting from responses. With the pastors&#x02019; approval, each interview was recorded over the telephone during July 2021. The IRB approved the pastors giving consent verbally over the telephone.

According to Rogers [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], change agents can help to pass information from &#x0201c;agency&#x0201d; to &#x0201c;audience.&#x0201d; In working with state and local health agencies, pastors play a vital role in disseminating information about COVID-19 vaccines to their congregations and the surrounding areas. They used different strategies, such as specific word choice, to avoid a disparaging tone and to learn why some church members were hesitant to take a COVID-19 vaccine. At times, they were challenged to provide too much information, which can cause misunderstandings about an innovation [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Caron and Dorsey [<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] de-scribe the importance of addressing &#x0201c;competing messages&#x0201d; about the COVID-19 vaccine and encouraging more messages among clergy. Pastors in this study sought to empathize with their church members&#x02019; concerns [<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], while sharing facts from reputable sources to convey the benefits of vaccination. Their trusting relationship is vital. Pastors emphasized the importance of not only disseminating accurate, health-based information about the recommended vaccines, but providing access, especially during the early months of distribution. Pastors set up clinics at their churches, provided access to clinics, and/or disseminated information about clinics. Abdul-Mutakabbir et al. [<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] describe an effective strategy relying on Black pastors and medical providers to increase awareness and remove structural barriers to accessing vaccines, such as deploying mobile clinics.

Historical medical mistrust and contemporary experiences of discrimination in healthcare have been cited as reasons why Blacks are apprehensive participating in medical studies [<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Their pastors understand why church and community members may be reluctant to take the vaccine. Partnering with trusted Black pastors is imperative in educating Black communities about COVID-19 vaccination and other healthcare innovations. Future healthcare messaging should be culturally tailored to Black communities and address their specific concerns.</p><p id="P43">This study has several limitations. First, findings may not apply to Black pastors in other states. Second, the 10 pastors are clustered in two areas, mainly the coast and up-state; Black pastors in the central and western regions of South Carolina may consider different strategies to help increase COVID-19 vaccine uptake among their congregants. Third, the Black pastors represent only two denominations. Finally, the researchers did not interview church members to understand their attitudes about the pastors&#x02019; COVID-19 vaccination messages.</p></sec><sec id="S14"><label>5.</label><title>Conclusions</title><p id="P44">This study used the diffusion of innovations theory to identify the function of pastors in predominantly Black churches as change agents in disseminating COVID-19 vaccine information in South Carolina. It highlights the importance of developing strategies with trusted messengers, such as Black pastors, to improve communication and health awareness in communities that have endured discrimination for centuries. Pastors who disseminate COVID-19 vaccine information continue to help protect the health of their communities.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="S15"><title>Funding</title><p id="P45">This research received no external funding</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="FN2"><p id="P46">Conflict of Interest</p><p id="P47">The authors have no conflicts of interest to declare.</p></fn><fn id="FN3"><p id="P48">Ethical Considerations</p><p id="P49">The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at North Carolina A&#x00026;T State University (protocol #22&#x02013;0088).</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="R1"><label>[1]</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><name><surname>Rogers</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name>
