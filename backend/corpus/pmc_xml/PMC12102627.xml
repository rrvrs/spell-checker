Adjunctive psychological interventions for BD can delay episode recurrence and reduce symptom severity [<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. However, only 54% of individuals with BD receiving pharmacological treatment have accessed psychosocial services [<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Smartphone apps could improve access to care by facilitating mood and sleep monitoring, providing psychoeducation, supporting medication adherence, and enabling in-the-moment application of coping skills [<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and may benefit quality of life, relapse risk, and mood instability in BD [<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>-<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Unfortunately, research-led efforts to develop evidence-based mental health apps are rarely made publicly available. For example, a review of apps for psychosis found that only 15% of research apps were accessible on the public marketplace [<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In contrast, there is a boom in commercial mental health apps [<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The acceptability and uptake of apps in people with BD are high, with 77% expressing interest in receiving mental health treatment via their mobile device [<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], and 42% reporting use of an app to support mood or sleep self-management [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>There are drawbacks to consider in regard to the safety, efficacy, and feasibility of apps for BD. A review of the top 98 apps returned for the search term &#x0201c;bipolar&#x0201d; found that almost half were not clearly relevant to BD, no patient-facing apps were developed by a university or health care organization, and only 1 app had peer-reviewed literature to support its efficacy [<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Two-thirds of apps offered privacy policies, of which 41% shared personal data with third parties. Some apps contained potentially harmful content such as advice misaligned with treatment guidelines and stigmatizing or triggering content. Further, the majority of apps for BD did not contain features to support user engagement, despite the fact that many commercial apps report poor user retention [<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Given the variable quality of publicly available apps for BD, it is unsurprising that consumers experience challenges in selecting appropriate options. Results from an international survey regarding app use among people with BD found that younger age, education below a postgraduate level, and lack of experience using mood or sleep self-management apps were associated with lower levels of digital health literacy (the ability to identify, evaluate, and use health information in an online context) [<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Individuals with lower health literacy are less likely to adopt eHealth resources or perceive them as useful while simultaneously overestimating the privacy protections offered by health apps [<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. As such, these groups are at risk of selecting unsafe or inappropriate apps (or conversely, not using potentially helpful apps).</p><p>Supporting informed decision-making in mental health app use through developing digital health literacy skills is necessary for an equitable digital mental health ecosystem [<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Ideally, clinicians would play a role in referring individuals with BD to credible, safe, and engaging apps, given their role as a trusted information source [<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In practice, a web-based survey of health care providers found that only 50% had discussed or recommended smartphone apps to patients with BD [<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Alternative information sources accessible to patients include expert-reviewed app libraries, such as Psyberguide [<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], the mHealth Index and Navigation Database [<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], and the Organisation for the Review of Care and Health Apps [<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Individuals with BD rarely sought information on health apps from such resources, preferring to seek recommendations from others with BD, app store reviews, or family or friends [<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>An alternative strategy to relying on health care provider recommendations or app libraries is to enhance digital health literacy skills in patients. One such intervention targeting people with serious mental illness is the 4-week Digital Opportunities for Outcomes in Recovery Services (DOORS) course [<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. However, the length and foundational content of this program (eg, basic smartphone functions) may not be suitable for all individuals with BD, given research showing people with BD have high levels of smartphone ownership [<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and higher digital health literacy than people with psychosis [<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>Brief videos may be an acceptable method to succinctly communicate key messages regarding mental health app selection and have previously been shown to be an effective knowledge translation strategy for people with BD [<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. They require a lower time commitment to learning than an in-person course such as DOORS and may be shared easily across a wide range of electronic devices (eg, phones and computers), potentially enhancing their reach and accessibility. Brief videos could also be embedded in psychological interventions for BD or provided as a supplementary resource, as a way to support individuals with BD to self-identify smartphone apps relevant to the self-management strategies taught in psychoeducation or in psychotherapy [<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>This study aimed (1) to develop a brief educational video describing strategies for selecting safe, effective, and engaging mental health apps and (2) to evaluate the acceptability and impacts of this intervention among people with BD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Ethical Considerations</title><p>Ethics approval for the video evaluation was granted by the University of British Columbia Behavioral Research Ethics Board (H21-03767) on January 19, 2022.

In the first phase, we applied principles of community-based participatory research (CBPR) to develop a brief video promoting awareness of the potential risks and benefits of mental health apps for individuals with BD and strategies to select appropriate apps. In the second phase, we conducted a quantitative evaluation of the acceptability and impact of the brief psychoeducation video.</p></sec><sec><title>CBPR Framework</title><p>The study was conducted using a CBPR framework: academic researchers or clinicians and those with lived experience worked in partnership to identify research priorities, conduct research, and disseminate findings [<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The approach used was informed by 20 years of experiential knowledge of applying CBPR methods in BD research and knowledge translation by the Collaborative Research Team to Study Psychosocial Issues in Bipolar Disorder (CREST.BD) research network [<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Details of the CREST.BD network are summarized below; a fulsome case study describing the network&#x02019;s history and use of CBPR methods to determine network priorities has been previously published [<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], along with papers describing the network&#x02019;s approach to CBPR in a BD context [<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p>The CREST.BD network was established in 2005 as a British Columbia&#x02013;focused team of clinicians and researchers with expertise in BD and psychosocial treatments, with an emphasis on community-engaged research. In 2010, it expanded to a Canada-wide network and formally established advisory groups consisting primarily of individuals with lived experience of BD as well as clinicians and representatives of community organizations. Since then, the network has expanded its scope and geographic representation: team members specialize in a range of disciplines (ie, psychology, psychiatry, criminology, nursing, social work, gerontology, occupational therapy, and genetic counseling) and are located internationally, with particularly strong representation in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia. The current membership of CREST.BD can be viewed on the website [<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Membership of the CREST.BD advisory groups has changed over the years, and project-specific advisory groups have also contributed to network activities. As some members are not publicly disclosed as living with BD, the identities of advisory group members are not detailed on the website.</p><p>In this work, CBPR activities were led by a subset of CREST.BD members (EM or EEM) and peer researchers through a project working group. In addition, 2 CREST.BD advisory groups were actively consulted on project activities. The membership of these groups and their involvement in the project, from conceptualization and funding acquisition through to the preparation of study findings, is summarized in <xref rid="figure1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> and described further below.</p><fig position="float" id="figure1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Involvement of lived experience and community perspectives across the project phases.

One advisory group (Community Advisory Group) consulted at a high level on the network&#x02019;s program of research and was primarily comprised of people living with BD; other group members were a clinician, representatives of community organizations, and a community engagement and knowledge translation coordinator with a specialty focus on diverse and marginalized communities [<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The other advisory group (Bipolar Bridges Advisory Group) consulted specifically on the development of an app for BD and was comprised only of people with lived experience of BD [<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]; feedback was therefore obtained from individuals with varying degrees of interest in and familiarity with apps. Membership of the Bipolar Bridges Advisory Group specifically privileged individuals of diverse genders, sexual orientations, ethnicities, and cultural backgrounds.</p><p>Here, the advisory groups provided feedback on specific decisions about the video content and presentation and the evaluation strategy (including questionnaire wording and recruitment avenues). The groups also generated new ideas for alternative knowledge dissemination strategies that were the focus of later development efforts (see Discussion section). The advisory groups were consulted on 3 occasions over Zoom over the course of the project (attendance ranged from n=4 to n=7). Additional feedback was obtained asynchronously via email. On the spectrum of public participation [<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], the advisory groups contributed at both the &#x0201c;consult&#x0201d; and the &#x0201c;involve&#x0201d; level in the context of their longstanding contributions to establishing the CREST.BD strategic plan, research priorities, and ways of working, a process that has been documented in detail elsewhere [<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. All members of the advisory groups share the same scope of decision-making power.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Phase 1: Development of the Video</title><sec><title>Overview</title><p>Video development occurred between October 2021 and December 2022. Key messages and strategies for the video content were informed by the working group collaboratively reviewing and discussing existing resources (eg, the mHealth Index and Navigation Database and the DOORS curriculum [<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]), research on specific digital health needs of people with BD and depression [<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], and peer researcher reflections on their own lived experiences. The script was then drafted by EM and revised with input from EEM, ND, and RXH. Peer researchers were also involved in facilitating consultations with the CREST.BD advisory groups regarding the draft script and storyboard, with feedback integrated into the final video. Decisions regarding video look and feel were driven by peer researchers ND and RXH, who reviewed mood boards and previous videos by the artist to inform decisions regarding video presentation.</p><p>The guiding principles for video presentation were collaboratively decided by the project working group: the aim was to keep the video short, simple, and informative to make it easy for people living with BD to understand and apply the recommendations. Reflecting the values expressed by peer researchers, we deliberately targeted a wide range of patient demographics, and accessibility concerns (eg, cognitive difficulties, color blindness, hearing problems, and English as a second or foreign language) were considered in script development, storyboarding, and dissemination plans. For example, we used representative images rather than text wherever possible to minimize demands on working memory and facilitate subtitling and translation (<xref rid="figure2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>).

Broad topic areas addressed in the video were informed by the American Psychiatric Association (APA) app evaluation model, which in itself was developed by harmonizing 45 different app evaluation frameworks [<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], and consist of five different levels: (1) background information (eg, cost, accessibility, developer information, and system requirements), (2) privacy and security (eg, availability of a privacy policy, collection and use of data, data protection, and management of safety risks), (3) evidence base (eg, clinical foundation and evidence of efficacy or feasibility), (4) ease of use (eg, usability and engagement features), and (5) data integration. Video content centered on privacy and security, evidence base, and ease of use, as there is growing consensus between approaches to app evaluation that data security measures and clinical foundations are of central importance [<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Similarly, engagement with content and features is necessary for apps to have beneficial effects [<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The decision to emphasize these topics is reinforced by data, showing that people with BD report content quality or accuracy, ease of use, and control over information privacy or security among the top 4 most important mental health app features [<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Specific recommendations relevant to each chosen level of the APA app evaluation model are informed by the following considerations:</p></sec><sec><title>Privacy and Security</title><p>We represented mHealth Index and Navigation Database criteria deemed essential by a previous review [<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]: having a privacy policy, reporting security measures, declaring data use and purpose, allowing for the deletion of data, and allowing users to opt out of data collection. Feedback from peer researchers was that difficulties in interpreting the complex regulatory language of privacy policies should be normalized and that viewers could be directed to look for key phrases or to seek additional help from health care providers.</p></sec><sec><title>Evidence Base</title><p>To support viewers in evaluating the clinical foundations of an app, we described features with the potential to facilitate key mediating mechanisms of evidence-supported psychosocial interventions [<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].

Based on prior research on barriers to app engagement in people with a mood disorder [<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], as well as feedback from peer researchers, we strove to normalize BD-related fluctuations in mood and energy and their consequent impacts on engagement.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec><title>Phase 2: Evaluation of the Video-Based Intervention</title><sec><title>Overview</title><p>Evaluation of the video-based intervention was conducted using the web-based Qualtrics platform. Participants provided demographic information, completed baseline assessments, viewed the video, and responded to evaluation items immediately afterward. Data collection occurred between February and October 2023.</p></sec><sec><title>Participants and Recruitment</title><p>Participant recruitment occurred via promotion on CREST.BD social media pages, paid advertisements on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter, emails to the CREST.BD mailing list, and health care providers or organizations associated with the CREST.BD network (eg, Hope+Me, a Toronto-based community organization offering peer support and counseling; Bipolar Support Club International, an online, peer-led organization offering support and education; and the John Hopkins Bipolar Disorder clinic, an academic psychiatry center offering BD-specific consultation and care). CREST.BD network members based internationally (including academics, clinicians, representatives of mental health advocacy organizations, people with lived experience of BD, and caregivers or supports of individuals with BD) were invited to disseminate the recruitment materials through their networks.</p><p>Inclusion criteria were (1) age 19 years or older, (2) a self-reported diagnosis of BD, and (3) access to a personal smartphone device. The evaluation survey was open internationally.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Data Collection</title><sec><title>Overview</title><p>A web-based survey was developed based on previous literature and refined through peer researcher and advisory group input (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Multimedia Appendix 2</xref>). At baseline, individuals were asked to provide information on demographics (age, gender, cultural and racial background, education, and occupation), clinical characteristics (BD diagnosis and current treatment), and technology use (use of self-management apps and preferred information sources). Questions related to eHealth literacy and mobile health (mHealth) literacy (described below) were asked before and after viewing the video. After the video, 6 Likert-scale statements developed by the researchers (EM or EEM) were used to obtain video acceptability ratings (1=strongly disagree to 5=strongly agree).</p></sec><sec><title>eHealth Literacy</title><p>The eHealth Literacy Scale (eHEALS) was used to evaluate self-assessed knowledge and confidence in identifying, applying, and evaluating the quality of digital health resources [<xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Eight self-report Likert-type items (1=strongly disagree to 5=strongly agree) are summed to create an overall score (range 8-40), with higher scores indicating greater digital health literacy. Two additional Likert-type items assess respondents&#x02019; perception of the utility and importance of digital health resources; these are not included in the overall score calculation. The 1-factor structure and reliability of the eHEALS have been demonstrated in the general population [<xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>-<xref rid="ref46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] and populations with health conditions [<xref rid="ref47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>-<xref rid="ref49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>mHealth Literacy</title><p>While the eHEALS is the most commonly used measure of digital health literacy [<xref rid="ref50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], it was developed prior to the widespread use of apps and therefore may not encompass all relevant aspects of mHealth literacy. To address this, 6 additional items (using the same 5-point Likert scale as the eHEALS) were developed by the researchers (EM or EEM) to assess self-perceived knowledge and confidence specific to searching for, evaluating, and using self-management apps (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Multimedia Appendix 2</xref>). These items were not validated.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Data Analysis</title><p>Data were analyzed using SPSS (version 29; IBM Corp). Descriptive statistics were used to summarize demographics and feedback regarding video acceptability. Paired-sample <italic>t</italic> tests were used to compare summary scores on the eHEALS before and after viewing the video. The ordinal nature of mHealth literacy items warranted the use of a nonparametric, 2-sample paired sign test to assess video impacts. Significance was set at <italic>P=.</italic>05, and all analyses were 2-tailed. Effect sizes for paired-sample <italic>t</italic> tests were estimated using Cohen <italic>d</italic>, and effect sizes for nonparametric, 2-sample paired sign tests were estimated using Cliff &#x003b4;, given the nonnormal distribution of the difference scores [<xref rid="ref51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="ref52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Sensitivity analyses (<xref rid="app3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Multimedia Appendix 3</xref>) were conducted to evaluate the potential influence of key demographic and baseline variables on missing data, the impact of outliers, and the influence of missing data [<xref rid="ref53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Survey Sample</title><p>Of individuals who consented to the survey (n=77), suspected fraudulent responses (n=23) were removed based on indicators including duplicate IP addresses, email addresses that did not match provided names, infeasible completion times, and duplicate responses to open-ended survey items [<xref rid="ref54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="ref55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], leaving 54 valid entries. In total, 42 respondents completed the survey; their data were used for analyses of acceptability and changes in digital health literacy.</p><p>Demographics are summarized in <xref rid="table2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. Survey completers were primarily women (n=29, 69%), White (n=31, 74%), and residing in North America (n=34, 81%), with a mean age of 38.6 (SD 12) years. Under half the sample self-reported a BD-II diagnosis (n=19, 45%), and most participants were receiving psychiatric treatment, including medication (n=38, 90%) and counseling (n=25, 60%). The majority of the sample had completed postsecondary education (n=34, 81%).</p><p>To provide some insights into whether data were missing in a systematic fashion (<xref rid="app3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Multimedia Appendix 3</xref>), we compared those who dropped out prior to survey completion and those who completed the study using independent <italic>t</italic> tests for age and baseline eHEALS. Chi-square tests were used to assess for differences in survey completion rates related to gender and previous use of BD-related health apps, as this was found to be associated with digital health literacy in a previous analysis [<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. We did not assess for differences between BD-I and BD-II, as in the same previous analysis, when BD-I was used as the reference category in our regression model BD-II did not emerge as a significant predictor of eHEALS scores [<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. No significant differences were found between completers and noncompleters, suggesting that missing data were not associated with these demographic characteristics.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="table2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Demographic and clinical characteristics of survey participants.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" width="1000" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="1"><col width="30" span="1"/><col width="540" span="1"/><col width="180" span="1"/><col width="250" span="1"/><thead><tr valign="top"><td colspan="2" rowspan="1">Demographic or clinical variable</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Total sample (N=54)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Survey completers (n=42)</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr valign="top"><td colspan="2" rowspan="1">Age (years), mean (SD)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">40.1 (12.0)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">38.6 (11.8)</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td colspan="4" rowspan="1">

Preliminary evaluation data show that the video was largely perceived as acceptable, and viewing the video resulted in improvements to eHealth literacy. This study adds to a body of research showing that educational initiatives can improve digital health literacy for people with chronic health conditions. A previous scoping review identified 9 interventions aimed at improving digital health literacy that were grouped into 2 categories: those providing education and training and those providing social support, with education and training initiatives (including videos, workshops, and massive open online courses) showing greater benefits for digital health literacy [<xref rid="ref50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. We are only aware of 2 interventions developed to address digital health literacy in individuals with mental health conditions, including DOORS (developed to support individuals with psychosis to use smartphones and apps) [<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and video-based training to use a patient portal for people with chronic conditions (including depression and anxiety, among other physical health conditions) [<xref rid="ref57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. While these interventions reported positive effects for eHealth literacy measures, neither were developed with specific consideration of the app-related preferences and information needs of people living with BD, a gap addressed by our video-based intervention.</p><p>To complement the eHEALS, which is focused on digital health literacy more broadly, we also included some researcher-developed items to evaluate change in smartphone-specific competencies, such as searching for and evaluating apps. Positively, we observed improvements to some aspects of mHealth literacy, such as willingness to ask a health care provider for support and confidence in evaluating app privacy policies. We note that our previous web-based survey of health care providers found a common barrier to discussing or recommending smartphone apps to patients with BD was practitioner knowledge [<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]&#x02014;our findings therefore suggest that clinician education efforts are also needed in order for patients to receive the desired support from health care providers regarding app selection. Furthermore, in light of consensus that the presence of privacy and data security protections is of foundational importance in the decision of whether or not to use apps [<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], and BD-specific literature showing control over information privacy or security ranks among the top 4 most important mental health app features [<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], the finding that confidence evaluating privacy policies improved after the video is of particular note. As we included several strategies to support viewers in evaluating privacy policies (ie, key aspects of privacy policies, encouragement to seek the support of health care providers, and links to app libraries), future qualitative evaluations could explore which of these were most impactful from a viewer perspective, which could inform refinements to this and similar digital health literacy interventions.</p><p>It is important to acknowledge that not all aspects of mHealth literacy demonstrated improvements. Potentially, this may be indicative of some ceiling effects, given median baseline responses to items that did not demonstrate change were &#x0201c;agree&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;strongly agree.&#x0201d; We acknowledge the possibility that the use of web-based recruitment methods may have biased the participating sample to individuals with higher baseline digital health literacy as well as interest in app-based tools (described further in the Limitations section). However, it is also possible that the brief video-based intervention was not detailed enough to result in changes to self-perceived knowledge. Indeed, while video acceptability ratings were overall positive, some minor disagreement was observed regarding the appropriateness of the length of the video. Our own CREST.BD advisory groups offered similar reflections regarding the need to offer more in-depth learning opportunities for specific subgroups; the development of a suite of self-guided educational resources to address this feedback is detailed below.</p><p>Our project adds to a body of literature on the utility of CBPR frameworks for developing educational outputs that are well-received and impactful in the target population [<xref rid="ref58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>-<xref rid="ref60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Input from peer researchers and advisory groups helped to ensure that the video focused on issues of primary importance to people with BD, that recommendations were feasible and practical, and that video delivery was engaging and accessible. Participatory research activities in this study also highlighted challenges in planning the timelines and scope of projects developing and evaluating interventions using CBPR frameworks. For example, discussion with peer researchers and advisory groups identified potential user groups whose needs may not be sufficiently met by the intervention as originally conceptualized (ie, a brief video). It was noted that specific subgroups, such as those impacted by the digital divide, may need guidance in basic phone features or additional resources to support the application of strategies. The informational needs of health care providers were also highlighted via consultation activities and a prior survey [<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. To address this feedback, coauthors EM, EEM, and SSK created a complementary suite of self-guided resources for people with BD and health care providers, structured around the video themes (ie, privacy, efficacy, and engagement) and levels of the APA app evaluation framework not covered in the video (ie, background information and data integration). Emerging information regarding the potential risks of apps in BD, such as the potential for mood monitoring to reinforce depressive symptoms in vulnerable individuals [<xref rid="ref61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>] and the limitations of using apps designed for the general population for BD concerns [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], was also detailed. These resources were hosted on an innovative learning platform, the Tapestry Tool [<xref rid="ref62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>], where hierarchical relationships between concepts are represented spatially similar to a mind map (<xref rid="figure4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>), and multimodal resources including text, videos, and web articles can be linked. Similar online courses to support digital health literacy have been shown to improve eHEALS scores in specific populations, such as people with type 1 and 2 diabetes [<xref rid="ref63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Combining this brief video with a self-guided exploration of the Tapestry Tool educational module could therefore further enhance impacts on digital health literacy. However, as this Tapestry Tool educational module was developed in addition to the planned, funded activities (ie, development of the brief video), we did not have the resources to evaluate the impacts of these resources separately and in combination. This illustrates a common tension in CBPR research: extensive consultation with communities is needed to inform grant applications; yet, this can be difficult to resource before grant funding is available [<xref rid="ref64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. To avoid situations where there are not sufficient resources to fund research priorities identified by the community, we suggest a need for more funding opportunities specifically supporting CBPR during project conceptualization.</p><fig position="float" id="figure4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Navigation structure of the Tapestry Tool educational module containing resources for people with BD and health care providers (to view module content, please visit [<xref rid="ref62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]).

For context, we note that the grant provided to fund this project (Michael Smith Health Research BC REACH Grant) was specifically intended to cover costs associated with the development of the educational resources (including payment of peer researchers). For this grant, costs associated with research studies are noneligible expenses and were covered in kind by CREST.BD. This limited our ability to conduct a more fulsome randomized controlled trial, as we did not have sufficient funds to fairly compensate participants for their involvement in a study where they may not have received exposure to the intervention. In addition, it limited our ability to conduct more resource-intensive recruitment strategies, such as outreach into face-to-face settings. The implications of this for the study limitations are described in more detail below.</p><p>First and foremost, this was a nonrandomized pilot evaluation; findings should therefore be interpreted with caution. In the absence of a control group, spontaneous improvements due to expectancy effects, baseline sample characteristics, or other confounding variables cannot be ruled out. In addition, the small sample size limits generalizability. Removal of suspected fraudulent responses detected on review of the data (n=23) reduced the total valid survey entries (n=54). This finding emphasizes the importance of applying additional strategies to ensure sample validity, such as rigorous screening procedures, inclusion of questions to detect poor quality or inattentive responses, and restrictions on where and how surveys are advertised [<xref rid="ref65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Although our sample was small, it is comparable to other evaluations of digital health literacy interventions in serious mental illness populations [<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="ref66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Unfortunately, this sample was too small to conduct additional subgroup analyses, including gender-based comparisons.</p><p>Our sample was predominantly White and had completed some form of postsecondary education; efforts are needed to ensure that digital health literacy interventions are accessible to those with limited English proficiency. A survey of established (living in Canada for &#x0003e;10 years) senior Punjabi and Chinese immigrants (n=896) found that only one-quarter of participants reported advanced reading and writing proficiencies in English, and lower levels of education were associated with poorer eHEALS scores. As 65% of participants expressed an interest in using a smartphone to improve their health [<xref rid="ref67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>], this group may benefit from support to develop digital health literacy. To support equitable access to intervention content in Canada, we have translated the video into Mandarin, Punjabi, and American Sign Language, although we note that the evaluation was only conducted in English, limiting ability to generalize findings to other language groups.</p><p>Funding restrictions and issues of feasibility influenced our choice of recruitment strategy: we used a web-based survey to increase the likelihood of reaching a target sample size, given the relatively low prevalence of BD [<xref rid="ref68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. It may be that the use of web-based recruitment methods biased our sample toward individuals with higher pre-existing levels of digital health literacy. Relatedly, one survey that used telephone, hard-copy, and online data collection methods to assess digital health literacy and digital engagement for people with severe mental illnesses (including BD) found that higher levels of digital health literacy were associated with having outstanding or good self-reported knowledge of the internet [<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. As such, future studies should consider evaluating the impact of this video-based resource using alternative dissemination methods, such as DVDs that can be played in mental health clinics, or one-on-one consultations with health care providers.</p><p>The eHEALS measures self-perceived digital health literacy and not necessarily the actual performance of these skills; it is therefore possible that participants may experience an increase in self-perceived competencies without a concordant improvement in the real-world application of their skills. Future studies may wish to use procedural assessments of digital health literacy competencies. Approaches to performance-based assessments of digital health literacy are highly heterogenous and include simulated behavioral tasks, knowledge assessments, and evaluation tasks [<xref rid="ref69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. For example, previous studies have provided participants with a list of both high- and low-quality health information websites [<xref rid="ref70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>,<xref rid="ref71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]; the concordance of participants&#x02019; evaluation of these websites with researcher ratings (as based on a standardized framework) was used to evaluate eHealth literacy skills. A similar approach could be used in the future to compare participants&#x02019; evaluations of apps with expert ratings as a proxy for mHealth literacy skills. Alternatively, comparing eHEALS scores to skills-based assessments may improve confidence about the real-world implications of improvements on this measure. While some work has been conducted to demonstrate modest correlations between perceived and performed eHealth literacy [<xref rid="ref72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>], we acknowledge that additional external validation is required. Unfortunately, we are not aware of any validated measures of mHealth literacy (performance-based or self-assessment)&#x02014;a clear priority for future research. Our own in-house items were developed, given the dearth of available instruments; however, the fact that they were not validated remains a limitation of this study.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Interventions are needed to help address the digital divide by promoting the skills and knowledge needed to take advantage of digital mental health tools and enhance the uptake of safe and effective mental health apps by people with BD. In this study, receiving only 4.5 minutes of psychoeducation about the risks and benefits of mental health apps for BD was found to improve self-perceived eHealth literacy and some aspects of mHealth literacy in individuals with this diagnosis. However, it must be noted that multiple aspects of mHealth literacy remained unchanged, and 19% (n=8) of the survey completers denied learning anything new as a result of the video. While findings remain preliminary due to the small sample size, nonrandomized design, and the use of nonvalidated mHealth literacy items, they are encouraging for future evaluations. To support the reach of the video and the accompanying web-based educational module, we have made these resources freely available for health care providers and patients [<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="ref62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>].</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors gratefully acknowledge the research participants who were involved in this project.
