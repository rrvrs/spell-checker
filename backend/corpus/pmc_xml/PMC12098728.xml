However, it remains unclear whether FC-based metrics provide additional value beyond established epilepsy biomarkers such as epileptic spikes and high-frequency oscillations (HFOs). Using interictal iEEG data from 26 patients, we estimated FC across eight frequency bands (4&#x02013;290&#x000a0;Hz) using amplitude envelope correlation (AEC) and phase locking value (PLV). From the resulting FC-matrices, we estimated two graph metrics each to derive 32 FC-based features. We also extracted features related to spikes, HFOs, and power spectral densities (PSD). A trained support vector machine (SVM) classifier predicted seizure onset zones (SOZs) with an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.91 for node-level 4-fold cross-validation (CV), 0.69 for patient-level 4-fold CV, and 0.73 for patient-level leave-one-out CV. Notably, gamma-band graph features from AECs outperformed spikes and HFOs in SOZ prediction when using an equivalent number of features. Our results strongly suggest that AEC-based features may provide more information about epileptogenicity compared to PLV-based features. Furthermore, machine learning provides a robust approach for identifying useful FC-based features and integrating information from putative biomarkers of epilepsy to better localize epileptogenic networks.</p><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1038/s41598-025-02679-4.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Machine learning</kwd><kwd>Intracranial EEG</kwd><kwd>Functional connectivity</kwd><kwd>Seizure onset zone</kwd><kwd>Epileptogenicity</kwd><kwd>Biomarkers</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Biomedical engineering</kwd><kwd>Epilepsy</kwd><kwd>Neuroscience</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer Nature Limited 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Epilepsy is a disease of brain networks characterized by a predisposition to recurrent seizures and the sequelae of seizures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE), where seizures are refractory to adequate trials of two or more anti-seizure medications occurs in a substantial proportion of patients, with estimates ranging from ~&#x02009;15% in the community to as high as 35% in clinic-based populations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. While several non-pharmacologic treatment options are now available to manage drug-resistant epilepsy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, a sizable proportion of patients with focal DRE may benefit from surgical resection or ablation of the brain region(s) that give rise to their seizures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Invasive intracranial EEG (iEEG) studies that capture the patient&#x02019;s habitual seizures are very often necessary to delineate seizure onset zones (SOZs) which provide an approximation of the minimum amount of brain tissue that must be resected or ablated to yield seizure freedom&#x02014;i.e., the hypothetical epileptogenic zone (EZ)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Over the long term, seizure recurrence is unfortunately observed in a substantial proportion of patients; this is more frequent in non-lesional and extratemporal focal epilepsy and in patients with longer duration of epilepsy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. The limited spatial sampling of the brain that is possible using surgically implanted subdural or depth electrode arrays is a major limitation in delineating the precise extent of the SOZ. Furthermore, resections may sometimes be limited by the presence of eloquent cortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. However, seizure recurrences that are observed even when resections are deemed adequate underscore the fact that the SOZ only represents an approximation of the EZ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. There is thus enormous interest in interictal iEEG biomarkers that may provide better characterization of epileptogenic brain networks.</p><p id="Par3">Over the last couple of decades, several putative biomarkers derived from quantitative analysis of EEG signals have been explored with varying success in predicting the EZ or surgical outcomes, including measures that quantify epileptic spike discharges<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, focal slow activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>, HFOs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>, phase-amplitude coupling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>, and aspects of EEG dynamics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. Recently, functional connectivity (FC) has been explored by many groups to characterize epileptic networks in the brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>. While individual epilepsy biomarkers may provide a partial characterization of epileptogenic networks, the integration of information provided by different putative biomarkers could potentially yield better approximations of the EZ. There have thus far been few studies that have utilized machine learning (ML) to integrate information across multiple interictal features of intracranially recorded ECoG/SEEG signals to map seizure-generating networks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>. In this study, we sought to determine whether integration of information derived from FC and established biomarkers of epilepsy such as epileptic spikes and HFOs using ML can help improve the mapping of the EZ. We characterized interictal FC from iEEG signals recorded before epilepsy surgery using narrow-band amplitude envelope correlations (AEC) and phase locking values (PLV). Recent work from our laboratory has shown that graph metrics derived from AECs are more robustly elevated than those derived from PLVs within SOZs, especially in the gamma frequency band<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>, but this does not exclude the possibility that the latter provides useful information about epileptogenicity. We hypothesized that the integration of information from multiple iEEG features including those derived from FC using ML will improve the identification of epileptogenic cortex compared to determinations made from any one feature of the iEEG alone. Furthermore, we hypothesized that FC-based features provide information about epileptogenicity that is additive to what can be learnt from epileptic spikes, HFOs, or power spectral characteristics of the iEEG signals. We tested these predictions by training ML models on features derived from iEEG signals with the clinically annotated SOZ and resection zones (RZ) as the targets for the classifier. Since all patients in our cohort had good seizure outcomes after surgery, we treated the SOZ as a surrogate for the EZ in our analysis. We first compared several machine-learning methods for this classification task using both K-fold and leave-one-out (LOO) CV methods to identify the models that performed the best. We then assessed the dependence of classification accuracy on the number of features available and thereafter assessed the relative performance of different feature-sets for the classification task.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Intracranial EEG data</title><p id="Par4">This study utilized archived iEEG data from adults with drug-resistant focal epilepsy who underwent invasive iEEG studies before epilepsy surgery. The recordings were acquired between 2008 and 2018. Informed consent was obtained from all patients and/or their legal guardians. This study was performed under a protocol approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Medical College of Wisconsin (PRO15813) and all research activities were conducted in compliance with relevant guidelines and regulations. Inclusion criteria required an Engel Class 1&#x000a0;A seizure outcome for at least 2 years following surgery, availability of an awake sample of iEEG from the first 24&#x000a0;h of recording at least 1&#x000a0;h removed from any seizure activity, and the primary use of a subdural grid to ensure homogeneity of the dataset. Exclusion criteria included epilepsies related to high-grade tumors and perioperative strokes at the resection margin. We analyzed data from 26 patients who met al.l criteria.

Recordings were collected using either 128 or 192-channel amplifiers and subdural grid and strip electrodes. Of the 26 patients included in this study, three had depth electrodes sampling the mesial temporal structures in addition to the subdural electrodes. Subdural electrodes were constructed of platinum-iridium alloy discs 4&#x000a0;mm in diameter and were arranged in 8&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;8 grid, 8&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;2 partial grid, 4&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;1 strip, 6&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;1 strip, or a combination of types with 10&#x000a0;mm spacing (Ad-Tech Medical, Oak Creek, Wisconsin).

A system reference for the recording was provided by a 2-channel electrode anchored at the craniotomy margin with titanium screws. EKG and videographic data were acquired simultaneously. To localize seizure onset zones, anticonvulsants were tapered during the recording to provoke seizures while under observation in a Neurological Intensive Care Unit. Following the capture of sufficient seizure data, patients were restarted on their regimen of anticonvulsant medications. When clinically indicated, electrical stimulation mapping was performed to identify functional cortices to guide the surgical plan for ablation or resection.</p><p id="Par7">The data archived from these studies included 30-minutes each of awake and asleep interictal iEEG samples from each day of recording, segments containing clinical events or electrographic seizures, and, when performed, recordings from the stimulation mapping of the cortex.

All iEEG data was reviewed visually by an epileptologist, and channels with excessive noise were eliminated.

All analyses were performed at the original sampling rate of 1000&#x000a0;Hz. Channels containing excessive noise or continuous artifacts were eliminated from further analysis based on visual inspection by an epileptologist. Power line noise and its first five harmonics were removed from the recordings using a spectrum estimation method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup> as implemented in the <italic>removeLineNoise_SpectrumEstimation</italic> MATLAB function which is publicly available (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/54228-remove-line-noise">https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/54228-remove-line-noise</ext-link>). In this method, the edges of the power spectrum adjacent to the power line noise frequency and its harmonics are interpolated. We chose this method since it is less prone to produce distortions of the time domain signal compared to traditional notch filters. Although the frequency band definitions for our analysis avoid the harmonics of the power line noise, some of our bands are immediately adjacent to the frequencies of harmonics (within 10&#x000a0;Hz). Given the soft roll-off of the filter edges, this creates the potential for power line noise to leak into bands of interest and produce spurious AECs. We therefore felt it would be prudent to explicitly remove the line noise. The pre-processed iEEG data was then re-referenced to the common average reference. This process was repeated for all patients. Following preprocessing, a total of 2176 channels of data (ranging between 41 and 121 per patient) remained available for analysis with 344 and 622 channels belonging to the SOZ and RZ, respectively. This results in an average of 13.2 (3&#x02013;45) SOZ channels and 23.9 (8&#x02013;50) RZ channels per patient.</p></sec><sec id="Sec53"><title>Automatic detection of spikes and HFOs</title><p id="Par11">iEEG data were subjected to automated epileptic spike detection using a previously published method and software that has been validated by comparison to human experts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref></sup>.

Preliminary analysis of automated spike and HFO detection using the default detection thresholds for the detectors resulted in detections which we believed to be too lenient for our dataset. As such, the thresholds of both detectors were raised to ensure higher specificity. The specific details of the parameters changed to increase specificity are outlined in the supplementary information. Average rates and amplitudes for detected spikes and HFOs were recorded for each channel.

Continuous iEEG recordings were bandpass filtered using a two-pass (zero phase) FIR filter implemented in the <italic>FieldTrip</italic> function, <italic>ft_preproc_bandpassfilter</italic>. The filtered iEEG data was then segmented into 12-second, nonoverlapping epochs, which resulted in a total of 150 epochs per 30-minute recording. Epochs containing unfiltered signal amplitudes greater than 3000 &#x000b5;V on any channel were excluded. To ensure that FC was estimated using the same amount of data for all patients, 100 randomly selected epochs were used for FC estimations. Both FC measures used in this study are derived from the Hilbert transform of the iEEG signals. Before performing the Hilbert transform, iEEG epochs were mirror-padded to minimize edge effects. After estimating the Hilbert transform, the mirror padding was removed to preserve the original epoch length.</p><p id="Par14">The amplitude-envelope and instantaneous phase were calculated from the Hilbert-transforms of the iEEG signals. The amplitude-envelope correlations (AECs) for any given epoch are the Pearson correlation coefficients of the envelopes for all channel pairs. These values were then averaged across epochs to yield an average AEC for each pair of channels. Similarly, phase-locking values (PLV) were calculated from the Hilbert-transformed iEEG signals using the definition for resting state PLV<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref></sup> and averaged across epochs.

No thresholding of the FC values was performed before estimating the graph metrics. Node strength values were normalized by the number of iEEG channels for a given patient to account for differences across patients.

Prior to classifier training, feature vectors were rescaled by the maximum value of the feature across all patients so that magnitude variations across features were minimized while preserving the rank order of any given feature across channels in any given patient. Three methods of cross-validation (CV) were used: node-level 4-fold, patient-level 4-fold, and a patient-level leave-one-out (LOO). In the node-level 4-fold CV, nodes from all patients were randomly assigned to the training or test sets. For patient-level 4-fold and patient-level leave-one-out cross validations, the nodes from a given patient are either completely within the training set or the test set, with no crossover. Unlike the node-level 4-fold cross-validation, these latter two approaches simulate the situation where classifier training is based on retrospective patient data, and the testing occurs on prospective patient data. Because our dataset contains 26 patients, the patient-level 4-fold partitioning cannot be implemented exactly. The dataset was partitioned into four folds, two with 6 patients and two with 7. To improve generalizability and reduce the influence of any one partition, we repeated both the patient-level 4-fold and node-level 4-fold cross-validations 10 times with different partitions for each repetition. The partitioning of the data for these methods is outlined in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>. Classification performance was first evaluated separately for predicting the SOZ and RZ using 6 different ML methods and the node-level 4-fold CV (Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). All models were trained using a Bayesian optimization algorithm with the K-Fold loss being minimized to determine optimum model parameters over 300 iterations. To understand the characteristics of classifier performance across differing feature sets, the three best performing methods from this analysis were each evaluated using 150 different, random samples of the available 45 features. The objective was to gain insight not only into the consistency of the selected classifiers with reduced feature sets, but also the variability of classifier performance with reduced feature sets. Feature subsets with low feature-count but high SOZ classification performance may be inferred to carry more information about epileptogenicity.</p><p id="Par171">

For this analysis, SVM models were trained using all 45 features calculated from 6, 12, 25, 50, or 100 randomly selected epochs. For each epoch count, five random selections were analyzed. All models were trained using the node-level 4-fold CV. To ensure comparability, the channels were partitioned in the same manner for CV. This process was repeated five different times, and the mean and standard error across repetitions were calculated. These values are presented in supplemental Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>. We also determined whether false positives from a trained SOZ classifier are disproportionately represented within the surrounding RZ (in the vicinity of the SOZ), as opposed to distant sites. To do so, we first established the number of false positives (and the corresponding percentage value) that were observed to fall within the RZ (but outside the SOZ) at the optimal operating point (OOP) of the ROC curve of a trained SVM classifier. The OOP was defined as the intersection between the ROC curve and a line from (0,1) to (1,0) on the same axes. We generated a permutation test distribution by randomly picking an equivalent number of nodes 5000 times from among the non-SOZ channels and determined what percentage of the channels fell within the RZ (but outside the SOZ).

Recently, studies have turned to functional connectivity (FC) measures to determine if they can help improve the sensitivity and specificity of EZ prediction. Many measures, both directed and undirected, have been defined for estimating FC from physiological signals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref></sup>. From FC estimates based on any one of these measures, many graph-metrics can be derived to characterize underlying brain networks. In this preliminary analysis of the relevance of FC to the mapping of epileptogenic networks, we focused on two undirected measures of FC: amplitude envelope correlation (AEC) and phase locking value (PLV). We do not assume that results based on these undirected measures will generalize to other FC measures. Our choice of AEC was based on the body of evidence that gamma-band iEEG power is strongly correlated to the firing rates of local neuron populations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref></sup>, and thus AECs in the gamma-band may provide an FC measure that captures correlations in local neuronal firing rates within epileptic networks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. By contrast, PLV is representative of a popular class of FC measures that depend purely on narrow-band phase with no dependence on the amplitude envelopes. Using either of these measures, FC can be estimated in multiple frequency bands. Furthermore, FC estimated using any given method in any given frequency band yields multiple graph metrics that are attributable to the nodes of the network.</p><p id="Par33">The problem of integrating information from many features derived from iEEG signals is especially relevant for the utilization of functional connectivity (FC) to map epileptic networks. ML not only provides a robust approach for doing so but can also be used to determine the relative value of different features and eliminate those that are of little value or redundant. Some recent studies have shown promising results for predicting the SOZ (as a surrogate for the EZ) using ML applied to features of the interictal data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par34">In this study we applied ML to predict the SOZ or RZ using graph metrics derived from two different FC measures in 8 frequency bands along with more traditional measures related to epileptic spike activity, HFOs, and power spectral densities. FC was estimated using amplitude envelope correlations (AEC) and phase-locking values (PLV). The classification results for both SOZ and RZ presented in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref> demonstrate that SOZs and RZs (as surrogates for the EZ) can be predicted from interictal iEEG features with high accuracy when the 4-fold CV is done at the node-level (AUC of 0.91 and 0.88 for SOZ and RZ classification using all features), but the AUCs drop when data from any given patient is constrained to either the training or test fold (AUC of 0.69 with patient-level 4-fold CV, and 0.73 with patient-level LOO CV). This decrease in performance likely reflects limitations in classifier training occurring due to both the limited cohort size and selection of features used for training. The number of features used for the classification also had a strong influence on prediction accuracy. This is not surprising: increasing the dimensionality of the data increases the separability of the two classes of data (SOZ vs. non-SOZ) as demonstrated earlier in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>.</p><p id="Par35">The marked variability in classification performance at different feature-counts suggests that feature sets carry differing amounts of information relevant to SOZ/RZ classification. To evaluate this, we compared classifier performance for different feature sets while controlling for the number of features. The utility of the FC-derived graph features was assessed by comparison to more established interictal features such as the average rates and amplitudes of interictal spikes and HFOs. Gamma-band AEC-derived features (either NS or EVCs) outperformed an equivalent number of spike and HFO related features (4 features) for classification of SOZs using node-level or patient-level 4-fold CV, and patient-level LOO CV (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, bottom three rows).

Additionally, this suggests that there is a certain degree of radial symmetry in the structure of metrics derived from regions of epileptogenicity which a gaussian kernel SVM is uniquely suited to capture.</p><p id="Par38">To assess whether the outputs of a model trained to classify SOZs yields a measure of epileptogenicity beyond the clinically annotated SOZ, we examined whether false positives (i.e. incorrect &#x02018;SOZ&#x02019; labels) of the classifier tend to be disproportionately represented within the RZ. Ultimately, it is the tissue included within the RZ that determines seizure outcomes. We find that this is indeed true for our trained classifiers: at the optimal operating point of the classifier (defined as the intersection of the ROC curve with the diagonal from [0,1] to [1,0]), the SOZ false-positives were disproportionately within the RZ when compared to chance (31.8% vs. 16.2%; Z&#x02009;=&#x02009;4.028; <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;5.62E-5; Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>). This suggests that the output of a classifier trained on a large dataset of interictal features could potentially be used to generate spatial maps of epileptogenicity, analogous to the epileptogenicity index based on ictal data that has been proposed by Bartolomei et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref></sup>, but with the added ability to integrate information from multiple putative biomarkers without explicitly defining the relative weights of different features a priori. This approach would require systematic evaluation of the many potential epilepsy biomarkers based on large datasets representing a variety of surgical outcomes and epilepsy localizations, using both ECoG and SEEG recordings. Feature selection methods may then be applied to identify which features or feature families carry the most information about epileptogenicity. A future clinical tool using this approach would conceivably have two elements: a classifier that has been trained on the most useful iEEG features from a very large patient cohort, and a feature extraction pipeline that estimates these features from iEEG data from a given patient. The output of the classifier would yield a prediction for the EZ based on the most valuable features.</p><p id="Par39">A previous study by Varatharajah et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>, showed that the use of progressively longer interictal recordings yielded improvements in classifier performance up to durations of ~&#x02009;90&#x000a0;min. Our results also show a benefit from longer samples of recording, but saturation of performance appeared to occur by ~&#x02009;30&#x000a0;min using our collection of iEEG features, as shown in supplemental Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>. This may have to do with stabilization of connectivity derived features occurring over a shorter time scale. It is conceivable that the use of multiple short-duration (~&#x02009;30&#x000a0;min) recordings that are separated in time may improve the performance of SOZ classification since many interictal iEEG features, including connectivity, can change over time in relation to physiological states<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup> and withdrawal of anticonvulsants for seizure provocation.</p><p id="Par40">The total number of electrodes used in an iEEG study is typically much larger than the number of electrodes belonging to the SOZ. This can result in an imbalanced dataset when used to train a classifier. To account for this in our analysis, an imbalanced cost matrix was used during classifier training. This allowed classifier performance to be biased toward false positives rather than false negatives. Alternatively, one could apply different weights to the training data to bias classification towards the relevant (SOZ) channels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. Another popular strategy to account for imbalances within a dataset that can be applied after training is the use of precision-recall (PR) analysis. Specific comparisons between different classification performance measures including ROC and PR analyses are discussed in Hrtonova et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par41">One limitation of this study is the limited sample-size of the dataset. The differences in classifier performance between the two 4-fold CV methods that we implemented may be indicative of overfitting in the node-level 4-fold implementation. This also may indicate that there is a degree of spatial information between features derived from a given patient which is being learned by the classifier in the node-level 4-fold implementation. However, the similarity in performance trends across CV methods suggests that the features do provide information about epileptogenicity. Ultimately, a larger dataset is necessary for future analysis and may decrease the observed performance differences between CV approaches. Because of the differences in performance between CV approaches, a correlation analysis was performed to determine whether characteristics associated with individual patients contributed to overall classification performance in a predictable manner. There were no strong correlations between patient-level LOO performance across feature sets and the number of channels (r<sup>2</sup> = -0.024&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.05), number of SOZ channels (r<sup>2</sup> = -0.151&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.037), or ratio of SOZ to non-SOZ channels (r<sup>2</sup> = -0.185&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.045). This confirms that the LOO results were not skewed by characteristics of the datasets, and that the use of a larger dataset should improve LOO classification performance.</p><p id="Par42">The dataset used in this study consisted of patients who all had excellent seizure outcomes after surgery. Given the small sample size of the study, we felt that this was appropriate to be able to determine if FC-based measures carry useful information about epileptogenicity. Additionally, most patients within our cohort (19 of 26) had resections in the temporal lobes. This included patients with both mesial and neocortical temporal lobe epilepsies. Resections were temporal-plus in four (adjacent frontal, parietal, or occipital cortices) and exclusively extratemporal in only three patients. This temporal lobe bias in the data is not unusual and is consistent with the distribution of epilepsy localizations seen in typical surgical series<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref></sup>. It is conceivable that differences in the characteristics of iEEG signals and how they are modified by epilepsy differ between brain regions. A direction of future study, with a much larger sample size, would be to perform similar analyses using patients with a wide variety of lobar epilepsy localizations to determine if results generalize across lobes. This will allow for greater understanding of the generalizability of the approach described here, and prediction of surgical outcomes can be used to identify FC-based features that are better markers of epileptogenicity. Another important aspect of our dataset is that it is comprised primarily of subdural recordings from grid and strip electrodes, although three patients also had depth-electrodes sampling the mesial temporal structures. We acknowledge that clinical practice, including that at our epilepsy center, has shifted to primarily stereo-EEG (SEEG) studies using depth electrodes. While there are complexities associated with network construction and interpretation when combining different contact types (surface vs. depth, etc.), it does not appear that these complexities had any effect on classification performance in this study. We see no reason why the approach taken by this study cannot be replicated using SEEG recordings.</p><p id="Par43">One question that is raised by our results is how to optimally utilize features when there are many possible FC-based features, or other putative biomarkers of epilepsy, that can be estimated from any given dataset. There are several feature selection strategies that can be applied to identify irrelevant or redundant features<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref></sup>. Another approach of particular interest to address this problem is that of the explainable-AI (xAI) model. This approach allows for an understanding of which features were deemed to carry high importance by a trained classifier while reducing the need for an exhaustive search of all extracted feature permutations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref></sup>. A recent example of this with application to the identification of epileptogenic brain regions was demonstrated by Hoogteijling et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref></sup>. In this study, xAI was used to determine the relative contributions of spectral features from intraoperatively recorded ECoG signals for determining whether the recorded region was resected. While these approaches may help determine which signal characteristics carry relevant information, it will be important to consider the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying the feature, which may make some features more relevant than others. Additionally, consideration should be given to the type of classifier used since this greatly impacts the types of analyses which can be performed to make an AI model explainable.</p><p id="Par44">In summary, our results indicate that graph-theoretic measures derived from interictal FC estimates contain valuable information relevant to epileptogenicity. This information is maximal in the gamma band for both AEC and PLV based measures of functional connectivity. We also demonstrate that ML not only provides a powerful approach for integrating the information provided by multiple features of iEEG signals to map epileptogenicity but can also help identify those that are most useful. The general approach of using machine learning to integrate information from multiple features of brain signals to predict the EZ can potentially be applied to cortical source estimates derived from scalp EEG (especially high-density EEG) and magnetoencephalographic (MEG) recordings. While functional connectivity using MEG sources has been shown by a few recent studies to have value in predicting the SOZ and seizure-outcomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref></sup>, integration of multiple features of EEG/MEG source signals to predict the EZ remains to be explored. Application of this approach to HD-EEG or MEG sources has the potential to yield whole-brain maps of epileptogenicity in contrast to maps with limited spatial sampling that iEEG studies provide.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.</p><p>
