This review explores the current state of research on SARS-CoV-2 drug resistance and underscores the ongoing need for effective therapeutic strategies. It critically evaluates existing knowledge on resistance mechanisms and therapeutic options, aiming to consolidate information and highlight areas for future research. By examining the complex interactions between the virus and its host, the review advocates for a multifaceted approach, including combination therapies, targeted drug development, and continuous surveillance of viral mutations. It also emphasizes the impact of evolving viral variants on antiviral efficacy and suggests adaptive treatment protocols. This review aims to enhance our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 drug resistance and contribute to more effective management of COVID-19 through a discussion of promising strategies such as drug repurposing and combination therapies.</p></abstract><kwd-group id="kwrds0010"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Antiviral drugs</kwd><kwd>SARS-CoV-2</kwd><kwd>Drug resistance</kwd><kwd>Resistance mechanism</kwd><kwd>Therapeutic strategies</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0010">Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2, or SARS-CoV-2, is a novel coronavirus that emerged in late 2019 and caused the COVID-19 pandemic as declared by the World Health Organization in March 2020 [<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. By late 2020, scientists had made significant progress in the development of COVID-19 vaccines, intending to protect as many people as possible and to achieve herd immunity. However, the virus evolved, resulting in new variants such as Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Omicron with varying degrees of transmissibility and potential resistance to immunity. These variants influenced the trajectory of the pandemic. These new variants not only initiated waves of infections but also helped people develop hybrid immunity, which provided some protection. As the virus evolved, it began to behave more like a normal seasonal virus, rather than causing severe outbreaks. By 2022, discussions had begun about the virus becoming less dangerous. For example, a newer variant, Omicron, spread more slowly in the lungs and caused less severe illness than older variants such as Delta [<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. This evolution made COVID-19 appear more like a regular illness, similar to the flu and led to the belief that it would become easier to manage with time. By May 4, 2023, amidst declining death and hospitalization rates, the WHO Director-General announced a shift towards long-term pandemic management for COVID-19 following the fifteenth report of the International Health Regulations (2005) Emergency Committee [<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. While the pandemic status has changed, ongoing research remains critical, particularly for vulnerable populations such as immunocompromised people and those at high risk. Immunocompromised individuals, such as those undergoing cancer treatment, organ transplant recipients, or those with untreated HIV often experience prolonged viral replication. It provides the virus with more opportunities to mutate and become resistant to antiviral treatments. Long-term infections, frequent use of antiviral drugs, and higher viral loads are all risk factors for mutations and resistance.</p><p id="p0015">It was first identified in the city of Wuhan, the capital of China&#x02019;s Hubei Province, investigations indicated a probable zoonotic origin from bats, with transmission to humans via an intermediate host [<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. It shares the family with two other closely related coronaviruses; including MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV, that have previously caused significant outbreaks in 2012 and 2002&#x02013;2003, respectively [<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. COVID-19 manifests with a spectrum of symptoms ranging from mild to severe, encompassing fever, cough, respiratory distress, anosmia (partial or full loss of smell), dysgeusia (distorted sense of taste), and, in most severe cases, Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and mortality.</p><p id="p0020">SARS-CoV-2, classified within the Betacoronavirus genus, possesses a single-stranded RNA genome. Among its repertoire of structural and non-structural proteins encoded by this genome, the spike (S) protein plays a pivotal role in viral entry into host cells. SARS-CoV-2 has undergone mutations over time, leading to the emergence of various variants. Due to their increased transmissibility and potential to affect therapeutic effectiveness, some of these variants have raised considerable concern.</p><p id="p0025">Antiviral drugs have played a crucial role in the management of the COVID-19 pandemic, offering valuable insights into potential treatments for viral outbreaks. While not a definitive cure, these drugs contribute significantly to symptom alleviation, severity reduction, and potentially expedited recovery. Their significance is particularly pronounced in cases of moderate to severe disease. Early administration of antiviral drugs can effectively decrease viral load in infected individuals, thereby diminishing their infectiousness and impeding viral transmission, thus breaking the chain of spread. Antiviral drugs offer an extra layer of defense for high-risk groups that are more vulnerable to severe COVID-19 outcomes, such as the elderly and immunocompromised patients&#x02014;antiviral drugs aid in managing the disease in this highly susceptible population. Timely intervention with these drugs has demonstrated a notable decrease in hospitalization rates and mortality, pivotal in preventing healthcare system strain and preserving lives.</p><p id="p0030">The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants has significantly altered the efficacy of certain treatments and vaccines. Variants such as Alpha (B.1.1.7), while more transmissible, had little effect on early drug resistance. Delta (B.1.617.2) variant, first identified in India in mid-2021, demonstrated increased transmissibility and severity, as well as some resistance to monoclonal antibodies due to mutations in the spike protein, particularly the L452R and T478K which contributed to this altered drug resistance profile [<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Omicron (B.1.1.529), identified in South Africa in late-2021, and its subvariants (e.g., BA.1, BA.2, BA.4, BA.5) caused numerous mutations, reducing the efficacy of monoclonal antibodies and potentially affecting some antiviral drugs [<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Treatment strategies became more complicated due to the rapid evolution of sublineages such as BA.1, BA.2, and BA.5, as each sublineage exhibited distinct resistance patterns [<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Beta (B.1.351) and Gamma (P.1) were also less susceptible to monoclonal antibodies which is probably because of the mutations at the 417, 484, and 501&#x000a0;amino acid positions in the spike RBD of both variants [<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. As of June 28, 2024, the only currently circulating Variant of Interest (VOI) is JN.1 after WHO excluded BA.2.86 from the list [<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. JN.1 is a sublineage of the Omicron variant that is grabbing more attention recently due to its unique mutations, especially the L455S mutation in the receptor-binding motif (RBM) of the RBD [<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Approved antiviral drugs continue to be effective against BA.2.86 and JN.1. Nevertheless, developing antiviral drugs requires urgent attention because these variants are resistant to many monoclonal antibodies. Although the renewed monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccine protects against JN.1, induced neutralizing antibody titers are significantly lower than in the wild-type [<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In contrast, the XBB.1.5 trivalent mRNA vaccine maintains high neutralizing titers, even surpassing those seen in XBB breakthrough infections [<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p id="p0035">Antiviral drugs with various modes of action can be used for variant-specific treatment and offer tailored options for treatment when the efficacy of other interventions is compromised. However, the management of the pandemic is significantly hampered by the development of drug resistance. SARS-CoV-2 mutations can render antiviral drugs ineffective or only partially effective, often in response to the selective pressure exerted by these drugs. Consequently, the efficiency of antiviral treatments diminishes as drug-resistant strains proliferate, posing challenges in symptom management and viral load reduction for COVID-19 patients reliant on these drugs. Continued infection with drug-resistant variants may exacerbate case numbers, while variants bearing drug-resistant mutations may concurrently harbor mutations rendering vaccines less effective. This dual challenge complicates efforts to curb virus spread and attain herd immunity.</p><p id="p0040">Monoclonal antibodies represent a vital component of the immune system&#x02019;s arsenal against deadly pathogens such as viruses. In the context of the SARS-CoV-2, several monoclonal antibodies have been developed and approved for emergency use COVID-19 treatment. These antibodies are developed to specifically target and impede the virus&#x02019;s ability to infect human cells. Notably, several monoclonal antibodies, such as Bamlanivimab, Etesevimab, Casirivimab, Imdevimab, Tixagevimab, Cilgavimab, Sotrovimab, Regdanvimab, and Bebtelovimab, have received authorization from regulatory bodies like the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA). However, some of these authorizations have been subsequently revoked or restricted after a brief period.</p><p id="p0045">The efficacy of monoclonal antibody treatments becomes compromised as the virus evolves, acquiring mutations within the epitopes targeted by these antibodies. This phenomenon has been particularly evident with certain variants, notably those within the omicron lineage. Liu et al. first observed the potential emergence of neutralization-resistant variants when monoclonal antibodies were used in laboratory conditions (<italic>in vitro</italic>) [<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Later, Fenaux et al. reported a case of an immunocompromised patient who displayed prolonged and high viral loads for 51 days despite Bamlanivimab and Etesevimab therapy, with sequencing revealing mutations at targeted monoclonal antibody positions, suggesting resistance to the treatment [<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In early 2022, the FDA imposed restrictions on specific monoclonal antibody treatments following emerging data indicating their reduced effectiveness against the prevailing omicron variant of COVID-19 [<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Numerous monoclonal antibody treatments have demonstrated ineffectiveness against Omicron and its highly transmissible subvariants. Accordingly, the FDA revoked the emergency use authorization for the monoclonal antibody therapy EVUSHELD in January 2023 due to its inability to confer protection against the latest and most prevalent strains of COVID-19 in the US. For the same reason, the FDA revoked bebtelovimab's approval in late 2022 [<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p id="p0050">This review paper aims to comprehend the challenges posed by drug resistance in the COVID-19 pandemic by digging deep into the diverse mechanisms underlying SARS-CoV-2 resistance. Furthermore, it would advance scientific understanding and assist in the development of effective therapeutic plans. Despite the transition away from pandemic status, the importance of ongoing research in mitigating the impact of COVID-19 on vulnerable populations remains of great importance.</p><p id="p0055">Our review paper distinguishes itself from the existing literature by providing a comprehensive and integrated evaluation of both drug resistance and therapeutic strategies against SARS-CoV-2. Although most of the reviews have usually focused on either drug resistance or specific classes of therapeutic approaches, our paper combines these aspects to provide a comprehensive understanding of their dynamics. Furthermore, our review article includes the most recent studies and data, providing updated insights into emerging resistance patterns and novel treatment options that were not covered altogether in previous reviews. This review serves as a one-stop resource for researchers, offering a broad range of aspects and a comprehensive summary of SARS-CoV-2. We identify critical gaps in current knowledge and propose innovative solutions by taking an interdisciplinary approach that includes virology, pharmacology, and clinical perspectives, thereby advancing the field in a unique and valuable direction.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>SARS-CoV-2 drug resistance mechanism</title><sec id="sec2.1"><label>2.1</label><title>Overview of viral replication and mutation rate</title><p id="p0060">RNA viruses exhibit a notably high mutation rate owing to the inherent instability of their genetic material, RNA, in comparison to DNA. This heightened propensity for mutation stems from several factors, including a lack of proofreading mechanisms, the presence of quasispecies, and the phenomenon of error catastrophe. These mutations, particularly in target proteins, can confer resistance to antiviral drugs, posing challenges to treatment efficacy. Unlike DNA polymerases, RdRp enzymes lack proofreading capabilities, thereby permitting the perpetuation of replication errors. However, it is noteworthy that viruses within the coronavirus family possess RdRp-independent proofreading activity, mitigating their mutation rates to some extent [<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p id="p0065">The viral replication process of SARS-CoV-2 involves specific steps within host cells and exhibits a moderate yet significant mutation rate. It is critical to uncover how SARS-CoV-2 interacts with host factors during its life cycle to fully comprehend the pathogenic mechanisms that underlie the viral infection and to devise effective prophylactic measures and antiviral therapies. SARS-CoV-2 viral replication is initiated by infecting human respiratory epithelial cells, where the virus adheres to surface receptors of the host cell, facilitated by the spike protein present on the viral envelope. The spike protein binds to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) via the receptor-binding domain (RBD), inducing major conformational changes necessary for infection [<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Following viral attachment, the viral envelope either fuses with the host cell membrane, allowing the entry of the viral ribonucleoprotein complex into the cytoplasm [<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], or undergoes endocytosis before fusion [<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Upon entry into the host cell, the viral RNA is released and serves as a template for transcription and translation. Two open reading frames, ORF1a and ORF1b, encoded within the viral RNA, are translated into viral proteins, pp1a, and pp1ab, respectively, by the host cell&#x02019;s ribosomes. This process yields the replicase-transcriptase complex (RTC), crucial for viral RNA genome replication, occurring within protective double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) in the host cell's cytoplasm [<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Viral RNA polymerase is responsible for catalyzing the replication of the RNA genome, which produces subgenomic RNA (which is utilized to produce viral proteins), as well as genomic RNA (which is utilized to create new viral particles). Subsequently, the full-length genomic RNA generates the subgenomic RNAs which act as templates, facilitating the synthesis of viral structure and accessory proteins. These subgenomic RNAs are translated into proteins by the host cell&#x02019;s machinery, and viral proteins assemble into new virions. Structural proteins including spike(S), envelope(E), membrane(M), and nucleocapsid(N) proteins aid in budding at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi compartment. Virions are then released from the infected cells into the extracellular space via exocytosis or by insertion into lysosomes, subsequently fusing with the cell membrane [<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. This viral replication cycle keeps going on by releasing virions infecting the other host cells.</p><p id="p0070">&#x0201c;The mutation rate is a function of replication fidelity&#x0201d; [<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Mutations occur every time a virus replicates inside a cell. Generally, the mutation rates for the various positive sense ssRNA viruses that have been studied range from 10^6 to 10^3 and are expressed as nucleotide substitution per-site per-cell infection (s/n/c) [<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. SARS-CoV-2 exhibits an unstable mutation rate, initially characterized by low mutation frequency. However, as the pandemic progressed, the mutation rate escalated. Different segments of the virus evolve at varying rates; while certain components such as nsp11, nsp7, nsp10, nsp8, and nsp16 undergo gradual changes and remain relatively stable, others like N, nsp3, S, nsp4, nsp12, and M proteins mutate at a faster rate [<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The mutation rate also varies among viral lineages and across different regions of the virus genome, with mutations accumulating more rapidly in some regions than in others. Despite its RNA nature, SARS-CoV-2 displays a lower mutation rate compared to other RNA viruses, notably HIV [<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and influenza virus (H3N2) [<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The majority of the mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome are point mutations, altering a single nucleotide in the viral RNA. The spike protein, which is the target of numerous vaccinations and therapies, is one of the many locations in the genome where point mutations can arise. Early in the pandemic, under neutral genetic drift conditions, the mutation rate was estimated to be approximately 1&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;10^3 substitutions per base (per year) [<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], implying an average occurrence of one mutation in the viral genome every 1000 years per nucleotide. Further studies have stated a slight increase in mutation rates, such as 1&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;10^5 to 1&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;10^4 substitution per base per transmission event [<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In late December 2019, researchers analyzed 32 genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 and stated an estimated mean evolutionary rate ranging from 1.7926&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;10^3 to 1.8266&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;10^3 substitutions per site per year [<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Between February and April 2020, the Afr-SARS-CoV-2 evolved at a rate of 4.133&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;10^4 substitutions per site per year [<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], offering insights into the virus&#x02019;s evolving pace. Based on the findings of Amicone et al. the estimated mean rate of spontaneous mutation in two lineages of SARS-CoV-2 (one with the original spike protein and the other with D614G mutation) is 1.3&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;10^6&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;0.2&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;10^6 per base per infection cycle [<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. These findings contribute significantly to our understanding of the dynamic evolution of the virus and its implications for transmission and adaptation.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><label>2.2</label><title>Overview of available antiviral drug</title><p id="p0075">While numerous antiviral drugs have undergone rigorous testing against SARS-CoV-2, only a few have garnered approval for clinical application (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).<list list-type="simple" id="olist0010"><list-item id="o0010"><label>(i)</label><p id="p0080">Paxlovid (Nirmatrelvir&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;Ritonavir): Developed by Pfizer, Paxlovid comprises two active ingredients; nirmatrelvir and ritonavir [<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].

One key mechanism is latency. For example, viruses in the Herpesviridae family can enter a latent state within the host, allowing them to persist for a lifetime even with a functional immune system [<xref rid="bib106" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>]. These dormant viruses can reactivate periodically, often without symptoms, making complete eradication difficult. In addition, certain viruses, like HIV, integrate a DNA copy of their RNA genome into the host cell&#x02019;s DNA, becoming part of the host's genetic material and contributing to persistent infection [<xref rid="bib107" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>].</p><p id="p0260">Another factor contributing to resistance is the diversity of viral genotypes and serotypes [<xref rid="bib108" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>]. While antiviral drugs and vaccines may be highly effective against specific strains, their protective benefits can be limited or ineffective against other strains.</p><p id="p0265">RNA viruses also exhibit unique resistance mechanisms. For instance, the influenza virus, with its segmented genome, can undergo genetic reassortment when two strains co-infect a single cell [<xref rid="bib109" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>]. This reassortment can create new virus variants, potentially combining characteristics of drug-sensitive and drug-resistant strains, resulting in highly contagious viruses that are difficult to control.</p><p id="p0270">Viruses use random mutations as their primary mechanism to develop resistance to antiviral treatments and vaccines, aligning with Darwin&#x02019;s theory of evolution where random changes lead to the survival of the fittest [<xref rid="bib110" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>]. Rapidly mutating viruses generate numerous variants known as quasi-species, some of which, when subjected to antiviral pressure, result in a dominant resistant strain, demonstrating the selective survival of the fittest [<xref rid="bib108" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>].</p><p id="p0275">Viruses may also develop resistance by altering their replication cycle or modifying the drug target itself [<xref rid="bib111" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>]. Additionally, increased expression of drug efflux pumps can expel drugs from infected cells, and some viruses may enhance drug metabolism or fail to activate prodrugs properly. For example, antiviral drugs like M2 channel blockers can lead to rapid, widespread resistance due to single mutations, limiting their clinical utility [<xref rid="bib112" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>]. Conversely, drugs that mimic viral enzyme substrates often experience a slower development of resistance [<xref rid="bib113" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>]. Initially, resistance may arise from mutations that disrupt drug binding without significantly affecting the virus&#x02019;s catalytic activity.

After removing blood cells, the remaining plasma which is rich in antibodies can help people recover from the same illness. Although not novel, this strategy was previously employed to treat diseases like Influenza and Ebola. In 2020, it gained prominence as a treatment for COVID-19 when no other treatment option was available. It is used to treat or prevent serious complications, particularly in cases where the immune system is slow to respond or when there&#x02019;s no specific treatment. COVID-19 convalescent plasma is still available and is authorized for use in emergency situations especially for non-hospitalized individuals with compromised immune systems. Research on the effectiveness of COVID-19 convalescent plasma therapy is still ongoing. Fillipatos et al.

For outpatients, convalescent plasma therapy was linked to a 26&#x000a0;% lower risk of needing hospital care than standard care, which is a noteworthy exception. Regional variations in the efficacy of convalescent plasma may exist, as subgroup analyses in European trials revealed an 8&#x000a0;% lower risk of ICU-related disease progression.

Early administration, particularly through local applications such as inhalation or spray, is recommended within the first 3&#x02013;5 days of symptoms onset to prevent severe outcomes in at-risk patients. Type III interferons are thought to be beneficial due to their anti-inflammatory properties, though their efficacy might be limited by receptor expression in specific cell types. It is advised to switch to daily systemic administration for later-stage treatments or if no improvement is seen by day 5. PEGylated formulations may be used in this situation. To reduce risks, more intensive therapy should not be started earlier than 6&#x02013;8 days after symptoms first appear.

The results offer significant insights into the promising efficacy and safety profile of combination therapy for critically immunocompromised patients dealing with prolonged or relapsed COVID-19, even though the study takes into account the limitations of small sample size and the lack of a control group.</p></list-item><list-item id="o0200"><label>(vi)</label><p id="p0495">Remdesivir&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;Nirmatrelvir: A study conducted by Pasquini et al. [<xref rid="bib173" ref-type="bibr">173</xref>] discusses how immunocompromised people are still susceptible to severe COVID-19, especially those who have impaired humoral immunity due to conditions like B cell malignancies or B cell-targeting treatments. In a case series spanning three academic hospitals in Italy, the researchers treated 14 adult patients with persistent SARS-CoV-2 infection with a combination antiviral therapy consisting of remdesivir and nirmatrelvir/ritonavir. Most of the patients had previously received B cell-targeting therapies and had been diagnosed with B cell lymphoma. The combination therapy, which lasted a median of 10 days, resolved COVID-19 symptoms in a median of 6 days and cleared the virus in a median of 9 days, despite differences in the severity of the disease. These findings highlight the need for more research through prospective comparative trials and suggest that the remdesivir and nirmatrelvir/ritonavir combination may be effective in treating persistent COVID-19 in immunocompromised patients with compromised humoral immunity. Before this study, the synergy between remdesivir and nirmatrelvir/ritonavir is also reported by several researchers in <italic>in vitro</italic> and clinical studies [<xref rid="bib174" ref-type="bibr">174</xref>,<xref rid="bib175" ref-type="bibr">175</xref>,<xref rid="bib176" ref-type="bibr">176</xref>,<xref rid="bib177" ref-type="bibr">177</xref>].</p></list-item><list-item id="o0205"><label>(vii)</label><p id="p0500">Molnupiravir&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;Remdesivir: In order to treat patients with severe COVID-19, Hashemian et al. looked into the possible synergistic effects of combining molnupiravir with remdesivir [<xref rid="bib178" ref-type="bibr">178</xref>]. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of combining these two antivirals in five cases of severe COVID-19. A thorough assessment of data was, however, hampered by a number of limitations, such as a small sample size, the lack of a control group, and ethical considerations while combining molnupiravir with remdesivir. Although the combination might have a synergistic effect, specific results are still unknown, highlighting the need for more research to determine the therapeutic efficacy and possible risks of this combined antiviral approach, especially in severe and hospitalized cases.</p></list-item></list></p><p id="p0505">Previously, Abdlenabi et al. [<xref rid="bib179" ref-type="bibr">179</xref>] also investigated the effectiveness of the combination therapy involving molnupiravir and the parent analog of remdesivir (GS-441524). Both <italic>in vitro</italic> and in infected hamsters, the combination showed a strong antiviral effect against the virus, especially against the beta (B.1.351) variant. In cell cultures, the researchers observed a general additive antiviral effect with noticeable synergism at specific concentrations. Furthermore, the combination of GS-441524 and molnupiravir demonstrated a potent antiviral effect in hamsters given suboptimal doses of each drug, lowering viral titers in the lungs to undetectable levels in the majority of the animals.</p><p id="p0510">(viii) Ensitrelvir&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;mPSL (methylprednisolone): Most recently, Sasaki et al. conducted a study that focuses on the effects of antiviral and anti-inflammatory treatments on SARS-CoV-2 infection in hamsters [<xref rid="bib180" ref-type="bibr">180</xref>], to determine their efficacy in reducing the severity of COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 targets lung bronchial and alveolar epithelial cells, causing inflammation and immune cell infiltration. According to the study, antiviral therapy administered early is essential for preventing hyperinflammation and lessening the severity of the illness. The study highlights that more severe outcomes result from delayed intervention by comparing the effects of treatment with ETV and mPSL. Surprisingly, combination therapy combining ETV and mPSL is suggested as a powerful treatment choice that efficiently regulates host inflammatory reactions without postponing viral elimination. The study does, however, acknowledge certain limitations, including the hamster models and the requirement for additional research on drug interactions and different oral antiviral candidates.</p><p id="p0515">Although several efficacious combination therapies have been identified, none of them have been proven beyond a reasonable doubt to address drug resistance in the context of SARS-CoV-2. Drug resistance in the fight against SARS-CoV-2 remains an unresolved issue despite continued research and the identification of promising therapeutic combinations. This emphasizes the necessity of ongoing research and the development of innovative approaches to address the problems with drug resistance caused by the virus.</p></sec><sec id="sec5.2"><label>5.2</label><title>Rational drug design or drug repurposing</title><p id="p0520">Rational drug design and drug repurposing are two prominent approaches to mitigate drug resistance to COVID-19. An in-depth knowledge of the molecular and biological characteristics of the virus is necessary for rational drug design, as it allows researchers to identify the precise targets that are essential for the virus's replication or the host's reaction. Using this knowledge, novel therapeutic agents with high precision can be designed, aiming to interact selectively with these identified targets. This technique has the advantage of tailoring drugs for maximum potency while minimizing the risk of side effects. Furthermore, since the drugs aim to disrupt the critical stages of the viral life cycle, the targeted nature of rational drug design can reduce the likelihood of the virus developing resistance.</p><p id="p0525">Drug repurposing, on the other hand, entails the investigation of existing drugs that were originally developed for various health conditions. This strategy takes advantage of these drugs' known safety profiles and mechanisms of action, screening them to identify candidates with potential efficacy against COVID-19. The potential for faster deployment is what makes drug repurposing appealing since many of these drugs have already undergone extensive testing for safety and regulatory approval. Repurposed drugs may also have a wider range of antiviral activity since they can act on several targets. This diversity can be especially helpful in addressing the virus's complexity and reducing the likelihood that resistance will develop.</p><p id="p0530">One major example of a repurposed drug for SARS-CoV-2 is Remdesivir, originally evaluated for the Ebola virus in 2014. It has improved clinical outcomes and decreased mortality risk in both hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients [<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Zidovudine (AZT) has the potential to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 polymerase, as demonstrated in silico with stable interactions [<xref rid="bib181" ref-type="bibr">181</xref>]. Lamivudine, another HIV drug, showed antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref rid="bib182" ref-type="bibr">182</xref>] and reduced infection rates in Hepatitis B patients, making it a promising candidate for COVID-19 treatment [<xref rid="bib183" ref-type="bibr">183</xref>]. Abacavir also shows promise due to its ability to inhibit viral polymerase [<xref rid="bib184" ref-type="bibr">184</xref>]. Additionally, tenofovir and emtricitabine have been found to reduce viral titers in non-hospitalized patients [<xref rid="bib185" ref-type="bibr">185</xref>]. Despite the initial promise, many other drugs were later revoked by the FDA due to failure in clinical trials or toxicity concerns.</p><p id="p0535">However, repurposing a drug for a new use involves many challenges, which often leads to a high rate of failure. These challenges include proving a strong pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) relationship, confirming a safe profile for the new indication, determining an appropriate potency, maintaining target engagement, and distinguishing the repurposed drug from the standard of care. Repurpose drugs also carry a commercial risk because it can be challenging to obtain new patents and exclusive market rights for the drug&#x02019;s new use [<xref rid="bib186" ref-type="bibr">186</xref>]. Sometimes, the original drug developers discover new uses for a drug in preliminary research or as a side effect in clinical trials, and then they patent these new uses. A well-known example is sildenafil, which was actually developed to treat high blood pressure but later became Viagra when it was found to be quite effective for treating erectile dysfunction during clinical trials [<xref rid="bib187" ref-type="bibr">187</xref>]. To increase the chances of successfully repurposing and approving a drug, all of the challenges must be carefully considered.</p><p id="p0540">Bringing together the benefits of both drug repurposing and rational drug design is a holistic and synergistic approach. Rational drug design provides accuracy and adaptability by finding novel targets or improving the effectiveness of already-approved drugs. Simultaneously, drug repurposing leverages the abundance of knowledge surrounding currently available drugs to enable the quick identification of viable solutions.</p></sec><sec id="sec5.3"><label>5.3</label><title>Continuous monitoring of viral mutations</title><p id="p0545">In the context of COVID-19, regular monitoring of viral mutations is a critical approach for reducing drug resistance. Scientists can quickly detect new variants and evaluate how they might affect the effectiveness of treatments by using systematic genomic surveillance. This enables the early adjustment of antiviral drug regimens and vaccination plans. This proactive strategy emphasizes the value of data sharing for thorough surveillance by bringing together scientists, public health organizations, and policymakers globally. As specific mutations are discovered, researchers can investigate whether existing vaccines are still effective or if improvements are required, contributing to a dynamic and adaptive response. With over 2 million SARS-CoV-2 genomes sequenced and shared via the GISAID platform, the COVID-19 pandemic has signaled a significant advancement in the application of whole-genome sequencing (WGS). This huge genomic data has been critical in informing public health decisions, such as detecting mutations that may affect the virus's behavior, such as virulence, spread, and ability to evade the immune system. While genomic sequencing offers quick insights, it is still difficult to predict how these genetic alterations will impact the virus's properties.</p><p id="p0550">Ongoing genomic surveillance informs public health policies, enabling policymakers to adjust strategies in response to new variants with higher transmissibility or immune escape. Integrating genomic data with clinical insights enhances our ability to preemptively address challenges posed by evolving viral genetics. A notable example is the Traveler-Based SARS-CoV-2 Genomic Surveillance Program launched by the CDC in September 2021. Initially deployed at three U.S. airports, this program is set to expand to eight international airports by spring 2024, focusing on identifying new variants from travelers. Similarly, the United States' National SARS-CoV-2 Strain Surveillance (NS3) system demonstrates practical genomic surveillance. NS3 collects and analyzes data on SARS-CoV-2 genetic diversity nationwide. By sampling from various regions, it tracks virus evolution, identifies emerging variants, and evaluates their impact on diagnostics, treatments, and vaccines. This system supports timely public health decisions and adaptive strategies. Wastewater surveillance is another key method, involving the monitoring of wastewater for SARS-CoV-2 traces. This technique offers early warnings of new variants and potential outbreaks by analyzing genetic material at a community level, complementing traditional surveillance methods.</p><p id="p0555">The integration of genomic surveillance with national programs and innovative methods like wastewater analysis exemplifies a comprehensive approach to managing viral mutations. Coordinated global efforts enhance our ability to adapt public health measures and respond effectively to emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2 and other infectious threats. This strategy is crucial for both current pandemic management and future preparedness.</p></sec><sec id="sec5.4"><label>5.4</label><title>Public health interventions to reduce transmission</title><p id="p0560">Drug resistance in SARS-CoV-2 requires a multifaceted approach centered on public health interventions. Aiming for broad coverage, vaccination campaigns have the dual benefit of directly preventing infections and acting as an effective barrier to the excessive use of antiviral drugs. These campaigns effectively reduce the selective pressure that could lead to the development of drug-resistant strains by reducing reliance on specific classes of drugs. Besides vaccinations, reliable testing and early detection are essential components of the strategy as they enable immediate isolation and treatment, which limit the uncontrolled spread of the virus and minimize the need for a lot of antiviral drugs. Efficient contact tracing augments these efforts by identifying and isolating potentially exposed individuals, thereby breaking the transmission chain. Campaigns for public awareness help the cause by informing the public about preventative measures, which in turn lowers the rate of transmission. To reduce the risk of resistance emergence, antiviral stewardship programs in healthcare settings monitor medication use, encouraging cautious deployment and minimizing needless prescriptions. International cooperation, the exchange of knowledge about new variations, and continuous research into novel antiviral medications expand the range of available treatments and taken together, provide a comprehensive approach that is essential for reducing SARS-CoV-2 drug resistance. These coordinated efforts tackle the long-term objective of reducing the risks of resistance emergence alongside the immediate pandemic challenges.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec6"><label>6</label><title>Future directions in SARS-CoV-2 drug development</title><p id="p0565">Antiviral drug discovery has advanced significantly, especially with the pressing need to combat SARS-CoV-2. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, the main focus in antiviral drug development was on treating HIV and hepatitis C. These two viruses were the target of over 67&#x000a0;% of the antiviral drugs that had been approved. Developing new antiviral drugs typically took a very long time, often stretching over several decades, particularly for the initial treatments designed to combat a new virus. However, after the COVID-10 pandemic, multiple antiviral treatments were identified, tested, and approved in less than two years. This was achieved by applying previous knowledge and quickly adapting to the urgent situation. Key to this success were enthusiastic teams and thorough planning, which included having backup strategies. The large investments needed to accelerate the process highlighted the challenge of adapting traditional, cautious public funding to support fast-paced drug development. The pandemic also saw remarkable collaboration among drug companies and government agencies, leading to new partnerships and networks like ACTIV8 and RECOVERY, which significantly sped up clinical trials [<xref rid="bib188" ref-type="bibr">188</xref>]. Regulatory agencies responded swiftly by implementing faster review processes, though they had to continually adjust trial criteria as the pandemic evolved. For future pandemics, it will be essential to develop tools and drugs for potential new viruses and invest in drug discovery infrastructure. This will help ensure a more effective and rapid response to global health crises.</p><p id="p0570">Disrupting the viral replication mechanism is a major area of focus, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) has emerged as a key target. Remdesivir and other drugs that inhibit RdRp have been helpful in the treatment of COVID-19. Researchers are also investigating immune response modulation and host cell factors to impede the virus&#x02019;s life cycle and strengthen the body&#x02019;s defenses. Through drug repurposing strategies, the development of broad-spectrum antivirals capable of combating multiple viruses is gaining attention. Protease inhibitors are being researched for their potential to treat SARS-CoV-2, as they have been successful in treating other viral infections. To improve treatment outcomes and lessen the severity of infection, the interplay between antiviral drugs and vaccines is becoming increasingly important. Likewise, by predicting efficacy and optimizing chemical structures, the combination of artificial intelligence and computational approaches speeds up the drug discovery process. In order to build on existing knowledge and to quickly address new challenges, researchers must now collaborate globally and share data. To stay ahead of the changing viral landscape, SARS-CoV-2 drug development is likely to take a multifaceted approach in the future.</p><p id="p0575">A multifaceted approach to combating viral pathogens significantly enhances effectiveness by targeting viruses through various strategies simultaneously. For instance, combining vaccinations, antiviral drugs, and public health measures creates a robust defense system that tackles the virus at different stages, reducing overall infection rates and severity. This approach also helps in minimizing the development of resistance, as viruses struggle to adapt to multiple concurrent interventions. Public health responses become more effective, speeding up containment and recovery, as evidenced by the coordinated efforts during the COVID-19 pandemic, which combined vaccines, testing, and social distancing. Additionally, this strategy fosters greater public engagement and compliance, leading to improved health outcomes and quality of life, as seen with chronic infections like hepatitis C, where a combination of treatments and lifestyle adjustments yields higher cure rates and better disease management.</p><p id="p0580">Drug development encounters numerous challenges throughout the process. Finding promising drug targets and developing effective compounds in the early stages is difficult and demands extensive research and optimization. This stage is critical and uncertain because preclinical testing in animal models frequently does not perfectly predict human outcomes. Clinical trials pose additional challenges, such as finding appropriate volunteers, high costs, and requiring thorough evaluations of safety and effectiveness. Clinical trials present additional challenges, such as recruiting suitable participants, high costs, and rigorous safety and efficacy assessments. Navigating the regulatory landscape to obtain approval from agencies such as the FDA or EMA adds another layer of complexity, requiring meticulous documentation and adherence to strict guidelines. All things considered, numerous scientific, financial, and regulatory roadblocks can obstruct advancement and drive up costs during the discovery to market phase.</p><p id="p0585">The integration of novel technologies like gene editing and RNA-based therapies indicates a promising future for SARS-CoV-2 drug development. CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing tools enable the modification of host cell factors exploited by the virus, making cells less susceptible to infection. This strategy produces genetically altered cells that are resistant to SARS-CoV-2, potentially providing a long-term defense. A colorimetric viral detection method using the CRISPR/dCas9 system, developed by Jeong Moon et al. [<xref rid="bib189" ref-type="bibr">189</xref>], detects RNA from viruses through a color change reaction. This CRISPR/dCas9-based method is particularly valuable for identifying SARS-COV-2 and its drug-resistant variants due to its rapid and simple detection capabilities. Using the CRISPR/dCas9 system, it can quickly identify specific RNA sequences associated with the virus, including drug resistance mutations, through a simple color change reaction. Sierra SARS-CoV-2, an open-source, web-based tool introduced by Tzou et al. [<xref rid="bib190" ref-type="bibr">190</xref>], can also be employed to detect drug resistance in SARS-CoV-2 by analyzing viral sequences for specific mutations associated with reduced susceptibility to antiviral. It utilizes global mutation prevalence data and the CoV-RDB database to identify mutations that might indicate resistance to treatments like antiviral drugs or monoclonal antibodies. Sierra SARS-CoV-2 analyzes spike and other viral protein mutations, to track and understand resistance patterns, aiding in the monitoring and management of emerging drug-resistant SARS-CoV-2 variants. Other bioinformatic tools, such as SABRes [<xref rid="bib191" ref-type="bibr">191</xref>], are designed to detect drug resistance mutations in SARS-CoV-2 genomes and viral subpopulations by utilizing expanding public datasets. Recombinase Polymerase Amplification (RPA) is an isothermal nucleic acid amplification method that operates at a constant, low temperature (37&#x02013;42&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C), allowing for rapid and simple detection of specific DNA or RNA sequences without the need for thermal cycling. In the context of SARS-CoV-2, RPA can be employed to rapidly identify mutations associated with drug resistance, allowing for timely monitoring and management of resistant strains in various testing scenarios. Dried blood spot (DBS) testing, which has previously been shown to be effective in detecting drug resistance in HIV-1 and HIV-2 [<xref rid="bib192" ref-type="bibr">192</xref>,<xref rid="bib193" ref-type="bibr">193</xref>] has potential applications in the monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 drug resistance. Similar to its use in HIV, DBS testing can be employed to analyze SARS-CoV-2 for resistance mutations by assessing viral genetic material from blood samples. Additionally, DBS testing is utilized for monitoring SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels [<xref rid="bib194" ref-type="bibr">194</xref>], demonstrating its versatility and applicability in the field of viral infections.</p><p id="p0590">Another approach for SARS-CoV-2 drug development is RNA interference (RNAi), in which small RNAs can be designed to target viral RNA, inhibiting translation, and disrupting viral replication. Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna's success with mRNA vaccines exemplifies the potential of mRNA-based therapies beyond vaccination. Therapeutic proteins that directly impede viral replication or alter the host immune response can be encoded by mRNA, enabling a prompt response to newly emerging viral variants. Advances in gene editing, such as base editing and prime editing, provide accurate methods for modifying DNA, facilitating the creation of treatments that more specifically target the viral genome or host factors. The flexibility of these technologies offers a robust and dynamic approach to drug development, able to tackle novel challenges brought about by emerging viral strains, even as SARS-CoV-2 continues to evolve.</p><p id="p0595">Proactively combating potential resistance to antiviral therapies is a critical consideration in the ongoing pursuit of effective drug development for SARS-CoV-2. In the future, combination therapies will play a major role in combating resistance through a multifaceted approach. Resistance to a comprehensive treatment regimen is more difficult to develop when multiple drugs targeting different viral mechanisms are combined. Simultaneously, scientists are investigating the idea of multi-target antiviral drugs, which aim to simultaneously disrupt multiple viral proteins or host factors, thereby raising the barrier at which the virus can evolve resistance. Another cutting-edge approach is host-targeted therapy, which focuses on altering important host cell components for viral replication. Rather than going after viral components directly, this strategy uses the host's cellular machinery to reduce the likelihood of resistance while also broadening the antiviral strategy. Adaptive therapies, which involve real-time monitoring of viral genomic changes and subsequent adjustments to treatment regimens, are also gaining popularity. This dynamic strategy enables a rapid response to emerging viral variants, ensuring that antiviral interventions remain effective. These approaches, taken together, highlight a comprehensive and forward-thinking approach to fighting resistance in the evolving landscape of SARS-CoV-2 drug development.</p></sec><sec id="sec7"><label>7</label><title>Conclusion</title><p id="p0600">Although COVID-19 is no longer considered a global emergency, ongoing research remains important, particularly for combating drug resistance in immunocompromised and high-risk populations. To date, no combination therapies have been proven effective in overcoming SARS-CoV-2 resistance; however, history shows that such strategies can be highly effective, as evidenced by treatments for viruses like influenza and HIV. This emphasizes the urgent need to investigate the mechanisms underlying drug resistance and the virus's ongoing evolution.</p><p id="p0605">By analyzing the complex interactions between the virus and its host and exploring potential therapeutic interventions, we pave the way for a more nuanced and adaptable approach to managing drug resistance.
