It transforms high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional format while preserving as much of the original information as possible. This is done by identifying directions, referred to as principal components, along which the data shows the greatest variability.</p><p>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is one of the leading causes of morbidity, mortality, and healthcare burden globally [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Between 29% and 47% of individuals with COPD experience at least one exacerbation annually [<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The disease is characterized by significant heterogeneity in clinical features and systemic involvement, contributing to variable risks of exacerbation, hospitalization, and mortality. Phenotyping COPD patients can provide a more accurate assessment of these risks. These phenotypes vary depending on patient-specific factors such as smoking history, respiratory symptoms, comorbidities, spirometric findings, physical activity levels, and inflammatory biomarkers [<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>-<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Over the years, several updates have been made to classification algorithms for COPD. Notably, the Global Initiative for Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) introduced the A-B-C-D classification in 2011. In 2023, GOLD revised this scheme, merging groups C and D into a single group - labeled &#x0201c;E&#x0201d; - to underscore the clinical significance of exacerbations [<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>This study aims to apply PCA in a cohort of COPD patients to identify potential clinical clusters that may reflect different disease trajectories.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Study design</p><p>This prospective observational outpatient study was conducted to investigate factors associated with COPD severity and its clinical course. All consecutive patients who met the predefined eligibility criteria and provided signed informed consent were included.</p><p>Study population</p><p>Eligible participants were adults over 40 years of age, current or former smokers with a history of more than 10 pack-years, and diagnosed with COPD based on a post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV&#x02081;)/forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio of less than 0.7. Only patients in a stable condition, without exacerbations or changes in treatment for at least one month prior to enrollment, were included.</p><p>Study measures</p><p>Demographic data such as age, sex, and smoking status were recorded. Symptom-based variables included the presence of cough, wheezing, sputum production, and shortness of breath, all reported as binary (yes/no) variables. Comorbidities were systematically documented and included a history of bronchial asthma, asthma-COPD overlap (ACO), emphysema, bronchiectasis, chronic bronchitis, obstructive sleep apnea, arterial hypertension, osteoporosis, dyslipidemia, hyperuricemia, and depression. The Charlson Comorbidity Index was also calculated.</p><p>Disease-specific assessments included post-bronchodilator spirometry measurements: FVC, FEV&#x02081;, FEV&#x02081;/FVC ratio, and peak expiratory flow. The number of moderate and severe exacerbations in the previous year was documented, with severe exacerbations defined as those requiring hospitalization or emergency department visits due to worsening respiratory symptoms.</p><p>Hematological parameters were assessed via blood samples, including CBC, CRP, fibrinogen, and &#x003b1;1-antitrypsin levels. Cardiovascular status was evaluated through echocardiography, which measured ejection fraction, shortening fraction, left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic dimensions, interventricular septal thickness, posterior wall thickness of the left ventricle, left atrial diameter and surface area, E and A wave velocities, acceleration time, ejection time, deceleration time, left atrial pressure, right ventricular free wall thickness, mean pulmonary artery pressure at rest, and maximal and minimal inferior vena cava diameters. An ECG was also performed to assess resting heart rate, the presence of atrial fibrillation, and the presence of peaked P waves (&#x0003e;2.5 mm) in lead II (p-pulmonale).</p><p>Diaphragmatic function was measured using thoracic ultrasound, evaluating both left and right diaphragmatic excursion at rest and following exertion. All patients performed a six-minute walking test (6MWT) to assess functional capacity, recording total distance walked and post-test peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO&#x02082;). An echocardiographic follow-up exam was conducted after the 6MWT. Dyspnea severity was assessed with the modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnea scale, and quality of life was evaluated using the COPD Assessment Test (CAT).</p><p>Statistical analysis</p><p>All collected variables were included as input for PCA. Continuous variables (e.g., FEV&#x02081; and eosinophil count) were used in their original form, while binary variables (e.g., presence of cough and asthma history) were coded as 0 or 1. PCA was performed using the corrr package in RStudio. Prior to analysis, all variables were standardized to have a mean of 0 and an SD of 1.</p><p>A biplot was generated to visualize the relationships between input variables and their contributions to the first two principal components (Dim1 and Dim2). In this plot, each arrow represents a clinical variable; the arrow&#x02019;s direction and length indicate its influence on the components. Variables pointing in the same direction are positively correlated, while those in opposite directions are negatively correlated. This visualization aids in identifying clusters of variables and their role in distinguishing different COPD phenotypes.</p><p>Ethics statement</p><p>The study was approved by the local ethics committee. All participants signed informed consent forms and received standard treatment as determined by their attending physician.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>A total of 96 patients with COPD were included in the study.

This presentation is consistent with chronic bronchitis, where airway inflammation and reduced quality of life are predominant, as shown by the vector labeled &#x0201c;Chronic Bronchitis&#x0201d; in Figure <xref rid="FIG2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>.</p><p>The emphysema phenotype, situated in the lower right quadrant, is characterized by frequent exacerbations, desaturation during physical exertion (such as the 6MWT), and signs of cor pulmonale, including a high P-wave on ECG. These findings are typical of emphysema, where alveolar destruction and impaired pulmonary diffusion lead to chronic hypoxemia. The &#x0201c;Emphysema&#x0201d; vector direction in Figure <xref rid="FIG2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> further supports this classification.</p><p>The COPD with asthmatic features phenotype, found in the lower left quadrant, is distinguished by eosinophilia and a prior asthma diagnosis. These features suggest that individuals in this group may respond well to inhaled corticosteroids.</p><p>The non-exacerbator phenotype, located in the upper left quadrant, is characterized by fewer symptoms, better spirometric results, and a lower risk of exacerbations. This phenotype, represented by the opposite direction of the &#x0201c;AE_hosp&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;AE_moderate&#x0201d; vectors in Figure <xref rid="FIG2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, corresponds to a more stable form of COPD with a more favorable long-term prognosis.</p><p>It is important to note that the opposite phenotype of the bronchitis phenotype (upper right quadrant) is not emphysema, but rather the overlap phenotype (lower left quadrant). Similarly, the opposite of the emphysema phenotype (lower right quadrant) is not bronchitis, but the non-exacerbator phenotype (upper left quadrant).</p><p>In another study, 322 COPD patients underwent PCA and cluster analysis to identify distinct clinical phenotypes [<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Three independent components accounted for 61% of the variance, leading to the classification of subjects into four clinical phenotypes not identified by the traditional GOLD classification. Notably, patients with similar airflow limitation (FEV1) were classified into different phenotypes, demonstrating significant variations in age, symptoms, comorbidities, and predicted mortality.</p><p>The identification of four distinct COPD phenotypes, alongside the associations between clinical, functional, and echocardiographic parameters, suggests that PCA could serve as a valuable tool for phenotyping COPD patients. The separation of groups corresponds not only to well-established phenotypes but also enables an objective and statistically valid classification.</p><p>Limitations</p><p>This study has several limitations. First, the sample size was relatively small, which may limit the generalizability of the findings. Second, the study population consisted of outpatients from a single center, meaning the results may vary in different settings or in larger, multicenter studies. Third, while PCA is an effective tool for identifying patterns within data, the scarcity of similar studies makes it challenging to directly compare our results, highlighting the need for further research.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>PCA of COPD patients enables the identification of four distinct clusters that correspond to well-established disease phenotypes: bronchitis, emphysema, COPD with asthmatic features, and non-exacerbator. By using statistical methods to distinguish these phenotypes, it becomes possible to identify the characteristics that are most strongly related to each other. This approach facilitates a more personalized treatment strategy tailored to the specific phenotype of each patient.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group content-type="conflict"><title>Disclosures</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Human subjects:</bold> Consent for treatment and open access publication was obtained or waived by all participants in this study.
