Early establishment of healthy habits is vital as childhood behaviors often persist into adulthood, affecting long-term well-being. However, pervasive health misinformation on social media exacerbates the challenge of addressing NCDs. The vast online information exposes individuals to misinformation, leading to uninformed health decisions. Countering this misinformation is crucial to promote accurate understanding and preventive strategies for NCDs, improving public health outcomes. To address this, the study proposes a system using online social listening (OSL) to collect and analyze social media data, focusing on children&#x02019;s nutrition, physical exercise, sleep patterns, and related NCD risk factors. This platform aids healthcare professionals in recognizing and responding to online misinformation, facilitating informed decision-making. Collaboration with parents, teachers, and healthcare providers aims to instill healthy habits in children from an early age. Utilizing the Twitter Application Programming Interface (API), the study collected data on NCDs, their risk factors, and their impact on children. Despite challenges from recent Twitter API policy changes, the methodology remains adaptable. Additionally, the study integrates diverse data sources, including traditional news outlets like PressReader, providing comprehensive coverage of health issues. Analysis comparing data from PressReader and Twitter underscores differences in discussion frequency and nature, emphasizing the need to leverage insights from various sources. The results highlight the effectiveness of the OSL system in identifying prevalent health topics, benefiting healthcare professionals. This collaborative approach positions the system as a valuable tool for addressing NCDs and promoting well-being. The study lays a foundation for future research, suggesting expansions to include additional platforms and languages, as well as advanced features like sentiment analysis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>Noncommunicable diseases (NCDs)</kwd><kwd>Online social listening (OSL)</kwd><kwd>Social media misinformation</kwd><kwd>Data integration</kwd><kwd>Public health</kwd><kwd>Online behavior</kwd><kwd>Social media data mining</kwd><kwd>Big data in public health</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund-1"><funding-source>FCT (Funda&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o para a Ci&#x000ea;ncia e Tecnologia)</funding-source><award-id>00319</award-id></award-group><award-group id="fund-2"><funding-source>R&#x00026;D Project</funding-source><award-id>PTDC/SAU-ENF/2584/2021</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>This work has been supported by FCT (Funda&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o para a Ci&#x000ea;ncia e Tecnologia) within the Project Scope of the R&#x00026;D Unity number 00319.

They play a significant role in the top 10 causes of death globally, spanning low-, middle-, and high-income countries, as identified by the World Health Organization (WHO) (<xref rid="ref-4" ref-type="bibr">Budreviciute et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="ref-37" ref-type="bibr">WHO, 2020</xref>). According to WHO statistics on &#x0201c;NCD: Mortality&#x0201d; (<xref rid="ref-42" ref-type="bibr">WHO, 2023a</xref>), it is evident that NCDs have a profound global impact, leading to the demise of 41 million individuals annually. Remarkably, over 15 million lives are claimed by NCDs every year within the age range of 30 to 69 years, with an overwhelming 85% of &#x0201c;premature&#x0201d; deaths.</p><p>Furthermore, NCDs not only represent a primary cause of mortality but also contribute substantially to the loss of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) on a global scale, equivalent to the loss of 1 year of full health. Examples of NCDs encompass cardiovascular diseases (coronary artery disease, heart failure, and stroke), cancer, chronic respiratory diseases (asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), diabetes, and mental health conditions, among others (<xref rid="ref-41" ref-type="bibr">WHO, 2022b</xref>).</p><p>Of growing concern is the increasing prevalence of NCDs among children, a demographic that has traditionally been less associated with these conditions. Childhood obesity, for instance, is a significant risk factor for the early onset of metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases (<xref rid="ref-13" ref-type="bibr">GBD 2021 US Obesity Forecasting Collaborators, 2024</xref>). Research indicates that the prevalence of obesity and overweight among children has risen dramatically over the past few decades, influenced by sedentary lifestyles, unhealthy diets, and socioeconomic factors (<xref rid="ref-22" ref-type="bibr">Lister et al., 2023</xref>). Moreover, childhood exposure to modifiable risk factors, such as poor dietary habits and physical inactivity, contributes to a higher likelihood of these individuals developing chronic conditions in adulthood (<xref rid="ref-20" ref-type="bibr">Laddu et al., 2024</xref>).</p><p>NCDs are influenced by various factors, including lifestyle, genetics, environment, and sociodemographics. While certain risk factors like age and family history are unmodifiable, many others, such as an unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, tobacco use, harmful alcohol consumption, and sleep deprivation, can be modified through lifestyle changes and interventions. An unhealthy diet, involving the consumption of fried, processed, and sugary meals, elevates the risk of heart disease, diabetes, obesity, hypertension, and specific cancers. Physical inactivity is another modifiable risk factor associated with heart disease, diabetes, and obesity. Tobacco use increases the risk of lung cancer and chronic respiratory diseases, while excessive alcohol use can contribute to liver disease, cancer, and cardiovascular issues (<xref rid="ref-4" ref-type="bibr">Budreviciute et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Addressing modifiable risk factors is crucial, with the potential to prevent 80% of heart diseases, strokes, diabetes, and 40% of cancer cases (<xref rid="ref-10" ref-type="bibr">Davagdorj et al., 2021</xref>). While many risk factors are modifiable through public health interventions and early screenings, comprehensive best practices in this realm are still lacking. Given that NCDs often trace their origins to childhood habits with potential lasting effects into adulthood, preventive measures and the promotion of healthy lifestyles in children are crucial for long-term benefits to both public health and healthcare systems (<xref rid="ref-44" ref-type="bibr">Yan &#x00026; Mi, 2021</xref>). Beyond these challenges, the pervasiveness of misinformation and its amplification through social media platforms adds a new layer of complexity.</p><p>The global population of Internet users surpassed 5 billion unique individuals in October 2022, with over 70% utilizing the Internet for healthcare-related information (<xref rid="ref-21" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="ref-8" ref-type="bibr">DataReportal, 2018</xref>). In January 2023, Portugal had 8.73 million Internet users, constituting 85.1% of the total population, with &#x0201c;Researching Health Issues and Healthcare Products&#x0201d; ranking among the top 15 reasons for Internet usage among the Portuguese (<xref rid="ref-9" ref-type="bibr">DataReportal, 2023</xref>). Concurrently, social media usage is on the rise globally, especially in contexts related to health issues (<xref rid="ref-34" ref-type="bibr">Suarez-Lledo &#x00026; Alvarez-Galvez, 2021</xref>). With the simplicity of generating online content and the immense volume of information circulated daily, a notable health concern arises. Individuals may easily become misinformed, not only due to the overwhelming amount of health information but also because some of it is false or inaccurate (<xref rid="ref-35" ref-type="bibr">Swire-Thompson &#x00026; Lazer, 2020</xref>).</p><p>Children aged 6&#x02013;10 years usually have limited direct access to smartphones or social media platforms. Although, it is important to note that this group is often exposed to online media through indirect means, such as through shared devices with parents or caregivers. Research shows that the younger demographic is increasingly engaging with digital content, with many children gaining access to the internet and social media, often under parental supervision (<xref rid="ref-11" ref-type="bibr">Dinleyici et al., 2016</xref>). A study by the American Academy of Pediatrics found that children aged 6&#x02013;11 spend an average of 2&#x02013;3 h per day on digital media, including educational content and entertainment, which may also include exposure to health-related information (<xref rid="ref-31" ref-type="bibr">Qi, Yan &#x00026; Yin, 2023</xref>).</p><p>Furthermore, adults such as parents, educators, and healthcare providers, who influence children&#x02019;s behaviours, are highly active on social media platforms like <xref rid="ref-5" ref-type="bibr">Business of Apps (2024)</xref>. These groups play a crucial role in shaping the health-related narratives and decisions that affect children, making social media data highly relevant for tracking the broader public discussions about children&#x02019;s health and NCDs.</p><p>Health misinformation involves the circulation of false or misleading information about health, shared without intent to cause harm, posing potential serious consequences for individuals and communities (<xref rid="ref-35" ref-type="bibr">Swire-Thompson &#x00026; Lazer, 2020</xref>). It can result in ill-informed health choices, disease transmission, setbacks in public health, economic repercussions, and adverse effects on mental well-being (<xref rid="ref-40" ref-type="bibr">WHO, 2022a</xref>). Research often focuses on platforms like Twitter and YouTube, yet health misinformation extends to various platforms and offline channels.</p><p>Online social listening (OSL) can play a vital role in identifying information gaps and viral misinformation narratives. It involves the continuous monitoring and analysis of conversations and interactions across social media, forums, and online platforms. This process allows to gather data, understand public sentiment, identify trends, and inform decision-making, particularly in the context of online discourse about specific topics (<xref rid="ref-23" ref-type="bibr">Lutkevich &#x00026; Hildreth, 2022</xref>). With 4.76 billion active global social media users, constituting 59.4% of the world&#x02019;s population, and 8.05 million active users in Portugal, comprising 78.5% of the population, social media platforms play a significant role in shaping public opinion and discourse (<xref rid="ref-9" ref-type="bibr">DataReportal, 2023</xref>). OSL emerges as a powerful strategy for combating health misinformation by closely monitoring and analysing online conversations, providing valuable insights, and facilitating the dissemination of accurate health information to diverse audiences (<xref rid="ref-39" ref-type="bibr">WHO, 2021b</xref>).</p><p>While YouTube, Instagram, and Facebook currently dominate social media usage in Portugal, Twitter stands out as an effective platform for conducting OSL about health topics. With 328 million active accounts globally (1.90 million in Portugal), Twitter offers real-time updates, diverse perspectives, and a text-centric format that simplifies data processing (<xref rid="ref-9" ref-type="bibr">DataReportal, 2023</xref>). Its concise nature encourages users to share opinions, facilitating the capture of current sentiments and trends. The platform&#x02019;s interactive features, including hashtags and trending topics, provide convenient ways to track health-related discussions and engage with a wide range of viewpoints. Twitter usually serves as a central hub where discussions from various platforms converge, extending the reach of topics gaining traction on other platforms like Instagram, Facebook, or YouTube (<xref rid="ref-15" ref-type="bibr">Gumaei et al., 2022</xref>; <xref rid="ref-24" ref-type="bibr">Ola &#x00026; Sedig, 2020</xref>; <xref rid="ref-6" ref-type="bibr">Colditz et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="ref-16" ref-type="bibr">Hart et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="ref-34" ref-type="bibr">Suarez-Lledo &#x00026; Alvarez-Galvez, 2021</xref>). The prevalence of health misinformation on Twitter, combined with active participation from health professionals and organizations, makes it a valuable resource for accurate information and insights into public perception of health topics.</p><p>Crucially, the integration of diverse data sources, including both social media platforms (which offer a plethora of user-generated content) and traditional news outlets and magazines (widely regarded for their credibility), is paramount. PressReader (<xref rid="ref-28" ref-type="bibr">PressReader, 2003</xref>) emerges as a notable platform for accessing a wide array of news articles and publications, offering in-depth coverage and analysis on health issues, including NCDs affecting children. With its extensive collection of newspapers and magazines from around the world, PressReader provides a comprehensive view of global health trends and research findings. Its user-friendly interface and search functionalities enable efficient navigation through a wealth of content, making it a valuable resource for professionals and stakeholders interested in gaining insights into the prevalence, management, and impact of NCDs among children.</p><p>The motivation behind this article stems from its integral role within the Nursing School&#x02019;s research project at the University of Minho. The project is titled &#x0201c;Health promotion in primary school children and families in conditions of social vulnerability (BeE-school)&#x02014;A cluster randomized study&#x0201d; (<xref rid="ref-100" ref-type="bibr">Universidade do Minho, 2022</xref>).</p><p>Through this project, there was direct interaction with children from vulnerable communities in Braga. This interaction revealed their limited access to daily health information. It also highlighted a common trend among children aged 6 to 10: frequent internet and social media use. This first-hand experience underscored the necessity for a comprehensive system to address health information dissemination among children, driving the need for this study. Additionally, the pursuit of sustainable development goals emphasizes the importance of reducing NCD mortality and promoting healthy lifestyles, especially among children (<xref rid="ref-41" ref-type="bibr">WHO, 2022b</xref>, <xref rid="ref-43" ref-type="bibr">2023b</xref>).</p><p>The kernel of this study is the development of an OSL system that systematically monitors and analyses social media discussions related to children&#x02019;s health behaviours, particularly concerning NCD-related misinformation. By leveraging real-time data from Twitter and PressReader, this system aims to assist healthcare professionals in identifying misleading health narratives and promoting evidence-based health literacy interventions.</p><p>Creating an OSL system for tracking trends related to NCDs and associated risk factors in children provides numerous advantages, including early identification of health trends for proactive interventions, and facilitating focused efforts on specific areas like children&#x02019;s nutrition and exercise (<xref rid="ref-3" ref-type="bibr">Braga et al., 2023</xref>). Additionally, the analysis of publications and sentiments offers insights into public concerns, aiding health professionals in understanding diverse perspectives. This system has the potential to revolutionize social media interaction regarding NCDs and children&#x02019;s health. However, collaboration with influential agents such as governments, healthcare professionals, and educators is crucial for the effective dissemination of accurate information (<xref rid="ref-1" ref-type="bibr">Bin Naeem &#x00026; Kamel Boulos, 2021</xref>).</p><p>In summary, <xref rid="fig-1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> shows a schematic representation of the envisioned system pipeline.</p><fig position="float" id="fig-1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7717/peerj.19311/fig-1</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Project pipeline: an OSL system for tracking trends related to NCDs and associated risk factors.</title><p>(<uri xlink:href="https://www.flaticon.com/free-icon/twitter_733635?related_id=733579&#x00026;origin=search">https://www.flaticon.com/free-icon/twitter_733635?related_id=733579&#x00026;origin=search</uri>).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="peerj-13-19311-g001" position="float"/></fig><p>The work aims to achieve the following scientific and technical goals:

This section presents a compilation of studies exploring OSL and its diverse applications in analysing health-related content.</p><p>One implementation was an advanced natural language processing (NLP) pipeline to sift through vast amounts of Twitter data and identify potential COVID-19 cases in the United States was proposed (<xref rid="ref-19" ref-type="bibr">Klein et al., 2021</xref>). By analysing tweets mentioning COVID-19 keywords, they employed sophisticated algorithms to detect patterns indicative of individuals self-reporting symptoms or potential exposure to the virus. This approach enabled them to contribute to the early detection and tracking of COVID-19 outbreaks through social media surveillance.</p><p><xref rid="ref-19" ref-type="bibr">Klein et al. (2021)</xref>, developed a comprehensive taxonomy and methodology specifically tailored for extracting and categorizing relevant COVID-19 narratives from social media platforms (<xref rid="ref-29" ref-type="bibr">Purnat et al., 2021</xref>). By combining expert knowledge with Boolean string searches, they crafted a systematic approach to filter digital content related to COVID-19 and classify it based on its relevance to public health. This framework not only facilitated efficient content classification but also provided valuable insights for public health response planning and risk communication strategies.</p><p>In 2018 a Real-time Infoveillance of Twitter Health Messages (RITHM), an innovative framework designed to streamline the process of collecting and analysing data from Twitter for public health research purposes was introduced (<xref rid="ref-6" ref-type="bibr">Colditz et al., 2018</xref>). RITHM offers researchers a robust set of tools for data collection, storage, filtering, and formatting, aiming to maximize efficiency and effectiveness in subsequent data analysis. By providing a structured approach to data handling and analysis, RITHM enhances insights into public health trends and behaviours gleaned from social media data.</p><p>Recent studies have deeply expanded the role of OSL in identifying and countering health misinformation, particularly in relation to children&#x02019;s health and social media engagement. For example, <xref rid="ref-33" ref-type="bibr">Sharevski &#x00026; Loop (2023)</xref> investigated how children interact with misinformation online, revealing that while they can recognize certain deceptive content, they often rely on digital assistants like Siri or their parents for verification (<xref rid="ref-33" ref-type="bibr">Sharevski &#x00026; Loop, 2023</xref>). This highlights a crucial gap in media literacy, emphasizing the need for targeted interventions to improve children&#x02019;s ability to discern misinformation. Their study supports the current research by reinforcing the importance of OSL in analysing parent and educator discussions, which shape children&#x02019;s perceptions of health-related topics such as nutrition and physical activity. Additionally, <xref rid="ref-12" ref-type="bibr">Garwood-Cross (2023)</xref> explored one very intersting topic that is the increasing reliance of children and young people on social media for health information (<xref rid="ref-12" ref-type="bibr">Garwood-Cross, 2023</xref>). The authors underscore both the benefits and risks associated with user-generated content. This aligns with the present study&#x02019;s objective of using OSL to track discussions on children&#x02019;s health across social platforms like Twitter. <xref rid="ref-12" ref-type="bibr">Garwood-Cross (2023)</xref> focused on the UK context, the methodologies employed in this study extend to a broader dataset, capturing a diverse range of conversations that influence children&#x02019;s health behaviours. By incorporating insights from various sources, including traditional news media and social media discussions, the study enhances the ability to identify prevailing narratives, assess misinformation trends, and develop strategies to promote accurate health information. Furthermore, <xref rid="ref-25" ref-type="bibr">Papanikou et al. (2024)</xref> conducted a systematic survey of IT approaches for tackling health misinformation in social networks, emphasizing the role of misinformation detection, fact-checking, and AI-driven classification methods (<xref rid="ref-25" ref-type="bibr">Papanikou et al., 2024</xref>). Their findings contribute to the methodological framework of the present study, reinforcing the necessity of integrating machine learning and NLP techniques into OSL systems. Over and above that, <xref rid="ref-17" ref-type="bibr">Heyerdahl et al. (2023)</xref> provided a critical perspective on the use of social listening in global health contexts, advocating for a more inclusive and context-aware approach (<xref rid="ref-17" ref-type="bibr">Heyerdahl et al., 2023</xref>). Their argument for grounding social listening methodologies in local cultural contexts aligns with the present study&#x02019;s approach, which seeks to capture nuanced discussions across different demographics and linguistic groups. By incorporating these recent contributions, this study enhances the scope and applicability of OSL in combating health misinformation, particularly in relation to children&#x02019;s health and NCD prevention.</p><p>Additionally, various online platforms, such as the WHO&#x02019;s EPI-WIN (<xref rid="ref-38" ref-type="bibr">WHO, 2021a</xref>) initiative and Symplur&#x02019;s Healthcare Hashtag Project (<xref rid="ref-36" ref-type="bibr">Symplur, 2023</xref>), actively employ OSL to address misinformation, particularly concerning the COVID-19 pandemic. These platforms utilize diverse data sources and automated categorization to track online discussions and provide insights into trending topics and public sentiments. Moreover, initiatives like Portugal&#x02019;s Pol&#x000ed;grafo newspaper and the CovidCheck.pt website demonstrate efforts at both national and local levels to combat misinformation and promote reliable information dissemination.</p><p>Overall, the studies and platforms presented above offer valuable techniques and approaches that can enhance infodemic management systems. Despite their diverse research objectives, their methodologies and insights hold potential for integration into infodemic management strategies, providing flexible tools to combat health misinformation and manage information dissemination during public health crises.</p><p>These recent contributions collectively highlight the evolving landscape of OSL in health research, emphasizing the continuous development of NLP techniques and machine learning models for monitoring, classifying, and addressing health-related misinformation. Such advancements are particularly relevant for the present study, which aims to apply these methodologies to analyse online discourse surrounding children&#x02019;s NCDs and identify prevailing misconceptions that may hinder public health efforts.</p><p>The OSL platform was chosen for this study due to its ability to monitor public discussions on health topics, especially those related to children&#x02019;s NCDs, by analysing online content from diverse sources. While children aged 6&#x02013;10 typically have limited smartphone access, the OSL approach focuses on capturing conversations from parents, educators, and healthcare professionals&#x02014;key influencers in shaping children&#x02019;s health behaviours. By analysing topics like nutrition, physical activity, and sleep patterns, the study seeks to understand how these issues are discussed online and to identify misinformation that could impact children&#x02019;s health.</p><p>In conclusion, while OSL proves invaluable for understanding and addressing health-related issues, navigating through vast amounts of unstructured data requires sophisticated tools and methodologies, including NLP and machine learning (ML) algorithms for sentiment analysis and semantic understanding.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>The project devised a high-level architecture outlining the chosen software components and their interrelationships.

<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p><bold>Data source:</bold> This component acts as the gateway to real-time data from the social media platform by leveraging the Twitter API. It collects tweets and associated data for subsequent processing.</p></list-item><list-item><p><bold>Server back-end:</bold> Using Google Cloud Functions as its backbone, the server-side back-end manages the tasks of data collection, cleaning, and processing. Google Cloud Functions enable efficient handling of data collection and cleaning processes, while Node.js serves as the intermediary connecting the database to the front-end server.</p></list-item><list-item><p><bold>Data storage:</bold> The robust data storage solution, MongoDB, efficiently manages the structured data gathered from Twitter. It ensures reliable data accessibility and integrity, enabling seamless storage and retrieval of data within the system.</p></list-item><list-item><p><bold>Website front-end:</bold> The user-friendly interface of the website, designed for accessing and interacting with processed data, was developed using React.js. This interface empowers users to intuitively explore trends, insights, and health-related information with ease.</p></list-item></list></p><sec><title>Data collection</title><p>The project selected Twitter API as its primary data source for several reasons. Firstly, Twitter is a widely recognized social media platform with a diverse user base engaging in discussions on various topics, including health. Secondly, the project&#x02019;s emphasis on monitoring and responding to emerging health-related trends aligns seamlessly with Twitter API&#x02019;s capability to provide developers with real-time data access. Thirdly, the open framework of Twitter&#x02019;s API allows for flexible crafting of specific data collection queries, facilitating precise targeting of relevant content. Lastly, the public availability of Twitter data enhances the project&#x02019;s transparency and accessibility, adhering to ethical data usage practices.</p><p>While Twitter API supports academic research and application development for free, it comes with limitations such as rate limits (300 requests per 15 min) and access restricted to public tweets. Despite the potential for real-time data acquisition, the project opted for daily updates to efficiently meet its goals, considering the API&#x02019;s rate limits. This strategy addresses concerns about identifying pertinent tweets in real-time, as daily updates provide information that approximates real-time conditions, ensuring effective data collection within the API&#x02019;s constraints.</p><p>Selecting appropriate keywords is a vital and intricate task in data collection, especially when aiming to comprehend complex subjects like NCDs and their associated risk factors. The significance of keywords lies in their role as gatekeepers to the vast realm of digital information, particularly in this text-centric data context. The selection process followed a structured approach based on multiple criteria:
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p><bold>Expert consultation:</bold> A panel of health experts, including epidemiologists and public health professionals, was consulted to identify essential terms related to NCDs and child health. Their expertise ensured that the selected terms were both medically and contextually relevant.</p></list-item><list-item><p><bold>Literature review:</bold> Scientific publications, policy reports, and global health databases (<italic toggle="yes">e.g</italic>., WHO, CDC) were analysed to identify commonly used terms in discussions about child health, lifestyle habits, and NCD risk factors.</p></list-item><list-item><p><bold>Data-driven expansion:</bold> To enhance keyword coverage, we utilized the NLTK WordNet library and the Related Words platform to identify synonyms and semantically related terms, ensuring broader data retrieval.</p></list-item><list-item><p><bold>Preliminary data testing:</bold> An initial dataset was collected to evaluate keyword effectiveness. Keywords generating a high volume of irrelevant data were either refined or excluded.</p></list-item><list-item><p><bold>Filtering for context:</bold> To improve relevance, queries included additional terms specifically related to children (<italic toggle="yes">e.g</italic>., &#x0201c;kids,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;child,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;minor&#x0201d;). Retweets, quotes, and replies were also excluded to prioritize original content.</p></list-item></list></p><p>Through this multi-step approach, a refined set of 116 unique terms was established, balancing inclusivity and precision in data collection. However, during individual term searches, a significant amount of irrelevant information was collected, prompting the need for control measures. To filter this data, various experiments were conducted, initially extracting tweets with combinations of two out of the 116 predetermined keywords. Semantic similarity between keyword pairs was measured using the spaCy NLP library, but this approach proved ineffective. A refined strategy involved extracting concepts associated with younger age groups to improve data filtration precision.</p><p>The study involved analysing 103 distinct queries spanning 15 primary topics related to child health and behaviour, such as &#x0201c;lifestyle habits&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;substance abuse&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;diets&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;nutrition&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;physical exercise&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;sleep&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;screen time&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;diabetes&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;hypertension&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;cardiovascular disease&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;cancer&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;mental health&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;noncommunicable diseases&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;respiratory diseases&#x0201d;, and &#x0201c;school&#x0201d;. For the final dataset, each of the 103 queries was refined to include the original predetermined keyword, terms specific to children (kids, child, minor &#x02026;), and a filter to exclude retweets, quotes, and replies, thereby retaining only original tweets (<xref rid="ref-26" ref-type="bibr">Peixoto et al., 2025</xref>). This method, although resulting in some irrelevant data, aimed to prioritize the acquisition of an extensive dataset for a comprehensive analysis of child-related topics.</p><p>The study collects diverse data attributes from Twitter, including Tweet ID, text, creation date, language, user information, multimedia information, entities, and public metrics. User information, like verification status, helps identify influential participants. The location attribute provides insights into the geographic concentrations of discourse, while links and multimedia files enhance the depth of the tweet <italic toggle="yes">corpus</italic>. Retrieving public metrics, such as engagement and retweet counts, aids in identifying influential content. Data extraction from Twitter&#x02019;s API involves making requests with parameters like query, start and end times, and maximum results. Due to API limitations, the daily routine extracts tweets from the past 24 h. Python&#x02019;s <italic toggle="yes">requests</italic> library is used for extraction, and the data is stored in a Mongo Atlas database in a structured dictionary format.</p><p>Initially, tweets were indexed based on ID numbers, but due to users repetitively posting identical tweets, a revised indexing scheme was introduced. This aims to retain the original tweet with the highest user engagement while accommodating multiple entries for users disseminating the same content. This approach prevents redundant storage of identical tweets and conserves computational resources.</p></sec><sec><title>Data cleaning and processing</title><p>Twitter data, rich in potential insights, requires thorough preprocessing before meaningful analysis. Filtering mechanisms like &#x0201c;health_filter&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;pos_filter&#x0201d; were implemented to exclude irrelevant information. Some selected keywords lacked a direct association with health, introducing potential noise into the dataset (<italic toggle="yes">e.g</italic>., &#x0201c;school&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;television&#x0201d;). As a solution, the &#x0201c;health_filter&#x0201d; was introduced to assess tweets and identify matches with a predefined list of health-related keywords. To handle nuanced language usage, the &#x0201c;pos_filter&#x0201d; function was developed using the <italic toggle="yes">spaCy</italic> library. This function specifically addressed instances where users used &#x0201c;minor&#x0201d; as an adjective and &#x0201c;kid&#x0201d; as a verb, requiring specialized management to maintain dataset accuracy and relevance to research goals.</p><p>Cleaning procedures for tweets involved several steps (<xref rid="ref-2" ref-type="bibr">Bopaiah, 2022</xref>; <xref rid="ref-27" ref-type="bibr">Pradha, Halgamuge &#x00026; Vinh, 2019</xref>):

Adjustments to the neutrality threshold did not significantly enhance its accuracy. With a precision of 0.650 and recall of 0.444, TextBlob struggled to correctly classify sentiments, particularly negative ones. VADER, while highlighting specific qualities, misclassified neutral tweets as positive, a concerning issue for health analytics, potentially leading to an overestimation of positive sentiment. Its precision of 0.666 and recall of 0.646 indicate moderate performance, though its F1-score suggests inconsistency in classification. DistilBERT demonstrated performance comparable to VADER but struggled with accurately identifying neutral tweets, achieving a precision of 0.672 and recall of 0.677. In contrast, BERTweet emerged as the standout performer, boasting an accuracy rate exceeding 80%, a precision of 0.811 and recall of 0.808, leading to an F1-score that surpassed all other models. In this research, the decision to utilize a pre-trained Sentiment Analysis model, such as BERTweet, was grounded in its proven performance, extensive training on diverse datasets, and the ability to generalize effectively in the dynamic context of social media content. This approach not only saved valuable resources but also ensured efficient capture of sentiment nuances in health-related tweets, with BERTweet achieving a notable 100% accuracy in identifying negative sentiments in the test sample.</p><p>To further assess model performance, we evaluated their receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, measuring the true positive rate against the false positive rate. The area under the curve (AUC) values provide a robust metric for comparing classification performance. As shown in <xref rid="fig-5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>, BERTweet demonstrated the highest AUC score (0.86), followed closely by DistilBERT (0.83), while VADER and TextBlob performed comparatively worse with AUC values of 0.77 and 0.64, respectively.</p><fig position="float" id="fig-5"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7717/peerj.19311/fig-5</object-id><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>ROC curve for sentiment analysis models.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="peerj-13-19311-g005" position="float"/></fig><p>The geolocation challenge arose from users providing fictional locations.

Overcoming this, Web Scraping from the GeoNames website (<xref rid="ref-14" ref-type="bibr">GeoNames, 2023</xref>) improved dataset accuracy by acquiring location data. Utilizing regular expressions and the <italic toggle="yes">PySentimiento</italic> model, tweets expressing concern or doubts were identified based on the predominant emotion of fear. A scoring system prioritizing relevance and significance considered user interactions (likes, retweets, views), identifying high engagement as indicative of notable trends. Verified users&#x02019; tweets, owing to their influence, were given added weight in shaping public discourse.</p><p>After data processing, information selection for the application followed three paths: general stats, topic-specific analysis, and link-containing tweets treatment. General stats covered tweet count, engagement, sentiment, and geographic distribution. Research topics, ranked by frequency, considered hashtags, and tweet tokens for trend identification. Opting for tokens in trend analysis preserved language nuances, revealing insights into distinct discussions, like varied discussions around different diabetes types. The established scoring system facilitated the identification of the top 10 tweets across diverse categories, including global impact, linked multimedia, verified user tweets, and expressions of concerns or doubts. Each category served a unique purpose. The top 10 global tweets signify exceptional engagement and resonance, showcasing their relevance and widespread impact. Conversely, the top 10 tweets with links or multimedia underline the role of multimedia in enhancing tweet visibility and engagement. Verified users, with their influential status and likely greater credibility, form a distinct category, given their substantial impact on public discourse. The concerns and doubts category identifies tweets expressing ambiguity about health-related topics, emphasizing areas requiring clarification. Similar to general statistics, a comparable method was employed for topic-specific health statistics.</p><p>To enhance their significance, tweets with links were singled out for special treatment. After reviewing the data, it was evident that many of these links led to informative articles, studies, or news relevant to the research. Recognizing their value, a decision was made to categorize and manage them separately, potentially for a health literacy or news section within the app. To achieve this, a filtering process was applied to select links with titles and descriptions containing keywords related to research, scientific investigations, and advancements. Keywords like &#x0201c;research&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;article&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;study&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;discovery&#x0201d;, and reputable medical publication sites were included.

However, a significant obstacle arose in June 2023 when the application reorganization by the new proprietor of X (Twitter&#x02019;s new name) led to substantial modifications in the API definitions. This modification resulted in the termination of free access to Twitter&#x02019;s Academic API, making data acquisition prohibitively expensive. Consequently, the accessible dataset was limited to records from June 7, 2023.</p><p>It is imperative to emphasize that the technical infrastructure of the project was systematically developed, except for the final testing and validation phases, which were pending. Despite their pending status, these phases were executed iteratively throughout the project to enhance the quality and integrity of the data presented to the target audience. Regrettably, financial constraints compelled the discontinuation of new data acquisitions, thereby restricting the analysis of the final results to the last day of data collection.</p><p>Data collection commenced on June 7, 2023, at 00:00 and concluded at the same time on June 8, 2023. Post-collection, a dataset of 3,551 unique tweets underwent meticulous cleaning and processing. This dataset garnered a total of 7,488,962 views, 78,077 likes, and 23,866 retweets.</p><p>Initially, it became evident that the data collection window on June 7, 2023, coincided with World Food Safety Day 2023. Notably, topics related to &#x0201c;food&#x0201d; dominated discussions on that day, constituting a total of 1,033 tweets. Furthermore, the prevailing discourse broadened to include discussions on &#x0201c;mental health&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;school&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;education&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;nutrition&#x0201d;, offering valuable contextual insights into the public discourse on that particular day.</p><p>In analyzing the general statistics, it was found that approximately 44.10% of the collected tweets were categorized as neutral, with negative sentiments surpassing positive sentiments at 32.16% and 23.7%, respectively. This disparity underscores the prevalence of negative sentiments in discussions related to child health issues on the specified day. A closer examination of the dataset revealed that among the top 10 tweets with the highest global engagement, eight exhibited a noticeable negative sentiment, while the remaining two were classified as neutral.</p><p>A salient example in this group is the top-ranked tweet, which spread misinformation about vaccination, suggesting a potential link between vaccinations and health problems like earaches, eczema, and asthma in children (<xref rid="fig-12" ref-type="fig">Fig. 12</xref>). Such unverified claims pose a significant public health risk by potentially discouraging parents from vaccinating their children.

Such situations are inherent in the dynamic landscape of social media data collection. However, it is crucial to understand that the platform&#x02019;s effectiveness does not solely depend on eliminating irrelevant tweets. Instead, its primary strength lies in its ability to identify and analyze emerging trends in the population&#x02019;s discourse. The sentiment analysis also plays a crucial role in this study, providing healthcare professionals with a unique perspective to examine public opinions and concerns related to various healthcare themes. This perspective enables informed initiatives and responses to public concerns, ensuring that health information and services align with the population&#x02019;s sentiments.</p><p>This phenomenon is especially noticeable when a specific issue gains significant public attention, resulting in a surge of related tweets and increased user engagement. To illustrate, consider a hypothetical scenario where a prominent influencer with a substantial online following raises concerns about the safety of commercial baby food brands. The influencer&#x02019;s message, emphasizing harmful chemicals and toxins in these products and advocating for homemade baby food, would likely trigger a wave of tweets discussing &#x0201c;baby food&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;harmful chemicals&#x0201d;, and &#x0201c;child development&#x0201d;. This surge in related tweets would naturally elevate these topics to the forefront of trending discussions on the platform.</p><p>The &#x0201c;Perspectives and Updates&#x0201d; page features links to highly relevant articles for users, particularly parents, and teachers, covering topics such as the positive impact of youth sports on mental health, PFAS exposure&#x02019;s link to obesity risk, and the risks of social media on children&#x02019;s well-being. Despite commendable content, limitations in consistent information presentation arise due to variations in website structures and web scraping complexities. Occasional inclusions of content less aligned with the primary focus are expected, given the automated processes&#x02019; reliance on keyword matching and contextual interpretation.</p><p>The findings from comparing the frequency of topics between PressReader and Twitter shed light on the distinct dynamics of discourse between traditional press and social media platforms concerning research topics. Twitter emerges as a prominent platform for discussions, characterized by its succinct nature and high frequency of engagement. In contrast, PressReader, while still relevant, appears to host fewer discussions on research topics, likely due to its emphasis on detailed textual content.</p><p>The thematic analysis reveals a noteworthy overlap in the thematic content discussed on both platforms, particularly in domains such as mental health, cancer, food, and drug-related topics. This convergence suggests that despite differences in platform structure and user demographics, there is a shared interest and concern regarding certain research topics across traditional and social media platforms.</p><sec><title>Research strengths and limitations</title><p>Through the analysis of the results in the previous section, it is evident that all the objectives outlined were successfully achieved.</p><p>The research gains strength from its diverse team and collaborative approach, enhancing credibility and effectiveness.
