This study presents a pathological clavicular fracture that occurred 50 years after radiotherapy for a sarcoma. A 67-year-old female with a history of radiation therapy following surgery at the age of 10 years developed a clavicular fracture without trauma. Prior to the fracture, the patient experienced progressive brachial plexopathy over the past 15 years. Biopsy revealed no malignancy, which led to the diagnosis of a pathological fracture. This study illustrates the delayed onset of radiation-induced complications, with neurological damage appearing earlier than the fracture. Moreover, it underscores the importance of considering radiation-induced bone fragility in patients with unexplained fractures, particularly individuals with prior radiation exposure. Early detection of neurological damage, such as brachial plexopathy, may offer an opportunity for preventive care. Furthermore, it highlights the necessity of patient education regarding the long-term effects of radiation therapy, including bone fragility and the risk of pathological fractures.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>late-onset radiation complications</kwd><kwd>long-term cancer survivorship</kwd><kwd>osteoradionecrosis</kwd><kwd>pathological clavicle fracture</kwd><kwd>radiation-induced brachial plexopathy</kwd><kwd>radiation therapy</kwd><kwd>sarcoma</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Radiotherapy (RT) is an effective cancer treatment that can lead to long-term complications, including neurological and bone disorders [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. For example, brachial plexopathy is a well-known RT-induced neuropathy following radiation in breast, lymphoma, and head and neck cancers. Following RT, pathological fractures frequently occur in the ribs, pelvis, and femur [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], while clavicular fractures are rare and can occur after radical neck dissection [<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. RT-induced disorders, including brachial plexopathy and pathological bone fractures, are dose-dependent and influenced by the irradiation technique and treatment site.</p><p>This study reports a rare case of pathological clavicle fracture following brachial plexopathy occurring more than 50 years after RT&#x000a0;for sarcoma, demonstrating the delayed onset of RT-induced complications. It also emphasizes the importance of early detection of neurological damage to educate patients about the potential risk of pathological bone fractures post-treatment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="cases"><title>Case presentation</title><p>A 67-year-old female with a history of sarcoma, treated with radiation following tumor resection at the age of 10 years, was referred to our institution for evaluation and management of a skin ulcer accompanied by a right clavicular fracture. A surviving summary report indicated that the patient received a cumulative dose of 60 Gy during the initial treatment for sarcoma. However, detailed information regarding the radiation technique, including field settings, fractionation, and modality, was unavailable due to the long elapsed time since therapy. Similarly, details of the surgical procedure could not be obtained. The patient reported no recent trauma but described progressively worsening pain in the same area over the past two months. She also noted a gradual decrease in right upper limb muscle strength, which had worsened over approximately 15 years.</p><p>Upon examination, a small skin ulcer was observed above the clavicle with a palpable clavicular fracture beneath the ulcer (Figure <xref rid="FIG1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). A surgical scar from a deltopectoral flap performed approximately 20 years after RT for the treatment of a radiation-induced skin ulcer was also observed on her right shoulder. Right deltoid muscle atrophy was evident. A manual muscle test revealed a strength score of one in the right biceps brachii, triceps brachii, and brachioradialis and shoulder joint internal rotation, indicating severe muscle weakness. Tendon reflexes of biceps brachii, brachioradialis, and triceps brachii were absent. Sensory function in the right upper arm and ulnar aspect of the forearm diminished.</p><fig position="anchor" fig-type="figure" id="FIG1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Clinical findings of the first examination.</title><p>The patient presented with a scar from a previous surgery on her right shoulder, accompanied by a minor skin ulcer.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="cureus-0017-00000082898-i01" position="float"/></fig><p>Radiography of the right shoulder revealed a clavicular diaphysis fracture (Figure <xref rid="FIG2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).

Pathological fractures due to RT have been reported with a frequency ranging from 1.2% to 25%, and most of these fractures involve weight-bearing bones, such as the femur, pelvis, and spine [<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However, a pathological fracture of the clavicle solely caused by RT is a rare complication. Historically, most reported clavicle fractures post-cancer treatment occurred in patients who underwent both neck dissection and post-operative RT, with an incidence of only 0.4-0.5% after neck dissection [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The combination of neck dissection and RT can compromise blood supply and structural integrity of the bone, predisposing the clavicle to fracture [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. However, fractures solely attributable to RT (without head dissection) were reported by Niikura et al. [<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The latency period for radiation-induced pathological fractures in various cases ranges from 0.4 to 25 years after RT. The median latency in some cases is approximately five to seven years, depending on the type of cancer treated and the extent of irradiation [<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Generally, the radiation tolerance of the brachial plexus is 60 Gy [<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The incidence of brachial plexopathy is approximately 5% with radiation doses of 60 Gy or less, but increases exponentially when the dose exceeds 60 Gy. The reported median time from radiation exposure to the onset of paralysis is seven months (range: 4.5-88 months) [<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In the present case, both brachial plexopathy and pathological clavicular fractures occurred much later than typical reports.</p><p>The incidence of RT-induced brachial plexopathy varies in accordance with the irradiation technique, ranging from 66% with historical doses of 60 Gy in 5 Gy fractions to less than 1% with modern doses of 50 Gy in 2 Gy fractions [<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Several RT-related factors associated with brachial plexopathy have been identified, such as a large total dose (&#x0003e;50 Gy to peripheral nerves and &#x0003e;60 Gy to cranial nerves) and a large dose per fraction (&#x0003e;2.5 Gy). In this case, because the patient had received RT more than 50 years ago, it is likely that the irradiation technique used at that time posed a greater risk. Although modern RT techniques, such as intensity-modulated radiation therapy, have considerably reduced the risk of late adverse effects, this case emphasizes that individuals treated with earlier-generation modalities remain susceptible to delayed complications [<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Therefore, early intervention and prevention, including education, should be prioritized during follow-up.</p><p>The patient developed a chronic RT-induced skin ulcer approximately 20 years after RT, which required reconstruction with a deltopectoral flap. Skin ulcers are among the more common late complications of RT and typically occur at lower doses [<xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Although this complication preceded the onset of brachial plexopathy and pathological clavicular fracture by a few decades, this case suggests that the presence of superficial complications alone may not reliably predict the development of more severe neurological or skeletal complications, which tend to emerge at higher doses and occur less frequently.</p><p>For pathological bone fractures caused by RT, the standard treatment is often a combination of conservative management and surgical intervention. Surgical treatments such as open reduction and internal fixation or bone grafting have been suggested for pathological fractures following post-operative RT [<xref rid="REF14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In this case, we decided against performing surgical fixation of the clavicular fracture because of the patient&#x02019;s pre-existing brachial plexopathy, which caused significant weakness in the deltoid, biceps brachii, triceps brachii, brachioradialis, and shoulder internal rotators. The clavicle functions as a strut that supports shoulder mobility by maintaining the alignment and spacing of the scapula, thereby enabling efficient upper-limb movements. However, because the primary limitation was neural rather than mechanical, fixation is unlikely to improve shoulder joint movements. Therefore, conservative management was considered appropriate.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This case of pathological clavicle fracture occurring 50 years after RT underscores the importance of recognizing late-onset RT-induced complications. As the brachial plexus and bones have a similar tolerance to RT, clinicians should consider radiation-induced bone damage in patients with a history of RT, particularly when evaluating unexplained fractures. This case also highlights the need for long-term multidisciplinary monitoring of cancer survivors, especially those treated with historical high-dose radiation protocols.&#x000a0;Regular follow-ups and patient education are essential for managing these long-term risks.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group content-type="conflict"><title>Disclosures</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Human subjects:</bold> Consent for treatment and open access publication was obtained or waived by all participants in this study.</p><p><bold>Conflicts of interest:</bold> In compliance with the ICMJE uniform disclosure form, all authors declare the following:</p><p><bold>Payment/services info:</bold> All authors have declared that no financial support was received from any organization for the submitted work.</p><p><bold>Financial relationships:</bold> All authors have declared that they have no financial relationships at present or within the previous three years with any organizations that might have an interest in the submitted work.</p><p><bold>Other relationships:</bold> All authors have declared that there are no other relationships or activities that could appear to have influenced the submitted work.</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="other"><title>Author Contributions</title><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Concept and design:</bold>&#x000a0; Toshio Netsu, Masato Tsuchiya, Satoshi Kubo, Ryuichi Azuma</p><p><bold>Acquisition, analysis, or interpretation of data:</bold>&#x000a0; Toshio Netsu</p><p><bold>Drafting of the manuscript:</bold>&#x000a0; Toshio Netsu</p><p><bold>Critical review of the manuscript for important intellectual content:</bold>&#x000a0; Masato Tsuchiya, Satoshi Kubo, Ryuichi Azuma</p><p><bold>Supervision:</bold>&#x000a0; Ryuichi Azuma</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="REF1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><article-title>Radiation-induced thoracic necrosis with a pulmonary cutaneous fistula repaired using a free omental flap: a case report</article-title><source>BMC Surg</source><person-group>
