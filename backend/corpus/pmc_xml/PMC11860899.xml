Post-renal transplantation rejection encompasses three primary forms of allograft rejection: hyperacute rejection, acute rejection (AR) and chronic rejection (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Chronic rejection in renal transplantation clinically manifests as a slow deterioration in allograft function and represents the primary cause of delayed renal graft failure. Chronic transplant renal dysfunction (CAD) stems from a range of factors, including glomerulosclerosis, inflammation, interstitial fibrosis, and tubular atrophy (IF/TA) (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), serving as the primary source of interstitial matrix deposition, plays a crucial role in driving the development of CAD (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). The prevention or delay of CAD occurrence becomes a crucial long-term treatment goal following kidney transplantation.</p><p>Ferroptosis is a novel form of programmed cell death dependent on iron, distinguished from apoptosis, necrosis, and autophagy at the cellular level (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). The primary mechanism of ferroptosis involves the catalysis of heightened expression of unsaturated fatty acids on the cell membrane in the presence of divalent iron or esteroxygenase, leading to lipid peroxidation and subsequent cell death. Furthermore, ferroptosis is characterized by a reduction in the activity of the regulatory core enzyme GPX4 within the antioxidant system, specifically the glutathione system (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Regarding cell morphology, ferroptosis induces smaller mitochondria, heightened membrane density, and diminished cristae. However, morphological alterations are not observed in the nucleus. Concerning cellular composition, ferroptosis is characterized by elevated lipid peroxidation and distinct genetic alterations. Utilizing iron agents and experiencing an overload of iron ions can lead to an accumulation of excessive iron in the cytoplasm and mitochondria, thereby hastening the production of highly toxic reactive oxygen species, particularly hydroxyl radicals, resulting in ferroptosis (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), With the occurrence of ferroptosis in the transplanted kidney tissues, it exacerbates the inflammatory response and secretes a large amount of validating and pro-fibrotic factors, which together promote the process of EMT, which in turn accelerates interstitial fibrosis and CAD in the transplanted kidney (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).</p><p>In recent years, the widespread adoption of genetic testing technologies has led to a gradual shift in research focus from macroscopic phenotypic studies to microscopic investigations of genes, signal transduction, and other cellular processes, especially with the development and application of second-generation sequencing and single-cell technologies. These advancements have further deepened the study of gene expression and the role of different cell subtypes (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). In this study, datasets pertaining to chronic rejection after renal transplantation were retrieved from the GEO database. After screening, biopsy samples from the GSE21374 dataset were selected for analysis. Subsequently, the samples from GSE21374 were categorized into CAD and No-CAD groups based on the biopsy results (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Differentially expressed genes were initially identified, followed by the extraction of differentially expressed ferroptosis-related genes through their association with known ferroptosis-related genes. Subsequently, prediction models were constructed utilizing these genes to identify target genes. Survival analysis was then conducted to assess the impact of these genes on the survival time of transplanted kidneys. By analyzing transcriptomics data of transplanted kidney samples from public databases, we obtained the relationship between ferroptosis-related gene (Caveolin-1, CAV1) and the prognosis of transplanted kidneys. The main function of CAV1 is to induce plasma membrane invagination, participate in cytoskeletal interactions, endocytosis, and cholesterol transport (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). CAV1 is involved in stem cell differentiation, proliferation, and cell death pathways (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Previous studies have shown that variants in the CAV1 gene are associated with post-transplant graft renal failure (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), but the mechanism is unclear. Subsequently, validation was carried out using clinical samples and animal models, and the underlying mechanism was explored through cell experiments, further confirming the association between high CAV1 expression and CAD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2_1"><label>2.1</label><title>Data retrieval and collation</title><p>We searched the official GEO website (<ext-link xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/</ext-link>) to identify datasets related to renal transplantation and rejection. After thorough screening, we selected GSE21374 as the dataset for our study, comprising 282 expression profiles from human renal allograft biopsies. The follow-up time of each sample was extracted from the original dataset, and the samples were subsequently categorized into No-CAD and CAD groups. Data processing involved raw data download, probe annotation, imputation of missing values, and removal of differential P-values. These steps were carried out by two professional bioinformatics analysts.</p></sec><sec id="s2_2"><label>2.2</label><title>Differential gene acquisition and prognostic modeling</title><p>Raw data from GSE21374 were log-transformed and normalized using the &#x02018;limma&#x02019; package in R. Differential expression was identified with a threshold of log2FoldChange &#x0003e; 0.5. Statistical analyses were conducted using R version 4.2.2. Ferroptosis-related differential genes were identified by integrating data from the FerrDb website (<ext-link xlink:href="http://www.zhounan.org/ferrdb/current/" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.zhounan.org/ferrdb/current/</ext-link>). Cox regression analysis was conducted utilizing the status of each kidney transplant puncture sample in GSE21374 and the corresponding follow-up time, utilizing the &#x0201c;survival&#x0201d; package. This analysis was performed using the expression matrix of ferroptosis-related genes to establish a prediction model for CAD occurrence and to derive the risk value for each sample, serving as the basis for subsequent analyses. Subsequently, target genes significantly associated with CAD occurrence were identified through the prediction model. These genes, along with the follow-up time of each sample, were utilized to conduct survival analysis on the transplant kidney survival time, facilitated by the &#x0201c;survival&#x0201d; package. This analysis aimed to further explore transplant kidney survival based on differences in time using the model established by the target genes.</p></sec><sec id="s2_3"><label>2.3</label><title>Functional enrichment analysis</title><p>Building upon the previously obtained differentially expressed genes, we performed Gene Ontology (GO) function enrichment analysis using R language to identify the signaling pathways predominantly activated by these genes. Utilizing the risk values derived from the prediction model and the high and low expression groups of the target genes, we conducted Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) on the gene expression matrix. This analysis identified pathways significantly enriched in the high and low-risk groups, serving as a reference for future studies. GSEA enrichment analysis was performed using the GSEA 4.1.0 software (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2_4"><label>2.4</label><title>Clinical samples</title><p>This experiment utilized 20 transplanted kidney specimens obtained from patients diagnosed with CAD, all confirmed through histopathology at Jiangsu Provincial People&#x02019;s Hospital, exhibiting interstitial fibrosis of the transplanted kidney.

Kidneys from C57BL/6 mice were transplanted into BALB/C mice to establish a model of chronic allograft rejection (Allo group), while kidneys from BALB/C mice were transplanted into other BALB/C mice to establish a control group (Syn group). The left kidney of the donor mice was transplanted into the peritoneal cavity of the recipient mice, followed by intraoperative removal of the recipient mice&#x02019;s intrinsic right kidney. At day 7 post-transplantation, the contralateral (left) kidney of the recipient mice was also removed. Intraoperatively, the mice were anesthetized with inhaled isoflurane, and the total ischemic time during surgery averaged 40 to 60 minutes. To prevent acute rejection, recipient mice were orally administered tacrolimus at a dose of 1 milligram per kilogram (mg/kg) once daily for 7 days, followed by 1 mg/kg once weekly for the next 4 weeks. At week 16 post-kidney transplantation, the mice were euthanized, and the transplanted kidney tissue was either fixed in paraffin wax or stored in liquid nitrogen (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>).

In the co-culture experiment, WB analysis of the lower layer cells revealed that in the CAV1 knockdown group, Erastin induced significant changes in EMT indicators compared to the control group (increase in &#x003b1;-SMA and Fibronectin; decrease in E-cadherin). However, in the CAV1 knockdown group, these indicators of the lower layer cells did not exhibit significant changes (<xref rid="f7" ref-type="fig">
<bold>Figure&#x000a0;7F</bold>

In our present study, we found that CAV1 overexpression could promote the occurrence of epithelial cell ferroptosis, which is an inflammatory mode of death, and IL-6 is also mainly involved in the inflammatory response, as a result, IL-6 levels were increased after CAV1 overexpression. To further validate the role of IL-6, neutralizing antibodies against IL-6 were added to co-cultured cell media overexpressing CAV1. Subsequent WB analysis of lower layer cells revealed that the changes in EMT were significantly reduced under the action of IL-6 neutralizing antibodies (<xref rid="f7" ref-type="fig">

This is attributed to its significant enhancement of the quality of life for patients with end-stage renal disease. However, acute and chronic graft rejection subsequent to kidney transplantation substantially curtails its efficacy, thereby inducing considerable distress for both patients and clinicians (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). The diagnosis of graft rejection currently depends on the pathological biopsy report, which entails an invasive procedure that could lead to post-puncture renal bleeding and exacerbate the loss of renal function (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). In recent years, owing to the continuous advancement in gene sequencing technology, there has been a growing interest in the genetic and molecular aspects of rejection in kidney transplantation and post-transplantation. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying acute and chronic rejection after kidney transplantation remain unclear. The process of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) leads to significant intercellular material deposition, representing a key process in chronic renal fibrosis, extensively studied in conditions such as hypertensive nephropathy and chronic kidney disease (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Our study is centered on investigating the impact of EMT on chronic transplant renal fibrosis and exploring strategies to mitigate EMT progression, thus prolonging the functionality of transplanted kidneys.</p><p>Ferroptosis, characterized by iron-dependent regulated cell death, arises from the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), initiating a cascade of intracellular oxidative events culminating in cell lysis and demise (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). The concept of ferroptosis has garnered significant attention since its inception. Previous studies suggest that ferroptosis contributes substantially to drug resistance in tumor cells, ischemic organ damage, and various degenerative diseases associated with extensive lipid peroxidation (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Criteria for iron-dependent cell death include an imbalance in cellular metabolism and redox homeostasis, leading to lethal lipid peroxidation and subsequent cell demise (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Anemia and disrupted iron homeostasis are prevalent in chronic kidney disease and are associated with serious adverse consequences (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Iron supplementation is commonly employed in treating renal anemia. Factors such as iron ion overload in renal tubular epithelial cells and the microenvironment of chronic inflammation in transplanted kidneys contribute to ferroptosis (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). These factors motivate our investigation into iron-dependent cell death in chronic transplanted renal fibrosis. Not all cells undergo ferroptosis during chronic rejection of transplanted kidneys (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>), similar to the variation observed in renal tubular atrophy and fibrosis on pathological sections (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Ferroptosis plays an important role in cardiomyocyte injury and can be induced by plasma peroxidation products (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). Studies have shown that increased ferroptosis after myocardial ischemia, cardiomyopathy, and myocardial infarction may lead to cardiomyocyte death, which can exacerbate the fibrotic process (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). In diseases such as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and alcoholic liver disease, ferroptosis may lead to disorders of lipid metabolism and cellular damage (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). Activation and proliferation of fibroblasts are critical steps in the process of liver fibrosis. Ferroptosis can promote fibrosis by activating fibroblasts through increased oxidative stress and decreased antioxidant defenses (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). Ferroptosis may result in damage to alveolar epithelial cells and fibroblasts, increasing the production and release of inflammatory mediators to exacerbate the inflammatory response in pulmonary fibrosis (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). In the context of chronic inflammation, certain renal tubules experience iron-dependent cell death, resulting in cell lysis, extravasation of cellular contents, and release of significant amounts of pro-fibrotic factors, which influence neighboring cells and potentially contribute to epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), thereby accelerating the progression of transplantation renal fibrosis (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). Our objective is to investigate the mechanism of ferroptosis during the chronic allograft dysfunction (CAD) process.</p><p>Caveolin-1 (CAV1) plays a significant role in signaling receptor binding, response to hypoxia, protein kinase binding, and positive regulation of NF-kappaB transcription factor activity (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). It is a major membrane-intrinsic protein located in caveolae, which are invaginations on the cell surface responsible for maintaining their integrity, facilitating small molecule transport, and mediating signaling processes. Microcaveolae are specialized intracellular depressions found on the surface of lipid rafts in the cell membrane (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>). CAV1, an integral membrane protein primarily located on the cytosolic membrane, is a key component of microcyst formation and serves as one of the primary regulators of cellular senescence (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). Previous research indicates that CAV1 can modulate iron death by influencing reactive nitrogen species (RNS) metabolism during acute immune-mediated hepatic damage and liver fibrosis (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>). Given the highly metabolic nature of organs, particularly transplanted kidneys characterized by complex tissue infiltration of inflammatory factors, ferroptosis and other forms of cell death exhibit intricate interactions. Currently, some iron chelators and redox agents are mainly used to regulate the occurrence of ferroptosis (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>), but specific targeted drugs have not yet been applied to the clinic. CAV1 emerges as a potential target for regulating cellular metabolism in the treatment of kidney diseases (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>). Future studies should explore pharmacological inhibition of CAV1 or ferroptosis modulators to mitigate CAD progression.</p><p>In this study, we identified differentially expressed ferritin-related genes in CAD using publicly available data from the GEO database. The prediction model constructed based on these genes demonstrated good diagnostic efficacy for CAD and significant discriminatory power for the survival time of transplanted kidneys. Subsequently, we investigated the role of CAV1 in influencing the process of epithelial cell iron death in transplanted kidneys using clinical samples, animal models, and <italic>in vitro</italic> cellular experiments. Our findings elucidated the occurrence of iron death in renal tubular epithelial cells through the secretion of pro-fibrotic factors, resulting in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in neighboring cells and accelerating the fibrosis of transplanted kidneys. However, this study has certain limitations, such as the intrinsic mechanism by which CAV1 regulates ferroptosis, warranting further investigation in subsequent studies, Moreover, this experiment is a single-center data study, needs to be validated in larger, more ethnically diverse groups.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><label>5</label><title>Conclusions</title><p>In this study, we identified ferroptosis-related differential genes through analysis of the gene expression matrix of transplanted kidney puncture biopsy samples from the GEO database. We established a prognostic model for chronic allograft dysfunction (CAD) of the transplanted kidney by analyzing dataset GSE21374 and conducted survival analysis based on the expression levels of target genes. Subsequently, we selected CAV1 as a focus for further investigation and validated its effects using clinical samples, animal models, and cellular experiments. The findings suggest that elevated expression of CAV1 promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in epithelial cells by activating the ferroptosis pathway, thereby contributing to the progression of CAD in transplanted kidneys.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We acknowledge the open databases of GEO.</p></ack><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s6"><title>Data availability statement</title><p>The original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/<xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material">
