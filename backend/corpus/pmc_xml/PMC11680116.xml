Here, we analyzed the immunological responses of a live-attenuated recombinant Pichinde virus (PICV) vector platform (rP18tri). Methods: To evaluate anti-PICV immunity in the development of vaccine antigen-specific immune responses, we generated a rP18tri-based vaccine expressing the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) nucleoprotein (NP) and administered four doses of this rP18tri-NPLCMV vaccine to mice. Using MHC-I tetramers to detect PICV NP38-45 and LCMV NP396-404 epitope-specific CD8+ T cells, we monitored vector- and vaccine-antigen-specific immune responses after each vaccination dose. Results: LCMV NP396-404-specific effector and memory CD8+ T cells were detected after the first dose and peaked after the second dose, whereas PICV NP38-45-specific memory CD8+ T cells increased with each dose. PICV-binding IgG antibodies peaked after the second dose, while anti-PICV neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) remained low even after the fourth dose. Immunization with the rP18tri-NPLCMV vaccine significantly reduced LCMV viral titers in a chronic LCMV Clone 13 infection model, demonstrating the protective role of LCMV NP-specific T cells. Conclusion: These findings provide important insights into the antigen- and vector-specific immunity of the rP18tri-NPLCMV vaccine and support the development of NP-based vaccines against arenavirus pathogens.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>arenavirus</kwd><kwd>Pichinde virus</kwd><kwd>LCMV</kwd><kwd>vaccine</kwd><kwd>viral vector</kwd><kwd>vaccine immunity</kwd><kwd>anti-vector immunity</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>This research received no external funding.</funding-statement></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-vaccines-12-01450"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Viral vector-based vaccines utilize genetically modified, weakened viruses to deliver antigens, stimulating immune responses without the need for adjuvants [<xref rid="B1-vaccines-12-01450" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-vaccines-12-01450" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. They are generally cost-effective and can be highly immunogenic [<xref rid="B3-vaccines-12-01450" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-vaccines-12-01450" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Current viral vectors include both replication-competent and replication-incompetent platforms derived from various RNA and DNA viruses, such as adenoviruses, adeno-associated viruses (AAVs), vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), lentiviruses, and poxviruses [e.g., Modified Vaccinia Virus Ankara (MVA) and Canarypox vector] [<xref rid="B5-vaccines-12-01450" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The FDA has approved two viral vectored vaccines for human use: the Janssen adenovirus-vectored COVID-19 vaccine, which had its emergency use authorization (EUA) revoked in 2023 due to reports of blood clots post-vaccination, and ERVEBO, a recombinant VSV-vectored Ebola vaccine that has shown good protection against Ebola Zaire [<xref rid="B6-vaccines-12-01450" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>A major limitation of viral vectored vaccines is anti-vector immunity. Prior exposure to the vector virus or repeated vaccinations can lead to immune responses against the vector itself, rendering it less effective against vaccine antigen(s) [<xref rid="B2-vaccines-12-01450" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B4-vaccines-12-01450" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. While the availability of multiple serotypes and capsid variants makes AAVs an attractive vector, they have limited transgene capacity and lower immunogenicity compared to other viral vectors [<xref rid="B4-vaccines-12-01450" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Poxvirus vectors can accommodate large transgene inserts and have shown high immunogenicity in preclinical studies [<xref rid="B5-vaccines-12-01450" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B7-vaccines-12-01450" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Nevertheless, further research evaluating the potential impact of anti-vector immunity with MVA-vectored vaccines has shown reduced immunogenicity following multiple doses of the vaccine [<xref rid="B8-vaccines-12-01450" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Additionally, highly attenuated replication-incompetent poxvirus vectors do not grow to high titers, posing challenges for large-scale production [<xref rid="B9-vaccines-12-01450" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. There are also safety concerns with some viral vectors: lentiviral vectors may pose a risk of insertional mutagenesis, and live-attenuated viral vectors could revert to a virulent form or cause disease in immunocompromised individuals [<xref rid="B4-vaccines-12-01450" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Therefore, there is an urgent need for new viral vector platforms that can ensure both safety and efficacy while eliciting robust and long-lasting immune responses.</p><p>Our lab has developed a replication-competent Pichinde virus (PICV)-based vaccine platform (rP18tri) [<xref rid="B10-vaccines-12-01450" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-vaccines-12-01450" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. PICV is a non-pathogenic RNA virus within the Arenaviridae family. The natural host for PICV is the Colombian rice rat (<italic toggle="yes">Oryzomys albigularis</italic>). PICV has very low seroprevalence and pre-existing immunity in humans, even in the local population [<xref rid="B12-vaccines-12-01450" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-vaccines-12-01450" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-vaccines-12-01450" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. PICV&#x02019;s genome consists of two RNA segments encoding four essential genes in an ambisense coding strategy. The large (L) RNA segment encodes the viral matrix protein (Z) and the large RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L), whereas the small (S) segment encodes the viral glycoprotein (GPC) and nucleoprotein (NP). Using a reverse genetics strategy, we divided the S RNA segment into S1 and S2 RNA segments, each containing an essential viral gene (either PICV NP or PICV GPC) and a multiple cloning site (MCS) for the insertion of a foreign gene, resulting in a recombinant rPICV with three RNA segments (rP18tri) [<xref rid="B10-vaccines-12-01450" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-vaccines-12-01450" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>The rP18tri vector offers several unique advantages as a vaccine platform. PICV has no pre-existing immunity in the general population and shows a good safety profile [<xref rid="B10-vaccines-12-01450" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. PICV naturally targets antigen-presenting cells (APCs), which enhance antigen presentation on both MHC class I and class II molecules, promoting strong cellular and humoral immune responses [<xref rid="B10-vaccines-12-01450" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B15-vaccines-12-01450" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Antigen-specific immune responses can be further increased by homologous boosting [<xref rid="B10-vaccines-12-01450" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-vaccines-12-01450" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, the potential development of anti-vector immunity and its impact on vaccine efficacy after multiple doses requires further investigation. The rP18tri vector can accommodate two extra open-reading frames (ORFs) of up to 2 kb each and has proven effective in inducing both systemic and mucosal immunity across multiple animal species via various vaccination routes [<xref rid="B16-vaccines-12-01450" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-vaccines-12-01450" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-vaccines-12-01450" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Its ability to stimulate robust T cell immunity, apart from the antibody response, makes the rP18tri vector an ideal candidate for developing vaccines against pathogens for which cell-mediated immunity (CMI) plays a critical protective role, such as arenavirus pathogens [<xref rid="B19-vaccines-12-01450" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-vaccines-12-01450" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-vaccines-12-01450" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-vaccines-12-01450" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>The Arenaviridae family includes multiple significant human pathogens. Several Old World (OW) and New World (NW) arenaviruses can cause severe and lethal hemorrhagic fever (HF) diseases, for example, Lassa fever caused by the OW Lassa virus (LASV) in West Africa and Argentine hemorrhagic fever caused by the NW Junin virus (JUNV) in South America [<xref rid="B23-vaccines-12-01450" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) is an OW arenavirus with a global distribution and can cause neurological disorders, such as meningitis and encephalitis, congenital infections, and transplant-associated hemorrhage and death [<xref rid="B24-vaccines-12-01450" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Currently, there are no FDA-approved antivirals or vaccines for these arenavirus pathogens. Previous research has suggested that CD8+ T cells play an important protective role against arenavirus infections [<xref rid="B19-vaccines-12-01450" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B25-vaccines-12-01450" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], while neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) contribute to the protection against NW HF-causing arenaviruses but do not seem to play a major role against LASV or LCMV during infection or vaccination [<xref rid="B19-vaccines-12-01450" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B22-vaccines-12-01450" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>In this study, we generated a recombinant rP18tri-based vaccine expressing LCMV NP and assessed the development of both antigen- and vector-specific immune responses following multiple doses in mice. We observed high levels of antigen-specific effector and memory CD8+ T cells, which peaked after the second dose. While vector-specific antibodies and CD8+ T cells are highly elevated, no significant anti-vector NAbs were detected even after four homologous doses. This rP18tri-NPLCMV vaccine effectively reduced the LCMV viral load in a chronic LCMV infection model in mice. Our study establishes the optimal vaccination strategy for the rP18tri vector and demonstrates the role of NP-specific CD8+ T cells in generating protective immunity against LCMV, offering a promising approach for developing vaccines against other arenavirus pathogens.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-vaccines-12-01450"><title>2.

Detection of Antigen- and Vector-Specific CD8+ T Cells by Tetramer Staining in Mice Immunized with rP18tri-NPLCMV Vaccine</title><p>LCMV NP-specific CD8+ T cells can be conveniently evaluated by a well-established MHC-I tetramer assay with the H-2Db LCMV NP396-404 tetramer [<xref rid="B27-vaccines-12-01450" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28-vaccines-12-01450" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B29-vaccines-12-01450" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. We thus used LCMV NP as a model T cell antigen and generated a rP18tri-vectored vaccine rP18tri-NPLCMV encoding LCMV NP (<xref rid="vaccines-12-01450-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A).</p><p>To determine whether rP18tri-NPLCMV can elicit LCMV NP antigen-specific CD8+ T cells, we immunized (IP) mice with PBS (mock), rP18tri vector, or rP18tri-NPLCMV. PBMCs were analyzed 7 d post-vaccination using MHC-I tetramer staining. LCMV NP396-404 tetramer-positive CD8+ T cells were detected only in mice immunized with rP18tri-NPLCMV but not with the mock or the rP18tri vector, while PICV NP38-45 tetramer-positive CD8+ T cells were present at high levels in mice immunized with both the vector and rP18tri-NPLCMV but were undetected in the mock group (<xref rid="vaccines-12-01450-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>B). The LCMV NP396-404 epitope is FQPQNGQFI, and the corresponding sequence in PICV NP is YQPDTGNYI, whereas the PICV NP38-45 epitope is SALDFHKV, and the corresponding sequence in LCMV NP is NGLDFSEV. Thus, even though LCMV and PICV NP proteins show 79% similarity and 50% identity scores, the two MHC-I tetramers do not cross-react with CD8+ T cells induced by the opposing NP antigen. Our data demonstrate that rP18tri-NPLCMV can elicit strong antigen- and vector-specific T cell responses, which can be specifically detected by the two MHC-I tetramers.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot2-vaccines-12-01450"><title>3.2. Evaluation of Antigen-Specific Effector CD8+ T Cells After Multiple-Dose Immunization</title><p>To evaluate the changes in antigen-specific CD8+ T cells elicited after repeated exposure to the viral vectored vaccine, we immunized (IP) mice with PBS (mock) or rP18tri-NPLCMV for a total of four doses with a 45 d interval and collected PBMCs 7 d after each dose for LCMV NP396-404 tetramer staining (<xref rid="vaccines-12-01450-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>A).

A significant number of LCMV NP396-404-specific CD8+ effector T cells were detected after the first dose in all vaccine-immunized mice and increased markedly after the second dose. While NP antigen-specific CD8+ T cells continued to increase after the third or the fourth dose in two mice, they remained at similar levels in two other mice and decreased in one mouse; as such, their average magnitude as a group did not increase further after the third and fourth doses of vaccination. Most of these NP tetramer-specific CD8+ T cells expressed the activation and memory T cell marker CD44high (<xref rid="vaccines-12-01450-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>E). As such, the magnitude of LCMV NP396-404-specific CD44highCD8+ T cells showed a similar trend of changes after each dose of vaccination (<xref rid="vaccines-12-01450-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>F,G) as that of CD8+ T cells (<xref rid="vaccines-12-01450-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>C,D).

Discussion</title><p>In this study, we conducted a comprehensive evaluation of antigen- and vector-specific CD8+ T cells, along with anti-vector antibody responses, throughout the multiple-dose immunization of mice with rP18tri-NPLCMV, a replication-competent rP18tri viral vectored vaccine expressing LCMV NP as a model T cell antigen. We show that rP18tri-NPLCMV elicits strong antigen-specific effector and memory cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), as evidenced by high levels of LCMV NP396-404 epitope-specific CD8+ and CD44high CD8+ T cells during the expansion (7 d) phase and after the contraction (30 d) period. The antigen-specific T cell response was robust following the first dose and became even stronger after the second dose. A strong vector-specific CTL response was also detected, as shown by a large number of PICV NP38-45 CTLs that increased after the administration of multiple doses. Despite the high level of anti-PICV IgGs, particularly after the second dose, neutralizing activity against PICV remained undetected or at very low levels even after the fourth dose. Together, these findings suggest that although a single dose of the replication-competent rP18tri vectored vaccine can elicit a strong antigen-specific CTL response, which may already provide sufficient protection, a boost dose significantly enhances vaccine immunity. Thus, a prime-boost vaccination strategy can be used with rP18tri-vectored vaccines to achieve the strongest vaccine immunity and protection, which is especially relevant for vaccine development against complex diseases such as cancers, tuberculosis, and malaria.</p><p>Our data showing the peak of antigen-specific memory CD8+ T cells after the second dose of rP18tri-NPLCMV are consistent with a previous study using two arenavirus vectors, rPICV and rLCMV [<xref rid="B36-vaccines-12-01450" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], where the highest immune responses were observed after the second dose of homologous boosting. The exact mechanism for the increased antigen-specific memory CD8+ T cells after prime-boost immunization is unclear, but it may result from a robust recall (memory) response, with a much higher number of effector T cells generated during the expansion phase. PICV (vector)-specific immunity also seems to peak after the second dose of vaccination, as observed in the anti-PICV binding IgGs in this study (<xref rid="vaccines-12-01450-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>B) and PICV-specific T cells in a prior study [<xref rid="B37-vaccines-12-01450" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Although the number of PICV NP38-45 tetramer-positive memory CD8+ T cells continued to increase after the third and fourth doses (<xref rid="vaccines-12-01450-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>C), they targeted a highly immunodominant epitope, while the total PICV-specific T cells, as evaluated by ELISPOT, did not increase further after the second dose [<xref rid="B37-vaccines-12-01450" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The high levels of vector-specific CD8+ T cells after the second dose may limit the further increase in antigen-specific T cells after additional doses. To mitigate anti-vector immunity developed after multiple doses, a possible solution is to use heterologous prime-boost strategies. Previous studies have shown that heterologous boosting with different arenavirus vectors, such as alternating between rPICV and rLCMV, can bypass vector-specific immunity and refocus the immune response on the target antigen [<xref rid="B38-vaccines-12-01450" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. This approach has already shown success in early-phase human clinical trials for HPV16+ cancer vaccines, where it induced strong tumor-specific CD8+ T cell responses and long-term immunity [<xref rid="B36-vaccines-12-01450" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="B39-vaccines-12-01450" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].</p><p>Although high titers of PICV-specific IgG antibodies were generated, particularly after the second dose, anti-PICV NAbs were not observed until the fourth dose, and even then, they were only present at a low titer (<xref rid="vaccines-12-01450-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>B,C). Our finding is consistent with previous reports showing that the extensive post-translational glycosylation of the PICV envelope glycoprotein, which forms &#x0201c;glycan shields&#x0201d;, can limit the development of NAbs against the virus [<xref rid="B32-vaccines-12-01450" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B33-vaccines-12-01450" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B34-vaccines-12-01450" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Since using anti-vector NAbs is a major mechanism to reduce the efficacy of viral vectored vaccines, the lack of anti-PICV NAbs despite repeated exposures represents a key advantage for the rP18tri vaccine vector. It remains to be determined whether these non-neutralizing PICV-specific IgGs could influence antigen immunity through Fc effector functions.</p><p>Developing effective vaccines for arenaviruses is challenging due to the high genetic diversity of viral strains and limited knowledge of the protective antigen(s) and protective immunity. Most if not all of the experimental arenavirus vaccines based on viral vectors and RNA/DNA platforms utilize the full-length glycoprotein GPC as the vaccine antigen [<xref rid="B23-vaccines-12-01450" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. However, GPC has the highest sequence diversity among the arenaviral proteins, and studies have indicated that vaccines containing only one strain of GPC failed to provide adequate protection against other arenavirus strains [<xref rid="B40-vaccines-12-01450" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="B41-vaccines-12-01450" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Arenaviral NP is an attractive vaccine target because it is abundantly expressed in arenavirus-infected cells, is more conserved in sequence across arenavirus strains, and is highly immunogenic [<xref rid="B42-vaccines-12-01450" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Notably, NP contains both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell epitopes, some of which are conserved among arenaviruses [<xref rid="B43-vaccines-12-01450" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="B44-vaccines-12-01450" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Previous studies have suggested that CD4+ T cell responses targeting LASV NP play an important role in the early control of LASV infection [<xref rid="B21-vaccines-12-01450" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B45-vaccines-12-01450" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Our study demonstrates the protective role of LCMV NP-specific immune responses, resulting in a significant reduction in viral titers in various tissues in a chronic LCMV infection model (<xref rid="vaccines-12-01450-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). These anti-LCMV-NP immune responses likely control viral infection by inducing a robust memory T cell response and promoting enhanced T cell differentiation and function. In summary, our study characterizes the development of vector- and antigen-specific immune responses during multi-dose immunization with the rP18tri-NPLCMV vaccine. It establishes the prime-boost vaccination strategy for the rP18tri-based vaccine platform to induce the strongest vaccine immunity and provides evidence for the protective role of NP-specific immunity against arenavirus pathogens. These findings advance our understanding of the rP18tri vaccine vector platform and demonstrate its potential for developing vaccines against various infectious diseases, including those caused by arenavirus pathogens.</p></sec><sec id="sec5-vaccines-12-01450"><title>5.
