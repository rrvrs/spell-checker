This long prodrome is suggestive of peripheral immunity involvement in the initiation of disease. We previously developed a model system in PINK1 KO mice displaying PD-like motor symptoms at late stages following intestinal infections. Herein, we map the initiating immune events at the site of infection in this model. Using single-cell RNAseq, we demonstrate that peripheral myeloid cells are the earliest highly dysregulated immune cell type followed by an aberrant T cell response shortly after. We also demonstrate an increased propensity for antigen presentation and that activated myeloid cells acquire a proinflammatory profile capable of inducing cytotoxic T cell responses. Together, our study provides the first evidence that PINK1 is a key regulator of immune functions in the gut underlying early PD-related disease mechanisms.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Inflammation</kwd><kwd>Parkinson's disease</kwd><kwd>Antigen processing and presentation</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Aligning Science Across Parkinson's (ASAP 000525)</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Aligning Science Across Parkinson's (ASAP 000525) Canadian Institutes of Health Research (grant PJT-165928)</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer Nature Limited 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Parkinson&#x02019;s disease (PD) is a highly prevalent, age-associated progressive neurodegenerative disorder that is usually diagnosed upon the appearance of cardinal motor functional deficits such as bradykinesia, tremor, and rigidity. The motor symptoms are caused in part by the loss of dopamine (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta of the midbrain and it is estimated that by the time of diagnosis, 60&#x02013;80% of nigral DA neurons are already irrevocably lost, making treatment of PD challenging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, it is now widely recognized that motor symptom development can be preceded by a long prodromal phase where non-motor symptoms, such as hyposmia, constipation, sleep disruption and anxiety, may be present<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. The extensive prodromal period suggests that disease initiating mechanisms may occur early life and remain unnoticed until the appearance of motor symptoms in older age. Understanding the pathophysiology of the prodromal phase of PD offers promise for earlier detection and treatment.</p><p id="Par3">Peripheral inflammation and immune dysfunction have been implicated in PD onset, including the emergence of various non-motor symptoms, such as gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Analyses of immune profiles in the stools of PD patients demonstrate higher levels of inflammatory mediators suggestive of GI inflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Clinical studies further reveal that people with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and GI infections have an increased risk of developing PD later in life<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Other studies also underscore common genetic variants between patients with PD and immune disorders, such as IBD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Intriguingly, evidence suggests that multiple genes implicated in familial forms of PD as well as several PD risk variants are expressed in immune cells and function in the regulation of immune responses.</p><p id="Par4">Of interest, PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1), a serine/threonine kinase, and Parkin (PRKN), an E3 ubiquitin ligase, both associated with familial forms of PD, have been shown to act as repressors of innate immune responses independently from their previously described roles in mitophagy. A loss of function of either of these two proteins disinhibits the formation of mitochondrial-derived vesicles (MDVs) in antigen-presenting cells leading to the presentation of mitochondrial peptides via major histocompatibility complex I (MHCI), a process referred to as mitochondrial antigen presentation (MitAP)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. MitAP leads to the establishment of mitochondrial antigen-specific T cells, implicating T cell autoimmunity in PD pathogenesis. Subsequently, others have also proposed that PINK1 modulates immune responses triggered by oxidative stress and viral infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">In accordance with this, intestinal infection with Gram-negative bacteria (Citrobacter rodentium) in PINK1 knockout (KO) mice was able to induce antigen-specific T-cell autoreactivity and increased entry of immune cells into the brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Notably, with aging and repeated infections, these mice developed L-DOPA reversible PD-like motor impairments. A similar phenomenon was also recently demonstrated using a major PD-associated human-relevant pathogen (Helicobacter pylori), where autoreactive CD8&#x02009;+&#x02009;T-cell-dependent PD-like motor phenotypes developed following GI infection of PINK1 KO mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Additionally, adoptive transfer of mitochondrial antigen-specific CD8&#x02009;+&#x02009;T cells was shown to be sufficient to induce motor impairments and DA neuron loss in both PINK1 KO and wild-type mice, supporting a critical and direct role for autoreactive CD8&#x02009;+&#x02009;T cells in causing neuronal loss under such conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Taken together, these data provide proof of concept that peripheral infections can lead to aberrant immunity engendering parkinsonism in genetically predisposed models of PD.</p><p id="Par6">Critical questions remain, in particular regarding the mechanisms at play in the periphery at the earliest prodromal stages of the disease process. Understanding the immune mechanisms that initiate disease early in the periphery at the cell/molecular level will address a major knowledge gap that hinders the development of diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to stop the onset of impairment at early stages of disease before irreversible neuron death ensues. Here, we sought to provide an in-depth characterisation of the initiating immunological events in the gut mediated by PINK1 deficiency. We find that intestinal infection in PINK1 KO mice induces early immune dysregulation in the colon marked by the promotion of proinflammatory myeloid cell differentiation with an increased capacity to promote T-cell cytotoxic profiles. Further in-vitro findings demonstrate that PINK1 loss in myeloid cells following lipopolysaccharide stimulation can elicit more potent CD8&#x02009;+&#x02009;T cell responses in both wild type and PINK1 KO CD8&#x02009;+&#x02009;T cells. Collectively, our study deepens our knowledge of the role of PD-associated genes in the regulation of peripheral immunity, providing an opportunity for the development of biomarkers and therapeutic approaches.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Single-cell RNAseq of the colon unveils a role for PINK1 within the immune cell compartment at the earliest stages following infection</title><p id="Par7">We have previously described that repeated infection of PINK1 KO mice with mouse intestinal Gram-negative pathogen (C. rodentium) via gavage induces L-DOPA reversible motor symptoms 16-24&#x02009;weeks later<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Despite clear evidence for the role of autoreactive CD8&#x02009;+&#x02009;T cells in the neurodegenerative process within the brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, it is unknown how this is instigated. The phases of C. rodentium infection subsequent to its establishment in the colon are well described, and include bacterial expansion (by 1&#x02009;week), steady-state (1&#x02013;2&#x02009;weeks) and clearance (2+&#x02009;weeks). This immune response is governed by several players of innate and adaptive immunity, including early myeloid cell responses driven by dendritic cells then ultimately the engagement of type 1 and interleukin 17-producing T helper cells (Th1 and Th17, respectively) for complete clearance of the infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par8">We first employed an indirect, non-invasive approach using faecal analysis to evaluate whether there was any evidence for enhanced gut inflammation in PINK1 KO mice at different time points after infection. We used enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to detect lipocalin-2 (LCN2) and calprotectin, which are highly expressed by activated innate immune/epithelial cells, and often used as indicators of intestinal inflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. We noted a progressive increase in the concentration of inflammatory markers over time which reached significance in wild type and PINK1 KO mice at 2- and 4&#x02009;weeks post infection (w.p.i.) compared to uninfected mice. Importantly, there was significantly more LCN2 in PINK1 KO infected mice compared to wild type infected mice at these time points (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1A</xref>). Similar genotype-dependent increases were observed with calprotectin at 2&#x02009;w.p.i. (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1A</xref>). Additionally, we interrogated gut function in PINK1 KO mice after infection, as constipation is one of the earliest non-motor symptoms experienced by PD patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. We discovered that PINK1 KO mice often exhibited lower faecal water content and/or reduced stool frequency at 2&#x02009;w.p.i. compared to wild type infected mice, suggestive of exacerbated GI dysfunction (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1B</xref>). It is noteworthy that the constipation phenotype is highly variable across cohorts albeit the reason for this is unclear.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Single-cell transcriptomics of the colon in an infection-induced model of PD.</title><p><bold>A</bold> Lipocalin-2 levels were measured in faecal samples of WT and PINK1 KO mice at 1-, 2- and 4&#x02009;w.p.i. and uninf. controls.

Briefly, we prepared gene expression libraries from wild type and PINK1 KO infected mice along with uninfected control groups at 1- and 2&#x02009;w.p.i. (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>). Subsequent to quality control of our datasets employing standard parameters in Seurat<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, we annotated all immune cell types using identity markers curated from the literature for each cell cluster (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1D, E</xref>). Cell populations were further defined by sets of genes displayed in Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>. By comparing wild type and PINK1 KO datasets in each distinct condition (uninfected control, 1&#x02009;w.p.i. and 2&#x02009;w.p.i.), we determined transcriptional regulation driven by PINK1 in specific immune cell types in response to intestinal infection. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2A</xref>, we did not observe obvious genotype-dependent alterations in cell cluster identities in each condition, although as expected, we noticed a larger population of granulocytes at 1- and 2&#x02009;w.p.i. in both genotypes compared to the uninfected groups. Meanwhile, CD4+ and CD8&#x02009;+&#x02009;T cell subtypes became more prominent at 2&#x02009;w.p.i. in both genotypes. These changes are consistent with the involvement of innate and adaptive immunity in bacterial clearance at these timepoints, as expected<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Next, we performed differential gene expression analyses between PINK1 KO and wild type mice. The heatmap illustrates the number of genes that were either significantly upregulated or downregulated in each immune cell type of PINK1 KO mice compared to wild type (adjusted <italic>p</italic>-values&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05 using non-parametric Wilcoxon rank sum test with Bonferroni correction applied to evaluate significance) with the most substantial changes occurring in the myeloid cell compartment (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>). We found extensive transcriptional regulation in monocytes/macrophages and dendritic cells at 1-w.p.i., followed by CD4&#x02009;+&#x02009;Th1 and Th17 as well as CD8+ cytotoxic T cells (Tc1) at 2&#x02009;w.p.i.

Next, we delved deeper into the myeloid cell lineage and performed unsupervised clustering on these cells (generating higher resolution principal component analyses) to identify monocytes distinct from macrophages (M&#x003d5;s) and dendritic cells (DCs). The highest number of DEGs were found within intestinal monocytes (187 upregulated and 127 downregulated) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4B</xref>). We then analyzed the differential trajectories in the monocytes using the aforementioned pseudotime methods, providing immature monocytes as origin given these are the precursor cells for M&#x003d5;s and DCs (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4C</xref>). This approach identified two distinct lineages in both wild type and PINK1 KO mice emerging from immature monocytes. One trajectory differentiated into macrophage-like mature monocytes and the other into DC-like monocytes. To determine whether genotype altered the propensity of intestinal monocytes to differentiate, we quantified the proportions of monocytes from wild type and PINK1 KO mice with low (0, 10) or high (10, 20) pseudotime values. This analysis suggested that PINK1 KO monocytes have a greater tendency to commit to becoming mature, antigen-presenting myeloid cells as evidenced by a higher ratio of M&#x003d5;-like or DC-like monocytes in PINK1 KO infected mice compared to wild type (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4D</xref>). Most of the top GO terms associated with DEGs in the monocyte population in PINK1 KO infected mice compared to wild type represented functions related to dysregulated pathways of myeloid hemopoiesis leukocyte differentiation and mononuclear lymphocyte mediated immunity, which are congruent with an altered differentiation state and regulation of T cell activation (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4E</xref>; Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>).

Emerging preclinical models of PD instigated by GI infections may have far-reaching clinical significance in determining the underlying inflammatory-mediated mechanisms at play in the periphery driving pathology. To this end, we exploited our previously developed infection-induced PD model to study such mechanisms. Consistent with clinical observations indicating elevated inflammatory markers in stools of PD patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, we found that PINK1 KO infected mice exhibit exacerbated intestinal inflammation as evidenced of higher faecal lipocalin-2 and calprotectin levels compared to wild type. Of note, we inoculated mice with higher C. rodentium (4&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>9</sup> CFU) contrary to our previous publication<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> where genotype-dependent inflammatory intestinal markers following infection were not detectable. Interestingly, PINK1 KO mice at 2-w.p.i. tended to display more extensive gut dysmotility compared to wild type although these observations varied between cohorts. We suspect that differences between cohorts wherein some may have had high mouse Helicobacter positivity (which we did not track) could be underlying these PD-like phenotypes. Of note, in our related publication, we demonstrate that human Helicobacter pylori infection of PINK1 KO mice is sufficient to trigger PD-like motor deficits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Future investigations are warranted to decipher the impact of a diversity of variables in our GI-targeted infection-induced PD models that may underlie the heterogeneity we observe across cohorts.</p><p id="Par23">In line with a plethora of reports highlighting the role of other genes associated with familial PD in inflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref></sup>, PINK1 has been shown to play pleiotropic effects in innate immunity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref></sup>. However, whether PINK1-regulated inflammatory signalling perpetrates early disease processes in PD remains elusive. Here we discovered that the myeloid cell lineage exhibits the most substantial dysregulation at the initial stages of our infection-induced model. We further reveal an amplified proinflammatory response in monocytes of PINK1 KO infected mice, including upregulation of HIF1&#x003b1;. Consistent with this, a prior study demonstrated that deletion of PINK1 in non-immune cells resulted in glucose metabolism reprogramming, which requires increases in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and the activation of HIF1&#x003b1; signalling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref></sup>. Our data suggests the occurrence of early HIF1&#x003b1;-mediated metabolic alterations in activated PINK1 KO monocytes, which intriguingly is also in line with what has been observed in monocytes from peripheral blood of RBD patients who are considered at the prodromal period of the disease. These patients display elevated levels of mitochondrial ROS associated with a concomitant increase in glycolysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref></sup>. Other features of RBD monocytes include upregulation of human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-DR expression which correlates with worsened cognitive and motor performance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>, while changes in TLR4 expression inversely correlate with the functionality of midbrain DA neurons, estimated by <sup>18</sup>F-DOPA positron emission tomography (PET) imaging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. These findings are also recapitulated in our data demonstrating elevated expression of major histocompatibility complexes and toll-like receptors in intestinal monocytes of PINK1 KO mice at the earliest phase of infection.</p><p id="Par24">Cellular roles of PINK1 seems to be context-dependent and operate in response to a distinct type of stressor. Previous studies elucidated conflicting results regarding the implication of PINK1 in mitigating inflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. Sliter et al., reported that PINK1 KO mice under mitochondrial stress display excessive systemic levels of the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin 6 and &#x003b2;-interferon via increased activation of the cyclic GMP&#x02013;AMP synthase (cGAS)-stimulator of interferon genes (STING) signalling pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. A previous in vitro study of human skin cells following varicella zoster viral infection also suggested that PINK1 attenuates STING-mediated interferon responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. In contrast, PINK1 was shown to induce retinoic-acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors-mediated antiviral immunity in peritoneal macrophages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Here, we provide evidence for a negative regulation of myeloid cell responses by PINK1 in an intestinal microbial infection-induced PD model. It is still unclear if this dysregulation in myeloid cells triggered by PINK1 deficiency directly contributes to neuronal dysfunction or loss or whether effects are indirect, such as through other immune cells. Sun et al., previously reported that deletion of PINK1 in LPS/IFN&#x003b3;-stimulated mixed-glia cultures elicits the generation of an inflammatory milieu conducive to neuronal death in vitro<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Intriguingly, our findings point to an upregulation of IL-6 and IL-1&#x003b2; secretion in activated PINK1 KO myeloid cells, which were formerly demonstrated to sufficiently induce dopaminergic neurodegeneration and aggravate synuclein-mediated neuronal pathology in iPSC models of PD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref></sup>. Understanding the mechanisms for how PINK1 loss potentiates inflammatory responses in myeloid cells and the repercussions on DA neurons will be crucial to develop approaches to target immune-mediated pathology implicated in disease onset.</p><p id="Par25">The contribution of PINK1 in inflammation has largely been attributed to its role in regulating mitophagy. During cellular stress, this serine/threonine kinase together with another PD-associated protein, the E3 ubiquitin ligase Parkin, is stabilized at the surface of damaged mitochondria, critical for the initiation of mitophagy. In the absence of PINK1/Parkin, impaired mitophagy occurs and is traditionally viewed as a putative neuronal cell-autonomous mechanism contributing to DA neuron loss<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref></sup>. Albeit recent work has suggested instead a role of PINK1 in modulating innate immunity induced by oxidative stress and viral infections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Our group previously showed that PINK1 represses immune responses independent of mitophagy, through inhibition of the formation of MDVs, which carry proteins to late endosomes, where they are processed. PINK1 abrogation thus induces MDV transport to the endosomal and proteasomal compartments resulting in heightened MitAP in dendritic cells undergoing cellular stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. With MitAP occurring in the periphery, it is likely that na&#x000ef;ve T cells become educated against these self-peptides. Indeed, we have previously revealed that elevated MitAP in PINK1 KO dendritic cells leads to the establishment of mitochondrial antigen-specific T cells, which can later access the brain and cause degeneration of DA neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. The exact mechanisms linking such processes to neuronal loss are nonetheless unclear. Since DA neurons have the capacity to express MHCI at their cell surface in response to inflammatory signals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref></sup>, a direct attack of DA neurons by cytotoxic CD8&#x02009;+&#x02009;T cells is therefore plausible, as suggested by recent results demonstrating that adoptive transfer of mitochondria-specific CD8&#x02009;+&#x02009;T cells in PINK1 KO and wild type mice is sufficient to cause death of midbrain DA neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Importantly, our current study showcases that deregulated antigen presentation mediated by PINK1 KO occurs at the earliest stage of disease as evidenced by upregulation of MHC molecules and co-stimulatory ligands, including CD86 and ICAM1, in PINK1 KO APCs. We suggest that, in addition to perturbations in direct cell-cell contact mediated interactions as we have also previously noted<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, a lack of PINK1 in myeloid cells may amplify cytotoxic T cell responses through excessive production of proinflammatory, T-cell-polarizing cytokines. Together, we posit that PINK1 may participate in a critical innate to adaptive immune transition in all aspects of APC-T cell cross talk via the three-signal paradigms, from TCR engagement, co-stimulation, and skewing.</p><p id="Par26">The activation of intestinal CD8&#x02009;+&#x02009;Tc1 cells in PINK1 KO mice at early stages after infection is illustrated by upregulation of Stat3 and Ccr5. A prior study demonstrated that CCR5 overexpression induces the activation of the JAK/STAT signalling pathway in human CD4&#x02009;+&#x02009;T cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. In addition, accumulation of CCR5 at the immunological synapse leads to more robust APC-T cell interactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. Moreover, in this study, CD8&#x02009;+&#x02009;Tc1 cells in PINK1 KO infected mice displayed significant elevated levels of cytotoxic mediator perforin (Prf1) concomitant with increased expression of Pdcd1 encoding PD-1, known to be upregulated early during acute infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref></sup>. We also described higher expression of other activation-induced markers (e.g., Tnfrsf9) as well as cytotoxicity-related genes (e.g., Gzmb, Ifng, Il17a) in intestinal CD8&#x02009;+&#x02009;T cells of PINK1 KO infected mice. Our findings collectively suggest that effector CD8&#x02009;+&#x02009;T cells are expanding in the gut of PINK1 KO mice at an early stage after intestinal infection, and it is likely that these T cells induce pronounced cytotoxic outcomes. Presently, it is still unclear if the appearance of more cytotoxic CD8&#x02009;+&#x02009;T cells in the gut of PINK1 KO mice is a result of myeloid cell interactions with na&#x000ef;ve or mitochondrial antigen-experienced T cells. Future work focused on identifying naturally occurring mitochondrial proteins processed and presented through the PINK1-controlled MDV pathway could inform plausible MHCI-TCR interactions in the gut and may open novel avenues for early detection and interventions in PD.</p><p id="Par27">Ultimately, our study bridges critical knowledge gaps on the influence of genetic and environmental interplay on immune mechanisms that confer risk for PD.

Briefly, cells were partitioned into nanoliter-scale Gel Bead-In-EMulsions (GEMs) using 10X GemCode Technology. Primers containing (i) an Illumina R1 sequence, (ii) a 16&#x02009;bp 10x barcode, (iii) a 10&#x02009;bp Unique Molecular Identifier (UMI) and (iv) a poly-dT primer sequence were incubated with partitioned cells resulting in barcoded, full-length cDNA from poly- adenylated mRNA. Silane magnetic beads were used to remove leftover biochemical reagents/primers, then cDNA was amplified by PCR. Enzymatic fragmentation and size selection was used to optimize cDNA amplicon size prior to library construction. R1 (read 1 primer sequence) were added during GEM incubation, whereas P5, P7, a sample index (i7), and R2 (read 2 primer sequence) were added during library construction via end repair, A-tailing, adaptor ligation and PCR. Quality control and quantification was performed using an Agilent Bioanalyzer High Sensitivity chip. Sequencing was performed using NovaSeq 6000 S4 PE 100&#x02009;bp, which resulted in a read depth of ~20,000 reads/cell. Reads were processed using the 10X Genomics Cell Ranger Single Cell 2.0.0 pipeline (RRID:SCR_017344, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/software/pipelines/latest/what-is-cell-ranger">https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/software/pipelines/latest/what-is-cell-ranger</ext-link>) with default and recommended parameters, as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref></sup>.
