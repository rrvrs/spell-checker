This study evaluated how peripheral inflammatory cytokines relate to the intensity of the psychiatric symptoms of these disorders.</p><p>Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted that included 100 participants, of which 30 were schizophrenia patients, 30 were major depressive disorder (MDD) patients, and 40 were healthy controls. The inflammatory markers, also known as peripheral cytokines IL-6, TNF-&#x003b1;, and IL-1&#x003b2;, were measured using an ELISA method. The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) tools were used to evaluate symptom severity.

PANSS scores in schizophrenia patients correlated with IL-6 and TNF-&#x003b1; serum levels, whereas MDD patients showed correlations between IL-6 and IL-1&#x003b2; levels and HAM-D scores.</p><p>Conclusion: Peripheral inflammatory markers were seen to be associated with psychiatric symptom severity, which supported the inflammatory hypothesis of mental illness.

In the central nervous system, microglial cells maintain their identity as immune cells while they control the developmental pathways, synaptic connections, and inflammatory reactions&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. These cells change their phenotype to become pro-inflammatory when confronted with persistent stress or pathology, which causes them to release cytokines that damage neural functions and produce behavioral problems&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>According to the research studies, traditional neurotransmitter-based illness models differ from the neuroimmune framework because they demonstrate immune dysregulation as the foundation for psychiatric symptom development and maintenance&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Available research demonstrates that schizophrenia and depression both have shown increased rates of cytokines, including IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-6, and TNF-&#x003b1;, which indicate systemic inflammation followed by cognitive impairment, treatment unresponsiveness, and disturbances in mood&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Present research primarily studied individual inflammatory markers, but the comprehensive study on microglial activation processes and resulting consequences in various psychiatric populations has been done only to a limited extent&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Peripheral cytokines became the primary focus because they are widely available and scalable in psychiatric care, particularly in low-resource settings. Microglia evaluation remained unapproachable for practical use in large-scale clinical trials and low-income regions. This study connected translational research by identifying measurable biomarkers that allowed for the development of anti-inflammatory treatment strategies, but still, clinical utility is required for additional multi-modal validation&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>This research analyzed how microglial-linked inflammatory cytokines are connected to specific psychiatric symptoms in schizophrenia and depression. The evaluation of biological markers with clinical symptoms in affected patients aimed to advance our knowledge about inflammatory mechanisms during psychiatric illnesses. Research demonstrated the translational worth of microglial activity manipulation, which serves as a base for developing immune-based psychiatric therapies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>A cross-sectional investigation took place between January 2024 and July 2024 at psychiatric outpatient departments within Pakistan. The Indus Medical College Hospital issued approval (040325-45-MS). Determination of sample size was conducted using an Open API version 3.0.0 that recommended a total sample of 100 participants (60 patients and 40 healthy controls) to achieve the 80% power at a 0.05 significance level while assuming a moderate effect size (Cohen&#x02019;s d = 0.5). Patients were classified into two disease groups: 30 with schizophrenia and 30 with. Controls were age and gender matched individuals who didn&#x02019;t have any psychiatric or inflammatory comorbidities. Clinical diagnosis occurred through interviews conducted by psychiatrists aligned with DSM-5 standards. The participants signed written consents that authorized their involvement in the study. Participants needed to fit the following requirements for inclusion: Adults aged 18-50 years, DSM-5 diagnosis of schizophrenia or MDD (for patient groups), stable medication regimen for &#x02265;6 weeks (if applicable), and no comorbid neurological, autoimmune, or infectious diseases.</p><p>The study excluded patients who had: a history of traumatic brain injury, substance abuse, or non-psychiatric systemic illnesses, used immunomodulatory drugs (e.g., steroids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)) within the past 3 months, and healthy controls with any lifetime psychiatric diagnosis. The research team performed complete assessments on each subject through the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) for schizophrenia and the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) for MDD symptom evaluation, together with demographic surveys (including age, gender, and other socioeconomic indicators). While fasting in early mornings, researchers measured pro-inflammatory cytokines: IL-6, TNF-&#x003b1;, and IL-1&#x003b2; through ELISA tests for blood serum collected from each participant. SPSS version 25 was used to analyze the data collection. Descriptive statistics were employed to summarize baseline characteristics. All groups underwent independent t-tests to measure cytokine differences, but Pearson&#x02019;s correlation method analyzed the connection between cytokine levels and symptom severity scores. The authors used one-way ANOVA with Tukey&#x02019;s post-hoc test to study comparisons between groups with a statistically significant threshold at a p-value lower than 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>A research sample of 100 participants was taken that consisted of 30 individuals who received a diagnosis of schizophrenia and 30 patients who received a diagnosis of MDD, while 40 were controls.

Research indicated that schizophrenia and MDD patients had higher levels of IL-6, TNF-&#x003b1;, and IL-1&#x003b2; as compared to healthy controls. These experimental results aligned with the documented evidence of inflammation as an important factor in the development of psychiatric disorders, particularly schizophrenia&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>The associations between the elevated cytokine levels and clinical symptom scores further supported the neuroinflammatory framework. In schizophrenia, IL-6 and TNF-&#x003b1; were positively correlated with PANSS scores while indicating their involvement in symptom severity&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. IL-6 is believed to impair synaptic plasticity and disrupt neurotransmission, while TNF-&#x003b1; may interfere with glial-neuronal communication, both of which were consistent with mechanisms linked to microglial activation. In MDD, IL-6 and IL-1&#x003b2; showed moderate correlations with HAM-D scores. This correlation supported the cytokine hypothesis of depression in which immune signaling was thought to impact serotonin pathways, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, and neuroplasticity&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>The findings established that microglial activation-induced immune dysregulation played a role in creating psychotic symptoms. The inflammatory cytokine levels in MDD patients remained lower than schizophrenia, yet IL-6 and IL-1&#x003b2; showed significant links to depression intensity. The &#x0201c;cytokine hypothesis of depression&#x0201d; received support from these research findings, which showed that peripheral and central immune signaling mechanisms affect mood regulation by potentially causing reduced serotonin availability and dysfunction in both the HPA axis and the processes of neuroplasticity&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The research identified that inflammation is caused regardless of gender and socioeconomic factors when examining brain cytokine concentration. Research findings confirm the presence of male prevalence in schizophrenia, while female patients exceed men in MDD cases because of potential hormonal and psychosocial influences on inflammation.</p><p>Scientists have validated the concept of interspersed yet separate inflammatory processes that link schizophrenia to depression&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="REF15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Schizophrenic inflammation appears to be more severe than depression, but this disorder also exhibits important inflammatory pathways. Research supports the development of psychiatric care approaches that unite immunological assessment together with therapeutic approaches&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>The study design restricts any potential conclusions about cause-and-effect relationships, and cytokine measurements from blood may differ from those found in brain tissue inflammation. The study controlled neither the drug medication impact on cytokine levels nor was able to generalize results beyond limitations in sample size. Furthermore, lifestyle factors such as diet, smoking, or sleep quality were not evaluated, which might have influenced systemic inflammation. Future psychiatric research should use longitudinal study designs and microglial cellular measurement techniques via translocator protein (TSPO) ligand positron emission tomography (PET) scans and must evaluate anti-inflammatory drug effects in treatment procedures.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study demonstrated that schizophrenia and MDD were inflammatory disorders because enhanced IL-6, TNF-&#x003b1;, and IL-1&#x003b2; levels showed direct links to symptom intensity in affected patients. The higher levels of inflammation observed in schizophrenia patients indicated that microglial dysfunction played a significant role in schizophrenia development than in depression cases. The results emphasized the crucial need to use neuroimmune biomarkers both in psychiatric diagnostic approaches and decision-making in treatment development.</p><p>Discovering patterns of psychiatric disorders against inflammation would lead to better intervention strategies, especially when emphasizing neuroinflammation treatments.
