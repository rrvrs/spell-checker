Translation initiation factor 2 (IF2) plays a key role in translation initiation by delivering fMet-tRNA<sup>fMet</sup> to the ribosome forming the pre-initiation complex, and releasing fMet-tRNA<sup>fMet</sup> into the P-site after hydrolyzing its bound GTP, allowing the ribosome to enter translation elongation<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. Despite the important role for IF2 in translation initiation, IF2 contains a small N-terminal subdomain and a large intrinsically disordered region (IDR)<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> which is poorly understood. In addition, <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> cells are known to produce three protein isoforms of IF2<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>, with distinct regions of the IDR truncated, yet all isoforms contain the GTP, tRNA, and fMet binding domains and are all known to be capable of translation initiation activity. Initial work on IF2&#x02019;s IDR established that deletion of the N-terminal IDR led to a cold-sensitive phenotype where <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> cells were unable to grow at 15 &#x000b0;C<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. Additionally, a drug screen targeting ribosome assembly inhibitors found a novel antibiotic candidate, lamotrigine, which bound to the N-terminal IDR and led to a cold-specific inhibition of <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> growth<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. Interestingly, the N-terminal IDR also promotes dsDNA break repair<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>, suggesting that IF2&#x02019;s IDR may be involved in cellular functions outside of translation initiation. Despite these studies, the exact molecular and cellular function(s) of the N-terminal IDR have remained poorly understood.</p><p id="P6">Biomolecular condensates are phase separated membraneless assemblies that typically assemble through the physical process of phase separation<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. Many RNA processes are spatially localized in biomolecular condensates<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>, including rRNA transcription and assembly which occur in the nucleolus<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>, mRNA storage in p-granules<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>, and RNA decay and storage which occur in P-bodies<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>. While some condensates like nucleoli and p-bodies are constitutively present, other condensates such as Ded1P or poly-A binding protein condense during heat shock<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. Stress granules contain stalled translation initiation complexes<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> and condense under a variety of stresses<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> including heat shock, oxidative stress, viral infection, osmotic stress, UV irradiation, or cold shock. Interestingly, eIF2&#x003b1; is known to be a key regulator of the stress granule formation, in which its phosphorylation leads to a shutdown in translation that triggers stress granule condensation and leads to enhanced fitness under stresses like cold shock<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>. Interestingly, biomolecular condensates have been recently discovered in bacteria<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>, and are involved in many in RNA processes<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>, with RNAP condensates corresponding to rRNA transcription<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>, BR-bodies promoting mRNA decay<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>, and Hfq condensates involved in mRNA/sRNA regulation and chromatin compaction<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>. Importantly, biomolecular condensate phase separation is often driven by intrinsically disordered regions making multi-valent protein-protein, protein-RNA, and RNA-RNA interactions<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup>. However, no bacterial biomolecular condensates have been discovered whose phase separation is driven by the translation machinery.</p><p id="P7">To investigate bacterial IF2&#x02019;s potential for phase separation, we investigated the N-terminal IDR and found that it is present across most bacteria and is predicted to phase separate in a majority of species by DeePhase or fuzdrop algorithms. Purified <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">C. crescentus</italic> IF2 phase separate with total RNA at 25&#x000b0;C, and the N-terminal IDR drives phase separation of these proteins, suggesting the ability to drive phase separation is broadly conserved. We found that ribosomes and initiator tRNA were able to prevent IF2 phase separation and dissolve IF2 condensates. We find that cold temperature (4&#x000b0;C) could strongly promote IF2 phase separation which requires the IDR, and that reversible IF2 foci were observed <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> upon cold shock at 4&#x000b0;C. Finally, we found that <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> cells lacking the IDR were sensitive to cold shock, suggesting that IF2 condensates protect <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> against adaptation to cold temperatures. Taken together, IF2 condensates are a conserved environmentally responsive condensate that promotes fitness during adaptation to cold temperature with similar properties to eukaryotic stress granules.</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><sec id="S3"><title>Raw data deposition</title><p id="P8">Raw data reported within this manuscript has been uploaded to figshare with DOI: <ext-link xlink:href="10.6084/m9.figshare.27624369" ext-link-type="doi">10.6084/m9.figshare.27624369</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Plasmid construction</title><sec id="S5"><title><italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> plasmid construction</title><sec id="S6"><title>pET-MBP-TEV-His-infB-Ec</title><p id="P9">The <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> IF2 gene was inserted into the pET-MBP-TEV-His vector using SspI and HindIII restriction sites.

IF2 phase separated without RNA above a concentration of 5 &#x003bc;M, and we observed that the addition of total RNA reduced the critical concentration of IF2&#x02019;s observed phase separation.

To investigate whether IF2&#x02019;s N-terminal IDR promotes fitness during cold shock, we grew cultures of <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> expressing a single copy of either full length IF2 or IF2&#x00394;NTD from a plasmid<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> at 37&#x000b0;C, and subjected the cells to 1-hour cold shocks at 4&#x000b0;C, &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C, or &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4D</xref>). Upon growth at 37&#x000b0;C, we observed no difference between the two strains. Upon cold-shock, we noticed that the IF2&#x00394;NTD strain showed a significant reduction in fitness compared to the IF2 strain that was small at 4&#x000b0;C but grew bigger at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C and was large at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C. As the severity of cold-shock increased, we observed a decrease in CFU&#x02019;s in the IF2&#x00394;NTD strain relative to IF2, suggesting that the N-terminal IDR promotes fitness to <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> cells during cold shock. In the same genetic system, it was previously established that the IF2&#x00394;NTD was unable to grow at 15&#x000b0;C<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. As IDR length varied significantly across species, we explored whether the N-terminal IDR length varied across different species with distinct optimal growth temperatures. Therefore, we collected a set of IF2s derived from psychrophile and thermophile bacteria and calculated their IDR lengths (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4E</xref>). Here we observed that psychrophiles tended to have longer IDRs, while thermophiles have much shorter IDRs, in-line with our experimentally derived role in promoting fitness at lower temperatures in <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S54"><title>Discussion:</title><p id="P65">The N-terminal IDR of bacterial IF2 is capable of driving phase separation with cellular RNA into a biomolecular condensate, suggesting a conserved molecular function of the IDR. Interestingly, IF2 IDRs tend to share low sequence identity, with <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">C. crescentus</italic> IF2s sharing only 40.8% amino acid identity, yet they are both capable of phase separation. Across bacteria, most IF2 sequences are predicted to have the capacity to phase separate by deePhase<sup><xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> or fuzdrop<sup><xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> algorithms, so it will be important to investigate the molecular and functional properties of IF2 condensates across species.</p><p id="P66">Bacterial IF2 condensates share many similarities with cold-induced eukaryotic stress granules<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>, suggesting they may play a similar functional role across domains. Unlike constitutive bacterial condensates like BR-bodies<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>, IF2 condensates are not present at normal growth temperature, but are induced by a shift to cold temperature<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>. Based upon the genetic system established in <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> cells<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>, we have found that IF2 has enhanced phase separation in the cold, and that IF2 condensates appear to protect <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> cells during adaptation to the cold (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>), where the N-terminal IDR was found to be required for growth at cold temperatures<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. Interestingly, phosphorylation of eIF2&#x003b1; by the integrated stress response triggering reduced translation is important for eukaryotic stress granule formation<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></sup>, placing IF2 as a key player in bacteria and eukaryote cold-induced condensates. Interestingly, bacterial IF2 is encoded by a single protein, while in eukaryotes it is encoded by three separate protein subunits (eIF2&#x003b1;, eIF2&#x003b2;, and eIF2&#x003b3;). While eukaryotic stress granules are induced by the cold, they can also be induced by other stresses including heat shock, oxidative stress, viral infection, osmotic stress, and UV irradiation<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. Therefore, an important goal will be to determine whether bacterial IF2 condensates are induced by similar stresses and whether they promote fitness across stresses. It is well established that cold-shock in <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> leads to a strong reduction in translation<sup><xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref></sup>, and an important goal moving forward will be to determine whether IF2 condensation is involved in the translation shutdown during adaptation to the cold. In line with their role in the cold, we observed that IF2&#x02019;s IDR length is significantly reduced in thermophiles (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4E</xref>). While the RNA composition of cold-induced IF2 condensates is not yet known, an important goal will be to identify which cellular RNAs and proteins are contained in IF2 condensates. Interestingly, lamotrigine, a novel antibiotic candidate, has been found to already bind to the N-terminal IDR and selectively inhibit <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> growth in the cold<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. This suggests IF2 condensates present a promising target for the development of next-generation antibiotics.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM1"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="SD1" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>Supplement 1</label><media xlink:href="media-1.pdf" id="d67e1136" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S56"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p id="P68">NIH NIGMS grant R35GM124733 and IU startup funds to JMS.
