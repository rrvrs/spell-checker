As dementia is characterized by substantial and irreversible neurological damage, early detection and prevention is paramount. Accordingly, dementia prevention research has spurred an increase in studies aimed at capturing the transitory, pre-clinical phase of dementia. Diagnostic criteria for various cognitive impairment classifications, such as Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and Cognitive Impairment, No Dementia (CIND) have been developed in order to describe this state between normal cognition (NC) and dementia, in which cognitive decline is present beyond what is expected of normal aging but does not yet meet a dementia diagnosis (<xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">Petersen, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="ref62" ref-type="bibr">Welstead et&#x000a0;al., 2021</xref>). Such classifications are characterized by objective deficits in cognitive abilities that do not impact functional independence (<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">Canevelli et&#x000a0;al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">Moradi et&#x000a0;al., 2021</xref>). Whereas MCI typically requires impaired objective test performance <italic toggle="yes">and</italic> a subjective complaint of cognitive decline, CIND classifications typically require impaired test performance <italic toggle="yes">or</italic> a subjective complaint (<xref rid="ref46" ref-type="bibr">Plassman et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>). However, the criteria defining MCI and CIND have become synonymous over time, with each frequently classified using cognitive test performance in addition to a self or informant complaint. It is estimated that ~10&#x02013;20% of individuals over the age of 65 experience MCI/CIND (<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">Katayama et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">Makino et&#x000a0;al., 2021</xref>); however, long-term outcomes following classifications are heterogeneous.</p><p>Although originally conceptualized as diagnostic tools to identify those at risk of developing dementia, MCI/CIND represent nonlinear and unstable entities that do not always lead to imminent dementia. In a meta-analysis consisting of 41 studies, <xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">Mitchell and Shiri-Feshki (2009)</xref> reported an annual conversion rate from MCI to dementia of ~5&#x02013;10%, with many individuals demonstrating no progression even after a 10-year follow-up. The researchers further reported that the annual conversion rate from MCI specifically to Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease (<sc>ad</sc>) is ~7%, and even fewer&#x02014;approximately 2%&#x02014;convert to vascular dementia. In contrast, ~37&#x02013;67% of all MCI cases remain stable MCI without progressing (<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">Pandya et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, a substantial number of individuals with MCI fail to either convert to dementia or even remain MCI at a subsequent time point (<xref rid="ref59" ref-type="bibr">Vandermorris et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>); instead, research frequently reveals high rates of <italic toggle="yes">reversion</italic> from MCI back to NC (<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">Aerts et&#x000a0;al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">Malek-Ahmadi, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">Overton et&#x000a0;al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">Pandya et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="ref64" ref-type="bibr">Xue et&#x000a0;al., 2019</xref>). Thus, while it is true that some individuals classified as MCI/CIND will develop dementia, many will remain consistently MCI/CIND or even revert back to NC.</p></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>VARIABILITY IN REVERSION RATES</title><p>A wealth of recent longitudinal studies confirm the common occurrence of reversion from MCI/CIND to NC; however, the estimated prevalence rates of reversion are highly variable. Higher reversion rates are documented in community-based compared to clinic-based cohorts (<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">Manly et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>), as those in clinic-based samples tend to have greater cognitive impairment and increased likelihood of progressing, therefore generating lower reversion rates (<xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">Petersen et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>). Previous meta-analyses report reversion rates of ~25&#x02013;30% in community-based studies, 8&#x02013;14% in clinic-based studies, and 18&#x02013;24% when combining the two populations (<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">Canevelli et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">Malek-Ahmadi, 2016</xref>). However, such results are inconsistent in the wider literature. For example, <xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">Ganguli et&#x000a0;al. (2011)</xref> reported that reversion in community-based studies ranged anywhere from ~6&#x02013;53% over the course of 1 year.</p><p>Several other factors may impact reversion rates such that MCI/CIND instability may be due to a variety of subject-based factors (e.g., individual differences in demographics, depression, fatigue at time of testing), diagnostic criteria (e.g., number and type of tests used, cut-off score variations), or study-based factors (e.g., practice effects, measurement error; <xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">Malek-Ahmadi, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">Moradi et&#x000a0;al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="ref52" ref-type="bibr">Shimada et&#x000a0;al., 2019</xref>). Reversion may thus be due to true recovery of illness or neuroplasticity, issues in testing, definition, or individual factors impacting cognitive function such as sleep or nutritional deficits, affect, social anxiety, and more (<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">Canevelli et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">Moradi et&#x000a0;al., 2021</xref>). Altogether, conventional classifications such as MCI and CIND&#x02014;with the intended purpose of predicting dementia progression&#x02014;are highly susceptible to false positives (<xref rid="ref52" ref-type="bibr">Shimada et&#x000a0;al., 2019</xref>) and may not be indicative of progressive neuropathology. Due to these discrepancies, the prognostic and clinical value of such classifications have been questioned.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>SCOPE FOR IMPROVEMENT</title><p>In comparison to the large number of studies that examine predictors of progression, few have focused on such predictors of reversion, and factors related to cognitive impairment stability remain poorly understood (<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">Pandya et&#x000a0;al., 2017</xref>). Additional studies are needed to understand MCI/CIND stability across longer temporal periods as previous studies have primarily assessed individuals over the course of 1 (e.g., <xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">Diniz et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">Ganguli et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">Kang et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">Moradi et&#x000a0;al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="ref55" ref-type="bibr">Thomas et&#x000a0;al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="ref57" ref-type="bibr">Tokuchi et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>) or 2 years (e.g., <xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">Baiyewu et&#x000a0;al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="ref50" ref-type="bibr">Sachdev et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>), which is likely not long enough to identify classification stability and whether individuals are truly experiencing persistent, pathological cognitive impairment. In the evolution of dementia, one to two follow-up studies are fallible to misinterpreting both the risk of reversion and conversion, and may obscure the identification of slowly progressing conditions or milder forms of impairment (<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">Aretouli et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>). It is therefore recommended that researchers follow MCI/CIND trajectories for a prolonged temporal period, as the pathological cognitive decline&#x02014;despite the prolonged prodromal phase of dementia&#x02014;typically becomes detectable and accelerates after ~4 to 6 years (<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">Hall et&#x000a0;al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">Pandya et&#x000a0;al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="ref63" ref-type="bibr">Wilson et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Additionally, although some studies have indeed employed longer study durations, they remain constrained by the number of follow-up assessments&#x02014;generally examining individuals only once, or seldom twice, following their baseline assessment. A limited number of studies (e.g., <xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">Aerts et&#x000a0;al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">Bielak et&#x000a0;al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">Overton et&#x000a0;al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="ref49" ref-type="bibr">Roberts et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="ref51" ref-type="bibr">Sanz-Blasco et&#x000a0;al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="ref62" ref-type="bibr">Welstead et&#x000a0;al., 2021</xref>) have evaluated long-term trajectories of MCI/CIND using multiple repeated assessments. Multiple assessments are advantageous to detect the shape of change, distinguish measurement error from true change (<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">Aretouli et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="ref53" ref-type="bibr">Singer &#x00026; Willett, 2003</xref>), and detect fluctuations between classifications. For instance, longitudinal repeated measures studies reveal notable fluctuations in cognitive status over time, whereby a substantial proportion (24&#x02013;29%) of individuals who reverted to NC later transitioned back to MCI/CIND status at a subsequent assessment (<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">Bielak et&#x000a0;al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">Overton et&#x000a0;al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="ref54" ref-type="bibr">Sugarman et&#x000a0;al., 2018</xref>). Importantly, individuals who fluctuate between classifications have been previously documented as more prone to dementia progression (<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">Koepsell &#x00026; Monsell, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">Lopez et&#x000a0;al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="ref49" ref-type="bibr">Roberts et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>). In fact, <xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">Petersen (2011)</xref> suggests that unstable MCI may represent a pre-condition that will manifest into stable MCI with time. Thus, research remains inconclusive regarding 1) whether individuals classified as stable MCI/CIND stay that way for a long time, and 2) whether individuals who revert to NC remain NC if followed for long enough (<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">Pandya et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>). Ultimately, changes in MCI/CIND status may be missed if 1) stability is characterized based on a single follow-up, 2) too much time has passed without an evaluation, or 3) individuals are not followed for long enough to track long-term outcomes. All told, instability and fluidity between MCI/CIND classifications can jeopardize the utility and validity of the framework, and additional research is required if they are to be deemed sound constructs that can identify individuals at risk of future dementia. Individuals should be followed for several years using multiple repeated assessments to better understand transitions between MCI/CIND and NC, and to accurately identify factors associated with true stability in order to provide a framework for future identification and prevention for at-risk individuals.</p></sec><sec id="sec6"><title>THE CURRENT STUDY</title><p>There is a pressing need to enhance the understanding of cognitive impairment classification stability, the non-linear and long-term trajectories, and differences amongst stability predictors, in order to clarify and increase accuracy of the pre-clinical intermittent classification between NC and dementia. Using six-year longitudinal data, the current study sought to gain a better understanding of CIND classification stability across time in order to further its clinical utility as a classification tool. The objectives were to i) explore patterns of longitudinal stability in cognitive status across multiple assessments, and ii) investigate whether select baseline variables could predict 6-year cognitive status stability patterns.</p><p>It was anticipated that the overall reversion rates (from CIND to NC) would be higher compared to rates typically reported for clinical populations, but likely lower compared to other community-based reversion studies, as the current study disaggregated those who fluctuated from those who reverted. It was also expected that several patterns of stability (i.e., reversion, stability, progression, fluctuation) would be revealed across the 6 years of study. Such patterns would demonstrate the high levels of instability in CIND classifications and provide preliminary information on the optimal follow-up duration required to identify true CIND stability. Additionally, several baseline predictors were expected to significantly differentiate patterns of stability. In particular, age was hypothesized to significantly predict CIND stability subgroups, such that those who were younger would be more likely to fluctuate or revert in their cognitive status. Further, it was hypothesized that depressive symptoms would be significantly associated with CIND outcomes as depressive symptoms can result in lower cognitive test scores and MCI misclassifications (<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">Ganguli et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">Overton et&#x000a0;al., 2019</xref>). However, no specific directional hypotheses were made for depressive symptoms as depression has been associated with stability (<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">Pandya et&#x000a0;al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="ref54" ref-type="bibr">Sugarman et&#x000a0;al., 2018</xref>), reversion (<xref rid="ref62" ref-type="bibr">Welstead et&#x000a0;al., 2021</xref>), as well as <sc>ad</sc> progression (<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">Modrego &#x00026; Ferr&#x000e1;ndez, 2004</xref>). It was also hypothesized that baseline CIND severity (single- vs. multi-domain impairment) would significantly predict subgroup membership. Specifically, those classified as CIND-S (based on impairment in a single cognitive domain) were predicted to have a higher likelihood of reversion and/or fluctuation, whereas those classified as CIND-M (impairment in multiple cognitive domains) were predicted to have a higher likelihood of CIND stability. Such findings would corroborate previous research demonstrating the more labile, unstable nature of single- compared to multi-domain impairment (e.g., <xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">Diniz et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">Loewenstein et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="ref48" ref-type="bibr">Ritchie &#x00026; Tuokko, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="ref50" ref-type="bibr">Sachdev et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>). Finally, it was hypothesized that educational attainment and/or premorbid IQ would be negatively associated with CIND stability, providing support for cognitive reserve theory.</p></sec><sec id="sec7"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="sec8"><title>Participants</title><p>The current study examined archival data from Project Mental Inconsistency in Normals and Dementia (MIND), a longitudinal repeated measures study assessing cognitive change in community-dwelling older adults. Project MIND was approved by the University of Victoria Human Research Ethics Board and was conducted in accordance with institutional guidelines. Participants resided in Victoria, <sc>bc</sc>, and were recruited through local media advertisements soliciting volunteers who were concerned about their cognitive functioning but had not been diagnosed with a neurological disorder. Initial exclusion criteria included physician-diagnosed dementia or an MMSE (<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">Folstein et&#x000a0;al., 1975</xref>) score less than 24, current psychiatric diagnosis, psychotropic drug use, drug or alcohol abuse, a history of significant head injury (e.g., loss of consciousness), other neurological or major medical illnesses (e.g., Parkinson&#x02019;s disease, cancer), severe sensory impairment (e.g., difficulty hearing a normal conversation, difficulty reading newspaper-size print), and a lack of English language fluency.

Baseline testing included a group testing session conducted at the University of Victoria to collect demographic and health data, and an individual testing session conducted in the participant&#x02019;s home. Within these independent sessions, participants completed various assessments to measure performance across several health domains (e.g., cognitive, psychosocial, physiological). The entire testing battery was repeated annually four times (i.e., Years 1&#x02013;4), followed by a single follow-up assessment at Year 6 to evaluate change in cognitive status. During each annual testing wave, the measures were identical and the order of presentation did not vary. See <xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">MacDonald and Stawski (2020)</xref> for a full account of Project MIND, including the incorporation of an intensive repeated measures burst design involving weekly assessments within a given year. Attrition rates for the entire sample (N&#x02009;=&#x02009;304) were 11.0%, 3.5%, 4.5%, and 9% between Years 1&#x02013;2, 2&#x02013;3, 3&#x02013;4, and 4&#x02013;6, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="sec10"><title>Measures</title><sec id="sec11"><title>Cognitive status</title><p>CIND status was derived psychometrically each year according to participant&#x02019;s performance on five cognitive tasks.

Participants were classified as NC or CIND based upon deficits spanning the five distinct cognitive domains; subjects were classified as CIND if they scored at or below 1.5 SDs relative to age- and education-matched peers on any of the cognitive tasks. Age- and education-based norms were derived from an external sample of 445 adults, aged 65 to 94&#x000a0;years, from the Victoria Longitudinal Study (<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">Dixon &#x00026; de Frias, 2004</xref>).

Despite latent class analysis typically preceding the use of LTA, the current study utilized the formerly derived CIND status subgroups (i.e., NC or CIND) as the categorical latent variables for each annual assessment. LTA tests the hypothesis of &#x0201c;no change between time-points,&#x0201d; which assumes that status membership at time 2 is the same as status membership at time 1 (<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">Lanza et&#x000a0;al., 2010</xref>).

The primary findings show high rates of both reversion and fluctuation in CIND status. Additionally, logistic regression analyses with odds ratios identified baseline CIND severity and premorbid IQ as predictors of future CIND stability patterns.</p><sec id="sec21"><title>Patterns of CIND stability across years</title><p>In this community-based sample, 68% of those classified as CIND at Year 1 reverted from CIND back to NC at some point across the 6-year study. However, the majority of these individuals eventually transitioned back to CIND at a later assessment&#x02014;highlighting the evident occurrence of CIND status fluctuation. In fact, the most common long-term stability pattern for those classified as CIND at baseline was indeed fluctuation, with 38% fluctuating between CIND and NC. Similar results were reported by <xref rid="ref54" ref-type="bibr">Sugarman et&#x000a0;al. (2018)</xref> in which 29% of individuals who reverted eventually transitioned back to MCI at a follow-up assessment. Such findings suggest that those who improve in their cognitive status remain at risk of re-transitioning to CIND if followed for long enough. Furthermore, fluctuation was apparent not only for those classified as CIND at baseline, but also for those classified as NC, generating a 26% fluctuation rate for the entire sample of older adults. This is an important finding as few studies have followed individuals for long enough to account for such fluctuations, and instability/fluidity in the literature is likely underestimated. Correspondingly, the current study&#x02019;s true reversion rate (i.e., reverted to NC and stayed NC) was 30%. This is consistent with previous meta-analyses that report reversion rates of ~25&#x02013;30% in community-based studies (<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">Canevelli et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">Malek-Ahmadi, 2016</xref>). However, this was higher than predicted; it was expected that the rate of reversion would be lower given that the current study separately considered and extracted those who fluctuated from those who reverted. Further, Project MIND is composed of a relatively healthy sample, and it was anticipated that initial CIND classification would reflect stable pathological cognitive impairment rather than momentary poor cognitive performance due to external factors such as socioeconomic status. For instance, <xref rid="ref62" ref-type="bibr">Welstead et&#x000a0;al. (2021)</xref> followed a comparatively healthy sample for 6 years and reported a 7% reversion rate. Nonetheless, the current high reversion rate suggests that CIND may not represent the prodromal stage of dementia and provides further justification for continued research on factors associated with CIND reversion versus stability.</p><p>Previous studies have predominately examined cognitive impairment stability by employing a 1-year study period and/or a single follow-up assessment that is likely to produce more inaccurate stability patterns. The current study demonstrated that most transitions between cognitive statuses occurred at Years 2 and 3 (i.e., 1- and 2-years following baseline assessment). Due to these transitions, cognitive status classifications by Year 4 were the least comparable to Year 1 classifications, suggesting that CIND status is likely to be unstable for at least 4 years following baseline assessment. In fact, 51% of those classified as CIND at baseline were no longer classified as CIND at Year 4. Such findings may explain the large range of reversion rates reported in the literature, as transitions from CIND to NC occur at disparate points in time. The present findings also corroborate previous research demonstrating that a substantial portion of individuals classified as CIND (and synonymous classifications) will fluctuate in their cognitive status, reverting back to NC at subsequent assessments. Such variability in CIND classifications may disrupt the development of effective interventions for individuals with dementia, as inclusion of those who are on a reverting trajectory in research and clinical trials can bias findings (<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">de Jager &#x00026; Budge, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="ref54" ref-type="bibr">Sugarman et&#x000a0;al., 2018</xref>). Predicting stable CIND&#x02014;representing an at-risk subgroup&#x02014;across time may thus improve clinical trial research and the interpretation of results. Given the findings of the current study, and consistent with previous recommendations (see <xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">Pandya et&#x000a0;al., 2017</xref>), it is suggested that researchers and clinicians assess individuals annually for at least 4 years in order to better determine and detect CIND stability.</p></sec><sec id="sec22"><title>Predictors of CIND stability outcomes</title><p>Neither age nor sex (as independent predictors) were significantly associated with increased likelihood of reverting, progressing, or fluctuating relative to CIND stability. This is in contrast to expectations in which age specifically was predicted to be associated with stability outcomes; previous studies have demonstrated that younger ages are more likely to recover from MCI back to NC (<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">Gao et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="ref64" ref-type="bibr">Xue et&#x000a0;al., 2019</xref>), the prevalence of CIND classifications increase with age (<xref rid="ref46" ref-type="bibr">Plassman et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>), and older age is associated with increased incidence of progression from MCI to <sc>ad</sc> (<xref rid="ref64" ref-type="bibr">Xue et&#x000a0;al., 2019</xref>). However, the current findings are consistent with other research also reporting no significant differences between MCI stability and reversion for age (<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">Hu et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="ref50" ref-type="bibr">Sachdev et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>) or sex (<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">Gao et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">Hu et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>).

In their study, <xref rid="ref48" ref-type="bibr">Ritchie and Tuokko (2010)</xref> reported that, while other CIND classifications (e.g., amnestic vs. non-amnestic CIND) demonstrated poor sensitivity for dementia conversion, CIND-M was the only diagnostic criteria to significantly predict dementia 5 years later. The current study provides additional evidence that future stability in CIND status may be better predicted when the initial classification is derived from assessment of multiple cognitive domains (<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">Han et&#x000a0;al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="ref48" ref-type="bibr">Ritchie &#x00026; Tuokko, 2010</xref>).</p><p>It has been suggested that individuals who are more variable in their cognitive course may be at higher risk of dementia progression, such that CIND fluctuation may represent an underlying pathological precondition (<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">Lopez et&#x000a0;al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">Pandya et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">Petersen, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="ref49" ref-type="bibr">Roberts et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>). However, a final follow-up investigation revealed that the majority (72.4%) of those classified as CIND Fluctuaters were classified as CIND-S at baseline. Likewise, 73.9% of those classified as Reverters were also CIND-S at baseline. Therefore, it is likely that this fluctuation group was not a result of an underlying mechanism that will lead to eventual pathological cognitive decline, but rather a result of the transient, labile nature of CIND-S classifications (e.g., due to factors such as lifelong low performance). Classifying cognitive impairment based on poor performance on a single cognitive task may misclassify low-performing but otherwise cognitively intact participants (<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">Brodaty et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>). While CIND-S is subject to fluctuations and reversions, producing diagnostic (and prognostic) ambiguity, CIND-M classifications may be indicative of &#x0201c;at-risk&#x0201d; individuals experiencing true pathological decline. In effect, CIND classifications could be maximized by considering CIND severity at initial assessment such that multi-domain impairment should be warranted in the initial classification criteria.</p><p>We further recommend that future research investigate whether specific neuropsychological domains&#x02014;such as processing speed, vocabulary, and episodic memory (including immediate vs. delayed recall measures) &#x02014;contribute unique predictive value for CIND stability and dementia progression, especially within the framework of CIND-M classifications. A comprehensive understanding of the domains that most reliably indicate stable impairment will enhance the precision of prognostic assessments for individuals vulnerable to cognitive pathology. Moreover, adopting a &#x0201c;comprehensive criteria&#x0201d; approach (see <xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">Jak et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>), which requires multiple measures of impairment <italic toggle="yes">within</italic> a given cognitive domain, may further refine stability classifications and increase the clinical relevance of CIND assessments. Notably, this discrepancy&#x02014;where academic researchers often classify cross-domain multi-impairment whereas clinicians and clinical researchers emphasize within-domain multi-impairment&#x02014;may be a key factor contributing to the significant variations in stability and reversion rates reported in the literature. That is, classifying and examining multiple indicators of impairment within cognitive domains may potentially enhance the consistency of stability and reversion findings across studies but also improve the clinical utility of CIND classifications, making them more reliable and applicable in both research and practice.</p></sec><sec id="sec24"><title>Cognitive reserve metrics for predicting stability</title><p>Higher educational attainment has been previously associated with recovery from MCI to NC and it has been proposed that individuals with higher education levels may better understand and implement health knowledge and lead healthier lifestyles, thereby reducing MCI risk (<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">Pandya et&#x000a0;al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="ref64" ref-type="bibr">Xue et&#x000a0;al., 2019</xref>). However, educational attainment within the current study&#x02014;although significantly differentiating baseline cognitive status&#x02014;was not associated with stability outcomes. In contrast, premorbid IQ was significantly associated with increased likelihood of being classified as Fluctuaters and Progressers relative to Stable CIND. This is consistent with <xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">Osone et&#x000a0;al. (2016)</xref> who similarly found that, while years of education did not significantly differentiate MCI subgroups, premorbid IQ was significantly higher in those who reverted. It was suggested that, compared to premorbid IQ&#x02014;a more sensitive measure of cognitive reserve&#x02014;educational attainment may have limited variance and is thus less sensitive to detecting an effect. The results suggest that higher baseline premorbid IQ may delay or protect against recurrent CIND classification due to cognitive reserve. Individuals with greater reserve are posited to have a greater defense against the cognitive decline process prior to reaching a diagnosis threshold (<xref rid="ref50" ref-type="bibr">Sachdev et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>). For instance, in the current study, individuals were more likely to delay their CIND classification (i.e., be classified as NC at baseline) and progress at a later assessment compared to being classified as CIND at Year 1 (i.e., Stable CIND), independent of age or sex differences. Overall, higher baseline premorbid IQ, denoting greater cognitive reserve, may have exhibited protective effects against stable cognitive impairment. However, few studies have examined premorbid IQ and further research should explore this variable as an important predictor of long-term CIND stability.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec25"><title>Clinical and practical considerations</title><p>There is a pressing need for ongoing dementia prevention studies and methods for predicting those at risk of pathological decline. While dementia detection may be facilitated by the identification and quantification of select biomarkers (e.g., B-amyloid, tau-proteins) and neuroimaging techniques, these can be costly and invasive. Alternatively, routine screening for CIND status may represent a non-invasive and inexpensive tool for dementia detection. The identification of an at-risk group may contribute to early detection strategies for slowing cognitive decline. Early intervention of dementia&#x02014;before prominent neuronal damage and notable symptomatology occurs&#x02014;is generally viewed as most effective (<xref rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr">Pike et&#x000a0;al., 2022</xref>), and impairment in multiple cognitive domains may represent an early and reliable marker for pathological impairment. The identification of individuals more likely to show positive outcomes (i.e., reversion) can also benefit the healthcare system by better allocating health resources; CIND stability information may inform decisions about the frequency of future contact (e.g., decrease transitory CIND-related visits) and the necessary monitoring required. Focused attention can thus be given to those who exhibit adverse trajectories (i.e., CIND stability) which may decrease burden for individuals, care-partners, and the larger healthcare system (<xref rid="ref46" ref-type="bibr">Plassman et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Additionally, a false positive CIND classification, while not a formal diagnosis, can cause considerable anxiety and feelings of uncertainty. Misclassifications may also lead to additional unintended negative consequences including stigmatization, discrimination (<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">Canevelli et&#x000a0;al., 2017</xref>), and can alter people&#x02019;s self-perceptions as well as life decisions (e.g., moving, retiring, looking into care facilities; <xref rid="ref55" ref-type="bibr">Thomas et&#x000a0;al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, if CIND is viewed as an imminent, unavoidable dementia indicator, then it may trigger the start of targeted yet unnecessary and potentially harmful treatment, particularly if pharmaceuticals are involved (<xref rid="ref54" ref-type="bibr">Sugarman et&#x000a0;al., 2018</xref>). However, rather than viewing CIND as an irreversible state leading to imminent dementia, the current study lends further support to the supposition that CIND&#x02014;in particular, CIND-S&#x02014;is a reversible, labile state. Illuminating the inherent instability in CIND classifications, even as long as 6 years following baseline assessment, demonstrates the heterogeneity in long-term outcomes and may help reduce over-diagnosis, stigma, anxiety, and over-medicalization. Further, identifying factors associated with future CIND stability may allow clinicians to better predict those at risk of dementia, as well as better inform their patients by providing a realistic prognosis and treatment recommendations.</p></sec><sec id="sec26"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>The current study has several notable strengths including the study duration and number of repeated assessments; the four follow-up assessments (in addition to the initial baseline assessment) and the extensive 6-year study duration affords a more comprehensive investigation and understanding of CIND stability. Second, the current sample is composed of a relatively homogenous population of healthy individuals residing in the same geographical area. Thus, participants likely have similar life experiences such as education and socioeconomic status; using an alternatively heterogeneous sample to investigate CIND status stability would likely impact the accuracy of results and make predictions less precise (<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">Pandya et&#x000a0;al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, the sample homogeneity is ideal for modeling aging characteristics, as a broader and more diverse sample may complicate analyses due to cohort effects (<xref rid="ref62" ref-type="bibr">Welstead et&#x000a0;al., 2021</xref>). Third, the use of a community-based sample is advantageous to avoid the inherent cognitively impaired selection bias of clinic-based samples and is more representative of the general public (<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">Ganguli et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="ref48" ref-type="bibr">Ritchie &#x00026; Tuokko, 2010</xref>). It has also been suggested that validating research criteria at the community level may be beneficial prior to incorporating into clinical practice (<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">Ganguli et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>). Fourth, whereas the majority of studies within this literature have examined the recovery <italic toggle="yes">rate</italic> of MCI to NC but not recovery <italic toggle="yes">factors</italic> (<xref rid="ref64" ref-type="bibr">Xue et&#x000a0;al., 2019</xref>), the present study examined predictive factors for reversion as well as progression and fluctuation, relative to stability. Additionally, the current study is amongst the few that has examined the protective role of cognitive reserve in the context of MCI/CIND stability, and amongst the few specifically examining CIND stability. That is, the limited existing research on instability predominately leverages MCI classifications, despite the potential value of exploring other classifications; given the heterogeneous reversion rates reported in the literature, it is important to study different definitions to help increase overall clinical utility.</p><p>However, the current study is not without limitations. First, despite the strengths of the healthy and homogenous sample, this may also restrict generalizability to the larger population. Nevertheless, although the sample was Caucasian, a previous CIND study reported no significant association between race and the incidence of CIND or dementia (<xref rid="ref46" ref-type="bibr">Plassman et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>). A second limitation is the small cell sizes of CIND outcomes. Despite the reasonably large initial sample size, restricting analyses to those with three or more assessments and subsequently dividing the sample into different CIND stability outcomes resulted in smaller cell sizes that may have limited power to detect effects. Third, the current study was not able to determine which individuals eventually transitioned from CIND to dementia. Thus, although it is speculated that those who remained stable CIND represent an &#x0201c;at risk&#x0201d; group, it was ultimately not possible to confirm this. Additionally, while symptoms consistent with depressive mood were utilized to delineate depressive symptoms, this operationalization may inherently limit the depth of our understanding. Future investigations should hence examine the predictive role of depression on CIND stability by employing more established and validated depression assessment tools. Finally, the CIND outcomes were not fully validated as participants were not formally evaluated by a clinician. Whereas the neuropsychological measures were selected to broadly capture a continuum of cognitive functioning in a community-based sample, the absence of additional domain-specific tasks (such as semantic fluency, delayed recall, and visuospatial measures) may limit the sensitivity and comprehensiveness of clinical CIND classifications. Although subjects were recruited based on an expressed subjective concern about their cognitive functioning (a common criteria used in clinical assessments of CIND), and the use of objective cognitive tests has shown to be relatively accurate and robust (<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">Malek-Ahmadi, 2016</xref>), future research should include and investigate the impact of domain-specific cognitive tasks to enhance the detection and characterization of cognitive impairment.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec27"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Cognitive impairment classifications such as CIND are characterized by prognostic and clinical heterogeneity. The current study exemplifies the considerable variability that exists across long-term outcomes, with several individuals reverting or fluctuating in their cognitive status across time. However, the relatively small number of individuals who remained stable CIND over the course of the study may provide important evidence for the identification of risk and protective factors, as well as implications for future research and targeted clinical management. The primary findings suggest that most individuals are unstable in their cognitive status for several years following baseline assessment, and factors such as cognitive reserve may delay or protect against detectable cognitive impairment. Moreover, considering cognitive impairment severity (i.e., single- vs. multi-domain impairment) at the time of initial classification may improve CIND classifications. Due to the large number of individuals living with CIND or dementia, and the projected increase in these numbers, even modest improvements in early detection or prevention procedures can have long and lasting impacts on the healthcare system and quality of life.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="acae107-ack"><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We thank the volunteer participants of Project MIND for their time and efforts.
