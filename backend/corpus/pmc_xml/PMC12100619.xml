Changes in NfL are generally assumed to reflect changes in neuronal damage, while little is known about the clearance of NfL from biofluids. In a study of asymptomatic individuals at risk for prion disease, both blood and CSF NfL spiked in one participant following a 6-week course of minocycline, absent any other biomarker changes and without subsequent onset of symptoms. We subsequently observed high NfL after minocycline treatment in discarded clinical plasma samples from inpatients, in mouse plasma and in conditioned media from neuron&#x02013;microglia co-cultures. The specificity and kinetics of NfL response lead us to hypothesize that minocycline does not cause or exacerbate neuronal damage, but instead affects NfL by inhibiting its clearance, posing a potential confounder for the interpretation of this important biomarker.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="teaser"><p>Gentile <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> report that treatment with the drug minocycline may cause neurofilament light concentration to rise in CSF and blood.

Indeed, while the above examples illustrate that NfL is widely used and interpreted as a marker of neurological insult, confounding factors are also recognized.<sup><xref rid="fcaf175-B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="fcaf175-B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> For instance, NfL is inversely correlated with estimated glomerular filtration rate, suggesting removal through the kidneys, and with body mass index, perhaps due to dilution in a greater blood volume.<sup><xref rid="fcaf175-B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> A recent genome-wide association study demonstrated that a variant in <italic toggle="yes">UMOD</italic> implicated in kidney function affects plasma NfL levels, reinforcing a role for clearance pathways in steady state NfL levels,<sup><xref rid="fcaf175-B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> To date, however, factors affecting clearance of NfL within the CNS have not been identified.</p><p>Minocycline is a tetracycline antibiotic used clinically both for infections and for dermatologic conditions.<sup><xref rid="fcaf175-B14" ref-type="bibr">14-16</xref></sup> It has been shown in rodents and in humans to suppress microglial activation and proliferation.<sup><xref rid="fcaf175-B17" ref-type="bibr">17-19</xref></sup> This finding has led to clinical trials of minocycline in diverse neurologic indications; results have often been null or unfavorable,<sup><xref rid="fcaf175-B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="fcaf175-B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> though minocycline was shown to reduce the risk of conversion from clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) to multiple sclerosis.<sup><xref rid="fcaf175-B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> In clinical trials of both traumatic brain injury (TBI) and CIS, randomization to minocycline was associated with a &#x0223c;3-fold increase in plasma NfL, which was interpreted as meaning that the drug may have contributed to neurodegeneration or was intrinsically neurotoxic.<sup><xref rid="fcaf175-B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="fcaf175-B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup></p><p>Prion disease exhibits a more dramatic elevation of NfL than that seen in perhaps any other neurological disorder.<sup><xref rid="fcaf175-B24" ref-type="bibr">24-26</xref></sup> We and others have followed pre-symptomatic people at risk for genetic prion disease, however, and have found that plasma NfL increases in only a brief window prior to the onset of symptom,<sup><xref rid="fcaf175-B26" ref-type="bibr">26-29</xref></sup> consistent with the rapid clinical course of prion disease.<sup><xref rid="fcaf175-B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> Here, we observed an NfL increase of 3.5-fold in plasma and 5.7-fold in CSF in an asymptomatic individual at risk for genetic prion disease following 6 weeks&#x02019; treatment with oral minocycline for a dermatologic indication. Other biomarkers remained normal, and proteomic analysis of CSF revealed that the spike was exquisitely specific to neurofilaments. NfL dropped nearly to normal levels 5 weeks after minocycline cessation, and the individual remained free of disease 2 years later. Plasma NfL in dermatology patients was not elevated above normal controls. Dramatically high plasma NfL (&#x0003e;500&#x02005;pg/mL) was variably observed in some hospitalized individuals receiving minocycline. In mice, treatment with minocycline resulted in variable increases of 1.3- to 4.0-fold in plasma NfL, with complete wash-out 2 weeks after cessation. In neuron&#x02013;microglia co-cultures, minocycline increased NfL concentration in conditioned media by 3.0-fold without any visually obvious impact on neuronal health. We hypothesize that minocycline does not cause or exacerbate neuronal damage, but instead impacts the clearance of NfL from biofluids, a potential confounder for interpretation of this biomarker.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="fcaf175-s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="fcaf175-s2.1"><title>Ethical approvals</title><p>Human samples were collected through Mass General Brigham (MGB) Institutional Review Board (IRB) protocols 2015P000221, 2017P000214 and 2021P002185.

The list of matching medical record numbers was then flagged for plasma pulls at the Crimson Core at the point of sample discard. Any lavender top K<sub>2</sub>-EDTA tube plasma sample from one of these individuals for which all clinical testing was completed and 48&#x02005;h had passed was then pulled for inclusion in this study and labelled with a de-identified ID. Samples spent up to 8&#x02005;h at room temperature and up to 2 days at 4&#x000b0;C before being frozen at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C for transient storage and then shipped on dry ice to the analysing laboratory for storage at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C. For individuals for whom plasma samples were obtained, sex, age, medication history, problem list and, where applicable, date of death were queried. Each individual was assigned a &#x02018;zero&#x02019; date corresponding to the earliest date of any prescription start or blood sample collected. Sample dates, prescription start and end dates and death dates were then normalized to this zero. For analysis purposes, based on the duration of NfL elevation observed in the index case, patients were considered to be &#x02018;on&#x02019; drug from the prescription start date through 7 days after prescription end date. For outpatient prescriptions with no end date specified, the prescription was considered active for 30 days. Upon thaw, plasma samples were re-centrifuged and supernatants were used for NfL analysis. Ages were binned in 5-year intervals. Keys linking samples to medical record numbers were destroyed and all identifiable data were deleted; as noted above, the four-digit hexadecimal IDs shown in the supplementary tables and supplementary figures were randomly generated and are not known to anyone outside the study group.

Prior studies where randomization to minocycline resulted in an increase in plasma NfL were interpreted as suggesting that minocycline exacerbated neurodegeneration, or was to some degree intrinsically neurotoxic.<sup><xref rid="fcaf175-B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="fcaf175-B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> Correspondingly, low NfL has been interpreted as a neuroprotective signal.<sup><xref rid="fcaf175-B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref></sup> Several observations here suggest that minocycline may be capable of modulating NfL via a neuronal health-independent mechanism.</p><p>First, both CSF and plasma NfL increased dramatically after 6 weeks&#x02019; minocycline treatment in a healthy research study participant. We likewise observed, variably, increases in NfL in plasma of wild-type, unchallenged mice treated with minocycline and in conditioned media of co-cultured neurons and microglia.</p><p>Our research participant harboured a genetic predisposition to prion disease, but, other than NfL, showed no biomarker evidence of disease process. Both the magnitude of this individual&#x02019;s NfL increase&#x02014;far beyond levels ever observed in prodromal genetic prion disease<sup><xref rid="fcaf175-B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="fcaf175-B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="fcaf175-B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> and indeed, higher than many symptomatic genetic prion disease patients,<sup><xref rid="fcaf175-B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="fcaf175-B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref></sup> and the lack of disease onset 2 years later, argue that this spike does not correspond to the apparently very brief prodromal window in genetic prion disease. This individual also carried a dermatologic diagnosis which was the indication for minocycline treatment, but our analysis of discarded plasma from dermatology patients suggests that dermatologic conditions themselves are not a likely cause of elevated NfL. This individual took a 200&#x02005;mg/day dose of minocycline, the most commonly prescribed clinical dose. If minocycline were so neurotoxic at this dose as to cause the magnitude of NfL increase observed here, one might expect this neurotoxicity to exhibit outward phenotypic manifestations, inconsistent with the relatively clean safety record and widespread clinical use of minocycline.</p><p>Second, the increase in NfL was highly specific. Other than a slight perturbation in microglial markers TREM2 and AIF1 and a decrease in intermediate filament VIM, no proteins other than NfL and NfM were altered in this individual&#x02019;s CSF. If minocycline caused or exacerbated neurodegeneration, one might expect CSF T-tau to increase, which it did not. Similarly, in mice with elevated plasma NfL after 5 days of minocycline treatment, we observed a relatively quiet proteomic profile in brain parenchyma.</p><p>Third, the kinetics of NfL wash-out were rapid. In our study participant, NfL had returned almost to normal levels by 5 weeks after minocycline cessation. In two different mouse studies, we observed complete or nearly complete return to normal plasma NfL within 2 weeks of withdrawing minocycline. Spikes in plasma NfL due to acute neuronal insults are reported to take more than 12 weeks to clear.<sup><xref rid="fcaf175-B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="fcaf175-B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="fcaf175-B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref></sup></p><p>At the same time, our study has important limitations and many of the data collected here are inconsistent. We observed large and significant increases in NfL in only two of the four studies of minocycline treatment in mice. Despite using the same dose (50&#x02005;mg/kg/day) over similar dosing duration (5&#x02013;6 days) and generating directionally consistent results, the other two studies saw small and non-significant NfL increases. We were able to ascertain only one dermatology patient on minocycline, leaving us unable to determine whether minocycline increases NfL in this population. Moreover, while dermatology patients are often otherwise healthy, we were unable to rule out confounding diagnoses in this population. NfL levels were extremely high in a subset of hospitalized patients taking minocycline, but not in others, and overall, any difference in plasma NfL between on-drug and off-drug time points was non-significant. Most of these inpatients were on only short courses of minocycline, and we counted them as &#x02018;on&#x02019; drug from the first day of treatment.</p><p>Our comparison of plasma NfL levels observed in our mouse studies is based on a time point following 5&#x02013;6 days of treatment. In contrast, our research participant had been taking minocycline for 6 weeks, and increases in plasma NfL in TBI and MS-CIS were observed after 12 weeks. One possible explanation for our discordant findings would be that if minocycline inhibits the clearance or catabolism of NfL, then NfL concentration might increase rapidly (&#x0003c;1 week) in humans or mice that are releasing NfL rapidly, while it might rise much more slowly in humans releasing NfL at lower rates. CSF NfL was only modestly increased in <italic toggle="yes">Grn</italic> KO mice and was not increased in <italic toggle="yes">Trem2</italic> KO mice, but was dramatically increased in <italic toggle="yes">Grn/Trem2</italic> double KO mice,<sup><xref rid="fcaf175-B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref></sup> consistent with a &#x02018;two-hit&#x02019; hypothesis where the effect of inhibiting microglial clearance of NfL is magnified when there is also a perturbation that increases the rate of NfL release. Our hypothesis would also be consistent with data from Alzheimer&#x02019;s patients indicating an inverse correlation between microglial activation and NfL.<sup><xref rid="fcaf175-B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref></sup></p><p>Based on our results, we hypothesize that microglia play a role in clearing NfL and that minocycline inhibits this clearance, leading to an increase in CSF and plasma NfL concentration without causing neurodegeneration. At this time, however, this is only a hypothesis. It is not possible to make definitive conclusions, because our study has very prominent limitations. We possess detailed data on only one human research participant, and while our data argue against dermatological conditions themselves affecting NfL, we are unable to categorically rule out all other causes for increased NfL. Our data on dermatology patients and inpatients were collected only opportunistically, leading to incomplete clinical pictures, inconsistent numbers of days on drug and sporadic plasma sampling. There appear to be pre-analytical variables in our discarded plasma samples that we do not fully understand. We did not implement a pharmacokinetic assay to determine drug concentration in the human plasma samples but instead relied on medical records of prescriptions and drug administrations; the actual drug exposure levels in patients are unknown. The poor pharmacokinetics of minocycline in rodents compelled us to administer minocycline at a dose &#x0223c;16 times the typical clinical dose. This high dose was not tolerated for 10 days and even caused slight but significant weight loss by 5 days. Although this dose was not obviously toxic at 5&#x02013;6 days, a time point when we already observed elevated plasma NfL, there remains doubt as to the degree to which toxicity may have contributed to the findings. Moreover, the massive variability in plasma NfL in mice means that some of our mouse studies may have been underpowered, and we do not know how much a lack of power versus genuine heterogeneity explains our discordant results. Our cell culture studies were performed at a concentration above the C<sub>max</sub> reported in human plasma; however, only limited data on the pharmacokinetics of minocycline in brain are available. One study<sup><xref rid="fcaf175-B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> found that after a single dose in rats, the brain:plasma ratio was 0.35, while another study reported brain concentrations up to 20&#x02005;&#x000b5;M in chronically treated mice.<sup><xref rid="fcaf175-B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> We cannot be certain that the concentration of minocycline used in cell culture accurately reflects concentrations achieved <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic>.</p><p>While the evidence here is very preliminary, the implications of this hypothesis could be important. Given the pivotal role that NfL has begun to play in neurological clinical trials, the possibility that drugs&#x02014;and perhaps also genetic, environmental or other factors&#x02014;might be capable of altering NfL concentration by a means other than causing or alleviating neurological insult, merits consideration.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="sup1" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>fcaf175_Supplementary_Data</label><media xlink:href="fcaf175_supplementary_data.zip"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="ack1"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank all research participants for their contributions to this study.</p></ack><sec id="fcaf175-s5"><title>Supplementary material</title><p>
