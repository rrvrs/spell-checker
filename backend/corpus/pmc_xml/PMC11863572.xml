The main cause of childhood blindness is cataract. Cataract surgery can improve vision, but regular follow-up is necessary. Low attendance at follow-up is a medical and statistical challenge, as missing information can lead to biased results. Two research questions arise: what social factors influence attendance at first follow-up? What social factors influence a poor outcome of visual acuity at first follow-up?</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">An observational cohort study was conducted, and the total base population was analysed. The study includes children who received cataract surgery at Saint Joseph Hospital (Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo) from 2001 to 2021. Cox regression was used to examine attendance at the first follow-up (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1100 operated eyes), ordinal logistic regression to analyse visual acuity at the first follow-up (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;699 operated eyes), both clustered by patient identification number. Due to the high number of missing values, multiple imputation was performed as a sensitivity analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">Female sex, young age, very good visual acuity after surgery, and disease in both eyes led to lower attendance at follow-up. Poor visual acuity outcome at follow-up was associated with female sex, young age, poor financial situation, blindness after surgery and nystagmus.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">As regular follow-up is crucial for an improved visual acuity outcome, it is recommended that special attention needs to be paid to the groups identified in our analysis to better integrate them into follow-up. In particular, the higher risk of poor outcome in younger children is surprising and requires further analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s41182-025-00706-8.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Paediatric cataract surgery</kwd><kwd>Follow-up</kwd><kwd>Visual acuity outcome</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Universit&#x000e4;t Rostock (1046)</institution></funding-source></award-group><open-access><p>Open Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL.</p></open-access></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Japanese Society of Tropical Medicine 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par5">In 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that there were 43.3 million blind people in the world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] among them ~ 1.4 million blind children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. About 90% of children affected by blindness are from low- and middle-income countries, of which 72% are from Asia and 18% from Africa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The prevalence of blindness ranges from about 3&#x02013;4/10,000 children in economically developed countries to 12&#x02013;15/10,000 in the poorest countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Childhood blindness has profound and far-reaching personal and economic consequences. Blind children face a lifetime of blindness that limits their opportunities for education, employment and income. Early onset blindness also leads to delays in motor, language, social and cognitive development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">One of the leading causes of childhood blindness is cataract [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], which is also the focus of many programmes implementing the goals of "Vision 2020&#x02014;The Right to Sight", a global initiative to eliminate avoidable blindness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Cataract surgery can correct visual acuity and restore sight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. However, African countries have particularly low levels of access to and coverage of basic health services. The establishment of tertiary facilities in African countries has been a first step in improving medical care for children with cataract [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. This includes the Centre for Paediatric Ophthalmology at the Saint-Joseph Hospital in Kinshasa (Democratic Republic of the Congo), which has been collaborating with the University Medical Centre Rostock (Germany) since 2001 and whose clinical data form the basis of the study.</p><p id="Par7">In addition to high quality and timely surgery, postoperative follow-up is critical for optimal visual outcomes. Studies of paediatric cataract surgery report low rates of routine follow-up in low- and middle-income countries, with ~ 20&#x02013;40% of patients missing information on postoperative visual acuity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">Factors associated with low attendance include female sex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], long distance from the hospital [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], delay in presentation for surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], high cost [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], low socioeconomic status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], older child age or adolescence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], and low maternal education level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p id="Par9">Concerning visual acuity outcome in the first follow-up, early presentation and treatment is important. Infants and young children have better outcomes than older children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. However, a common problem in middle- and low-income countries is that children are delayed in getting to appropriate health care facilities, which negatively affects outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Generally, sex does not have an effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], with the exception of a study in Mexico where female children had worse outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par10">Similarly, preoperative blindness and preoperative nystagmus (wobbling eyes) are associated with poor final visual acuity outcomes in children with bilateral cataract [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. However, bilateral cataract (both eyes affected) was associated with a better outcome than unilateral cataract (only one eye affected) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p id="Par11">The aim of this paper is to analyse the social factors that influence participation and visual acuity at the first follow-up examination. There are few studies on the factors influencing non-attendance at follow-up after paediatric cataract surgery in low- and middle-income countries. We pay special attention to sex, age, family financial situation and hypothesise that they have an influence on attendance at the first follow-up such that older and female children from low-income families have lower attendance. We also suspect that higher age of the children may have a negative influence on the visual outcome, while for family income and sex there should be no differences in visual acuity. Furthermore, we assume that the medical pre-conditions nystagmus and laterality affect the outcome at the first follow-up such that those with nystagmus and unilateral cataract will have a worse outcome.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Data</title><p id="Par12">The study employed a cohort observational design, with the entire base population being analysed. In a Christoffel Blind Mission (CBM) community-based rehabilitation programme in Kinshasa, children's eye conditions requiring treatment were identified by trained community volunteers and a referral was made to Saint Joseph Hospital [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], but also self-initiated hospital treatments were possible. The CBM screening programme covers a catchment area of 16 health zones in Kinshasa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The distribution of children undergoing cataract surgery varies by district (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). During diagnosis and treatment, socio-demographic, pre-operative, surgical and post-operative characteristics were recorded in a database. At 20&#x000a0;years, the study period covers an exceptionally long time with a large number of procedures. The average number of eyes operated on per year was 55, with the lowest number of operations in 2018 (18 eyes) and the highest in 2020 (117 eyes).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Number of children with cataract in the districts of Kinshasa, map visualization.</p><p>Source: Saint Joseph Hospital (2001&#x02013;2021)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41182_2025_706_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p id="Par13">In the period from September 1999 to March 2022, 739 children with cataract were presented at Saint Joseph Hospital, corresponding to <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1478 examined eyes. Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> shows our exclusion criteria (a&#x02013;g): Only eyes for which cataract surgery could be reliably determined during the period 2001&#x02013;2021 were included in our study. Accordingly, 40 observations were excluded where no information on the surgery was documented (a) and 4 observations where the surgery was outside the observation period (b). Five children had no cataract, therefore their eyes were excluded from analysis (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;10) (c). Observations with duplicate patient identification numbers (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;4) (d), cases without age information and cases older than 15&#x000a0;years were excluded (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;37) (e). For eyes that underwent multiple surgeries due to complications, the first postoperative finding was included in the analysis for better comparability. In case of a unilateral cataract, eyes without visual impairments were excluded (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;203) (f) and eyes affected by cataract that had not yet been operated on were also excluded (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;50) (g). As the eyes of children with bilateral cataracts were sometimes operated on at different times (up to several months), we analyse participation by looking at the first follow-up visit at 3&#x000a0;weeks separately for each eye. Consequently, the analysis of participation in the initial follow-up examination was based on the data set comprising 1100 operated eyes in 690 individuals (1. Analysis sample). Among them information on visual acuity at first follow-up was missing for n&#x02009;=&#x02009;401 eyes and 198 persons, resulting in <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;699 eyes and 492 persons for the analysis of visual acuity at the first follow-up (2.

Individuals who had no information about the date of the follow-up or who attended the follow-up outside the defined period were counted as non-participants.

Since in both analyses our observations were eyes that underwent surgery, we clustered the variances by patient identification number. Due to the high number of missing values for visual acuity at the first follow-up, a sensitivity analysis was performed using multiple imputations of visual acuity as well as of the explanatory variables (visual acuity immediately before surgery, visual acuity after the surgery, family financial situation) combining them into one analysis based on Rubin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. All analyses were performed using STATA 12.1.</p><p id="Par18">The data collection documenting the cataract surgeries complied with local legislation and the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki.

Boys and older children were more likely to attend the follow-up visit, but we found no effect of financial situation. Poor visual acuity at the first follow-up was associated with younger age, female sex, and poor financial situation.</p><sec id="Sec13"><title>Participation in the first follow-up</title><p id="Par27">The percentage of children lost to follow-up is similar to other studies from low- and middle-income countries, ranging from 20 to 40% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In line with Eriksen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], girls were less likely to be taken to the follow-up than boys. It is likely that these sex differences are due to the social role of the male sex in the community, with treatment and a good visual outcome being considered more important for boys to enable them to attend school [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Sex differences are already evident in the uptake of cataract surgery at Saint Joseph's Hospital, where there are two boys for every girl. Studies in low- and middle-income countries show similar results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In this context, it is particularly important to encourage girls with cataracts to undergo cataract surgery and follow-up examinations. This will enable them to access education and reduce their dependence on family and community members.</p><p id="Par28">While Gogate et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] confirm poor follow-up especially for older children (age&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;11&#x000a0;years), our results show a reduced risk of participation for younger children. We suggest that for younger children who are not yet in school, good vision is seen as less important. Qualitative studies have shown that when parents seek eye care, they consider improved vision to be an important factor in their children's school performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. However, further qualitative research is needed to find out why parents do not bring their children back for follow-up and to what extent the age of the children is important in the decision. The Democratic Republic of the Congo is a low-income country, with ~ 60% of people living on less than USD 2.15 per day in 2022 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Based on data from Saint Joseph Hospital, ~ 72% of people have a monthly income of USD 80&#x02013;150. A more precise categorisation of the financial situation was not possible with the data. In terms of the financial situation, we did not find any effect on participation in the follow-up. We expect the community-based rehabilitation (CBR) programme to have a positive impact, covering surgery costs and transport costs. Other studies have demonstrated that the cost of surgery is a deterrent to follow-up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. However, we cannot exclude a data problem.</p><p id="Par29">Children who had no visual impairment after surgery were less likely to return for follow-up, as were children with bilateral cataracts. Qualitative interviews showed that many parents were unaware of the importance of follow-up and did not consider it necessary to return their children to hospital if the visual outcome had improved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. According to Yorston et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], children with immature cataracts who had relatively good vision preoperatively were more likely to attend follow-up, suggesting greater parental involvement. In line with the findings of Yorston et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], we found a lower risk of attendance in children with bilateral cataracts. We assume that parents who bring their child with unilateral cataract to surgery are also more likely to try to attend follow-up and to be well informed about the treatment process.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Visual acuity in the first follow-up</title><p id="Par30">The proportion of blind children was significantly reduced from 62% before surgery to 16% at the first follow-up after 3&#x000a0;weeks. About 9% of the operated eyes achieved good visual acuity (6/18 or better) and about 30% achieved moderate visual acuity (6/18 to 6/60). In 7% of the observations it was not possible to determine a specific visual acuity, but these may follow light or objects.</p><p id="Par31">Contrary to our hypothesis, the results show a higher risk of poor visual outcome at the first follow-up for girls. This is consistent with the findings in Mexico [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], but differs from other countries where no sex effect was found [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p id="Par32">We found a lower risk of poor visual outcome in older children.

These studies differ with regard to age groups and the partly separate evaluation of congenital (bilateral) and traumatic (unilateral) cataract. We only controlled for laterality and found no effect. Measuring visual acuity is particularly difficult in young children because no Snellen test is possible. Measuring visual acuity by assessing whether the child follows objects may lead to inaccuracies in the interpretation of the results. The age information is also partly based on estimates by the parents, which can also lead to inaccuracies.</p><p id="Par33">Controlled for sex, age and medical precondition, financial situation does not affect the risk of participation in the follow-up, but is associated with worse medical outcomes in the sensitivity analysis using multiple imputation. Medical outcome studies do not usually control for financial situation, which makes comparisons difficult. Financial aspects play an important role in the treatment process for families [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], but the CBR programme covers direct costs and indirect costs such as transport. It is possible that the effect of financial situation on poor visual outcome is due to different living conditions in the families and less opportunity for home eye care after surgery. To understand the influence of financial situation on visual outcome after surgery, the extent to which living conditions differ by financial situation and how this affects visual outcome needs to be investigated in more detail.</p><p id="Par34">Preoperative blindness, blindness and severe visual impairment immediately after surgery, and preoperative nystagmus were predictors of poor postoperative visual outcome; other outcome studies from low- and middle-income countries including children under 15&#x000a0;years of age with bilateral or unilateral cataract found the same results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p id="Par35">When comparing the results with previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], it is important to note that the follow-up times in these studies vary widely. To increase the validity within our study, we focused on the first follow-up after 3&#x000a0;weeks; other studies refer to the last follow-up, which can range from a few days to several years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. By clustering the data by patient identification number, we included both eyes in our analyses, not just the better eye [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. In addition, we imputed missing values when exploring visual acuity and this mainly influenced the results for sex and financial situation in terms of significance. This was important because visual acuity results were not available at the first follow-up for 36% of the observations.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Strength</title><p id="Par36">Our study has a series of strengths.

Low follow-up rates in low- and middle-income countries lead to a high number of missing values, which may affect the assessment and interpretation of the results. Also in our study, 36% of the observations had no vision results at follow-up, but we used multiple imputation. We could not include all variables of interest (cause of cataract, mother's education, father's education, number of siblings) present in the dataset in our analyses because they had too many missing values (80%) or inconsistent coding.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par39">As a first step, we identified factors that have a positive influence on follow-up after cataract surgery in children. In the second part of our study, we analysed factors that influence visual outcome after surgery. As regular follow-up is crucial for a good visual outcome in cataract surgery, special attention should be given to girls and young children in family counselling to better integrate them into follow-up. Qualitative interviews remain important to better understand family dynamics and individual fears of treatment and follow-up, and to develop possible strategies to increase participation. Further research is needed to understand why the different financial circumstances of families affect the outcome of surgery and to develop recommendations for action where appropriate.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>
