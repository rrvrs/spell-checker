waste through
a biocompatible ionic liquid approach, focusing on choline acetate,
[Ch][OAc]. This ionic liquid effectively extracts over 80 wt % of
protein from squid pen waste. To optimize the extraction process,
a factorial design of experiments was employed to achieve a protein
recovery of 75% at an estimated purity of 86%, along with highly acetylated,
crystalline &#x003b2;-chitin with a purity of up to 95%. The extracted
protein was subsequently used to create biocomposite films from &#x003b1;-
and &#x003b2;-chitosan, demonstrating impressive tensile strengths of
93.15 &#x000b1; 7.9 and 83.5 &#x000b1; 6.2 MPa, respectively, while maintaining
hydrophilic properties (&#x003b8;<sub>water</sub> &#x0003c; 90&#x000b0;). Molecular
dynamics simulations revealed that the anion [OAc]<sup>&#x02212;</sup> exhibits a stronger affinity for protein surfaces compared to other
anions, while its combination with the cation [Ch]<sup>+</sup> optimally
facilitates protein recovery. A material mass balance indicated that
from 1 kg of dry squid pen, 0.526 kg of protein and 0.34 kg of chitin
were recovered. However, high solvent usage significantly impacts
energy demands and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, generating approximately
4.27 kg of CO<sub>2</sub> per kg of product, with 61% attributed to
protein production. Technoeconomic analysis demonstrated that solvent
costs account for nearly 65% of the minimum selling price of the protein,
estimated at $9 kg<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>, which decreases to $0.6 for
each kilogram of coproduced &#x003b2;-chitin. Technoeconomic analysis
showed that solvent costs comprise nearly 65% of the minimum selling
price of the protein, which can reach $9 kg<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>, but
this price decreases to $0.6 for each kilogram of coproduced &#x003b2;-chitin.
This research underscores the potential of squid pen waste as a valuable
resource while highlighting the need for sustainable solvent management
strategies.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="short"><p>Ionic liquids can help to build a shellfish

global food commodity, and it encompasses
a wide range of species, including freshwater and marine finfish,
bivalves, decapods, cephalopods, algae, and cyanobacteria.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref></sup> In 2020, global seafood production reached 214
million tons, with the squid fishery representing about 4.3% of all
marine catches by volume and about 7% by value worldwide.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref></sup> The Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations estimates
the seafood trade to be worth U.S. $151 billion, with a projected
13% growth in production value by 2030.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref></sup> Seafood categories are generally considered to have better environmental
performance compared to other protein-rich foods, particularly in
terms of sustainability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref></sup> However, the
seafood supply faces various challenges, including increasing demand
due to overfishing, species depletion, environmental pollution, global
warming, and biodiversity changes that ultimately have impacted the
squid population over the last decades.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref></sup></p><p>Interest in the biorefining of seafood waste through environmentally
friendly processing is a result of a growing understanding of how
traditional fishing processes affect the environment and the stringent
pollution control requirements imposed by regulatory bodies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref></sup> Squids differ from fish in their high growth rate, short life span,
and high feeding behavior. These characteristics end up exerting a
high predation pressure on zooplankton, fish, and other squid prey,
as in the case of the invasive Humboldt squid in the eastern North
Pacific.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref></sup> There is then a necessity for population
control and, of course, the introduction of biorefinery strategies
for completely sustainable consumption and utilization of squid waste.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></sup></p><p>Large amounts of squid waste are produced
from wild-caught fisheries.
It is estimated that more than 40% of the total body weight of squid
ends up as processing byproducts, including the viscera, pens, and
skins.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></sup> These byproducts are routinely dumped in
landfills or released into bodies of water. Incineration, composting,
and anaerobic digestion could be an alternative, but only in more
developed countries such as the U.K. and Australia, with disposal
costs up to U.S. $150 per ton.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref></sup> This introduces
demand for the implementation of efficient and cutting-edge treatment
and utilization methods to minimize any adverse environmental effects
on aquatic ecosystems or land and to encourage more productive practices
that minimize biomass, energy, or nutrient losses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref></sup></p><p>The squid pen, or gladius, is an internalized shell
that acts as
both a point of attachment for significant muscle groups and a barrier
to protect the visceral organs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref></sup> The pen&#x02019;s
distinctive protein and &#x003b2;-chitin composition is what gives it
its strength and flexibility. The weight distribution of the pens
from different species of squid is 25&#x02013;49% &#x003b2;-chitin, 43&#x02013;75%
protein, and relatively low ash content.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref></sup> A protein layer surrounds the &#x003b2;-chitin nanofibrils, which
are arranged parallel to the pen&#x02019;s long axis by &#x003b1;-helical
protein coils.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref></sup></p><p>Squid pens valorization
has been focused on obtaining protein hydrolysates&#x02014;via
alkaline or enzymatic hydrolysis&#x02014;with antioxidant properties
or as fermentation media for microorganisms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref></sup> These
methods, however, do not entail the isolation of the squid protein
to obtain a high-purity protein isolate, as the protein recovery methods
such as dialysis or membrane separation, would be costly.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref></sup> Squid pen utilization for &#x003b2;-chitosan production
usually employs harsh chemicals such as hydrochloric acid and sodium
hydroxide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref></sup> and generates high volumes
of wastewater, which negatively impacts the water footprint of the
process.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref></sup> Obtaining a solid protein stream
would therefore facilitate protein transport and storage.</p><p>Ionic
liquids (ILs) are liquid salts at room temperature that present
interesting physicochemical properties, such as high vapor pressure,
conductivity, and high thermal stability. They can be tailored for
different purposes by choosing different cation and anion combinations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref></sup> There has been a debate on the &#x0201c;green-ness&#x0201d; of ILs
due principally to their eco-toxicity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref></sup> (i.e., how it negatively impacts the growth of microorganisms, plants,
or animal tissues), but this depends on the IL and process configuration.
If the IL is fully recovered and the processing water streams are
also recycled, then, a greener process can be ensured.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref></sup> Literature studies entailed solubilizing chitin
and chitosan with ILs for energy, pharmaceutical, and medical applications,
but not the fractionation of shellfish waste. A study by Shamshina
and Abidi<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref></sup> has shown that acidic ILs such
as 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hydrogen sulfate, [BMIM][HSO<sub>4</sub>], can efficiently fractionate shrimp shells to produce high-purity
chitin. Shrimp shells present more complex composition such as calcium
carbonate (20&#x02013;50 wt %), proteins (20&#x02013;40 wt %), &#x003b1;-chitin
(15&#x02013;40 wt %), and lipids (0&#x02013;14 wt %).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref></sup> However, there are no studies on the holistic biorefinery
utilization of squid waste with ILs.</p><p>In this study, we aim to
explore the use of ILs in the fractionation
of squid pens to produce high-purity &#x003b2;-chitin and protein as
two solid streams. We investigated the influence of the structure
of the anion and cation of the IL on protein extraction in an IL screening.
Once the IL was chosen, optimization of the fractionation parameters
determined the best conditions to ensure a high protein yield. Then,
recycling of the IL under a limited number of batches was probed to
ensure that the IL performance was retained along the cycles. Characterization
of the produced &#x003b2;-chitin and protein confirmed the efficiency
of fractionation. Biocomposite chitosan and squid protein films were
produced to underpin the potential utilization of the protein in biomaterials.
A mass balance of the fractionation process, together with a technoeconomic
analysis, indicated the process&#x02019;s feasibility. Lastly, molecular
dynamic (MD) simulation helped us to theorize the explanation of the
choline acetate selectivity toward protein extraction and further
isolation.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2.1"><label>2.1</label><title>Feedstock and Reagents</title><p>All experiments

into a powder with a coffee grinder (Dr. Mills, San Jose, CA, USA)

the squid pens were extracted with NaOH 1 mol&#x000b7;L<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> at 80 &#x000b0;C for 3 h for quantitative protein removal; the dry

established that its nitrogen content was 6.90%. The ash content of
the squid pen samples was determined after ashing the dry squid pens
in a muffle oven for 6 h at 600 &#x000b0;C.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3"><label>2.3</label><title>IL Synthesis and Characterization</title><p>Six ILs were synthesized by dropwise addition of equimolar amounts
of the acids (acetic, methanesulfonic, or sulfuric) to the base (choline

[MEA][HSO<sub>4</sub>], monoethanolammonium methanesulfonate, [MEA][MeSO<sub>3</sub>], and monoethanolammonium acetate, [MEA][OAc]. Once the addition
finished, the synthesized IL was stirred for 1 h and had its acid&#x02013;base
ratio and water content adjusted to 1:1 and 20 wt %, respectively.
IL water content was measured using a V20 Volumetric Karl Fischer
Titrator (Mettler-Toledo). Acid&#x02013;base ratios of [Ch][HSO<sub>4</sub>] and [MEA][HSO<sub>4</sub>] were determined by titration
with 0.1 M NaOH, using a G20S Compact Titrator (Mettler-Toledo, Columbus,

a primary standard.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.4"><label>2.4</label><title>IL Screening Assays</title><p>Briefly, 9.0

from 0.95 to 0.99, except [Ch][MeSO<sub>3</sub>] with 1.07:1.00. Some
interesting trends related to the relationship between the pH of the
ILs and protein removal can be found by inspecting <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>. From the three acidic ILs&#x02014;[MEA][HSO<sub>4</sub>], [Ch][HSO<sub>4</sub>], and [Ch][MeSO<sub>3</sub>]&#x02014;only
the [HSO<sub>4</sub>] ILs were able to remove the protein from the
biomass. The explanation relies on the amount of acidic protons available
in the medium. Acidic ILs with [HSO<sub>4</sub>]<sup>&#x02212;</sup> anions present a large pool of protons available for exchange. In
a study by Firth et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref></sup> they showed
through density function theory (DFT) calculations that spontaneous
proton dissociation from [HSO<sub>4</sub>]<sup>&#x02212;</sup> to water
occurred for ammonium-based protic ILs, preceded by the formation
of an anion trimer structure. However, with [Ch][MeSO<sub>3</sub>],
the slight excess of methanesulfonic acid did not provide sufficient
acidity to the system. Although the proteins were removed from the
squid pen, the protein yield was near zero because the proteins most
likely were hydrolyzed in the acidic media. The neutral IL, [MEA][MeSO<sub>3</sub>], was also inefficient in promoting protein solubilization.
The alkaline ILs [Ch][OAc] and [MEA][OAc] were able to extract a considerable
amount of protein. However, upon antisolvent addition to the protein&#x02013;[Ch][OAc]
mixture, instantaneous protein precipitation occurred (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssuschemeng.4c04217/suppl_file/sc4c04217_si_002.mp4">Video S1</ext-link> in the SI), which confirms the superiority
of this IL toward protein extraction and recovery. Of course, the
pH trend does not solely explain the protein solubility and precipitation;
other phenomena related to ion hydrophilicity, intermolecular interactions,
and effect of cosolvent which will ultimately impact the salting-in
and out effects of the IL will be covered in <xref rid="sec3.8" ref-type="other">Section <xref rid="sec3.8" ref-type="other">3.8</xref></xref> with the MD simulations. Regarding the

(data not shown), which shows the pH and anion structure are not the
main causes for protein extraction; the form in which these ions are
(in solution or in an IL) also matter. Sodium hydroxide extracted
a high amount of protein, however, the protein recovery was not as
considerable (about 30%). The protein is most likely hydrolyzed under
such alkaline conditions which may play a hint at the lower stability
of protein in aqueous media compared to ILs.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>IL screening of squid

are necessary to disrupt both the hydrogen bonding and covalent bonds

better predicted than how much protein is precipitated. Logically,
protein removal is a simpler outcome variable, as it depends on only
the mass of the samples before and after protein extraction. On the
other hand, protein recovery is more complex because it involves both
protein removal and their salting out via antisolvent addition. The
surface response plots are shown in <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssuschemeng.4c04217/suppl_file/sc4c04217_si_001.pdf">Figure S5</ext-link> (SI).

solids loadings.</p><p>Alternatively, protein recovery was favored
by low solids and low
extraction times. Long extraction times promote protein breakdown
into oligopeptides, peptides, and amino acids, which may have remained
in the IL even upon antisolvent addition. A compromise between high
protein removal and high protein recovery must be achieved. A time
course experiment (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssuschemeng.4c04217/suppl_file/sc4c04217_si_001.pdf">Figure S9</ext-link>, SI) showed
2 h of extraction was sufficient to ensure high protein yields (&#x0003e;60%).
Therefore, an extraction time of 2 h and 5 wt % solids loading was
chosen as the optimized condition.</p><p>The protein recovery as a
function of the water content can be
seen in <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssuschemeng.4c04217/suppl_file/sc4c04217_si_001.pdf">Figure S12</ext-link> (SI). A water content
of lower than 5% was difficult to achieve by rotary evaporation due
to the high hydrophilicity of [Ch][OAc], thus the initial water content
was 10 wt %. Protein recovery remained high under a low water content
and then decreased upon the addition of water to 60% protein recovery
with a 40% water content. A higher water content promotes the salting
out of the protein and therefore decreases the ionic liquid/protein
interactions. As there were no significant differences between 10
and 20% water content, 20% was chosen as optimal for the IL recycling
experiments. A higher water content in the IL decreases the cost related
to solvent removal, once [Ch][OAc] can be synthesized via diluted
aqueous solutions of either [Ch][OH] (46 wt %) or [Ch][HCO<sub>3</sub>] (80 wt %). An additional 2<sup>2</sup> design with solids loading
and water content was studied, and it showed that both parameters
were significant and negatively affected the protein removal, therefore
confirming that lower solids loading and water content are required
to enhance protein removal and consequent chitin purity.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.4"><label>3.4</label><title>IL Recycling&#x02014;Protein Build-Up</title><p>Recycling of [Ch][OAc] was carried out for three samples along five

steps of both chitin and protein. The slight losses along the recovery

the reduction in protein content from the two-step oxidation and acid

shown that proteins such as the green fluorescent protein are more
easily denatured in the presence of pyrrolidinium-based ILs, which

IL&#x02013;water interactions. The goal of these MD simulations was
2-fold: first, to understand why protein solubilization was more effective
in ionic liquids with the [OAc] anion. Second, we need to rationalize

analysis was conducted to evaluate the effects of the protein extraction
process. These assessments are particularly crucial to minimizing
solvent consumption for environmental and economic issues, as ethanol
and water are introduced at various stages of the process to facilitate
the recovery of chitin and protein. Consequently, energy is required
for the evaporation of these substances to achieve the appropriate
composition for the recovery of the IL for reuse. The IL recovery
was set to 97%, following previous results shown in <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssuschemeng.4c04217/suppl_file/sc4c04217_si_001.pdf">Table S15</ext-link> (SI). In addition, the experimental values reported
in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref> were considered
for the estimation of heat consumption for ethanol and water evaporation.</p><p>The simulation takes into account heating the squid pen and IL
mixture to 100 &#x000b0;C for protein extraction. Then, ethanol evaporation
was simulated by a flash vessel at 0.1 bar, optimized by trial and
error, until no ethanol was detected in the bottom stream (IL + water).
No IL was recovered in the top stream. 1.1 kg water&#x000b7;kg<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> of IL as low-pressure steam was necessary to provide the heat needed
for the distillation. The top stream (ethanol) was condensed and then
cooled to room temperature and recirculated, recovering the excess
heat for its employment in subsequent separations. Two-step multiple-effect
evaporators were used for water removal and IL recovery. Pressure
in both vessels (0.3 and 0.1 bar in the first and second vessels,
respectively) was optimized by trial and error to minimize vacuum
and energy consumption and ensure that the recovered IL matched the
required characteristics for its reuse. The excess heat from ethanol
condensation was used in the first step, as well as an additional
1.78 kg water&#x000b7;kg<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> of IL as low-pressure steam
for heating needs. Excess heat from water condensation at the top
of the vessel was recovered and employed in the second step with no
additional heating needs. Water was cooled to room temperature and
recirculated. IL was then heated up again to 100 &#x000b0;C and recirculated.
From the simulation, annual costs were calculated as described in
the methodology section. The cost breakdown showed that the heat needed
for IL recovery dominates at 64% of the total costs, followed by fixed
costs at 17%. Smaller contributions come from feedstock (7%), IL makeup
(6%), and other factors such as annualized CAPEX (2%), heat for the
reactor during extraction (3%), and cooling water (1%). Electricity
accounted for only 0.2%.</p><p>As expected, the most significant contribution
is the heat needed
for solvent recovery due to the high volumes of ethanol and, mainly,
water (85 wt % after mixing with the IL) employed in the process.
This is especially important considering that the heat of vaporization
of water is 2.65 times higher than that for ethanol. For this, energy
consumption in the multiple-effect evaporators for water evaporation
is 1.6 times higher than that for ethanol removal, accounting for
40% of the minimum protein selling price. Therefore, new methods for
IL recovery are worth investigating to improve the energy efficiency
of the process. IL makeup costs were calculated considering a 97%
IL recovery from experimental results in laboratory, which may not
completely translate to a larger scale.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref68">68</xref></sup> The large volumes of solvents employed for relatively low productivity
lead to high total field costs (due to equipment), which impact the
fixed costs, significantly contributing to the minimum selling price.
The main contributors to these costs are the three evaporators employed
in ethanol and water distillations, accounting for 15% of all fixed
costs. Finally, it is important to note that feedstock costs are estimated
using a squid pen powder price that may not be current, given the
challenge of accessing updated pricing information. Hence, caution
is advised in considering this aspect, as there is potential for cost
reduction if the plant is integrated into the fish industry, where
squid pens are commonly viewed as waste material.</p><p>According
to our simulation and considering all of the costs explained
in the methodology section, the minimum protein selling price obtained
is $9 kg<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>, which was calculated considering a protein
productivity of 416 ton&#x000b7;year<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>, in accordance
with the mass balance (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>) for simulated flow rates. However, it is worth mentioning
that this price was calculated considering only protein and does not
take into account the possible income from selling &#x003b2;-chitin
as a byproduct. Thus, based on chitin productivity and considering
a price of $3.75 kg<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref69">69</xref></sup> the protein selling price could be lowered to approximately $6.6
kg<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>. In terms of environmental impact, the process
generates CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of 4.27 kg of CO<sub>2</sub> per
kg of products, factoring in the production of both protein and &#x003b2;-chitin,
which account for 61 and 39% of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, respectively.
The predominant source of these CO<sub>2</sub> emissions is the significant
energy requirements of the solvent recovery process, compounded by
the limited availability of heat sources beyond steam. This underscores
the critical need to explore alternative methods for recovering ILs
from water streams given their substantial impact on both economic
and environmental considerations. A more flexible method for IL dehydration
is pervaporation, a scalable membrane separation technique that can
be selective toward the direct recovery of volatile solutes or solvents
from nonvolatile solvents in a quantitative manner.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref70">70</xref></sup></p></sec></sec><sec id="sec4"><label>4</label><title>Conclusions and Perspectives</title><p>Designing
ILs for protein extraction requires the appropriate selection
of cation and anion combination. Squid pens are an excellent model
for a shellfish biorefinery because they present a more simple composition
when compared to crabs, prawns, and lobsters. In this work, an ionic-liquid-based
process with [Ch][OAc] was designed and optimized that can generate
two product streams of high purity, squid protein and &#x003b2;-chitin.
Recycling of the IL showed that protein accumulates for a number of
recycles and can eventually be recovered, without compromising the
efficiency and purity of the IL. The mass balance of the process revealed
that the solvent usage is high; however, process integration and IL
recycling can ensure greener credentials for the process. Material
characterization of the two streams showed that the &#x003b2;-chitin
presents a low protein content and is highly crystalline, whereas
the protein isolate has a high protein content and low molecular weight.
MD simulations unveiled the reasoning behind the superiority of [Ch][OAc]
to extract and precipitate protein from aqueous solutions in comparison
to other ILs screened with the same cation or anion, underpinning
the role of the anion on the protein extraction and the role of the
cation on the protein precipitation. Technoeconomic analysis showed
how energetic requirements for washing steps and IL recovery can heavily
impact the protein minimum selling price. The coproduction of &#x003b2;-chitin
decreases the minimum selling price of the protein. Solvent usage
impacts negatively on CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and emphasizes that
despite its promise, an IL-based refinery requires further design
process integration and optimized heat recovery, as well as increased
efficiency in separation processes. This work can be viewed as the
foundation of an IL-based biorefinery for shellfish, where future
works on carbonate-rich shellfish such as crabs, prawns, and lobster
can be beneficial for the holistic utilization of shellfish waste.</p></sec></body><back><notes id="notes-1" notes-type="si"><title>Supporting Information Available</title><p>The Supporting Information
