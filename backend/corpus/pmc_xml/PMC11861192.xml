The incidence and progression of IBD vary across regions, with western countries reporting a higher prevalence. For instance, in the United States, the prevalence of IBD has been estimated at approximately 1.3% of the population (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Kaplan and Windsor, 2021</xref>). In recent decades, the prevalence of IBD has also been on the rise in Eastern and Latin American countries, likely due to economic and demographic growth, further straining global healthcare systems (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Colitis-Pathophysiology and Jurenka, 2003</xref>). IBD is a chronic idiopathic intestinal disease with an unclear cause, encompassing a complex interplay of gut microbiota, host genetic susceptibility, environmental factors, and aberrant immunology. In most cases, IBD patients exhibit variable degrees of colitis, accompanied by different types of epithelial barrier disruption (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Du and Ha, 2020</xref>).</p><p>The primary treatments for IBD include immunomodulators and, in severe cases, surgical intervention (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Kaplan and Windsor, 2021</xref>). Recently, new treatment options for IBD have emerged, such as JAK inhibitors, Anti-IL-12/23 agents, anti-TNF-&#x003b1; agents, and S1PR modulators, which are approved by FDA, EMA, <italic>etc.</italic>, and marketed for this indication (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Adolph et al., 2022</xref>; <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Pittayanon et al., 2020</xref>). The primary treatments for IBD currently approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) encompass a range of therapeutic modalities, each with distinct mechanisms of action. Immunomodulators, such as azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine, work by suppressing the immune system to reduce inflammation (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Ordas et al., 2012</xref>), Amino salicylates, like mesalamine, are anti-inflammatory agents that directly target the gut mucosa (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Hanauer, 2006</xref>).</p><p>
<italic>Meconopsis integrifolia</italic> is a distinctive species of plant, endemic to the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau and neighboring regions, flourishing at elevations between 2,700 and 5,100&#x000a0;m in specific areas of China (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2024</xref>). With a rich medicinal application history in traditional Tibetan medicine, it has been utilized to treat a plethora of ailments including hepatitis, pneumonia, inflammation, and pain (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2020</xref>). The leaves alleviate stomach acid reflux when harvested before flowering, and the flowers reduce fever, mitigate inflammation, and assist in fracture healing, highlighting its anti-inflammatory potential (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2013</xref>). The noted therapeutic attributes and historical medicinal applications of Meconopsis have led to increased scholarly attention, particularly towards its anti-inflammatory capacities (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Guo et al., 2016</xref>). According to our preliminary, Polysaccharides, being complex carbohydrates found in numerous living organisms, possess a wide array of biological functions, including immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory activities. This makes them promising candidates for the development of therapeutic agents targeting inflammatory conditions. In particular, polysaccharides derived from <italic>Meconopsis integrifolia</italic> may exhibit anti-inflammatory effects due to their potential to modulate immune responses and reduce inflammation, as suggested by preliminary studies.</p><p>Polysaccharides are important macromolecules found in nearly all living organisms and possess crucial biological functions (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Hou et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Yin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Niu et al., 2021</xref>). They are increasingly attracting attention due to their wide range of pharmacological and biological activities, including immunomodulatory, antitumor, antimicrobial, anticoagulant, antioxidant, antiviral, hypoglycemia, and antidiabetic properties, making them one of the most promising candidates in the field of biomedicine and pharmaceuticals (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Yi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Leong et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Fernandes and Coimbra, 2023</xref>). Polysaccharides can be gained from lots of origins, containing microorganisms, plants, animals, and algae. Because of their physicochemical features, they are susceptible to chemical and physical changes that improve their properties. This is the fundamental notion for their wide range of uses in biomedical and pharmaceutical industries.</p><p>This study comprehensively investigated the potential of Meconopsis polysaccharides (MP) to alleviate colitis induced by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in mice. Firstly, the Meconopsis polysaccharides was primarily characterized by chemical composition, homogeneity molecular weight, monosaccharide composition and thermal analysis. Then, its colitis alleviation activity was confirmed by <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments. The action mechanism was further primarily reveled by cell model and gut microbiota diversity. And it was found that Meconopsis polysaccharides could alleviate colitis induced by DSS via the regulation of PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. In addition, it alleviated the advancement of colitis by enhancing the regulation of gut diversity and concentration of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). Our results emphasize the outstangding efficacy of Meconopsis polysaccharides in relieving DSS-induced colitis and open up new way for potential therapy IBD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>2 Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>2.1 Chemical composition analysis</title><p>The content of uronic acid was determined using m-hydroxybenzene colorimetry method, with glucuronic acid employed as standard (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2015</xref>).

Our findings highlight the efficacy of MP in mitigating colitis symptoms, suggesting a novel natural remedy for the treatment of IBD. MP not only exhibited anti-inflammatory effects by suppressing the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway but also modulated the gut microbiome diversity and SCFA concentrations, contributing to an improved intestinal microenvironment.</p><p>Our results demonstrate that MP significantly alleviated DSS-induced colitis in mice, as evidenced by reduced weight loss, DAI scores, colon shortening, and tissue damage. These findings are comparable to those observed with other therapeutics used for colitis alleviation, such as aminosalicylates, anti-TNF-&#x003b1; agents, and JAK inhibitors (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Pittayanon et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Adolph et al., 2022</xref>). However, MP has the advantage of being a natural product with minimal side effects, making it a promising alternative to synthetic drugs. The predicted mechanism of action of MP involves the inhibition of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, which is a critical pathway involved in the regulation of inflammatory responses. This pathway is dysregulated in IBD, leading to excessive inflammation and tissue damage (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2022</xref>). By suppressing this pathway, MP may reduce the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1&#x003b2;, TNF-&#x003b1;, and IL-6, thereby alleviating colitis symptoms. In comparison to FDA-approved medications for IBD, MP may offer a more natural and holistic approach to treatment. While synthetic drugs are highly effective, they often come with significant side effects. MP, on the other hand, has the potential to provide similar therapeutic benefits with minimal side effects. Furthermore, MP may be combined with other medications to enhance their efficacy and reduce side effects.</p><p>The modulation of gut microbiome diversity and SCFA concentrations by MP is another important aspect of its anti-inflammatory effects. The gut microbiome plays a crucial role in maintaining intestinal homeostasis, and its dysbiosis has been implicated in the pathogenesis of IBD (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Shan et al., 2022</xref>). MP promoted the growth of beneficial bacteria, such as Tannerellaceae and Parabacteroides-B, while inhibiting the growth of harmful bacteria, such as CAG-485 and Alistipes-A. These changes in gut microbiome composition may contribute to the improved intestinal microenvironment observed in MP-treated mice. In addition, MP normalized the concentrations of SCFAs, such as butyrate, propionic acid, and valeric acid, which are important for maintaining intestinal health. SCFAs are metabolites derived from gut microbiota that play crucial roles in regulating inflammatory responses and maintaining intestinal barrier integrity (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">van der Hee and Wells, 2021</xref>). By modulating the gut microbiome and SCFA concentrations, MP may contribute to the alleviation of colitis symptoms through multiple mechanisms.</p><p>Our study highlights the novel therapeutic potential of MP in the treatment of IBD. The ability of MP to suppress the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, modulate the gut microbiome diversity, and regulate SCFA concentrations makes it a promising candidate for the development of novel therapeutic strategies. Future studies should aim to further elucidate the mechanisms underlying the anti-inflammatory effects of MP and investigate its efficacy in clinical trials. In conclusion, our findings emphasize the importance of MP in the treatment of DSS-induced colitis and open up new avenues for targeted therapeutic approaches in the therapy of IBD. The modulation of gut microbiome diversity and SCFA concentrations by MP may represent a novel mechanism of action that can be exploited for the development of new therapeutic agents.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="s5"><title>5 Conclusion</title><p>This work extensively studied the alleviation of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>polysaccharides</italic> for DSS-induced mice colitis.
