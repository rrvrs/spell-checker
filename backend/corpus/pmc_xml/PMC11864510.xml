</self-uri><abstract><p>Disruption of the glycosaminoglycan (GAG)-layer and urothelial barrier is an important aspect of the pathophysiology of bladder pain syndrome/ interstitial cystitis. Intravesical hyaluronic acid (HA) is often used in treatments for IC/BPS, however the role in the urothelial barrier is unknown. This study aims to clarify the location and functional contribution of HA in the urothelium, using an in vitro model. Immunohistochemistry was performed on human and porcine biopsies and on porcine cell cultures to evaluate the location of HA. Functional contribution was assessed through transepithelial electrical resistance measurements and the effects on gene expression in a differentiated primary porcine urothelial cell model. HA was found throughout in the urothelium and most abundant around the basal layer. Digestion of HA increased impermeability of the urothelium, contrasting with the effect of protamine sulfate (PS). After HA digestion, quantitative PCR analysis revealed upregulation of HA-synthesizing gene (HAS3) and the inflammatory marker (IL8). Treatment with HA and/or chondroitin sulfate therapy in undamaged cells upregulated genes related to GAG synthesis, barrier markers and inflammation. In PS-damaged cells, GAG therapy only upregulated genes associated with HA synthesis and inflammation, without affecting barrier recovery speed. These results emphasize the interaction of HA on urothelial cell inflammation and barrier repair physiology. HA seems to not directly restore the urothelial luminal GAG layer but influences barrier integrity through its interactions with urothelial cells.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>Goodlife Pharma</institution>

The specific pathophysiology is unknown, but there is evident involvement of the immune system and a clear disruption of the urothelial barrier, making the bladder vulnerable to toxins and bacteria in the urine, leading to symptoms like pain and urinary frequency [<xref rid="pone.0318277.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0318277.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>The urothelial barrier is predominantly formed by specialized tightly bound umbrella cells, covered by asymmetrical membrane units (consisting of uroplakins) and a layer of hydrophilic polysaccharide components (e.g., glycosaminoglycans (GAGs)), also called the GAG-layer [<xref rid="pone.0318277.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0318277.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Specifically, this GAG-layer, normally a highly impermeable layer, is thought to be of great importance in the pathophysiology of IC/BPS. GAG-molecules associated with the urinary bladder are hyaluronic acid (HA), chondroitin sulfate (CS), heparan sulfate(HS) and dermatan sulfate(DS) [<xref rid="pone.0318277.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0318277.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The first two form the target for GAG-therapy bladder instillations, widely used in IC/BPS patients [<xref rid="pone.0318277.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. CS, HS and DS are sulfated GAGs, there synthesis involves attachment to a core protein, whereas HA is a non-sulfated GAG. CS has been found in the apical urothelium and has a significant role in the urothelial barrier. CS digestion with specific enzymes increases permeability and CS instillations help restore impermeability after damage [<xref rid="pone.0318277.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0318277.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>The localization and function of HA in IC/BPS and urothelial barrier is less clear. It has been described in deeper layers of the urothelium [<xref rid="pone.0318277.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0318277.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. HA is an unique non-sulfated GAG, a biopolymer with varying chain lengths, but with an overall high molecular weight (HMW) of approximately 1000&#x02009;kDa in healthy native tissues [<xref rid="pone.0318277.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0318277.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. HA synthesis occurs at the plasma membrane through the activity of specialized integral membrane glycosyltransferases known as hyaluronan synthases (HASs), there are three distinct HAS genes encoding the isoenzymes HAS1, HAS2, and HAS3. These enzymes coordinate the utilization of substrates to initiate, elongate and translocate HA, ultimately depositing it into the extracellular environment [<xref rid="pone.0318277.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. HA is found in many tissues, where in the ECM it exerts a role in tissue structure and cellular motility, adhesion and proliferation, along with interactions through the CD44 and RHAMM receptors [<xref rid="pone.0318277.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0318277.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0318277.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The function of HA is closely linked to its molecular weight. In situations of tissue damage, HMW HA undergoes degradation, resulting in smaller fragments: low molecular weight (LMW) HA and/or oligo HA. These smaller HA particles have been associated with stimulation of inflammatory mediators, corresponding to an activated cell state, whereas HMW HA inhibits the production of these inflammatory mediators [<xref rid="pone.0318277.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0318277.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>Despite HA being used in clinical treatment for IC/BPS and cystitis prevention, much is still unknown about its role(s) in the bladder wall. An in vitro IC/BPS model by Rooney et al., showed a decrease in inflammatory cytokines after HA therapy [<xref rid="pone.0318277.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>It is crucial to understand the localization and function of HA in healthy and inflamed urinary bladders. This study firstly aimed to give a novel insight in the location of HA in the normal urothelium and bladder wall and give new insights in various aspects of the functional contribution of HA in bladder wall homeostasis. For this we have developed a matured, terminally differentiated urothelial cell culture model with consistent high barrier properties. The first aim of this study was to validate epithelial barrier, inflammatory responses and recovery after damage in this primary urothelial cell culture model. We therefore assessed the degree of differentiation with immunohistochemistry (IHC) markers in the primary cell culture model and compared these with human and porcine bladder biopsies. Additionally, we performed functional assessments (transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) measurements). Secondly, the localization of HA was assessed through additional IHC, the functional contribution of HA was analyzed through its effect on TEER and gene expression of genes coding for GAG synthesis, inflammation markers and barrier markers. The third aim of this study was to evaluate the functional effect of three clinically applied GAG therapies on an inflamed in vitro model.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Materials, antibodies and other reagents</title><p>Unless specified otherwise, all chemicals were obtained from Merck (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany).

Immunohistochemical analysis revealed a close resemblance between human and porcine bladders, a resemblance also evident in NPU cultures and shown before [<xref rid="pone.0318277.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0318277.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Corresponding with the observations of Turner et al., NPU cultures exhibited tight junctions and umbrella cells, even before the differentiation protocol was fully implemented. Tight junctions and umbrella cells, seen in histological IHC analyses, indicate the presence of differentiated cells and barrier markers. Our results show that this does not confirm impermeability, since these conditions still generated low TEER values (approximately &#x0003c; 200 &#x02126;&#x02219;cm<sup>2</sup>) indicating a leaky epithelium [<xref rid="pone.0318277.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0318277.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. This emphasizes the necessity of incorporating functional assessments such as TEER measurements for epithelial barrier research using in vitro models. After adding differentiation medium, our model successfully emulated an impermeable urothelium, with the properties essential for investigating our research inquires.</p><sec id="sec016"><title>HA location and function</title><p>HA was found most abundant in the deeper layers of the human and porcine urothelium, this is in line with earlier studies [<xref rid="pone.0318277.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0318277.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The greater presence of HA around the cell membranes (<xref rid="pone.0318277.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B1</xref>) might be attributed to the HA production at the plasma membrane. Correspondingly, the HA receptor CD44 was identified around the basal cell layer of the urothelium, consistent with prior findings as well [<xref rid="pone.0318277.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Comparatively, the GAG composition in the deeper urothelial layer differs from that in the apical layer, of which the latter is mostly composed of CS [<xref rid="pone.0318277.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0318277.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0318277.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Our results did not find a direct involvement of HA as a barrier increasing GAG. Enzymatic digestion of HA in cell cultures did not lead to an increase in permeability, but unexpectantly resulted in a more impermeable barrier compared to untreated cells. These findings are contrary to the effects seen during the removal of CS [<xref rid="pone.0318277.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. When considering the location of CS and HA within or on top of the urothelium, it appears that the luminal presence of CS directly influences the barrier integrity and the GAGs found deeper within the urothelium, such as HA, do not seem to directly compromise the barrier following digestion [<xref rid="pone.0318277.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Similar findings were previously described for the basally located heparan sulfate [<xref rid="pone.0318277.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. As to the mechanism of increase in impermeability after enzymatic HA digestion, we can currently only speculate. There is literature that describes a mediating role for the TSG6 protein that interacts between the HA and the CD44 receptor that is worthwhile exploring for future research to further clarify this. On a cellular level, HA function and composition determined by different chain lengths are mediated via hyaluronidase and mediates cellular metabolism, cell surface proteins, cellular adhesion and consequently cell proliferation and migration. Even the HA breakdown products are biologically active and activate Toll-like receptors that activate inflammatory responses [<xref rid="pone.0318277.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>In response to inflammation (PS exposure), there was a robust and rapid increase in the expression of <italic toggle="yes">HAS2</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">HAS3</italic>. The rapid dynamic response of HA has been suggested to be possibly due to the simplicity of HA synthesis. HA production is regulated without affecting other GAG production in the Golgi, a potential explanation is the more complex regulation of the other GAGs, which involves not only controlling the GAG synthetic machinery but also managing the expression of core proteins [<xref rid="pone.0318277.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Rapid <italic toggle="yes">HAS2</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">HAS3</italic> upregulation is in correspondence with other studies looking into ketamine induced cystitis [<xref rid="pone.0318277.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>Removal of HA led to positive feedback through predominantly one HA synthesizing gene, <italic toggle="yes">HAS3</italic>. Though the HAS genes are similar in function and protein sequence, <italic toggle="yes">HAS3</italic> codes in particular for LMW HA, while <italic toggle="yes">HAS2</italic> is thought to result more in HMW HA, [<xref rid="pone.0318277.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0318277.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Hyaluronidase cleaves the HA polymer [<xref rid="pone.0318277.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] potentially yielding LMW HA and/or oligo HA. Contrary to HMW HA, LMW HA has been shown to promote the production of proinflammatory cytokines [<xref rid="pone.0318277.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0318277.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The increased <italic toggle="yes">IL8</italic> expression could possibly be explained, by the increased amount of LMW HA due to cleaving of HMW HA and increased <italic toggle="yes">HAS3</italic> expression. The upregulation of other GAG, proteoglycan and tight junctions RNA after GAG therapy with HA alone or in combination with CS does imply a role for HA in barrier regulation of the bladder urothelium. The only contrasting finding in this study was that this effect was not seen in PS damaged conditions as one would expect. Our study results therefore demonstrate that downstream effect of HA suppletion on urothelial cells are complex and currently not fully understood. An inhibited or delayed response may be caused by the induced inflammatory trigger and subsequent mediation of HA receptors like CD44 and RHAMM. Also, the additional effects of HA breakdown products on inflammatory responses via the Toll-like receptors play a role, these factors should be further explored [<xref rid="pone.0318277.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec017"><title>HA replenishment therapy alone or with CS</title><p>The second objective of this study was to investigate the effect of three different GAG therapies on the recovery of damaged NPU cells. We did not find a beneficial effect on TEER recovery of the three GAG therapies. Contrary to earlier findings of our research group that demonstrated a significant beneficial effect of CS treatment [<xref rid="pone.0318277.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. This difference could be potentially explained because the current model results in a notably tighter baseline epithelium with higher TEER values, even after PS treatment. Suggesting that the cells were less susceptible to damage and more resilient in repair. The recovery in TEER over 24 hours in all four groups was in line with earlier findings [<xref rid="pone.0318277.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0318277.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>Additionally, the effect of the GAG therapies was investigated on gene expression level. To do this comprehensively, first the effect of the therapies on healthy NPU cells was investigated (at T = 2). This showed an increase in the expression for the synthesis of HA, CS and HS. There was also an increase in expression for tight- and adherence junctions. These results suggest a fast response of the urothelium to generate a stronger urothelial barrier under influence of GAG therapies. The additional increase of pro-inflammatory cytokines under these circumstances could possibly be explained, as the acute phase reaction which sets off repair. This mild inflammatory response after GAG therapy was also seen in Rooney et al 2020 [<xref rid="pone.0318277.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p><p>Moreover, in the damaged setting (after treatment with PS) the synthesis of HA is stimulated and even further upregulated when GAG therapies are given. In 2020 Rooney et al. also showed modulation of the HA receptor genes after GAG therapy with HA [<xref rid="pone.0318277.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. For the other genes involved in GAG synthesis no evident modulation was seen, in contrary to earlier findings by Rooney et al. [<xref rid="pone.0318277.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. However, there are notable important differences between the applied models, including variations in cellular background, HA therapy dosage and duration. The application of well characterized differentiated primary cells and clinically relevant HA therapy dosage and duration in the applied in vitro model, along with the addition of functional assessments, makes the current model especially suited to adequately evaluate urothelial barrier properties.</p><p>Interestingly, inducing damage did not alter the expression of genes associated with barrier function as detected in undamaged cells. The additional therapy with GAGs also did not stimulate the expression of barrier molecules (also not after 24 hours, data not shown) as was seen in the undamaged setting. HA breakdown products or other downstream effects of protamine sulfate may sustain an inflammatory response and explain this impaired barrier recovery, but this needs further clarification [<xref rid="pone.0318277.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Even so, the functional barrier recovered within 24 hours in all groups, possibly because of the regulation of other genes related to barrier properties. It is unclear if this lack of effect in the damaged model is due to some prolonged effects of PS or if other types of cell damage may yield a different response.</p><p>Concerning inflammatory cytokines, there is an increased expression of <italic toggle="yes">IL8</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">IL6</italic> after GAG therapy in damaged cells. High levels of IL-6 are associated with a high degree of complains of IC/BPS [<xref rid="pone.0318277.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], additionally in vivo studies show lower IL-6 measurements in damaged bladders after weeks of GAG therapy [<xref rid="pone.0318277.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Our results would seem contrary, but IL-6 is involved in the acute phase reaction and plays an important role in the timely resolution of wound healing. The signaling of IL-6 is responsible for the switch to a reparative environment [<xref rid="pone.0318277.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0318277.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. This fits with our increased <italic toggle="yes">IL6</italic> (together with <italic toggle="yes">IL8</italic>) expression directly after inflammation, followed by normalization of the gene expression and full recovery of barrier function within 24 hours.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec018"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our results emphasize the biological interactions that HA has on urothelial cell inflammation and barrier repair physiology. Intravesical GAG therapies with HA does not seem to directly repair the urothelial luminal GAG layer but modulates this action through urothelial cell interactions. There is a need for future research to further explore possible very fast-acting mechanisms around HA and other GAGs, as well as the later effects concerning inflammation and repair. This is pivotal to fully clarify the kinetics of the urothelial response to damage and optimize potential therapeutic interventions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec019"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material id="pone.0318277.s001" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S1 Data</label><caption><title>Dataset PLOSONE.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0318277.s001.xlsx"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>There were no additional contributors to the research or manuscript who are not listed as authors.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0318277.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Parsons</surname><given-names>CL</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Greenspan</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Mulholland</surname><given-names>SG</given-names></name>. <article-title>The primary antibacterial defense mechanism of the bladder</article-title>. <source>Invest Urol</source>. <year>1975</year>;<volume>13</volume>(<issue>1</issue>):<fpage>72</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>8</lpage>. <pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">1095522</pub-id>

</p><p>2. Thank you for submitting the above manuscript to PLOS ONE. During our internal evaluation of the manuscript, we found significant text overlap between your submission and previous work in the [introduction, conclusion, etc.].</p><p>We would like to make you aware that copying extracts from previous publications, especially outside the methods section, word-for-word is unacceptable. In addition, the reproduction of text from published reports has implications for the copyright that may apply to the publications.</p><p>Please revise the manuscript to rephrase the duplicated text, cite your sources, and provide details as to how the current manuscript advances on previous work. Please note that further consideration is dependent on the submission of a manuscript that addresses these concerns about the overlap in text with published work.</p><p>[If the overlap is with the authors&#x02019; own works: Moreover, upon submission, authors must confirm that the manuscript, or any related manuscript, is not currently under consideration or accepted elsewhere. If related work has been submitted to PLOS ONE or elsewhere, authors must include a copy with the submitted article. Reviewers will be asked to comment on the overlap between related submissions (<ext-link xlink:href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/submission-guidelines#loc-related-manuscripts" ext-link-type="uri">http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/submission-guidelines#loc-related-manuscripts</ext-link>).]</p><p>We will carefully review your manuscript upon resubmission and further consideration of the manuscript is dependent on the text overlap being addressed in full. Please ensure that your revision is thorough as failure to address the concerns to our satisfaction may result in your submission not being considered further.</p><p>3. Thank you for stating the following in the Competing Interests section:</p><p>&#x0201c;author Dick A.W. Janssen has received government support (ZonMW grant) for research regarding IC/BPS and GAG therapy. Authors have no further conflicts of interest to report.&#x0201d;</p><p>Please confirm that this does not alter your adherence to all PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials, by including the following statement: "This does not alter our adherence to&#x000a0; PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.&#x0201d; (as detailed online in our guide for authors <ext-link xlink:href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/competing-interests" ext-link-type="uri">http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/competing-interests</ext-link>).&#x000a0; If there are restrictions on sharing of data and/or materials, please state these. Please note that we cannot proceed with consideration of your article until this information has been declared.</p><p>Please include your updated Competing Interests statement in your cover letter; we will change the online submission form on your behalf.</p><p>4. We note that you have included the phrase &#x0201c;data not shown&#x0201d; in your manuscript. Unfortunately, this does not meet our data sharing requirements. PLOS does not permit references to inaccessible data. We require that authors provide all relevant data within the paper, Supporting Information files, or in an acceptable, public repository. Please add a citation to support this phrase or upload the data that corresponds with these findings to a stable repository (such as Figshare or Dryad) and provide and URLs, DOIs, or accession numbers that may be used to access these data. Or, if the data are not a core part of the research being presented in your study, we ask that you remove the phrase that refers to these data.</p><p>Additional Editor Comments:</p><p>Thank you for submitting the following manuscript to PLOS ONE.</p><p>Please revise the manuscript according to the reviewers' comments and upload the revised file.</p><p>[Note: HTML markup is below.

However, there are some points that need to be addressed by the authors.</p><p>1. The manuscript is not easily readable for not experts in the field. For example, the authors should clearly indicate what is and the mechanism of action of protamine sulfate. In the introduction should be added a brief explanation of how GAG and in particular hyaluronan is synthesized explaining the role of HASes. TEER technique should be briefly explained.</p><p>2. The authors should measure or localize TSG6 which is a HA binding protein with could have a role in the barrier function modifying HA.</p><p>3. The authors should show controls for the experiments with hyaluronidase and PS indicating a remodeling of the ECM.</p><p>4. Authors should check abbreviations throughout the text (i.e., sometimes they used HA sometimes hyaluronic acid...).</p><p>5. What is the molecular mass of commercial HA the authors added to digested samples (GAG-therapies)? What about if a different MW HA was used?</p><p>6. 4-methylumbelliferone, an aspecific inhibitor of HA synthases, could be used to show the role of HA in the barrier.</p><p>Reviewer #2:&#x000a0;This is a very interesting research and article on function and location of HA in the urothelial cell.</p><p>A few comments for the authors:</p><p>Introduction: the authors should emphasize more on the novelty of this research, what will this research add to the existing publications on this topic.</p><p>Methods: the authors should add a justification of the use of porcine model for this research, since they used a human bladder tissue as well. What was the aim of the comparison between the human and porcine tissue?</p><p>Discussion: Is there any explanation as to why enzymatic digestion of HA in cell cultures did not lead to an increased permeability, moreover resulted in a more impermeable barrier? Why is this different with the removal of CS?</p><p>Another interesting phenomenon is that damage did not alter the expression of genes associated with barrier</p><p>function, is there any explanation which could be added in the discussion?</p><p>Reviewer #3:&#x000a0;In this manuscript, van Ginkel at al show the localization of hyaluronic acid in tissue specimen of normal human and porcine urothelium, as well as evaluate different GAG replenishment therapies, used in clinical practice for treating interstitial cystitis, in in vitro model. Though the manuscript presents novel information and is potentially of interest, it presents with some flaws and it might lead to premature conclusions. Some additional experiments are required as well as improvements in the manuscript before it would be suitable for publication.</p><p>1. The third objective was to evaluate GAG therapies on an inflamed in vitro model, however, treating cells with PS does not lead to a substantial inflammation as seen in patients with IC/BPS. An in vitro model that employes PS together with another agent, such as LPS, TNFa or H2O2 should be used to better explain the effects of GAG therapies. I would strongly encourage the authors to add these additional experiments.</p><p>2. Methods: in all descriptions the number of biological replicates and technical replicates (number of independent experiments) is missing. Please add this information. Please also add how many human and porcine biopsies were used.</p><p>3. Why was the in vitro cell culture not prepared from human tissue since it was available?</p><p>4. Why did you decide to use different differentiation protocols for different experiments? If a very high TEER was achieved after 3 weeks of culture, why these cells were not used in subsequent experiments?</p><p>5. Why did you only evaluate gene expression of tight junctions? These should also be evaluated using ICH or IF, since gene expression does not always reflect the protein expression nor the distribution of tight junctions.</p><p>6. Statistical analysis: which post-hoc test was used to assess the differences between groups? Please add.</p><p>7. You state that HA was most abundantly present in the basal membrane of the urothelium, however, this should be labeled to justify your findings.</p><p>8. In figures with ICH, the scale bars are missing.</p><p>9. All figures should include information on how many biological/technical replicates, the labeling or other analysis was performed.</p><p>10. All figures should include an explanation of what we see: is it mean or median+/- SD, SEM?</p><p>11. Figure 3a: there is no legend explaining what individual lines represent.</p><p>12. Figure 4: please add what does the dotted line at y=1 indicate. Please also change graphs to show each individual value of a biological/technical replicate. Were there no significant results in this graph?</p><p>13. Why would GAG therapy increase inflammatory markers? I am not sure that the explanation about acute phase response is enough. If this is correct, then the expression of other markers that indicate resolution of inflammation or tissue fibrosis should also be evaluated.</p><p>14. If the integrity of urothelium recovers anyway after 24h then what is the point of treatment with GAG replenishment therapy? As written before, additional experiments with a more prominent inducement of inflammation should be employed.</p><p>15. For in vitro differentiation of NPU cells achieving high TEER values after 3 weeks, and resemblance with normal human urothelium, the protocol has already been described in literature.

</p><p>16. Why would be beneficial to generate a stronger urothelial barrier in healthy urothelium? But then in damaged urothelium, this therapy fails to improve the barrier? You are trying to replicate IC/BPS in which there is a leaky urothelium, do you implicate that this kind of therapy should not be used in IC/BPS? How would your findings translate into clinical settings?</p><p>17. Why would a mild inflammatory response increase impermeability of urothelium? In IC/BPS, there is an inflammatory response with increased permeability &#x02013; inflammatory mediators are thought to further increase the damage of urothelial cells and further increase permeability though a positive feedback mechanism? How do you comment on this?</p><p>Reviewer #4:&#x000a0;Presented manuscript deals with the function and occurrence of hyaluronic acid in urinary bladder epithelia. The manuscript is well written and uses appropriate methods to validate its claims. However, there are some minor issues that need to be resolved</p><p>1. Materials and methods, line 135 - The term &#x000bb;binocular microscopy&#x000ab; does not indicate the type of analysis. Bright field microscopy would be more appropriate in this case.</p><p>2. Results, line 193 &#x02013; It is unusual to use the term basal membrane of the urothelium because in this multilayered epithelium each cell has its own basal part of the membrane. Since the hyaluronic acid is most likely located extracellularly its location can be described as occurring at the basement membrane or basal lamina. Fig. 2A.2 shows the situation after hialuronidase treatment, so that no labelling is visible. Presumably Fig. 2A.3 is supposed to show the porcine biopsy.</p><p>3. In Material and Methods section it is not described whether GAGs and hyaluronidase were added from the apical or basal side of the inserts. Since most proteoglicans and GAGs are located at the basal side, application from the apical side may not be effective if the epithelium is undamaged. For this reason, the application procedure should be described in the Material and Methods section.</p><p>4. Results, lines 267, 268 &#x02013; Since treatment with low and high molecular mass GAG can give different results on the expression of genes for GAG or IL synthesis, the molecular mass of HA used in these experiments should be reported here?</p><p>5. Discussion, line 313 From the provided immages it is not possible to determine if HA is attached to the memberanes or even if this HA is located extracellularly or inside the cells. Aditionally, authors should explain what membrane-bound HA production means? HA is secreted from the cells by exocytosis and can only be attached to the membranes afterwards.</p><p>6. Discussion, lines 334,335 &#x02013; Since inflammation usually decreases barrier function, the authors should explain how it could increase the impermeability of the urothelium?</p><p>7. Discussion, line 349 &#x02013; The authors should explain why the addition of GAGs would increase the synthesis of new GAGs. Normally, the oversupply of molecules in the tissue decreases the synthesis of these molecules. The explanation should be confirmed by relevant literature.</p><p>**********</p><p>6.

</p><p>Reviewer #1</p><p>The manuscript by Van Ginkel and collaborators is interesting. However, there are some points that need to be addressed by the authors.</p><p>1. The manuscript is not easily readable for not experts in the field. For example, the authors should clearly indicate what is and the mechanism of action of protamine sulfate. In the introduction should be added a brief explanation of how GAG and in particular hyaluronan is synthesized explaining the role of HASes. TEER technique should be briefly explained.</p><p>Thank you for this valid comment. We have added more information to explain more the roles and mechanism of actions, to increase the readability.</p><p>2. The authors should measure or localize TSG6 which is a HA binding protein with could have a role in the barrier function modifying HA.</p><p>Thank you for this interesting contribution. There is indeed a lot of research showing an interaction between TSG-6 and HA. There is little known on the role of TSG-6 in IC/BPS specifically.</p><p>Previous research suggests that the function of TSG-6 (partly) relays on immune response/ immune cells with an interaction with CD44. We did not investigate the role of TSG-6 in the bladder. However, this is a very interesting possibility for future in vivo research or animal studies. We added this to the discussion section</p><p>3. The authors should show controls for the experiments with hyaluronidase and PS indicating a remodeling of the ECM.</p><p>We compared all experiments with untreated controls in both TEER and qPCR experiments. This information is also in the figures (qPCR up or downregulation compared to controls). A functional assay like TEER is matced with controls and gives a read out on epithelial barrier function realtiume. In our model TEER and therefore functionality is restored within 24 hrs, therefore ECM remodeling via other analyses such as SEM may provide some extra data, but we consider the current analyses sufficient to support the conclusions of this manuscript.</p><p>4. Authors should check abbreviations throughout the text (i.e., sometimes they used HA sometimes hyaluronic acid...).</p><p>Thank you, this inconsistency has been corrected.</p><p>5. What is the molecular mass of commercial HA the authors added to digested samples (GAG-therapies)? What about if a different MW HA was used?</p><p>The range for HA in Ialuril is between 1400KDalton and 2000KDalton. For Instylan the molecular weight is 2000KDalton. The MW has been added to the manuscript 85-88.</p><p>A higher molecular weight has been investigated, as so called superGag (crosslinked GAG molecules with higher molecular weights). For both CS and HA, these SuperGAGs have demonstrated an increased effectiveness in restoring barrier function in vitro, characterized by impermeability, compared to regular GAGs [2, 3]. So interestingly, this could have potential in future in vivo/clinical studies.</p><p>6. 4-methylumbelliferone, an aspecific inhibitor of HA synthases, could be used to show the role of HA in the barrier.</p><p>Indeed, there are additional modulating molecules (promotors/inhibitors) that could be used to further clarify the in vivo role of HA.</p><p>In the current study we chose to specifically remove HA (using hyaluronidase) and add HA (using GAG-therapy) artificially, in cell cultures. This gives the first insight in the role of HA in the urothelial barrier. To gain further insight in the complex dynamics of modulating molecules, that effect HA expression and function, additional research is necessary. Although this was outside of the scope of the current study, it would be a very interesting starting point future research.</p><p>Reviewer #2</p><p>This is a very interesting research and article on function and location of HA in the urothelial cell.</p><p>A few comments for the authors:</p><p>Introduction: the authors should emphasize more on the novelty of this research, what will this research add to the existing publications on this topic.</p><p>Thank you for this comment. We have rephrased parts of the introduction to better emphasizes the novelty of our research.</p><p>Methods: the authors should add a justification of the use of porcine model for this research, since they used a human bladder tissue as well. What was the aim of the comparison between the human and porcine tissue?</p><p>It is currently not feasible to obtain sufficient primary human urothelial cells from biopsies to perform these experiments. In our laboratory, efforts are underway to develop three-dimensional human cell cultures (organoids) for use in in vitro studies. Porcine bladder offers a matching anatomic and histochemical mimicry to the human bladder and therefore providing a practical alternative to facilitate these experiments. We used human and porcine bladder biopsies in our IHC experiments to show that there is this biologic mimicry and to show that our differentiated primary porcine cell cultures maintain there biological and histochemical properties, all in order to validate our in vitro model. By demonstrating similar characteristics between human and porcine tissue, we believe these studies yield valuable insights into the function of GAGs and GAG therapy in human tissue.</p><p>Discussion: Is there any explanation as to why enzymatic digestion of HA in cell cultures did not lead to an increased permeability, moreover resulted in a more impermeable barrier? Why is this different with the removal of CS?</p><p>Another interesting phenomenon is that damage did not alter the expression of genes associated with barrier function, is there any explanation which could be added in the discussion?</p><p>Earlier research from our group has shown that CS digestion leads to an increased permeability. Moreover, these results also showed that removal of Heparan Sulfate (HS) did not induce any alterations in the barrier function [4, 5]. Logically , we did not expect the results we obtained from our hyaluronidase experiments and amended our discussion to elaborate this response to HA digestion further. Taking this together with the results from our study, when considering the immunohistochemical staining of CS, HS and HA, it appears that the luminal presence of CS directly influences the barrier integrity. Conversely, GAGs found deeper within the urothelium, such as HS and HA, do not seem to directly compromise the barrier following digestion.</p><p>This has been added in 330-333</p><p>Regarding the lack of changes in barrier-related gene expression, we address this in the manuscript lines 414-415. Future research could explore broader gene analysis, other types of damage (e.g., TNF-&#x003b1;), or varying PS dose and duration.</p><p>Reviewer #3</p><p>In this manuscript, van Ginkel at al show the localization of hyaluronic acid in tissue specimen of normal human and porcine urothelium, as well as evaluate different GAG replenishment therapies, used in clinical practice for treating interstitial cystitis, in in vitro model. Though the manuscript presents novel information and is potentially of interest, it presents with some flaws and it might lead to premature conclusions. Some additional experiments are required as well as improvements in the manuscript before it would be suitable for publication.</p><p>1. The third objective was to evaluate GAG therapies on an inflamed in vitro model, however, treating cells with PS does not lead to a substantial inflammation as seen in patients with IC/BPS. An in vitro model that employes PS together with another agent, such as LPS, TNFa or H2O2 should be used to better explain the effects of GAG therapies. I would strongly encourage the authors to add these additional experiments.</p><p>Thank you for your thorough feedback. We used protamine sulphate in our experiment because of its very specific effect in neutralising the GAG-layer and increasing permeability, which was our primary objective for this study. PS is commonly used in in vitro models to increase the permeability of the urothelial barrier [6]. In our experiments it had the desired effect of a consistent response in increasing the permeability by inducing mild inflammation (reducing the TEER), without killing cells which is much more common in H2O2.</p><p>We have previously used LPS in non-published experiments, but results were less consistent in damage and recovery compared to protamine. Also, because this inflammatory agent is more commonly associated with bacterial infections and less with IC/BPS, we opted not to use it. TNF-alfa has indeed been used in IC/BPS research, and seems to create a good inflammation model, and is of interest due to its immune modelling effect. It would be very interesting to compare TNF-alfa with the protamine experiments for future research.</p><p>2. Methods: in all descriptions the number of biological replicates and technical replicates (number of independent experiments) is missing. Please add this information. Please also add how many human and porcine biopsies were used.</p><p>Good remark, this information has been added. (s.125, s.127, s.157, s164, s177)</p><p>3. Why was the in vitro cell culture not prepared from human tissue since it was available?</p><p>It is currently not feasible to obtain sufficient primary human urothelial cells from biopsies to perform these experiments and terminally differentiated urothelial cells with a very high barrier function were needed for our experiments. Therefore, human cell lines were not a good options and based on literature, immortalized cell cultures (so far) did not yield high TEER values compared to our in vitro model. In our laboratory, efforts are underway to develop three-dimensional human cell cultures (organoids) for use in in vitro studies. Porcine urothelial cells provide a practical alternative to facilitate these experiments. By demonstrating similar characteristics between human and porcine tissue, we believe these studies yield valuable insights into the function of GAGs and GAG therapy in human tissue. Ultimately, our goal is to culture human IC/BPS cells and conduct experiments directly on these human-based models.</p><p>4. Why did you decide to use different differentiation protocols for different experiments? If a very high TEER was achieved after 3 weeks of culture, why these cells were not used in subsequent experiments?</p><p>The cells for TEER measurements and for gene expression were cultured in different wells/membranes of different sizes. This was inherent to the materials needed for both experiments. We did not base the culture and differentiation protocol on the timeline but on evaluation of the cell growth and terminal differentiation.</p><p>Cells in the wells were grown until confluent and then differentiated for one week, this is indeed shorter than for the TEER experiment. We have experimented (unpublished ) with TEER measured in smaller and larger surface transwells and found that confluency plays a mayor part in differentiation. After one week of differentiation the cells were healthy and IHC showed a network of tight junctions indicating a differentiated (tight) epithelium(figure 1 B, ZO-1 expression).</p><p>TEER is measured in real-time experiment along time.</p><p>5. Why did you only evaluate gene expression of tight junctions? These should also be evaluated using ICH or IF, since gene expression does not always reflect the protein expression nor the distribution of tight junctions.</p><p>We did demonstrate tight junction formation in our in vitro model in figure 1. TEER function is highly dependent on tight junction formation, therefore we considered this as the best functional / dynamic outcome measure for complete barrier and tight junction function. IHC as outcome measure after damage could have provided some extra information on this, but is not conclusive of barrier function as mentioned in the discussion: &#x02018;Corresponding with the observations of Turner et al., NPU cultures exhibited tight junctions and umbrella cells, even before the differentiation protocol was fully implemented. Tight junctions and umbrella cells, seen in histological IHC analyses, indicate the presence of differentiated cells and barrier markers, and urothelial tight junction impairment has been observed after protamine sulfate exposure. Our results show that this does not confirm impermeability, since these conditions still generated low TEER values (approximately &#x0003c;200 &#x02126;&#x02219;cm&#x000b2;) indicating a leaky epithelium [8, 9].&#x02019;</p><p>Tight junction IF analyses was therefore regarded as being an inferior outcome measurement to the real-time TEER measurements. Nonetheless; the effect of PS on tight junctions quality on IHF/IF has been shown by a our group in this previous study [7].</p><p>6. Statistical analysis: which post-hoc test was used to assess the differences between groups? Please add.</p><p>A Bonferroni post-hoc analysis was used. We have added this to the manuscript under &#x02018;statistical analyses.&#x02019;</p><p>7. You state that HA was most abundantly present in the basal membrane of the urothelium, however, this should be labelled to justify your findings.</p><p>Arrows are present in figure 2 IHC in A1 and A3, it shows a darker colouring around where the basal membrane of the urothelium is located. We have slightly altered the wording in our results to better describe our findings.</p><p>Furthermore, in figure 2 IHC B1 and B2 we have added what the apical side of the cell culture is, this shows that HA expression is most pronounced in cell membranes and cells just below the most apical layer.</p><p>8. In figures with ICH, the scale bars are missing.</p><p>We have tried various lay outs for our images, we eventually chose to show the magnification factor in the lower right corner of each image. We found this resulted in the most legible and least crowded overall image, while still showing al the necessary information.</p><p>9. All figures should include information on how many biological/technical replicates, the labeling or other analysis was performed.</p><p>We have added the replicates numbers to the figure captions.</p><p>10. All figures should include an explanation of what we see: is it mean or median+/- SD, SEM?</p><p>Thank you for the feedback, numbers a presented as mean +/- standard deviation. Where applicable, it has been added to the figure description text.</p><p>11. Figure 3a: there is no legend explaining what individual lines represent.</p><p>All different shades of blue/grey represent (individual) untreated insert cultures that were followed over time. This figure aims to show that all untreated cultured inserts increased in TEER over time.</p><p>A legend has been added.</p><p>12. Figure 4: please add what does the dotted line at y=1 indicate. Please also change graphs to show each individual value of a biological/technical replicate. Were there no significant results in this graph?</p><p>Expressions of hyaluronidase and protamine in figure 4 are relative and compared to the control/untreated of that respective timepoint. The expression in untreated T5-T24 are relative to untreated T3, the dotted line at y1 is this control line. This has been added to the text description figure 4. We have also added this to figure 5, the dotted line is also presented there.</p><p>The main goal of the figure is to show differences in relative expressions and the curves over time. Therefore, and to aid legibility, we did not add the exact numbers to the graphs. No statistical analysis was conducted due to the limited sample size. As technical replicates cannot be combined to account for variability, statistical testing was not feasible and therefore we reported descriptive results.</p><p>13. Why would GAG therapy increase inflammatory markers? I am not sure that the explanation about acute phase response is enough. If this is correct, then the expression of other markers that indicate resolution of inflammation or tissue fibrosis should also be evaluated.</p><p>This finding is &#x02018;unexpected&#x02019; for GAG therapy. Most studies that evaluate GAG therapy do not evaluate inflammation in the very short time frame and this response is therefore likely missed in these studies. Inflammation responses and subsequent repair responses may differ in timing when it occurs and stops. Interestingly, if you look at a study by Rooney et al, where TNF-a-induced inflammation was treated with HA for 24 hours.
