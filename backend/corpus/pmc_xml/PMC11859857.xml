However, applicable photothermal agents associated with its photothermal activated immunogenic cell death remain exploiting. <bold>Methods</bold>: This study evaluates the effectiveness of IR813, a photothermal agent, combined with near-infrared (NIR) light for cancer treatment. In vitro, 4T1 cancer cells were treated with IR813 (5 &#x003bc;g/mL) and exposed to NIR irradiation (1 W/cm<sup>2</sup>) for 5 min. In vivo, after the tumor-bearing mice administered with IR813 (1 mg/kg) and exposed to NIR irradiation (1 W/cm<sup>2</sup>) for 10 min, the tumor volume, survival and immune activation were evaluated. <bold>Results</bold>: IR813 significantly increased the cytotoxicity of 4T1 cancer cells following near-infrared irradiation, resulting in the release of damage-associated molecular patterns and immunogenic cell death. Specifically, the cell viability was reduced to 5% compared to the control group. In vivo, irradiating the accumulation of IR813 at the tumor site had the potential to mediate substantial photothermal tumor suppression, improved mouse survival, and reduced metastasis, with minimal adverse reactions. Furthermore, the immune responses stimulated by IR813-induced photothermal therapy were evidenced by increased mature dendritic cell and cytotoxic T lymphocyte counts and a decrease in regulatory T cells in the spleen, tumor, and lymph nodes. <bold>Conclusions</bold>: These findings suggest that IR813-induced photothermal therapy is a promising approach for enhancing immunotherapy, directly inhibiting tumors while boosting systemic anti-cancer immunity.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>photothermal therapy</kwd><kwd>triple-negative breast cancer</kwd><kwd>immunogenic cell death</kwd><kwd>antitumor immunity</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>Science and Technology Innovation Plan Laboratory Animal Research Project of Shanghai</funding-source><award-id>23141900400</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>Excellent Young Medical and Pharmaceutical Talents Training Program of Health System of Shanghai Minhang District</funding-source><award-id>mwyjyx13</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>National Natural Science Foundation of China</funding-source><award-id>82172746</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the Science and Technology Innovation Plan Laboratory Animal Research Project of Shanghai (23141900400), Excellent Young Medical and Pharmaceutical Talents Training Program of Health System of Shanghai Minhang District (mwyjyx13), and National Natural Science Foundation of China (82172746).</funding-statement></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-pharmaceutics-17-00166"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>In the ongoing effort to overcome key challenges in cancer therapy, such as tumor recurrence [<xref rid="B1-pharmaceutics-17-00166" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], metastasis [<xref rid="B2-pharmaceutics-17-00166" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], and side effects [<xref rid="B3-pharmaceutics-17-00166" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], the scientific community [<xref rid="B4-pharmaceutics-17-00166" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] continues to explore innovative therapeutic strategies to enhance efficacy and minimize adverse reactions. Photothermal therapy, a promising new treatment method, uses near-infrared (NIR) light converted into heat by photothermal agents to selectively kill tumor cells [<xref rid="B5-pharmaceutics-17-00166" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-pharmaceutics-17-00166" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-pharmaceutics-17-00166" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Photothermal therapy offers targeted treatment with potentially lower systemic toxicity [<xref rid="B8-pharmaceutics-17-00166" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-pharmaceutics-17-00166" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In recent years, there has been a notable emergence of molecules with near-infrared absorption and photothermal effects, which have become widely utilized in the activation of immunity for the purpose of photoimmunotherapy in the treatment of tumors [<xref rid="B10-pharmaceutics-17-00166" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-pharmaceutics-17-00166" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-pharmaceutics-17-00166" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. As a high-end NIR fluorescence probe, IR813 has clearly demonstrated its key role in biomedical imaging, primarily because of its deep tissue penetration and minimal background interference. IR813, when doped into silica nanoparticles, has the properties of high brightness, photostability, and non-toxicity. These enable efficient hepatobiliary excretion and accurate lymph node mapping. Similarly, the use of IR813 in the synthesis of red-emitting carbon dots results in far-red emission and has potential for solvent polarity sensing and applications in in vivo imaging and drug delivery [<xref rid="B13-pharmaceutics-17-00166" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-pharmaceutics-17-00166" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-pharmaceutics-17-00166" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. As a kind of cyanine derivatives, IR813 has demonstrated its potential as a highly efficient infrared absorber, capable of converting absorbed light energy into thermal energy [<xref rid="B16-pharmaceutics-17-00166" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. This unique photothermal conversion property not only strengthens its position in high-resolution biomedical imaging but also opens new avenues for a wide range of photothermal therapy applications. It can reach the tumor through blood circulation and trigger cell death upon NIR exposure. Beyond its direct effects, the immunogenic cell death induced by IR813 with NIR light is of particular interest [<xref rid="B17-pharmaceutics-17-00166" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-pharmaceutics-17-00166" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-pharmaceutics-17-00166" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-pharmaceutics-17-00166" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. This process may activate the immune system to detect and destroy lingering cancer cells.</p><p>This study aims to determine the potential of IR813 in combination with NIR to induce immunogenic cell death in tumor cells. We administered 5 &#x003bc;g/mL of IR813 to 4T1 breast cancer cells and found that under NIR irradiation, significant cell death occurred within 3 h. Immunofluorescence and ELISA kits were used to detect the release of immunogenic substances such as ATP, calreticulin (CRT), and high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1). In vivo, we analyzed the proportion of mature DCs in sentinel lymph nodes to confirm tumor antigen exposure; we analyzed changes in cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and inhibitory Treg cells in splenic cells to determine immune activation in mice; and we detected the infiltration of CTLs and a reduction in Tregs at the tumor site, indicating an improvement in the tumor immune microenvironment. Finally, by analyzing tumor growth and survival in tumor-bearing mice, we confirmed the potential therapeutic effects of photothermal-induced ICD on tumors. Through detailed in vitro and in vivo experiments, we aimed to investigate the mechanisms by which IR813 and NIR treatment release damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) that lead to the release of calreticulin (CRT), HMGB1, and ATP and, shortly thereafter, induce an immune response [<xref rid="B21-pharmaceutics-17-00166" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-pharmaceutics-17-00166" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Our findings cover immune reactions in key sites like the spleen, tumor tissue, and lymph nodes, providing insights into the extensive immunomodulatory effects of this therapy.</p><p>As illustrated in <xref rid="pharmaceutics-17-00166-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, this research promises to deepen our understanding of how IR813 functions as a photothermal agent and explores its ability to enhance the immunogenic cell death pathway and support the immune system in fighting tumor progression. This could lead to innovative, integrated cancer treatment strategies that combine photothermal treatments and immunotherapy, pushing forward the development of personalized and effective cancer care.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-pharmaceutics-17-00166"><title>2.

Results</title><sec id="sec3dot1-pharmaceutics-17-00166"><title>3.1. Characterization</title><p>IR813 is a hydrophobic molecule. To solubilize it, we used a small amount of DMSO, enhancing its distinctive absorption characteristics in the NIR region, particularly the pronounced peak at 813 nm (<xref rid="pharmaceutics-17-00166-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>A). The absorption strength showed a strong linear correlation with concentrations ranging from 5 to 100 &#x000b5;g/mL, proving highly accurate as a quantitative probe (<xref rid="app1-pharmaceutics-17-00166" ref-type="app">Figure S1</xref>). Additionally, IR813 demonstrated exceptional long-wavelength fluorescence properties, emitting a robust spectral signal at approximately 820 nm following excitation with 740 nm light. The fluorescence intensity at this wavelength maintained a direct proportionality with concentrations between 1 and 5 &#x000b5;g/mL, underscoring its potential for in vivo fluorescence imaging (<xref rid="pharmaceutics-17-00166-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>B,D). Furthermore, IR813 showed excellent photothermal conversion performance. Under laser irradiation at a power density of 1 W/cm<sup>2</sup>, 40 &#x000b5;g/mL IR813 solution could achieve a temperature increase of approximately 10 degrees Celsius (<xref rid="pharmaceutics-17-00166-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>C), with this photothermal heating being concentration-dependent. These results confirm IR813&#x02032;s significant potential as an agent for both fluorescence imaging and photothermal conversion in biomedical applications.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot2-pharmaceutics-17-00166"><title>3.2. Immunogenic Cell Death</title><p>After 2 h, 4T1 tumor cells were first exposed to an 808 nm NIR laser for 5 min (1 W/cm<sup>2</sup>), which was sufficient for the cells to take up the maximum value of IR813 (<xref rid="app1-pharmaceutics-17-00166" ref-type="app">Figure S2</xref>). The results revealed significant cell damage, as indicated by live/dead cell imaging assays, and most of the treated cells stained positive for propidium iodide (PI) (<xref rid="pharmaceutics-17-00166-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>A), highlighting the lethal efficacy of IR813 + NIR in 4T1 cells. Further investigations using LDH release and CCK-8 cell viability assays confirmed a dramatic reduction in cell viability to less than 5% post-treatment (<xref rid="pharmaceutics-17-00166-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>C,D and <xref rid="app1-pharmaceutics-17-00166" ref-type="app">Figure S3</xref>), robustly supporting the superior antitumor activity of IR813 + NIR, which was more effective than ICG + NIR in the same conditions (<xref rid="app1-pharmaceutics-17-00166" ref-type="app">Figure S4</xref>). Detailed analysis showed that treated tumor cells not only displayed typical signs of cell death but also exhibited cytoplasmic vacuolation and a significant increase in membrane bubbling (<xref rid="pharmaceutics-17-00166-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>B), characteristics of pyroptosis [<xref rid="B23-pharmaceutics-17-00166" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24-pharmaceutics-17-00166" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. This suggests that the treatment may have induced immunogenic cell death. Following IR813 + NIR therapy, increased CRT exposure on the surface of the endoplasmic reticulum and release of HMGB1 from nuclei into the extracellular environment were demonstrated by immunofluorescence staining (<xref rid="pharmaceutics-17-00166-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>E,F). Additionally, there was a massive ATP release (<xref rid="app1-pharmaceutics-17-00166" ref-type="app">Figure S2</xref>) and elevated levels of DAMPs (<xref rid="pharmaceutics-17-00166-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>E,F and <xref rid="app1-pharmaceutics-17-00166" ref-type="app">Figure S5</xref>), indicating a potential to activate immune responses. Notably, no significant ROS generation was detected in the cells post-treatment (<xref rid="pharmaceutics-17-00166-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>G), suggesting that the cell death mechanism may not have relied on conventional ROS-mediated pathways. Overall, the combination of IR813 with NIR irradiation consistently displayed remarkable cytotoxicity and features of pyroptosis across various tumor cell models, including 4T1 (<xref rid="pharmaceutics-17-00166-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>H and <xref rid="app1-pharmaceutics-17-00166" ref-type="app">Figure S6</xref>), further underscoring its potential in antitumor therapy. In vitro experiments demonstrated the potent cytotoxic effects of IR813 combined with NIR light irradiation.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot3-pharmaceutics-17-00166"><title>3.3. In Vivo Antitumor Effects</title><p>In the in vivo antitumor experiments, a significant temperature increase was observed within the tumor region after the intravenous administration of the NIR dye IR813 at a dosage of 1 mg/kg for 2 h, when IR813 at the tumor site reached its maximum (<xref rid="app1-pharmaceutics-17-00166" ref-type="app">Figure S7</xref>), and when exposure to NIR light was at an intensity of 1 W/cm<sup>2</sup> for 10 min. Photothermal imaging showed that the temperature increase matched the tumor&#x02019;s contour rather than forming a uniform circular spot, suggesting the selective accumulation of IR813 in tumor tissues and its potent photothermal conversion properties in vivo (<xref rid="pharmaceutics-17-00166-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>B and <xref rid="app1-pharmaceutics-17-00166" ref-type="app">Figure S8</xref>). Further studies confirmed the inhibitory effect of IR813 + NIR on tumor growth. Bioluminescence imaging monitored tumor progression in tumor-bearing mice (<xref rid="pharmaceutics-17-00166-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>C), and continuous measurements of tumor volume changes demonstrated that the treatment effectively suppressed tumor proliferation (<xref rid="pharmaceutics-17-00166-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>D) and prolonged survival times in these mice (<xref rid="pharmaceutics-17-00166-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>F). Using hematoxylin and eosin (H&#x00026;E) staining for the histopathologic evaluation of the lungs, the results showed a potential reduction in metastatic nodules compared to control groups (<xref rid="app1-pharmaceutics-17-00166" ref-type="app">Figure S9</xref>). Throughout the treatment, the body weights of the mice did not change significantly during the treatment period (<xref rid="pharmaceutics-17-00166-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>E), and no pathological changes were observed in major organs such as the heart, spleen, and kidneys, indicating that IR813 did not cause significant systemic toxicity under the administered doses and treatment regimens (<xref rid="pharmaceutics-17-00166-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>G).</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot4-pharmaceutics-17-00166"><title>3.4. In Vivo Immune Activation</title><p>Building on previous cellular-level research that confirmed the IR813 + NIR treatment&#x02019;s ability to trigger significant DAMP release from tumor cells, thereby stimulating immune responses, further in-depth animal model investigations were conducted. We focused on the dynamic changes in immune activation within the spleen, tumor tissue, and tumor-related sentinel lymph nodes, such as the inguinal lymph nodes. The percentage of mature dendritic cells (DCs) in the sentinel lymph nodes increased significantly from 12.8% to 20.0% in the initial studies (<xref rid="pharmaceutics-17-00166-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>B), highlighting effective antigen presentation essential for triggering immune responses. Subsequent analysis revealed notable changes in immune cell composition in the spleen. The proportion of mature DCs increased from 21.7% to 26.5%, that of cytotoxic T lymphocytes rose from 3.3% to 10.53%, and that of regulatory T cells decreased from 34.9% to 22.4% (<xref rid="pharmaceutics-17-00166-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>A), signaling a significantly activated immune state in mice treated with IR813 and NIR. Direct assessments of intratumoral immune responses corroborated these findings. The percentage of mature DCs within the tumor increased from 23.6% to 29.4%, that of cytotoxic T lymphocytes increased from 25.4% to 37.9%, and that of regulatory T cells decreased dramatically from 41.0% to 23.2% (<xref rid="pharmaceutics-17-00166-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>A). These changes indicate that IR813 plus NIR treatment historically enhanced effector T cell infiltration into the tumor core, boosting the immune system&#x02019;s ability to attack tumor cells and contributing to the inhibition of tumor growth and metastasis.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec4-pharmaceutics-17-00166"><title>4. Conclusions</title><p>This study verifies the therapeutic benefits of IR813, a photothermal agent activated by NIR irradiation, in cancer treatment. In vitro, IR813 + NIR demonstrates potent cytotoxic effects on 4T1 cells by inducing immunogenic cell death and releasing DAMPs, which are crucial for initiating immune responses. In vivo, IR813 + NIR has the ability to suppress tumors and enhance survival rates with minimal toxicity, underscoring its potential for clinical safety. The treatment not only facilitates direct tumor ablation but also prompts a systemic immune response, characterized by increased mature dendritic cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes and decreased regulatory T cells at key immune sites. The dual actions of photothermal and immune stimulation make IR813 + NIR therapy a promising approach to augment cancer immunotherapy, combining tumor destruction with immune system engagement to curb growth and prevent metastasis. Compared to the commonly used near-infrared photothermal reagent indocyanine green (ICG), IR813 demonstrates rapid and effective cell-killing capabilities at lower concentrations in vitro, and it can quickly expose immunogenic substances. The dual actions of photothermal and immune stimulation make IR813 + NIR therapy a promising approach to augment cancer immunotherapy, combining tumor destruction with immune system engagement to curb growth and prevent metastasis. Future developments could focus on optimizing the delivery methods of IR813, improving targeting specificity, and exploring synergistic combinations with other therapeutic modalities. Additionally, large-scale clinical trials are essential to fully evaluate the safety and efficacy of IR813 in diverse patient populations. These results advocate for the advancement of IR813-based therapies, presenting a new, minimally invasive, and potent option for cancer treatment that leverages the unique properties of IR813 and NIR for a comprehensive antitumor response.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclaimer/Publisher&#x02019;s Note:</bold> The statements, opinions and data contained in all publications are solely those of the individual author(s) and contributor(s) and not of MDPI and/or the editor(s).
