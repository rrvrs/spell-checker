However, cow-centric reproductive traits tend to be lowly heritable and are not expressed until later in an animal&#x02019;s lifetime, making phenotypic selection alone inefficient at generating genetic gain. Genetic progress can be accelerated by focusing selection on the predicted genetic component of reproductive traits using Expected Progeny Differences. We used the American Simmental Association&#x02019;s performance and Total Herd Enrollment data, made up of 533,155 calving records from 303,158 females (132,403 cows and 170,755 heifers), 33,732 of which are genotyped, to explore three continuous and two discrete phenotypes focused on quantifying early and sustained fertility in beef cows. We analyzed calving date (<bold>CD</bold>) (cow&#x02019;s CD relative to the start of the calving season), calving interval (<bold>CI</bold>) (days between calves), first calving interval (<bold>FCI</bold>) (CI observation between the first and second calving record for a female), heifer pregnancy (<bold>HP</bold>) (did the animal calve as 2-yr-old), and discrete early calving (<bold>DEC</bold>) (did animal calve in the first 30 d of the calving season) as distinct, but correlated measures of fertility. This dataset provides insight into population-wide trends related to cow attrition, calving season lengths, and phenotypic variation in fertility. We used pedigree and genomic REML to estimate these six phenotypes&#x02019; genetic, permanent environment, and temporary environmental variance components. Pedigree-estimated heritabilities were 0.06 (&#x000b1;&#x02005;0.000011) for CD, (0.04&#x02005;&#x000b1;&#x02005;0.000005) for CI, 0.07 (&#x000b1;&#x02005;0.000016) for DEC, 0.05&#x02005;&#x000b1;&#x02005;0.000041 for FCI, and 0.23 (&#x000b1;&#x02005;0.000099) for HP, consistent with other fertility traits across beef and dairy cattle. The incorporation of genomics increased the heritability estimate for HP (0.24&#x02005;&#x000b1;&#x02005;0.000098) and decreased the estimate for FCI (0.04&#x02005;&#x000b1;&#x02005;0.000029). Positive phenotypic and genetic correlations were found among these phenotypes (r<sub>G</sub><bold>&#x02005;</bold>=&#x02005;0.01 to 0.96). These results call for further work in optimizing genetic predictions and exploration of the genetic architecture through genome-wide studies. Whole herd reporting date frameworks represent opportunities for measuring new reproductive phenotypes, but their utility in genetic evaluations will rely on novel trait initiatives and consistent recording that captures more detailed data.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="teaser"><p>Complete calving records from a large, publicly collected dataset enable the in-depth exploration of beef cattle fertility phenotypes.

For beef cow-calf operations, calves serve as the main end product and generate the majority of herds&#x02019; economic output (<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">Diskin and Kenny, 2014</xref>). The ultimate goal for cow productivity is for females to have their first calf by 24 mo of age and then produce a calf every 365 d until they are removed from production. Cows that fail to reproduce or are removed from the herd prior to their breakeven point fail to reach lifetime profitability (<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">Mathews and Short, 2001</xref>). This breakeven point is when a female has successfully produced enough calf weight to cover the costs of heifer development and annual maintenance. <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">Boyer et al. (2020)</xref> found that this breakeven point is typically after a female has successfully produced six calves by 7 yr of age. However, this largely depends on variable cow costs.</p><p>Cow longevity is the chief driver of economic success in cow-calf operations (<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">Garcia et al., 2015</xref>). An inability to rebreed is the most common reason that beef cows are prematurely culled from herds (<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">Diskin and Kenny, 2014</xref>). Phenotypes associated with increased cow fertility and longevity are known to be lowly heritable (<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">Cammack et al., 2009</xref>). As such, selection tools can help accelerate progress on cow fertility by focusing selection on only the modest genetic variation that controls these traits. Measuring these phenotypes at the population level, necessary for genetic evaluations, is challenging with conventional data recording schemes (<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">MacNeil et al., 2006</xref>). Conventional reporting schemes do not require female annual cow inventories or performance records for nonregistered animals. Without calving information on all cows, we cannot be certain of reproductive success or failure. This makes traditional datasets unusable for developing fertility phenotypes and creates biases in contemporary group estimates. Further, many of these fertility phenotypes take multiple years to be fully expressed, making phenotypic selection ineffective at generating rapid genetic improvement.</p><p>Many measures have been proposed for quantifying heifer and cow fertility. These include calving date (<bold>CD</bold>), age at first calving, heifer pregnancy (<bold>HP</bold>), and CI (<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">Lesmeister et al., 1973</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">Bourdon and Brinks, 1982</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">Cundiff et al., 1986</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">Doyle et al., 2000</xref>). However, a lack of comprehensive breeding records in the beef industry has made the collection of these phenotypes difficult. Whole herd reporting (<bold>WHR</bold>) is an inventory-based reporting system where all female production records and calving information are recorded, regardless of calf survival or registration (<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">Giess et al., 2021</xref>). This type of reporting framework has allowed breed associations to collect complete and unbiased reproductive and performance phenotypes from entire herds. However, these reporting schemes have not been universally adopted across breed associations, and many reporting schemes lack the granular details necessary for calculating date-dependent reproductive phenotypes (<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">Giess et al. 2021</xref>).</p><p>Producers have the ability to make selection decisions using genetic predictions in the form of Expected Progeny Differences (<bold>EPDs</bold>). EPDs are statistical estimates of an animal&#x02019;s additive genetic merit for a given trait. Numerous traits exist that allow producers to make more informed bull selection decisions that will result in more productive replacement females (<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">Rowan, 2022</xref>). The two most commonly reported EPDs for female productivity in current genetic evaluations are HP and Stayability (STAY). HP predicts the difference in the percentage of daughters of individuals who will calve as 2-yr-olds (<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">BIF Guidelines, 2023</xref>). Stayability is a comprehensive measure of cow longevity that predicts the proportion of an animal&#x02019;s daughters that will remain in a herd to at least 6 yr of age without missing a calf (<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">Snelling et al., 1995</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">BIF Guidelines, 2023</xref>). While not explicit predictions of sustained fertility, the two traits are strongly linked due to infertility being a major driver of culling. Limited whole herd reporting throughout beef cattle breeds means that these EPDs may be less accurate or noisier than predictions of other traits with more easily collected phenotypes (e.g., weaning weight, birth weight).</p><p>Reproductive traits are lowly heritable (typically <italic toggle="yes">h</italic><sup>2</sup>&#x02005;&#x0003c;&#x02005;0.1), and historical improvements have largely relied on changes to management practices rather than genetic improvements (<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">Guti&#x000e9;rrez et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">Cammack et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">Minick Bormann and Wilson, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">Berry et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">Boldt et al., 2018</xref>). This, coupled with delayed expression and limited information collected on behalf of sires, presents a need for the collection of other economically important reproductive phenotypes. This project aimed to estimate the heritabilities and genetic correlations for multiple cow fertility traits. We used the American Simmental Association&#x02019;s (<bold>ASA</bold>) Total Herd Enrollment (<bold>THE</bold>) dataset to calculate five phenotypes associated with HP and sustained cow fertility. We hypothesized that cow and heifer fertility and rebreeding phenotypes would be highly variable across the ASA population and under low levels of genetic control. Our major objectives aimed to 1) develop informative reproductive phenotypes using enrollment data and CDs, 2) understand the phenotypic distributions of reproductive phenotypes, particularly throughout a cow&#x02019;s lifetime, and 3) estimate the role that genetics plays in the expression of these traits. This work sets the stage for further exploration of these reproductive phenotypes, their economic value, genetic evaluation, and genetic architecture.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s3"><title>Dataset</title><p>As all of the data used in this work was producer-reported in an existing database, no IACUC protocol was necessary. Producer-collected enrollment records originated from the ASA THE program prior to January 1, 2021. Enrollment records for each animal consisted of enrollment year, season, breeder, and productivity and status codes (<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">Giess et al., 2021</xref>). The ASA Herdbook is open, meaning that not all animals are purebred Simmentals, and a wide range of breed compositions are present within. All animals had pedigree-estimated breed compositions. We excluded all animals with &#x0003e;1/16 <italic toggle="yes">Bos indicus</italic> breed composition. Animals are enrolled in THE annually and are placed in either spring (January 1 to June 30) or fall (July 1 to December 31) calving seasons, as defined by ASA. Animals are eligible for enrollment starting at 2 yr old. Status codes provide information for each enrollment to differentiate between cows and heifers, embryo transfer donors and recipients, and to identify females not exposed or bred to be moved to another year or season. Productivity codes include information about calving, weaning, and cow disposal. Both status and productivity codes are described in detail by <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">Giess et al. (2021)</xref>. In 2009, compliance for THE was implemented so that all females had to be enrolled with a productivity or disposal code based on set deadlines for each enrollment season. To ensure consistency of calving records, only animals enrolled in 2009 and after were used in our subsequent analyses (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#x02005;=&#x02005;1,606,815). All enrollments for embryo transfer donors and recipients and all females enrolled after 2021 were removed from the dataset.

Groups were constructed based on the ASA owner number at the time of enrollment, enrollment year, enrollment season, and heifer status (i.e., whether this was an animal&#x02019;s first opportunity to calve). We removed contemporary groups with less than five animals. This resulted in 18,383 total contemporary groups, 12,556 of which were cow groups and 5,827 were heifers. Separating cow and heifer groups helped account for management differences between groups on the same farms when calculating CDs and early calving phenotypes.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Phenotypes</title><p>THE records and contemporary groups were used to calculate five measures of reproductive efficiency: three continuous and two discrete. For each total herd reporting entry, we attempted to associate it with a calf record from ASA&#x02019;s performance data. THE dataset consisted purely of female enrollment inventories. Consequently, a cow&#x02019;s CD was the day that corresponded with the calf born in the year and season of enrollment. Cows that lacked either a calf performance record or calf disposal code were assumed to be a reproductive failure. Reproductive failures remained in the herd if they were not removed from the herd&#x02019;s enrollment. By restricting our dataset to post-2009, we knew that culling or removal from the herd would be accompanied with a proper disposal code. Multi-year CDs allowed us to calculate four cow fertility phenotypes and one heifer phenotype. Continuous phenotypes were CI (days between consecutive calves for each animal), first calving interval (<bold>FCI</bold>, CI observation between the first and second calving record for a female), and CD (day cow calved relative to the beginning of the calving season). Discrete phenotypes include discrete early calving (<bold>DEC</bold>, cow calved in the first 30 d of contemporary group&#x02019;s calving season) and HP (cow calved as a 2-yr-old).</p><p>In addition to lifetime measurements of these phenotypes, we also analyzed CIs and CDs between a cow&#x02019;s first and second calf, as this period of anestrous is the most difficult to recover from (<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">Mercadante et al., 2003</xref>). Phenotypes were calculated in R using various packages in the tidyverse (<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">Wickham et al., 2019</xref>). CIs were determined to be biologically impossible and were removed if they were less than 250 d (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#x02005;=&#x02005;533,155). To better estimate the start of the calving period used in CD and DEC phenotype calculations, we began counting relative to the date the third calf was born. This was aimed at removing abnormally early starts caused by premature calving events. Calves born prior to this point were considered to have a CD of zero. CDs were then broken into discrete classes to DEC phenotypes: 1) early, where calves were born in the first 30 d; 2) middle for days 31 to 60; and 3) late for days 61 to 90. Females who calved outside of a 90-d calving season were included to indicate calving outside of a 90-d season (4). Across all phenotypes, heifers were designated as females whose first enrollment year was their birth year plus two. Females who fell into this category were given a score of 1 for having a calf or 0 for not having a calf during their first calving opportunity (HP).</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Heritabilities and Genetic Correlations</title><p>We used the BLUPF90 family of programs to calculate variance components and estimate breeding values (<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">Misztal et al., 2014</xref>). We used a mixed linear model to estimate variance components for each of these four traits. Cow traits leveraged repeated records to capture information from multiple calving seasons and estimate a permanent environmental effect. We fit the contemporary group as a single fixed effect that was defined based on a record&#x02019;s herd, year, and season. Contemporary groups within operation were divided into heifer and cow groups, allowing for separate evaluation when both were included for a given phenotype. We included an age-of-dam effect for cow traits to account for conserved physiological differences between younger and older cows (<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">BIF Guidelines, 2023</xref>). We also ran models that included binary fixed effects for the previous year dystocia and a previous year&#x02019;s missed calf to test how these events altered reproductive phenotypes for a given year.</p><p>We performed univariate pedigree and single-step genomic analyses to estimate variance components for our five phenotypes of interest.

As with the univariate analyses, GIBBSF90&#x02005;+&#x02005;was used to estimate variance and covariance components for each pair of traits. We used POSTGIBBSF90 to determine model convergence criteria and variance and covariance component estimates for all analyses.</p><p>To assess the relationship between growth traits and our reproductive traits of interest, we performed a subsequent set of bivariate analyses between each of the five reproductive phenotypes and two measures of growth: weaning weight and yearling weight. We restricted this bivariate analysis only to females with both reproductive and growth phenotypes recorded. Raw weaning and yearling weights for all animals with reproductive phenotypes were filtered to only include those within three standard deviations of the mean. We adjusted weaning weight to a standard 205-d weight and yearling weights to a 365-d weight according to BIF Guidelines. We used ASA Reporting requirements to identify acceptable weaning weights between 200 and 1,200 pounds and yearling weights between 350 and 2,000 pounds. Adjusted weights outside of this range were removed from the dataset. Models for both weights included contemporary groups that were combinations of herd, year, and season. Weaning weight models included a maternal effect and a fixed effect for age of dam class according to the BIF Guidelines. We used both GIBBSF90&#x02005;+&#x02005;and POSTGIBBSF90 to estimate variance and covariance effects for each correlation as described above.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s7"><title>Results</title><sec id="s8"><title>Phenotypic Observations</title><p>We used five measures of female fertility to quantify population-level phenotypic trends in the ASA population, particularly for traits related to cow rebreeding. The mean CI for the dataset was 386 d, and the median was 370 d, with a maximum of 3,654 d. Ninety-two percent of females maintained a CI of less than 400 d (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). That said, the distribution is somewhat bimodal with a small increase in CI observations near the 2-yr, or 730-d, mark. This suggests that many females are retained in herds following a missed breeding. For both heifers and cows, the majority of females calved in the first 30 d of the contemporary group&#x02019;s calving season. The mean CD for heifers was day 19 with a median of 11 d (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>), while the mean for cows was day 32 with a median of 26 d (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). These discrepancies between mean and median were driven by a large number of animals with CDs of 0 or 1 based on our strategy for designating the beginning of the calving season and a handful of animals with very late CDs (&#x0003e;90 d). For heifers, 78.5% were classified as early calvers compared to only 57.7% of mature cows. This is likely driven by higher levels of estrus synchronization and artificial insemination in the heifer&#x02019;s reproductive management compared with cows. In heifers, 16.4% and 3.8% of animals were considered middle and late calvers, respectively. This proportion of middle and late calvers was much higher in cows: 30% and 9.1%, respectively.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Distribution of CIs: Histogram of CI observations for females enrolled in American Simmental Association&#x02019;s THE program.

As expected, the strongest genetic correlation existed between CD and DEC (r<sub>G</sub>&#x02005;=&#x02005;0.96) due to the direct derivative relationship between the two phenotypes. CI and FCI showed low phenotypic correlations (r<sub>P</sub>&#x02005;=&#x02005;0.13), but moderately high genetic correlations (r<sub>G</sub>&#x02005;=&#x02005;0.47). The next highest genetic correlation existed between FCI and CD (r<sub>G</sub>&#x02005;=&#x02005;0.34), suggesting that a genetic predisposition for rebreeding after a cow&#x02019;s first calf is shared with early calving throughout its productive lifetime. Estimates of genetic correlations all had very small associated standard errors (0.000011 to 0.000273). A cow&#x02019;s FCI showed weak phenotypic correlations with both CD and CI (0.07 and 0.13, respectively). CD and DEC were similarly correlated to HP (r<sub>G</sub>&#x02005;=&#x02005;0.07 to 0.19).</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T3"><label>Table 3.</label><caption><p>Heritabilities, genetic, and phenotypic correlations</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" width="100%" border="1"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Phenotype</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Heifer pregnancy</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Calving date</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Discrete early calving</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">First calving interval</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Calving interval</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Heifer pregnancy</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">

For example, the median CI of 370 d indicated that the vast majority of females present in the dataset were successfully producing one calf per year throughout their time in enrollment. This indicates that seedstock producers are limiting the number of open females in their cow herds and only retaining productive females each year.</p><p>We observed low-to-moderate heritability estimates for all studied phenotypes, in line with estimates across different populations and fertility-related phenotypes. CD was one of the least heritable traits in our population. Previous studies have reported a broad range of heritability estimates for this trait. However, most of them tend to be low. <xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">Morris et al. (2000)</xref> calculated heritability to be 0.091&#x02005;&#x000b1;&#x02005;0.036 in a population of Angus cattle, while <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">Buddenberg et al. (1990)</xref> estimated a wide heritability range from 0.13 to 0.39 in a population of Hereford cattle. This low heritability CD makes phenotypic selection nearly impossible despite the clear economic relevance of calving early in the season. This economic signal is driven by the fact that calves born early in the season are typically heavier at weaning (<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">Cushman et al., 2013</xref>). DEC was also lowly heritable in this population, which was expected based on its direct relationship to CD. Interestingly, we found that DEC was slightly more heritable than CD.</p><p>HP was the most heritable trait that we observed, falling into the moderately heritable range with <italic toggle="yes">h</italic><sup>2</sup> values of 0.23 and 0.24 for pedigree and genomic information, respectively. In two previous studies of Angus cattle, heritabilities were estimated to be 0.27 and 0.21 (<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">Doyle et al., 2000</xref>). However, other studies have estimated heritability to be more variable, ranging from 0.12 to 0.53 across different populations (<xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">Van Melis et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">McAllister et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">Boldt et al., 2018</xref>). HP has typically been modeled as a binary observation (i.e., Did a female calve as a 2-yr-old?). Other work has used continuous phenotypes such as age at first calving or age at puberty as indicator. Heritability estimates for age at first calving and age at puberty are similar to HP heritability estimates from our study, with estimates ranging from 0.08 to 0.24 for age at first calving and 0.07 to 0.67 for at age puberty (<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">Martin et al., 1992</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">Guti&#x000e9;rrez et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">Mart&#x000ed;nez-Vel&#x000e1;zquez et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>We found both positive and negative phenotypic correlations among the studied traits (r<sub>G</sub> from 0.004 to 0.96). This wide range in correlations indicates that while these phenotypes are all associated with cow fertility, they may be controlled by largely different genetic architectures. CI and CD were the least correlated cow-focused phenotypes with a value of 0.05. The key difference between these two phenotypes is that a favorable CD can be the result of a reproductive failure, and a female is shifted to calve in a different season or year (i.e., CD could be zero but CI could be 730). CI can capture this information because this phenotype will be elongated (&#x0003e;365 d), and this record will have a negative impact on the female&#x02019;s projected productivity. CI and HP were lowly genetically correlated, but it is worth mentioning an HP phenotype does not have a matched CI observation. Because of how heifers are managed to calve earlier in the season, indirectly, CI is impacted by heifer calving records since most occur early in the calving season. This management practice, although beneficial for the assurance of a successful rebreeding, can indirectly elongate CI phenotypes since heifers are managed to calve earlier than mature cows but then bred back for the next season at the same time as the mature cows. Interestingly, an animal&#x02019;s genetic potential for CD was more positively correlated with its FCI (0.34) than with CI throughout the entirety of an animal&#x02019;s lifetime (0.05). We also found that heifers that conceived early in their first breeding season went on to have shorter CDs throughout the course of their lives.</p><p>Genetic correlations between growth traits and fertility were variable. Correlations with weaning weight were all effectively zero, indicating that direct calf growth is not likely to be affected by selection for these traits. Interestingly, the magnitude of genetic correlations was larger for yearling weight. HP and yearling weight showed the strongest correlation (r<sub>G</sub>&#x02005;=&#x02005;0.235). This is likely driven by the relationship between yearling weight and puberty attainment, as heifers that are heavier at 365 d of age are likely to be more mature and primed for breeding in the following months. These differences also appeared to persist to the animal&#x02019;s first rebreeding, where yearling weight was negatively correlated with an animal&#x02019;s FCI (r<sub>G</sub>&#x02005;=&#x02005;&#x02212;0.091). However, the remaining correlations between the two growth traits and the five reproductive phenotypes were centered around zero, indicating that selection for growth may not impact sustained cow fertility and productivity.</p><p>While THE is a valuable tool for collecting reproductive phenotypes in cattle, a lack of detail in the data collected presents limitations for genetic evaluation. The collection of reproductive phenotypes in beef cattle populations did not begin in earnest until the implementation of inventory-based reporting. Even with the implementation of WHR, the beef industry lags behind the dairy industry in collecting more granular breeding records, specifically those related to actual breeding dates or service types (AI vs. natural service) that would allow for more precise measurements of these phenotypes. At the most basic level, collecting a breeding date, or even the start of the breeding season for each THE entry would be useful in calculating more precise and accurate phenotypes related to CD. This would also allow for the joint analysis of fertility phenotypes with gestation lengths. Collecting palpation records or approximate fetal age could aid in estimating gestation lengths when breeding dates are not reported. This information would allow for the back calculation of breeding dates to increase precision in developing contemporary groups when accounting for management differences. Further, if detailed breeding records were collected, CD could account for potential differences in conception from natural service versus AI versus estrus synchronization. We expect that with the ability to differentiate animals with breeding records would show which animals respond best to each type of service and change the distribution of CD. CD distributions in natural service settings would likely appear the most similar to the distributions observed in this work. We would expect that estrous synchronization protocols would shift CD closer to day 0 and increase the number of early calving records. As beef cattle breed associations look for ways to improve data collection, the inclusion of breeding records, including estrous synchronization, artificial insemination, or natural service, and dates for inventory-based reporting would allow for a more detailed investigation of the cow productivity phenotypes.</p></sec><sec id="s12"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We explored five phenotypes calculated from the American Simmental Association&#x02019;s Total Herd Reporting dataset that are indicators of cow fertility. The unbiased reporting required in THE allowed us to understand culling decisions and cow attrition at the population level. Most seedstock Simmental producers maintain close to a 365-d CI on average, but room for improvement still exists. CD for heifers was predictive of future reproductive performance. Each of these phenotypes was lowly to moderately heritable. All phenotypes showed low-to-moderate phenotypic and genetic correlations with one another. This suggests that genetic improvement is possible for these traits if breed associations develop genetic evaluations and genetic selection tools for them. To maximize the effectiveness of these tools, breed associations should consider strategies for collecting more granular breeding records. Future work will need to identify optimal modeling strategies for genetic predictions and potential inclusion into economic selection indexes.</p></sec></body><back><sec id="s13"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>Funding for portions of this work was provided by the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, U.S. Department of Agriculture Hatch Project S1086.</p></sec><glossary><def-list><title>Abbreviations</title><def-item><term>ASA</term><def><p>American Simmental Association</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CD</term><def><p>calving date</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CI</term><def><p>calving interval</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DEC</term><def><p>discrete early calving</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FCI</term><def><p>first calving interval</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GWAS</term><def><p>genome-wide association study</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HP</term><def><p>heifer pregnancy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>THE</term><def><p>total herd enrollment</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><sec id="s14"><title>Author contributions</title><p>Cassidy Catrett (Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Visualization, Writing&#x02014;original draft), Sarah Moorey (Conceptualization, Investigation, Supervision, Writing&#x02014;review &#x00026; editing), Jonathan Beever (Conceptualization, Investigation, Project administration, Supervision, Writing&#x02014;review &#x00026; editing), and Troy Rowan (Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Project administration, Supervision, Writing&#x02014;original draft, Writing&#x02014;review &#x00026; editing)</p></sec><sec sec-type="COI-statement" id="s15"><title>Conflict of interest statement</title><p>The authors declare no real or perceived conflicts of interest.</p></sec><ref-list id="r1"><title>Literature Cited</title><ref id="CIT0001"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
