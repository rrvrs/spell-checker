Despite governments&#x02019; efforts worldwide to control its spread, many people were hesitant to adopt preventive measures. The effectiveness of these measures largely depends on public willingness, which is influenced by their knowledge and perception of risk. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the knowledge, risk perceptions, protection practices, and related factors concerning COVID-19 in the Dessie City Administration, Northeast Ethiopia.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>Methodology</title><p>This study employed a cross-sectional design. We selected seven hundred ninety participants using a systematic sampling technique. Data was collected face-to-face using an interviewer-administered questionnaire. Descriptive statistics, including frequency, percentage, mean, and standard deviation, were used to summarise the sample characteristics. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was conducted using SPSS (version 23), and the results were presented in the form of text, tables, and graphs.</p></sec><sec id="sec3"><title>Results</title><p>Of the study participants, 498 (63%) had good knowledge of the pandemic, while 457 (58%) had a low-risk perception. Only 305 (39%) demonstrated good protection practices. The most trusted sources of information were healthcare personnel (686 participants, 86.8%), followed by the Ministry of Health websites (654 participants, 82.8%). Monthly income (&#x0003e;10,000 ETB), knowledge, and risk perceptions with AORs of 3.05 (CI: 1.51&#x02013;6.14), 4.45 (CI: 2.81&#x02013;7.04), 2.06 (CI: 1.38&#x02013;3.08) were significantly associated with protection practices against the COVID-19 pandemic.</p></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>Conclusion</title><p>More than two-thirds of the participants demonstrated good knowledge about COVID-19. However, over half perceived themselves to be at low risk and engaged in poor preventive practices. Control efforts will be challenging, especially among younger and less educated groups who consider themselves at low risk, requiring focused attention. Understanding people&#x02019;s risk perceptions and beliefs about the effectiveness of COVID-19 prevention measures is essential for improving protective behaviours. Health education and active community engagement are key strategies in combating the spread of the virus.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>COVID-19</kwd><kwd>knowledge</kwd><kwd>risk perception</kwd><kwd>protection practice</kwd><kwd>Dessie</kwd><kwd>Ethiopia</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>The author(s) declare that no financial support was received for the research and/or publication of this article.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="7"/><table-count count="5"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="61"/><page-count count="15"/><word-count count="9087"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>section-at-acceptance</meta-name><meta-value>Infectious Diseases: Epidemiology and Prevention</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec5"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a contagious respiratory disease in humans that causes pneumonia-like infection (<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). So far, seven human coronaviruses (HCoVs) have been identified. These include the highly pathogenic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and the newly identified SARS-CoV-2. They are known to have caused global outbreaks, with SARS-CoV-2 being responsible for the current pandemic (<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>).</p><p>The COVID-19 pandemic emerged in Wuhan, China, in late December 2019 (<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Later, this disease was declared a global public health emergency (<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by WHO on March 11, 2020, due to an increase in the number of cases worldwide (<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). On March 13, 2020, the first COVID-19 case in Ethiopia was confirmed (<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>).</p><p>Contaminated objects and respiratory droplets were the primary means of transmission for this pandemic (<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Asymptomatic patients serve as carriers of this pandemic (<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Old age and patients with pre-existing chronic illnesses were identified as risk factors for the severe form of the disease and mortality (<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Fever, dry cough, fatigue, respiratory illnesses, diarrhoea, vomiting, and headache were among the clinical manifestations (<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).</p><p>Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) are key to controlling the spread of this virus (<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), relying on public willingness, which is influenced by knowledge and risk perception (<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). However, studies showed inconsistent knowledge about the pandemic. A study in Bangladesh showed that about 45% of participants had poor knowledge (<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). A Chinese study showed that droplet infection was mentioned as a mode of transmission by only 66.6% of the participants, while 35.9 and 4.8% of the participants, respectively, mentioned people with ages greater than 65 and smokers as being at high risk of contracting COVID-19 (<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>).</p><p>Because of its high transmission rate, lack of definitive treatment, and high morbidity and mortality rate, this disease is a global concern (<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Controlling its spread was extremely difficult due to the lack of definitive treatments (<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Developed countries are adversely affected, despite their advancement in healthcare systems (<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Ethiopia is an African country with a low-skilled workforce and technological assets (<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Governments all over the world are working hard to keep it under control. However, a large number of people were reluctant to use preventive measures. To be effective, information is crucial to comprehend the relationships between demographic factors, risk perceptions, and prevention practices (<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>).</p><p>Several studies conducted in various countries revealed that the risk perception for this disease was low. A study done in Ghana showed that about 32% of participants had low-risk perceptions (<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). A Myanmar study showed that approximately 22% of the participants wrongly perceived spontaneous recovery (<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). According to a study conducted in Iraq, only 26.9, 29.7, and 41.7% of respondents, respectively, were concerned about contracting infection, serious illness, or death from this pandemic (<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>).</p><p>The number of COVID-19 cases and deaths in Ethiopia has increased over time. The Ethiopian Ministry of Health reported 102,720 cases as of December 14, 2020 (<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Ethiopia adapts basic intervention measures to reduce the spread of this virus (<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). However, people&#x02019;s adherence to preventive measures is critical, which is influenced primarily by their knowledge and risk perception (<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>).</p><p>Protection practices rely on the perceived risk of contracting a disease and efficacy beliefs for preventive modalities (<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Health models advocate risk perception as a motivator for change in behaviour (<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). One of them is the extended parallel process model (EPPM), which advocates protection practice as a result of threat assessment and coping evaluation based on the concept of protection motivation theory (PMT). Threat assessment entails assessing the risk of contracting a disease (perceived vulnerability or susceptibility) and determining the severity of the disease (perceived severity) (<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>).</p><p>Several studies found that protection practices against this disease were not satisfactory. For instance, studies done in Myanmar (<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) and Bangladesh (<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) revealed that nearly 45.2 and 24.8% of participants, respectively, had poor hand hygiene practices. Studies in the Philippines (<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>) and Malaysia (<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>) showed that around 37 and 49% of participants were not avoiding crowded areas, respectively. A Bangladesh (<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) study showed that around 30% of participants failed the regular mask-wearing practice. Studies done in Myanmar (<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), Bangladesh (<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>), and Thailand (<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>) showed that 78, 50, and 83% of respondents had poor protection practices, respectively.</p><p>Males, younger age groups, and less educated individuals were less likely to implement preventive measures (<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). The clarity of communication influences protection behaviour (<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Risk perception and beliefs about the efficacy of the preventive methods influenced the community&#x02019;s engagement in realising precautionary measures (<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). People with good knowledge and a high-risk perception of the pandemic respond positively to preventive methods (<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>).</p><p>As a result, the purpose of this study was to assess knowledge, risk perceptions, and protection practices in Dessie City, Northeast Ethiopia, as well as investigate factors associated with protection practices.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec6"><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec7"><label>2.1</label><title>Study area and period</title><p>The study was conducted among the population of Dessie City, North-East Ethiopia, between the end of July and mid-December 2020. Dessie is the main trading center in the Northeastern part of Ethiopia and is a part of the Wollo culture, thus having a style of close cultural relationship. The city is divided into 26 kebeles (the smallest administrative unit) for administrative purposes. The city has a number of publicly and privately owned health institutions. The city has one referral hospital that serves more than eight million people from all over the city and provinces.

The risk perception and belief in efficacy for preventive methods were assessed using a five-point Likert scale.

The sample size was calculated using Epi Info with a 5% margin of error, resulting in 376 participants. However, the sampling procedure involved two stages, and the design effect was considered in addition to a 5% contingency for non-response.

poses a serious economic as well as public health threat. COVID-19 is effectively controlled by increasing public knowledge, perception, and prevention practices.</p><p>In line with the previous study (<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>), nearly nine out of ten participants believed that the virus caused this pandemic (87.5% vs. 96%). The majority of them reported fever, dry cough, difficulty breathing, and headache as symptoms of this pandemic. These findings agreed with those of Fang et al. (<xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>).</p><p>The study found that 63% of the participants had good knowledge about the COVID-19 pandemic. This was comparable to findings from Bangladesh (63% vs. 61.4%) (<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) but higher than in Myanmar, where the majority (87%) of the participants had poor knowledge (<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), and lower than in India (<xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>), Tanzania (<xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>), China (<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), and USA (<xref rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>), where 80.64, 84.4, 90, and 80% of participants, respectively, had good knowledge. The variation in knowledge levels across studies may be due to differences in study population, timing of study, and access to information, highlighting the need for improved health education in the community.</p><p>Regarding the source of information, the majority of participants obtained COVID-19-related information from national TV, social media, and radio, with social media being a significant source, similar to studies in Myanmar (<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) and Hong Kong (<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), approximately half of participants obtained information about COVID-19 from social media. However, this finding differed from the Chinese study, in which the vast majority of participants (98%) obtained information about COVID-19 via social media (<xref rid="ref46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). This shows a high proclivity for people to use social media in recent years. However, trust in the truthfulness of social media information was low. The most reliable information sources were health professionals, MOH official websites, and mass communication tools such as television or radio. These findings were imperative since they may indicate that more efforts should be made to deliver trustworthy information through the most popular and trusted communication channels.</p><p>Approximately two out of five participants thought they were at risk of COVID-19. This finding is lower than that of Thailand (75%) (<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>), Southwest Ethiopia (53.4%) (<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>), Ghana (68.3%) (<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), and Sierra Leone (75%) (<xref rid="ref47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). Furthermore, the study found a higher risk perception than 7.6% in India (<xref rid="ref48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). This could be due to the differences in the study period, study population, and case count. The perceived severity of the disease was lower than in the Hong Kong (<xref rid="ref49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>) and Myanmar (<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) studies, where almost all participants perceived the disease to be very severe. In this study only 16.8% of the participants thought COVID-19 was a deadly disease, whereas in Thailand, approximately 70% thought it was a severe and dangerous disease (<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Similarly, studies in China found that the majority of people thought COVID-19 was extremely severe (<xref rid="ref46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, <xref rid="ref50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). In terms of survivorship, if infected, the communities in this study had a higher (53.5%) response rate than Myanmar (22%) (<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) and Hong Kong (18%) (<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). This explains why the people in this study setting become more hesitant to take preventive measures and require more convincing of the COVID-19 risk. According to a study conducted in Egypt (<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>), the majority of participants thought the disease was more dangerous for the older adult and those with chronic diseases. This could be because the risk of death from COVID-19 is higher in the older adult and those with medical conditions (<xref rid="ref51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>).</p><p>Perceived efficacy toward preventive measures such as hand hygiene, wearing face masks, and avoiding crowded areas was lower than in previous studies conducted in Myanmar and Hong Kong (i.e., 49.1% vs. 80 and 90%, respectively) (<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). The belief in the efficacy of preventive methods is important information for improving epidemic control. This indicates that more work is required to ratify belief in efficacy.</p><p>Handwashing practices were lower in studies conducted in the Philippines (<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>), Hong Kong (<xref rid="ref49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>), and Bangladesh (<xref rid="ref52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>) (58.6% vs. 89.9, 95.8, and 98.6%, respectively), but higher than a study conducted in Myanmar (<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) (58.6% vs. 44.9%). Avoiding crowded places was lower in this study than in previous studies from Myanmar (<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) and Hong Kong (<xref rid="ref49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>) (34.1% vs. 57.9 and 88.1%, respectively). Furthermore, the practice of avoiding crowded areas was lower than in a study conducted in the Philippines (<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>), Bangladesh (<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), Tanzania (<xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>), China (<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), Nepal (<xref rid="ref53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>), and Malaysia (<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>), where 62.9, 87.97, 77, 96.4, 94.9, and 51.2% of people avoid social gatherings, respectively.</p><p>Only 26.7% of participants followed the principles of staying at home. This was much lower than in the Bangladesh study (<xref rid="ref52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>), where the majority (93.2%) of respondents followed the stay-at-home principle. Cough etiquette practice was markedly lower than in a Hong Kong study (<xref rid="ref49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>) (56.2% vs. 97.1%), but higher than in a Myanmar study (<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) (56.2% vs. 47.3%). Only 27.3% of participants put on a face mask when leaving their home. It was much lower than in studies conducted in Bangladesh (<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), Malaysia (<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>), Tanzania (<xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>), China (<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), and Nepal (<xref rid="ref53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>), where nearly 75, 83.4, 80, 98, and 88.2% of the participants used a face mask. This disparity was attributed to socioeconomic factors, culture, case count, beliefs in the efficacy of preventive measures, and perceptions of COVID-19 risk.</p><p>The practice of COVID-19 prevention measures in this study was 38.6%, which was much lower than the study conducted in Iran (<xref rid="ref54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>), 71%, and Bangladesh (<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>), 51.6% of participants had good COVID-19 prevention practices, but higher than the study conducted in Myanmar, 22% (<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). The disparities could be explained by differences in information-seeking behaviour, case counts, death rates, misconceptions, and study time.</p><p>In line with the study done in Lebanon (<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>), Iran (<xref rid="ref55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>), India (<xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>), Hong Kong (<xref rid="ref49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>), and Malaysia (<xref rid="ref56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>), education was a strong predictor of protection practices. Behavioural models advocate education is an influential determining factor of healthy behaviour (<xref rid="ref57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>). Education leads to better information-gathering habits and efficient use of health inputs (<xref rid="ref58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>). This may explain why more educated respondents engaged in precautionary behaviours. This underlines the importance of education in an attempt to raise protection.</p><p>In line with the study done in China (<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), high income was associated with good practices. Economic status is the primary determinant of actions for maintaining one&#x02019;s health (<xref rid="ref57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>). It has been demonstrated that the low-income households do not use preventive methods (<xref rid="ref59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>). In addition, income determines the likelihood of purchasing personal protective equipment, such as a face mask and hand sanitiser. Individuals with low income fail to observe preventive methods; instead, they prefer to continue their daily activities to satisfy their basic needs during the transmission period. This may explain why high-income groups had good preventive practices. Therefore, the government should recognise income discrepancies and provide targeted support to decline the transmission rate across the income spectrum.</p><p>Protective practices were predicted by knowledge, aligning with findings from other studies (<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="ref60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>). Knowledge enhances awareness, dispels misconceptions, and supports informed decision-making. However, its effectiveness can be shaped by cultural beliefs to the pandemic, socioeconomic conditions, and trust in health systems. Traditional practices, resources limitation, and distrust may hinder the adoption of scientific protective behaviours. In line with other studies (<xref rid="ref61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>), risk perception also strongly predicts protective behaviour. People with a low perception of risk should be a prime target for public health education. Additionally, belief in the effectiveness of preventive methods was the strongest predictor of adherence to protective behaviours during the pandemic.</p><p>These findings showed that protective behaviour implementation largely depends on community engagement in the prevention pathway. Public health education should focus on enhancing knowledge while addressing key barriers, particularly among individuals with low risk perception and limited belief in the effectiveness of preventive measures, to ensure effective control over the spread of this virus.</p></sec><sec id="sec28"><label>5</label><title>Strengths and limitations of the study</title><sec id="sec29"><label>5.1</label><title>Strengths of the study</title><p>In the study setting, although studies had examined knowledge and protective practices for COVID-19, those comprising risk perception in their work were limited. Most previous studies were online application-based surveys; as a strong point, this research was a field-based study. The use of a field survey in the data collection process in this study may have resulted in an adequate representation of the less educated groups. This study solves the issue of representation and the methodological concerns of previous studies.</p></sec><sec id="sec30"><label>5.2</label><title>Limitations of the study</title><p>The cross-sectional nature of this study might make it tougher to establish a cause-and-effect relationship. Furthermore, the study is limited to one city administration in Northeast Ethiopia rather than the entire country, which is a limitation.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec31"><label>6</label><title>Conclusion</title><p>The study found that two-thirds of the participants had good knowledge. However, there was a low perception of the risk and poor practices for preventing COVID-19. There is an urgent need to fill the risk perception and knowledge gap to control the expansion of the COVID-19 outbreak.</p><p>This study revealed that COVID-19 knowledge, efficacy beliefs, and risk perception significantly predicted precautionary behaviour. Older people, people with a high income, a high level of education, and a large family size readily showed a high propensity toward protection practices. As a result, the young population, as well as lower-income and education groups, would be challenging to the control efforts and will require special attention. Risk communication and community engagement efforts should be considered in fighting against this pandemic.</p><p>The results of this study indicate the focus areas that need to be addressed and disclose the need for continued monitoring. The media should make it easier to get reliable health information. Moreover, future research would identify the possible barriers to adopting protective behaviours in fighting the pandemic disease and their solutions.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><title>Abbreviations</title><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>COVID-19, Coronavirus disease 2019; EPHI, Ethiopian Public Health Institute; EPPM, Extended Parallel Process Model; NCoV, Novel Corona Virus; NPIs, Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions; PHM, Public Health Measures; PPE, Personal Protective Equipment; SARS, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome; SARS-CoV-2, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2; WHO, World Health Organization.</p></fn></fn-group><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="sec32"><title>Data availability statement</title><p>The original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/supplementary material, further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding author.</p></sec><sec sec-type="ethics-statement" id="sec33"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>Ethical approval was obtained from the Ethics Review Committee of the College of Medicine and Health Sciences, Wollo University (CMHS-456/013/12), and informed consent was secured from each participant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="author-contributions" id="sec34"><title>Author contributions</title><p>HNT: Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Software, Supervision, Writing &#x02013; original draft, Writing &#x02013; review &#x00026; editing.
