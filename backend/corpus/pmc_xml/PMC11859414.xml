Recently, two-stage surgical approaches, with initial damage control surgery followed by delayed pancreatic resection and reconstruction, have been increasingly reported. However, we argue that not all cases need a two-stage approach; instead, surgical strategies should be tailored based on the patient's vital signs. Furthermore, in pancreatic surgery, effective collaboration between trauma surgeons and hepatopancreatobiliary (HPB) surgeons is essential. Here, we report a case of a grade V traumatic pancreatic injury in an elderly patient that was successfully managed with one-stage pancreaticoduodenectomy, performed through coordinated efforts between trauma and HPB surgeons, resulting in a favorable outcome.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>damage control surgery</kwd><kwd>grade v</kwd><kwd>pancreaticoduodenectomy(pd)</kwd><kwd>traumatic pancreatic injury</kwd><kwd>whipple's procedure</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Traumatic injuries to the pancreas are relatively uncommon, accounting for approximately 5% of abdominal trauma cases [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In Japan, nearly 90% of these injuries are caused by blunt trauma [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The retroperitoneal location of the pancreas often leads to delayed diagnosis, resulting in a mortality rate of 13-50%, which increases to over 73% in cases involving pancreatic head injuries [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. A critical factor influencing prognosis is the presence of a main pancreatic duct injury [<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Pancreatic injuries involving the main pancreatic duct, classified as grades III, IV, and V according to the Organ Injury Scale of the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST-OIS), have traditionally required surgical intervention [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>The prognosis of emergent pancreatic resections has been shown to be worse compared to elective procedures [<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Recently, damage control surgery (DCS) has become a more common initial approach, followed by staged pancreatic resection and reconstruction [<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. DCS is the preferred treatment for traumatic pancreatic injury with hemodynamic instability, as it enables rapid stabilization and early acid-base correction [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Thompson et al. suggest that staged pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) after DCS benefits from pancreatic hardening, facilitating reconstruction [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In recent years, some trauma surgeons have recommended that all traumatic pancreatic injuries be managed with a staged approach [<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, Thompson et al. found no significant difference in complication rates between staged and primary PD [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Therefore, primary PD remains a feasible option for hemodynamically stable patients.</p><p>In this report, we present a case of a grade V traumatic pancreatic injury in an elderly patient who successfully underwent a single-stage PD with the involvement of both trauma and hepatopancreatobiliary (HPB) teams. In recent years, DCS has become widely adopted, and trauma surgeons now occasionally manage liver and pancreatic injuries without the involvement of HPB surgeons [<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, this case demonstrates that collaboration between trauma and HPB surgeons remains essential in the management of traumatic pancreatic injury, even in the era of DCS.</p></sec><sec sec-type="cases"><title>Case presentation</title><p>An 85-year-old woman with hypertension and dyslipidemia was admitted to the emergency department 50 minutes after crashing her vehicle into an object.

Her diabetes has slightly worsened but remains controlled with oral hypoglycemic agents, and her exocrine function is preserved with oral pancrelipase supplementation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This case demonstrates that single-stage PD for severe traumatic pancreatic injury with complete pancreatic transection and duodenal perforation (AAST-OIS grade V) remains feasible, even in the era where DCS is widely adopted, provided that the patient is hemodynamically stable and the procedure is performed by surgeons experienced in pancreatic surgery.</p><p>Traumatic pancreatic injuries involving the main pancreatic duct (AAST-OIS grades III-V) traditionally require surgical intervention; however, their prognosis remains poor, with mortality rates ranging from 13% to 50% [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. To overcome these challenges, DCS and staged repair of injury have been proposed and implemented [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>DCS is a surgical strategy designed to avoid high-risk procedures, such as complex reconstructions or anastomoses, in trauma patients presenting in shock. Instead, organ repair and reconstruction are deferred to a second stage [<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The most widely accepted criteria for performing DCS are the so-called "lethal triad," which consists of hypothermia (median temperature &#x0003c;34&#x000b0;C), acidosis (median pH &#x0003c;7.2), and coagulopathy [<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>In the management of traumatic pancreatic injury, the first consideration for both trauma surgeons and HPB surgeons should be the patient's survival, and for this reason, DCS and staged repair of injury should always be considered [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. At our institution, two-stage PD is performed not only in emergency surgeries for traumatic pancreatic injuries but also in elective surgeries for pancreatic cancer. In fact, we have previously reported a case in which we employed open abdominal management for staged reconstruction following massive portal vein bleeding during PD with portal vein resection for pancreatic head cancer [<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>However, it is essential to recognize that DCS can lead to intra-abdominal abscesses, enterocutaneous fistulas, ventral hernias, and prolonged ICU stays [<xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Furthermore, inadequate drainage during DCS increases the risk of complications and must be carefully managed [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Thompson et al. suggest that during the second stage of surgery for pancreatic injury, the pancreas becomes hard due to pancreatitis that develops during the drainage period [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. While PD for a hard pancreas is associated with a lower risk of postoperative pancreatic fistula, it has been reported to increase the likelihood of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency [<xref rid="REF14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The primary objective of trauma surgery is survival; however, traumatic pancreatic injury typically occurs in younger patients compared to pancreatic cancer [<xref rid="REF15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Considering long-term patient quality of life (QOL), performing reconstructive surgery while the pancreas remains soft may help reduce the risk of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency.</p><p>For these reasons, PD for grade V traumatic pancreatic injury with duodenal perforation remains feasible if the following conditions are met: hemodynamic stability of the patient, the presence of HPB surgeons experienced in PD, and a facility equipped to effectively manage postoperative complications of PD [<xref rid="REF16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>PD has been shown to achieve superior outcomes when performed at high-volume centers specializing in HPB surgery [<xref rid="REF16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Similarly, trauma surgeries conducted in dedicated abdominal emergency centers have been associated with improved prognoses [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The management of traumatic pancreatic injuries, which require both advanced systemic trauma care and highly specialized surgical expertise, underscores the critical importance of close collaboration between HPB surgeons and trauma surgeons to optimize patient outcomes [<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="REF17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>In this case, late biliary stenosis at the choledochojejunostomy site resulted in recurrent episodes of cholangitis. Non-dilated bile ducts are recognized as a risk factor for benign biliary stenosis following PD [<xref rid="REF18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], and similar outcomes have been reported in cases of traumatic pancreatic injuries involving non-dilated bile ducts [<xref rid="REF19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. PD for traumatic pancreatic injuries is more frequently performed in younger patients compared to PD for malignant tumors [<xref rid="REF15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Consequently, the management and prevention of biliary stenosis remain significant challenges that require further investigation.</p><p>As the aging population continues to grow, the number of traumatic pancreatic injury cases in elderly patients, such as this case, is expected to increase. In these cases, treatment strategies should focus not only on survival but also on maintaining postoperative ADLs. The primary objective in the management of traumatic pancreatic injury is to ensure patient survival, with DCS being a fundamental consideration [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. While some advocate that all cases of traumatic pancreatic injury should be managed with DCS and staged repair of injury [<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], we believe that even in the era where DCS is widely adopted, single-stage PD may be a feasible option in select cases and beneficial in preserving ADLs and exocrine pancreatic function.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The present case demonstrated that one-stage PD for grade V traumatic pancreatic injury in elderly patients can be safely performed when vital signs are stable, in collaboration with HPB surgeons. In the management of severe traumatic pancreatic injury, DCS and staged repair of injury should always be considered, and single-stage PD may not be the first-line treatment. However, as demonstrated in this case, single-stage PD may be a feasible option and beneficial in preserving ADLs under specific conditions.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group content-type="conflict"><title>Disclosures</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Human subjects:</bold> Consent for treatment and open access publication was obtained or waived by all participants in this study.</p><p><bold>Conflicts of interest:</bold> In compliance with the ICMJE uniform disclosure form, all authors declare the following:</p><p><bold>Payment/services info:</bold> All authors have declared that no financial support was received from any organization for the submitted work.</p><p><bold>Financial relationships:</bold> All authors have declared that they have no financial relationships at present or within the previous three years with any organizations that might have an interest in the submitted work.</p><p><bold>Other relationships:</bold> All authors have declared that there are no other relationships or activities that could appear to have influenced the submitted work.</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="other"><title>Author Contributions</title><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Concept and design:</bold>&#x000a0; Tsuyoshi Terada, Susumu Matushime</p><p><bold>Acquisition, analysis, or interpretation of data:</bold>&#x000a0; Tsuyoshi Terada, Susumu Matushime, Kazuki Hashida, Keisuke Kamo, Nobuichiro Tamura</p><p><bold>Drafting of the manuscript:</bold>&#x000a0; Tsuyoshi Terada, Susumu Matushime</p><p><bold>Critical review of the manuscript for important intellectual content:</bold>&#x000a0; Tsuyoshi Terada, Susumu Matushime, Kazuki Hashida, Keisuke Kamo, Nobuichiro Tamura</p><p><bold>Supervision:</bold>&#x000a0; Susumu Matushime, Kazuki Hashida, Keisuke Kamo, Nobuichiro Tamura</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="REF1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><article-title>Revisiting the pancreaticoduodenectomy for trauma: a single institution's experience</article-title><source>J Trauma Acute Care Surg</source><person-group>
