These models have emerged as valuable tools for studying tumor biology, cytotoxicity, and response of patient-derived cells to cancer therapies. However, the establishment and maintenance of tumoroids has historically been challenging, labor intensive, and highly variable from lab to lab, hindering their widespread use. Here, we characterize the establishment and/or expansion of colorectal, lung, head and neck, breast, pancreas, and endometrial tumoroids using the standardized, serum-free Gibco OncoPro Tumoroid Culture Medium. Newly derived tumoroid lines (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;20) were analyzed by targeted genomic profiling and RNA sequencing and were representative of tumor tissue samples. Tumoroid lines were stable for over 250 days in culture and freeze-thaw competent. Previously established tumoroid lines were also transitioned to OncoPro medium and exhibited, on average, similar growth rates and conserved donor-specific characteristics when compared to original media systems. Additionally, OncoPro medium was compatible with both embedded culture in extracellular matrix and growth in a suspension format for facile culture and scale up. An example application of these models for assessing the cytotoxicity of a natural killer cell line and primary natural killer cells over time and at various doses demonstrated the compatibility of these models with assays used in compound and cell therapy development. We anticipate that the standardization and versatility of this approach will have important benefits for basic cancer research, drug discovery, and personalized medicine and help make tumoroid models more accessible to the cancer research community.</p><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1038/s41598-025-86979-9.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Cancer models</kwd><kwd>Cell growth</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100011033</institution-id><institution>Thermo Fisher Scientific</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer Nature Limited 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">A common challenge facing cancer researchers is the need for in vitro cancer models representative of the mutational patterns and gene expression levels observed in patient populations. Indeed, differences in mutational burden and gene expression between patient tumors and immortalized cancer cell lines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> may contribute to drug development bottlenecks in which agents effective in vitro do not translate to complex and multifactorial clinical settings. As a result, there has been increasing interest in utilizing more physiologically relevant cancer models in pre-clinical research, for a more efficient treatment development pipeline<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> and to reduce animal testing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Tumoroids, sometimes referred to as cancer organoids, are patient-derived cancer cells that self-organize into three-dimensional (3D) structures in culture and preserve key phenotypic and genotypic features of patient cancers. Our own work comparing two-dimensional (2D) colorectal cancer cell lines with randomly selected primary colorectal cancer donor samples and non-matched colorectal tumoroids demonstrated that the 2D lines tested harbored higher numbers of clinically relevant mutations and had higher tumor mutational burdens compared to tumors and tumoroid lines (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). In addition, quantification of gene expression levels followed by hierarchical clustering revealed that the 2D lines tested clustered separately from the primary tumors, which instead clustered together with tumoroids (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). These observations emphasize that 2D lines are, in some cases, hypermutated and less representative of patient cancer gene expression patterns compared to tumoroid models. Therefore, tumoroids hold great promise in both pre-clinical and translational research. Specifically, these physiologically-relevant models could reveal aspects of tumor biology that are not recapitulated by immortalized cancer cell lines and could help increase the efficiency of treatment discovery pipelines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, and, potentially, identify effective patient treatments through functional precision medicine approaches<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">While the value of tumoroid culture in cancer research is apparent, the complexity of the approach has limited its adoption. Many methods for tumoroid culture rely on complicated 3D culture handling and medium production protocols<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, lack of standardization amongst bespoke media recipes (&#x0201c;homebrew&#x0201d; media systems), reliance on conditioned medium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, and growth competition with benign cell types<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. In this study, we demonstrate the capability of the serum-free, conditioned medium-free Gibco OncoPro Tumoroid Culture Medium (referred to throughout as &#x0201c;OncoPro medium&#x0201d;) to support derivation and long-term culture of colorectal, lung, breast, and endometrial tumoroid models, wherein the patient-specific characteristics identified from primary tumor tissue are recapitulated throughout the culture period. Specifically, the system is composed of Advanced DMEM/F-12&#x02009;+&#x02009;1X GlutaMAX basal media, 1X B-27 supplement, a bovine serum albumin (BSA) supplement, and a proprietary OncoPro Supplement, which are purchased as a kit and combined to form the complete serum-free OncoPro medium (see Materials and Methods and Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). The system relies on this conserved base OncoPro medium, with the addition of 1&#x02013;2 niche factors for some indications to support growth. For example, Heat Stable FGF-10 (HS FGF-10) is added to OncoPro medium to support lung tumoroid culture; see below and Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S1</xref> for details on additional cancer indications. Tumoroid culture was also performed in the presence of antibiotics and the ROCK inhibitor Y27632. Tumoroid expansion in the system is compatible with 3D encapsulation in basement membrane extract (BME) domes but also amenable to a suspension culture approach where the cells float freely in the presence of diluted BME to provide extracellular matrix (ECM) cues. Suspension tumoroid culture reduces BME consumption and simplifies handling to facilitate scale up and use in high-throughput applications. We show the compatibility of this novel media system and suspension culture workflow with the expansion of colorectal, lung, head and neck, breast, and pancreas tumoroid lines that had been previously cultured in homebrew media formulations, while maintaining the distinctive mutational and gene expression profiles of each cell model. Finally, to illustrate the utility of tumoroid models in preclinical cell therapy research, we developed a tumoroid line that stably expresses green fluorescent protein (GFP) and used these tumoroids to interrogate the killing potential of primary natural killer (NK) cells and an immortalized NK cell line (NK-92). Together, our results illustrate how OncoPro medium is broadly effective in maintaining donor-specific characteristics during in vitro tumoroid cell culture.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec43"><title>Derivation of tumoroid lines from primary cancer samples across multiple indications using a conserved base medium formulation</title><p id="Par5">To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for tumoroid derivation, we tested whether the OncoPro medium formulation supported generation of novel patient-derived cultures from viable cancer cells. Dissociated cells, either from commercially available cryopreserved material or following enzymatic dissociation of fresh primary tumor surgical resection samples, were cultured in OncoPro medium (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a). Samples from the initial material were also collected for subsequent genetic and transcriptomic analysis. No red blood cell lysis or cell selection/sorting was performed prior to placing all recovered cells from dissociated tumor samples into culture, sampling dissociated cell populations for flow cytometry, or collecting samples for sequencing. The indications represented in the derivation experiments were colorectal, lung, breast, and endometrial cancers. For lung cancer samples, the base OncoPro medium formulation was supplemented with HS FGF-10, while medium for breast and endometrial cancer tumoroids was supplemented with HS FGF-10 and beta-estradiol (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). Our derivation workflow typically utilized a hybrid approach combining embedded culture in BME hydrogel domes for the first several passages (typically&#x02009;~&#x02009;5), followed by scale up in a suspension culture format wherein 2% (v/v) basement membrane extract was added to OncoPro medium in non-tissue culture treated cell culture dishes and flasks to maintain the self-organized 3D morphologies characteristic of tumoroids.</p><p id="Par6">

</p><p id="Par7">Greater than 85% of samples initially formed 3D tumoroid structures and exhibited a range of donor-specific morphologies (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b), which were retained for the duration of culture in either embedded or suspension formats. Tumoroids were subcultured by dissociating multicellular 3D structures when they reached an average diameter of 100&#x02013;300&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m and seeding a mixture of single cells and small cell clusters (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">S2</xref>); samples that did not grow as large were passaged after a period of 14 days. Occasionally, overall cell number would decline during the first few passages in culture (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c). Approximately half of cultures grew stably in the long term, which we defined as expanding consistently for more than 5 passages and exceeding 5 cumulative population doublings from the initial number of cells seeded (including any non-cancer cells present in the initial sample; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c). These stringent cutoffs were good predictors of whether a tumoroid culture would continue to grow consistently and were confirmed in 2 colorectal and 2 lung samples, which grew for over 275 days. Select examples of unsuccessful derivation (tumoroids reforming for only a few passages) are also given (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c). Derivation of cultures to these standards typically required 50&#x02013;120 days (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>d). Based on these derivation criteria, 9 colorectal tumoroid lines, 2 lung tumoroid lines, 1 breast tumoroid line, and 8 endometrial tumoroid lines were successfully established and cryopreserved for subsequent use. Donor characteristics for derived tumoroid lines and information on whether cultures were initiated from viably cryopreserved dissociated tumor cells or fresh tumor resection samples (which were dissociated in our lab and then cultured) are summarized in Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S2</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Genomic characteristics of original tumor cells are retained in patient-derived tumoroid cultures</title><p id="Par8">To help ensure that tumoroids preserve key genomic features of donor cancer material, we performed genomic characterization of successfully derived tumoroid cultures after 5&#x02013;13 passages using the Ion Torrent Oncomine Comprehensive Assay v3 (OCAv3) for comparison to initial samples. Quantification of the variant allelic frequency (VAF) of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) detected by the assay revealed high concordance between matched tumors and tumoroids (Pearson correlation coefficient <italic>r</italic>&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;0.85) for colorectal (8/9), lung (2/2), breast (1/1), and endometrial (7/8) cancers (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a, top panel). SNV profiles were patient-specific, with little cross-correlation across donors (<italic>r</italic>&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;0.70 between donors when all compared; see Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S3</xref> and Methods). The proportion of single base substitutions was also retained when comparing original tumor samples to corresponding tumoroids (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a, middle panel). Furthermore, oncogenic driver mutations present in the original tumor samples were largely conserved in matched tumoroid cultures (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a, bottom panel). On a per-mutation basis, &#x0003e;&#x02009;87% of SNVs were shared between the initial samples and the derived tumoroids for 19/20 samples, suggesting minimal clonal loss or expansion in culture (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b, Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S4</xref>). The <italic>APC</italic> gene is commonly mutated in colorectal cancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>; as this gene is not covered by the OCAv3, we verified the presence of APC mutations in select colorectal tumoroids using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) genotyping assays (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S5</xref>). Overall, these results indicate that the tumoroid media system can support samples across broad genomic landscapes from multiple cancer indications.</p><p id="Par9">

Similarly, minimal transcriptome changes of 4.4% and 1.0% were observed when comparing initial tumor cells to established tumoroids in lung cancer (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;2) and endometrial cancer (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;8), respectively, and differences in gene expression were primarily related to immune cell-related signaling pathways (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">S3</xref>). Likewise, an unbiased gene expression analysis to identify the top 50 variable genes in our tumor/tumoroid data set followed by hierarchical clustering illustrated a decrease in gene expression levels associated with immune and stromal cells (e.g., <italic>CCL3</italic>, <italic>CCL4</italic>, <italic>COL1A2</italic>, <italic>COL1A3</italic>) when comparing tumors and derived tumoroids (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">S3</xref>).

The dropout of immune cell signatures is expected in established tumoroid cultures, as OncoPro medium is intended to culture cancer cells and is not expected to support immune and stromal cells over the long term, and is consistent with flow cytometry data indicating that stromal, immune, and endothelial cells that may be present in initial dissociated tumor samples are lost during long-term in vitro culture. Few genes (&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.25%) were differentially upregulated in tumoroids for all three cancer indications, and those genes were primarily related to metabolism signaling pathways (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>d; Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">S3</xref>).</p><p id="Par13">To directly compare the transcriptome of cancer epithelial cells from tumors and tumoroids, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of two dissociated tumor cell samples, HuCo3209 and HuCo021320, and matched tumoroid banks at passage 10 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>e, f). Cells from the original tumor material formed distinct clusters of epithelial, immune, and stromal cells (as defined by expression of canonical marker genes; Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">S4</xref>) that were often nearby or overlapping between the two donors (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>e, f), though the proportion of cell types varied by donor (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>g).

Experiments focused on suspension culture in non-tissue culture treated flasks with a low concentration of BME proteins (2% v/v) to provide ECM cues, a technique that facilitated routine maintenance of tumoroid lines. Patient-derived tumoroid cultures maintained their donor-specific morphologies during long-term suspension culture (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a). Tumoroid density in these representative images should not be taken as an indicator of growth, as the cells floating in the suspension culture can drift. Instead, cell growth rate was calculated by dissociating tumoroids to single cells during passaging and reseeding a known number of cells. Cell doubling time was donor-dependent and averaged around 65&#x000a0;h for colorectal tumoroids &#x02013; on par with that of 2D colorectal cancer cell lines &#x02013; and 90&#x02013;100&#x000a0;h for lung tumoroids.

Similarly, comparison of early passage (P4 or P5) to late passage (P37 or P35, respectively) lung tumoroids revealed that only 1.1% of genes were differentially expressed, with enrichment for a small number of KEGG pathways primarily related to inflammatory and neural signaling in early-passage tumoroids and no significantly upregulated pathways at later passages (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b).

Classification of colorectal cancer tumoroids using the PAM38 gene classifier showed that original and OncoPro medium cultures of the 782815-120-R-V1-organoid, 919269-233-R3-V2-organoid, and 3dGRO ISO72 tumoroids maintained the transit amplifying, goblet-like/inflammatory, and transit amplifying/stem-like subtypes present in the original samples, respectively, after culture in OncoPro medium (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">S13</xref>). Similarly, the basal subtype of triple negative 128162-247-R-V1-organoid and 868763-120-R-V1 breast cancer tumoroids (by the PAM50 gene signature) was consistent across culture formats (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">S13</xref>). However, PAM50 subtyping of 171881-019-R-V1-organoid and 755229-096-R-V1 lines showed that OncoPro cultures adopted HER2 subtypes, while the original cultures had characteristics of luminal B cancers. These lines are positive for estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) expression (ER+/PR+), and we noted that the expression of estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) and progesterone receptor (PGR) genes was lower in these cultures after transition to OncoPro medium. Of note, the expression of these genes was still significantly higher in the OncoPro medium-transitioned ER<sup>+</sup>/PR<sup>+</sup> lines when compared to the triple-negative lines, indicating retention of ER<sup>+</sup>/PR<sup>+</sup> expression in OncoPro medium (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">S13</xref>). Other groups have shown some loss of these receptors in 30% of conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, and further optimization of medium conditions may be required for maintenance of ER/PR levels that more consistently reflect those observed in clinical samples. Overall, these data indicate that OncoPro medium can be used for the culture of existing tumoroid models from colorectal, lung, breast, head and neck, and pancreas cancers, with minimal expected changes in growth rate, mutational profile, or gene expression levels.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Tumoroid suspension cultures are amenable to medium-throughput, multiplexed immune cell-mediated cytotoxicity assays</title><p id="Par28">To demonstrate the compatibility of tumoroids with genome engineering and cytotoxicity assays, we engineered a colorectal tumoroid line, HuCo1044, to express green fluorescent protein (GFP). After dissociation and exposure to lentivirus in suspension culture, 67% of tumoroid cells were GFP-positive (GFP+), which increased to over 99% after antibiotic selection (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">S14</xref>, Supplementary Video <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). Targeted genomic sequencing and transcriptome profiling indicated that the engineered cells had a high degree of similarity to the parental culture (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">S14</xref>). To simulate immune-oncology development workflows, we co-cultured GFP&#x02009;+&#x02009;tumoroids with primary natural killer (NK) cells or an immortalized NK cell line, NK-92. Primary NK cells isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells via negative selection demonstrated 94.8% purity (CD45&#x02009;+&#x02009;CD56+), were not enriched for CD3&#x02009;+&#x02009;T cells (0.25%), and contained 33.3% CD16<sup>bright</sup> cells (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">S14</xref>).

After 64&#x000a0;h, NK cells (effector cells) were seeded at various effector to target (E: T) ratios.

The system was used for both (1) deriving novel tumoroid lines from cryopreserved dissociated tumor cells and fresh surgical resection samples, and (2) culturing established cancer organoid lines. When supplemented with tissue-specific niche factors, we used OncoPro medium for culturing tumoroids from a variety of solid tumors, including colorectal, lung, pancreatic, head and neck, endometrial, and breast cancers. During culture, mutations and gene expression signatures characteristic of the starting material were retained (Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>), and select lines tested were tumorigenic (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">S6</xref>). Furthermore, tumoroids from a wide range of tumor stages, grades, mutational backgrounds, molecular subtypes, and donor demographics were supported (Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>; Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S2</xref>). There is not a clear pattern of these variables that determines compatibility with the medium, though this bears monitoring as sample size increases. Additionally, the genetic and transcriptomic concordance of derived tumoroids with the starting material was not affected by whether fresh tissue or cryopreserved dissociated tumor cells were used to initiate cultures for a limited number of colorectal cancer samples tested (Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>; Supplementary Figures <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">S3-S5</xref>; Supplementary Tables <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S3-S4</xref>; list of whether tumoroids were initiated from fresh tissue or cryopreserved dissociated tumor cells is given in Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S2</xref>). Future studies to quantify the effects of tissue handling prior to initiating tumoroid culture are warranted. We expect that supporting niche factors that enable culture from additional cancer indications will be uncovered, and additional efforts using both fresh tissue resections and existing tumoroid models from the NCI PDMR are in progress.</p><p id="Par31">Tumoroid culture establishment represents a key technology for enabling patient-derived cancer models and is more affordable than establishing novel patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Previous studies suggest that tumoroid and PDX models retain donor-specific mutations, histological markers, and gene expression levels from the originating tumor to a similar degree and exhibit generally concordant responses to drugs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Direct comparison of a PDX model, tumoroid model, and 2D cell lines derived from an ovarian clear cell carcinoma patient demonstrated that the PDX and tumoroid models recapitulated patient response to treatments, while the 2D cell line model did not<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. In our studies, the definition of a stable tumoroid line was one that: exceeded 5 cumulative population doublings based on the number of cells initially seeded in culture, was passaged every 14 days or less for over five passages, was freeze/thaw competent, and was genetically and transcriptionally similar to the initial tumor material (SNV VAF correlation <italic>r</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.7, tumor-tumoroid gene expression correlation <italic>r</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.7). The success rate for stable tumoroid line establishment varied depending on multiple factors, such as time between tumor excision and culture and whether dissociated cells had been cryopreserved, but, with an optimized protocol, remained around 50% for colorectal and endometrial cancers. Our studies with a limited number of cryopreserved, dissociated colorectal tumor cell samples show that while culture initiation from these sources is feasible, the time to reach 5 cumulative population doublings from the initially plated cell number may be longer when cryopreserved samples are used (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c and source data). More study will be required to understand the impact of using fresh vs. cryopreserved cells on derivation success rate. The endometrial cancer data sample set we studied during focused derivation experiments (which excludes model HuEn041521) constituted 15 fresh tumor samples that were received and processed within 24&#x000a0;h of tumor resection. Of those samples, 14/15 initially formed tumoroids in culture, 11/15 samples reformed tumoroids for several passages (passaging every 1&#x02013;2 weeks), and 7/15 samples were able to grow stably for as long as they were tested (100&#x02013;200 days). Our initial studies suggest that this success rate is lower in lung and breast cancers. In general, we noted much higher success rate (&#x0003e;&#x02009;85%) of tumoroid formation during short-term culture across indications, as also observed by others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>, making short-term studies feasible for a wider range of samples. Unsuccessful cultures failed to re-form 3D tumoroid structures after dissociation (sometimes after several passages) or stopped expanding in vitro, precluding their use as stable, expandable cell models. Additional protocol improvements or tissue-niche factors may further enhance derivation rates; others have demonstrated that derivation using multiple bespoke homebrew media in parallel can further enhance success<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par32">Altogether, tumoroids retain the major genomic mutations of the tumors from which they were derived. Targeted genomic profiling to compare tumor material to matched tumoroid cells revealed occurrence of oncogenic mutations and donor-specific SNVs at similar allelic frequencies in both sets. Additionally, we observed qualitatively similar base substitution patterns between initial tumor samples and established tumoroids in donor-matched comparisons (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), with T&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;C and C&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;T as the most abundant base substitutions in all samples, consistent with other findings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>; indeed, T&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;C and C&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;T substitutions have been associated with loss of heterozygosity and gain of heterozygosity across multiple cancer types<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. We noted some donor-to-donor variability in substitution patterns (for example, relatively fewer C&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;A substitutions in HuEn070722 compared to other endometrial samples) within the largely similar substitution patterns for a given donor. Copy number variations were also maintained, as estimated broadly over the genome using scRNA-seq and inferCNV or by the OCAv3 assay. Mutations identified in tumor and tumoroid samples will depend on the sequencing method and analysis pipeline, and broader genomic sequencing would supplement the targeted approach utilized here. Comparison of epigenetic modifications to tumor cells would also be worthwhile given recent findings that tumoroids retain greater sensitivity to epigenetic vulnerabilities than 2D cell lines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par33">The loss of expression of immune and other stromal cell signaling pathways during derivation in OncoPro medium represented the major changes in the gene expression profiles of tumoroid cultures when compared to primary tumor material (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). In concordance with this finding, flow cytometry and single cell RNAseq data demonstrate that stromal and immune cells present in the initial tumor sample are not supported over long-term culture in OncoPro medium (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">S3</xref>,<xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">S4</xref>). KEGG pathway analysis of genes upregulated in initial colorectal tumor samples compared to established colorectal cancer tumoroids identified pathways that are likely associated with paracrine signaling between cancer cells and cells in the microenvironment, such as hematopoietic cells (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c); this signaling appears to be lost when non-epithelial cells are not retained during long-term tumoroid culture. Other media systems have also demonstrated loss of signaling associated with non-malignant cell components over the course of weeks in culture<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. At the single-cell level, comparison of malignant tumor cells and tumoroid cells demonstrated that transcriptomes were similar, with a correlation coefficient of 0.85, further indicating that loss of non-tumor cell populations drive much of the observed transcriptional changes observed during culture establishment. Transcriptional changes within the tumor cell population may be caused by removal of cell-cell contacts or paracrine signaling from non-malignant cells. Preservation or re-addition of other cell types in co-culture or using in vivo models may restore these cues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>.

The lack of these cells is a shortcoming of our current model and is one area, along with metabolic processes, where initial tumor samples may resemble PDX models more closely than tumoroids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par34">As compared to several other published methods<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>, our proprietary and novel serum-free medium does not require conditioned medium or Wnt agonists such as R-spondins. Additionally, no small molecule inhibitors are present in the OncoPro basal medium, OncoPro Supplement, BSA supplement, or B-27 supplement. The lack of Wnt activation may protect against non-malignant cells outcompeting malignant cells in tumoroid line derivation, a known issue with some cancer indications, including lung and breast cancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. Despite lacking Wnt agonists, OncoPro medium supported multiple tumoroid models from the NCI PDMR that are typically grown in systems containing Wnt and R-spondins. This is in line with literature suggesting that exogenous Wnt activation may not be required for in vitro growth of multiple cancer indications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>, either by gene mutation, endogenous production, or through transcriptional programming. In line with this, we verified the presence of APC mutations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> in select colorectal tumoroids (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S5</xref>). In addition to Wnt agonists, other factors and small molecules demonstrated to be necessary for the growth of non-malignant organoids are present in many published tumoroid media formulations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. The absence of Wnt agonists, R-spondins, noggin, and small molecule inhibitors (prior to the addition of Y27632 in some culture protocols) in the OncoPro medium formulation makes this system incompatible with the long-term culture of adult stem cell-derived organoids. Organoids derived from non-diseased tissue are used for comparison to tumoroids in some assays, and while our system prevents overgrowth by non-malignant cells in culture, one drawback is that a separate media system would be required for experiments incorporating healthy adult stem cell-derived organoids.</p><p id="Par35">Once established, comparison of early and late passage tumoroid cultures indicated stable growth rates, with retention of CNV levels and SNV presence and frequency, demonstrating stability over months in culture. This result held for both internally-derived tumoroid lines and tumoroids procured from external parties, where OncoPro medium supported commercially available tumoroid models (17/18 tested here). Testing revealed the importance of beginning with sufficient cell number from high-quality cryobanks or ongoing cultures, and passage of individual cultures when tumoroids reached sufficient size to prevent overgrowth (even if it meant passaging different media conditions at different times). Overall, growth and morphology were similar between homebrew media systems and OncoPro medium embedded or suspension cultures, with occasional donor-to-donor variability in growth rate between culture formats or media. One lung adenocarcinoma line (LG0481-F231-V1-organoid) expanded in the NCI recommended medium but not in OncoPro medium, while one lip/oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (head and neck) sample (832693-133-R-V1-organoid) expanded in OncoPro medium but not the NCI recommended medium in our hands. NCI PDMR standard protocols rely on the addition of fetal bovine serum (FBS) through addition of L-WRN conditioned medium, and it is possible that the instances in which tumoroid growth was slower in NCI PDMR media compared to OncoPro medium was influenced by our approach using recombinant Wnt (W), RSPO (R), and noggin (N) sources, which changed the source of WRN in the media and eliminated FBS from these cultures. While we believe that the reproducibility and ease-of-use of the OncoPro medium system offers substantial advantages to homebrew approaches, 17 of the 18 NCI PDMR tumoroid models that we tested also expanded in homebrew media (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>, Supplementary Figure <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">S10</xref>, Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S6</xref>), which remains an alternative option to culture tumoroid models. Additional homebrew media recipes have been used and described for tumoroid derivation and culture in the literature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>, and these could also serve as potential alternatives to OncoPro medium.</p><p id="Par36">Critically, genomic mutations and gene expression patterns were maintained during culture of established tumoroid lines in OncoPro medium in both embedded and suspension formats. These comparisons also revealed that few genes were differentially expressed after months in culture. Molecular subtypes of colorectal and triple-negative breast cancers were maintained during tumoroid culture, suggesting that key clinical aspects of gene expression signatures are stable during culture using OncoPro medium. Such maintenance of clinical subtype during tumoroid establishment has been named as critically important to demonstrate the physiological relevance of in vitro cancer models, especially with regard to drug response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>, and previous publications have mixed claims regarding the ability of tumoroids to adequately maintain subtypes representative of the tissue from which the tumoroid was derived or generate biobanks with tumoroid lines representing certain clinical subtypes. In line with this result, we observed some shift of hormone-receptor positive lines towards a HER2 subtype in OncoPro medium, with concomitant decreases in estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor gene expression levels compared to cryopreserved tumoroids received from the NCI PDMR (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">S13</xref>). Molecular subtyping approaches are dependent on the timepoint for comparison (tissue versus early passage for later comparison), cancer type of interest, assay of choice (scRNA-seq versus bulk RNA sequencing), and analysis pipeline, to name a few, and can thus be difficult to compare across studies. Future testing of the functional impact of maintenance of molecular subtype by screening therapeutic compounds for early versus late passage organoids and, ultimately, a retrospective analysis of organoid response in vitro compared to primary tumor response would be more definitive.</p><p id="Par37">We anticipate that standardized and easy-to-use tumoroid culture systems will promote their use in assays in which immortalized 2D cancer cell lines are commonly used. To this end, OncoPro medium is manufactured at GMP-compliant, ISO 13485-certified manufacturing sites, is functionally tested to ensure that each production lot enables tumoroid growth, and was designed to enable consistent tumoroid media preparation and compatibility with multiple cancer indications and formats during 3D cell culture. The serum- and conditioned-medium free formulation streamlined medium preparation and allowed for standardization between users and institutions and from lot-to-lot (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">S7</xref>), a clear need in the cancer organoid field<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Suspension culture is emerging as a more accessible alternative to embedded tumoroid culture, which requires greater amounts of expensive matrix material, precise pipetting, and, in many cases, careful control of reagent temperature. In previous studies, tumoroids exhibited reduced or minimal growth in suspension without ECM proteins, though the addition of 2&#x02013;5% volume/volume ECM potentiated growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>. These studies have demonstrated suspension culture of primary colorectal, metastatic colorectal, and esophageal tumoroids, typically for 2&#x02013;4 weeks, with some examples of longer durations (20&#x02013;25 weeks)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>. Another approach is to encapsulate tumoroid or organoid cells in small droplets of ECM that float in suspension medium, which has been demonstrated in NSCLC and non-malignant intestinal organoids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>. In our study, the addition of 2% BME generated a reliable suspension culture system suitable for long-term culture across a variety of cancer indications when used in conjunction with OncoPro medium. The time required for laboratory personnel to subculture tumoroids cultured in suspension decreased by approximately 2-fold compared to the embedded approach in our testing, facilitating maintenance of tumoroid models for downstream assays. Importantly, we demonstrated few changes at the transcriptome level between tumoroids in embedded or suspension culture. Potential downregulation in hypoxia-related signaling, cytokine-cytokine receptor interactions, and TNF&#x003b1; signaling in suspension compared to embedded culture formats (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">S12</xref>) should be considered during assay design.</p><p id="Par38">As one example of how tumoroid assays could be implemented, we engineered a tumoroid reporter line to express GFP and used that line to assess NK cell cytotoxicity in a 3D culture format (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). Testing the cytotoxic potential on 2D models of solid tumor cancers does not adequately represent the physiological conditions with which NK cells will contend in vivo, namely dense tumor tissue and nutrient gradients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup>, which are better represented with tumoroid morphologies. However, dense BME domes may inhibit immune cell infiltration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref></sup>, an issue which the suspension culture outlined here circumvents. That said, murine-derived BME may itself cause reactivity of CD4&#x02009;+&#x02009;T cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref></sup>, and the microenvironment in which tumoroid and immune cell co-culture assays are performed should be carefully considered. In our experiments, multiplexed reporters enabled analysis of NK-cell mediated cytotoxicity by two signals, GFP reduction and increased caspase-3/7 activity, that were quantifiable and distinct from tumoroid-only, medium-only, and NK cell-only controls in our experiments. These techniques could be readily adapted to research on other modalities of cancer therapeutics.</p><p id="Par39">Finally, multiple reports have demonstrated that drug response in patient-derived tumoroid models, at least in some cases, correlates highly with matched donor response during clinical treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref></sup>.

Sample size was determined based on past experience in obtaining a reproducible mean tumor size by the TLSS facility. HuCo1044 tumoroids and HuLu051921 tumoroids were derived from female donors and injected into female mice. As this experiment was designed to test the feasibility of xenograft growth using tumoroid models, no control group was used. All experiments were performed under Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) approval by the University of Maryland Baltimore Animal Care and Use Program in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations. Tumor volume was monitored for up to 90 days post-injection, at which time mice were euthanized by CO<sub>2</sub> inhalation. Mice were euthanized prior to this time point if tumors reached 10% of mouse body weight, or if no tumor was present at 60 days post-injection. Researchers were not blinded to the tumoroid line which had been injected during monitoring. For the HuLu051921 line, all three tumors were not measured at each time point. Tumor volume in one animal was measured at the 11, 32, and 35&#x000a0;day time points, and the day 40 tumor volume measurement for HuLu051921 was made on two instead of three animals.
