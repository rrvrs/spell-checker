The first level
consists of tangible artifacts, which are visible and observable structures,
processes and behaviors (<xref rid="ref064" ref-type="bibr">Schein, 2010</xref>).
The second level comprises the organization&#x02019;s values and beliefs, which
includes shared goals, aspirations and ideologies. The third level is composed of
implicit assumptions that an organization&#x02019;s employees unconsciously hold.
Their assumptions influence their behavior. For this study, Schein&#x02019;s
definition of OC is used due to its basis in multiple research studies. In addition,
Schein critiques the perception of OC as only shared values and beliefs, which
results in a conception of OC as a fixed and set of values that may be
problematically operationalized in management tools to change the culture. Due to
the influence of OC on employee behavior and performance, attempting to create a
strong OC is imperative for organizations&#x02019; leaders. Leadership has been
defined as influencing others, setting examples and a vision, collaborating, and
supporting and caring for others (<xref rid="ref022" ref-type="bibr">Eddy
<italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2023</xref>; <xref rid="ref042" ref-type="bibr">Lee and Ding, 2024</xref>). Moreover, OC may have been influenced
by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, which occurred from March 2020
through May 2023 and resulted in most businesses, commerce, schools and other
activities of daily living temporarily closing (<xref rid="ref076" ref-type="bibr">United Nations, 2023</xref>). However, hospitals remained open for care;
personnel, including non-patient-facing employees, did not work remotely as a
result, unlike employees in other industries. OC may have been significantly
influenced by the pandemic. For example, the pandemic may have changed OC in
hospitals to be more agile; decisions that may have taken several months to be made
may have been made in only weeks. Moreover, smaller teams may have been assembled
for quicker decision-making instead of large committees that commonly meet monthly,
which is how health systems traditionally have made decisions. The pandemic may also
have transformed OC to be more collaborative, supportive and prioritizing mental
health (<xref rid="ref015" ref-type="bibr">Carlasare <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>,
2024</xref>; <xref rid="ref049" ref-type="bibr">Maple
<italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2024</xref>). However, the pandemic may have
had negative effects on OC, such as creating a more stressful, high-paced and hectic
work environment (<xref rid="ref084" ref-type="bibr">Zink
<italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2024</xref>). However, the previous studies
focus on physicians and nurses instead of non-patient-facing employees. It is
unknown how OC has affected non-patient-facing health system employees.</p><p>OC has been studied in several industries, including healthcare (<xref rid="ref018" ref-type="bibr">Deal and Kennedy, 1982</xref>; <xref rid="ref012" ref-type="bibr">Braithwaite <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>,
2017</xref>; <xref rid="ref059" ref-type="bibr">Prodromou and Papageorgiou,
2022</xref>; <xref rid="ref006" ref-type="bibr">Al-Nammari
<italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2023</xref>; <xref rid="ref065" ref-type="bibr">Sen <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>., 2023</xref>). However, little
research has been conducted about perceptions of OC among non-patient-facing health
system employees. Health systems are defined as &#x0201c;collaborative healthcare
organizations encompassing hospitals, physician practices, ambulatory sites, and
administrative offices,&#x0201d; such as information technology (<xref rid="ref005" ref-type="bibr">AHRQ, 2023</xref>; <xref rid="ref035" ref-type="bibr">Johnson and Shamroukh, 2024</xref>). While patient-facing
employees, such as nurses and physicians, comprise a substantial percentage of
health system employees and can be directly tied to a hospital&#x02019;s revenue
(e.g. the more patients are treated, the more revenue the health system generates),
non-patient-facing employees are essential to supporting patient-facing employees.
For example, data analysts are necessary to create dashboards that show which units
have the most patients at certain times of the day so that nurse managers can staff
those units with an adequate number of nurses at the right time. Doing so ensures
that patients are cared for in a timely manner without sacrificing care quality and
protects against nursing burnout resulting from staffing shortages. Additionally,
environmental service employees thoroughly clean the hospitals to protect them from
the spread of infections, which result in patient complications and longer
lengths-of-stay. Longer lengths-of-stay prevent other patients who need care from
being admitted to the hospital. If patients cannot receive necessary care in a
timely manner, then they may return to the hospital sicker than they were
previously. More complex patients require more resources (e.g. physicians and lab
tests) would need to be used.</p><p>If non-patient-facing employees have a negative view of their health system OC, then
they may be more likely to stop working for that health system (<xref rid="ref019" ref-type="bibr">Du <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2024</xref>;
<xref rid="ref045" ref-type="bibr">Li <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>,
2024</xref>). Without non-patient-facing employees supporting the patient-facing
roles, nurses, physicians and other patient-facing employees will have to use their
time completing these supporting tasks, such as cleaning and transporting patients
to different units instead of caring for patients. Time used on tasks other than
patient care has been shown to dissatisfy patient-facing employees and contribute to
burnout (<xref rid="ref025" ref-type="bibr">Gidwani <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>,
2017</xref>; <xref rid="ref050" ref-type="bibr">McCormick
<italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2018</xref>; <xref rid="ref001" ref-type="bibr">Abda <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2023</xref>). Therefore, this
study examines perceptions of OC among mainly health system non-patient-facing
employees, who are defined as employees who work in non-clinical areas, such as in
the information systems department. They do not medically treat patients as part of
their daily work &#x02013; that is, they are non-patient-facing. Examples of
non-patient-facing employees include non-patient-facing assistants, financial
analysts and directors of marketing. Moreover, they include employees in leadership
roles, such as managers and directors, and individual contributors, such as
marketing associates and data analysts. Non-patient-facing employees comprise nearly
half of the health system workforce; their work significantly affects hospital
performance (<xref rid="ref029" ref-type="bibr">Hospitals - May 2022 OEWS
Industry-Specific Occupational Employment and Wage Estimates, 2023</xref>). This
research is novel because it is one of the first to study perceptions of OC among
non-patient-facing employees in health systems using a survey and semi-structured
interviews to determine drivers and the context of OC for non-patient-facing health
system employees.</p><p>Executive leaders have been shown to be key influencers of OC (<xref rid="ref053" ref-type="bibr">Montminy, 2022</xref>; <xref rid="ref054" ref-type="bibr">Mrayyan
<italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2023</xref>). For example, managers
promoting patient safety through their expectations and actions was shown to highly
impact the safety culture of a health system (<xref rid="ref027" ref-type="bibr">Hata <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2022</xref>). Safety culture is defined as
how employees perceive &#x0201c;the necessity of values, attitudes, skills and
behaviors focusing on an institution&#x02019;s patient care processes and the related
workforce&#x0201d; (<xref rid="ref066" ref-type="bibr">Sendlhofer
<italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="ref058" ref-type="bibr">&#x000d6;zer and &#x0015e;anta&#x0015f;, 2020</xref>). Safety culture
includes &#x0201c;the units, organizational structures and systems that produce
shared values of important issues,&#x0201d; beliefs about how organizational problems
are addressed, and behavioral norms that contribute to patient safety (<xref rid="ref075" ref-type="bibr">Ulrich and Kear, 2014</xref>). OC is related to
safety culture; the more positively employees perceive their OC, then the more
likely that a safety culture will be prominent (<xref rid="ref036" ref-type="bibr">Juanda <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>., 2024</xref>). An OC of empowerment has
also been shown to improve patient safety culture (<xref rid="ref062" ref-type="bibr">Rusdi <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>., 2024</xref>). Additionally,
managerial support for certain policies, such as health equity policies, can create
an OC in which health equity is highly valued, which is another way in which leaders
impact OC (<xref rid="ref023" ref-type="bibr">Erasmus
<italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2017</xref>). However, inadequate leadership can
create an OC of a lack of &#x0201c;owning&#x0201d; problems, territorialism, cynicism
and dysfunction (<xref rid="ref017" ref-type="bibr">Dalmas and Azzopardi,
2019</xref>).</p><p>Hata <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. found that teamwork affects perceptions of safety
culture (<xref rid="ref027" ref-type="bibr">Hata <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>,
2022</xref>). Due to a lack of teamwork, there was a lack of a patient safety
culture; employees did not refer patients to different departments, even when doing
so was best for the patient. Therefore, the organization had a culture of not
putting its patients first (<xref rid="ref003" ref-type="bibr">Agom
<italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2020</xref>). Role competition, complexity
and ambiguity may reduce teamwork.</p><p><xref rid="ref027" ref-type="bibr">Hata <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. (2022)</xref>
also concluded that the number of hours worked per week influences perceptions of
OC, which aligns with Tlili <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>.&#x02019;s findings that a
higher workload results in more negative perceptions of OC (<xref rid="ref074" ref-type="bibr">Tlili <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2020</xref>). Furthermore,
high workloads can hinder a culture of innovation and change; employees with high
workloads do not believe that change can positively affect everyone (<xref rid="ref017" ref-type="bibr">Dalmas and Azzopardi, 2019</xref>). Their studies
show several of the drivers of perceptions of OC, such as workload, leadership and
teamwork. Thus, one of the objectives of this study is to assess whether these same
drivers influence OC among non-patient-facing employees.</p><p>Several studies measure health system employees&#x02019; perceptions of OC. <xref rid="ref085" ref-type="bibr">Chesley (2020)</xref> used the Competing Values
Framework (CVF) to quantitatively measure and categorize different OCs in their
study about OC among merged health systems in the United States. Chesley found that
frontline staff, middle management and executive leadership had different
perceptions of the CVF&#x02019;s different categories of OC, such as team culture and
hierarchal culture. However, the authors did not review in-depth the specific scores
and differences between each category. Therefore, to address the complexities of OC,
a quantitative and qualitative instrument to measure different aspects of OC, which
includes teamwork and employee involvement, could be used.</p><p>Similar to Chesley, <xref rid="ref052" ref-type="bibr">Mesfin
<italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. (2020)</xref> used the CVF to measure
physicians&#x02019;, nurses&#x02019;, technical employees&#x02019; and support
employees&#x02019; perceptions of OC in four Ethiopian hospitals (<xref rid="ref052" ref-type="bibr">Mesfin <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>,
2020</xref>). Most perceived their hospitals to have a hierarchal culture, defined
as a clear organizational structure and rules, procedures and clearly defined
responsibilities; and a market culture, in which the hospital was externally
oriented instead of internally oriented. However, most of their sample was comprised
of patient-facing employees instead of non-patient-facing staff. The measuring of
perceptions of OC among multiple job categories in a hospital demonstrates the
importance of measuring patient-facing and non-patient-facing employees&#x02019;
perceptions of OC among health systems, not only one hospital. Additionally, their
study demonstrates that the theories of OC, such as hierarchical and market
theories, apply to different job categories. This study assesses these dynamics of
OC among non-patient-facing employees to continue the studies that Chesley and
others began.</p><p>In their analysis of OC, particularly regarding patient safety, in Japanese health
systems, <xref rid="ref027" ref-type="bibr">Hata <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>.
(2022)</xref> found that physicians and nurses believed that the OC of their
hospitals were positive, such as having a high degree of teamwork in units and an
organization oriented toward continuous improvement, while unit secretaries found
the OC as non-positive. In a United States&#x02019; Veterans&#x02019; Association
hospital&#x02019;s mental health department, perceptions of OC differed among
different professions. For example, rehabilitation counselors perceived OC more
positively than social workers (<xref rid="ref068" ref-type="bibr">Sieracki
<italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2024</xref>). Part of the discrepancy was
regarding a lack of recognition toward clinical and mental health staff, such as
social workers and physicians. Moreover, various ways of communication with
different professions also may contribute to perceptions of whether OC is
transparent. For example, a daily huddle in which the same information is provided
to different professions simultaneously, such as safety and staffing needs,
increases whether employees perceive their OC as psychologically safe to share
concerns, may increase perceptions of transparency and communication, and contribute
to a culture of feedback in which leaders consider employees&#x02019; insights. Their
work suggests that different categories of employees perceive culture differently.
However, these studies do not address perceptions of OC among different
non-patient-facing roles; moreover, few studies focus on different perceptions of OC
among different roles. While several studies assess perceptions of OC among
different professions, the researchers aggregate the data and do not indicate the
differences between different professions&#x02019; perceptions of OC, nor are they
thoroughly discussed (<xref rid="ref033" ref-type="bibr">Jafari
<italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2020</xref>; <xref rid="ref020" ref-type="bibr">Dziurka <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2022</xref>). Thus, this
study seeks to measure how employees with different roles perceive OC.</p><p>A paucity of studies exist in which non-patient-facing health system employees are
interviewed and surveyed about their perceptions of OC. Most of the recent
literature in healthcare focuses on perceptions of OC among patient-facing employees
in health systems instead of perceptions of non-patient-facing employees. Since OC
can influence behavior and work performance among all employees, further research is
needed about the perceptions of OC among non-patient-facing employees (<xref rid="ref069" ref-type="bibr">Simpson <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>,
2014</xref>; <xref rid="ref077" ref-type="bibr">van Rooij and Fine, 2018</xref>).
The behavior and work performance of non-patient-facing employees could impact
patient care. For example, a high workload contributes to a stressful OC. Therefore,
non-patient-facing schedulers who schedule appointments for patients from lab orders
may not do so in a timely manner due to high workloads preventing them from
scheduling all needed appointments in a workday. Patients may not receive timely
care, which results in worsened patient outcomes, such as complications of
sicknesses. The more positively an employee views his or her OC, the better his or
her work performance could be. OC affects factors beyond patient care, such as
turnover. Employees who work in a hierarchical OC, characterized by a low degree of
employee autonomy and managers controlling how employees work and a low amount of
managerial support are more likely to resign from their workplace (<xref rid="ref037" ref-type="bibr">Jung <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>., 2017</xref>;
<xref rid="ref021" ref-type="bibr">D&#x02019;Alessandro-Lowe
<italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2024</xref>; <xref rid="ref019" ref-type="bibr">Du <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2024</xref>; <xref rid="ref045" ref-type="bibr">Li <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2024</xref>).
Turnover has financial consequences for organizations; recruiting, training and
hiring new employees is a substantial expense in time and labor (<xref rid="ref044" ref-type="bibr">Lee <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>., 2021</xref>).
For example, nursing turnover costs hospitals approximately $88,000 per nurse
(<xref rid="ref013" ref-type="bibr">Brook <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>,
2019</xref>; <xref rid="ref010" ref-type="bibr">Bae, 2022</xref>; <xref rid="ref081" ref-type="bibr">Xie <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>,
2024</xref>).</p><p>Because OC changes depending on departments, leaders, and various other factors,
qualitative and quantitative studies could be conducted to address cultural dynamics
(<xref rid="ref055" ref-type="bibr">Muhr <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>.,
2022</xref>). Additionally, cultural dynamics could be accounted for by
integrating the differentiation theory of OC in which the differences of subcultures
within an organization are accounted for. Interviews among the same employees in the
same organizations, or interviewees&#x02019; assessments of how leaders view other
teams and subcultures, such as ethnic minorities, add to overall perceptions of
OC.</p><p>A void in the literature exists in which non-patient-facing health system employees
have not been interviewed or surveyed about their perceptions of their
organization&#x02019;s culture. Most studies focus on patient-facing employees or do
not utilize a mixed-methods approach but are cross-sectional (<xref rid="ref061" ref-type="bibr">Roth <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2021</xref>; <xref rid="ref028" ref-type="bibr">He <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2023</xref>;
<xref rid="ref046" ref-type="bibr">Logro&#x000f1;o
<italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2023</xref>). This study fills the literature
gap of perceptions of OC among non-patient-facing health system employees by
interviewing and surveying them about their perceptions of their
organization&#x02019;s culture during the COVID-19 pandemic. Previous studies have
not focused on the pandemic&#x02019;s influence on non-patient-facing
employees&#x02019; perceptions of OC, even though they may have been affected by
resource constraints, such as a lack of staff, as patient-facing employees were.
This study shows the importance of measuring and accounting for non-patient-facing
employees when leaders cultivate OC through their actions and decisions.</p><p>To further explore health system non-patient-facing employees&#x02019; perceptions of
OC, the following research questions will be explored:<statement content-type="research-question" id="stmt1"><label>RQ1.</label><p>What are non-patient-facing health system employees&#x02019; perceptions of

health system employees.</p></sec><sec id="sec001.2"><title>Setting, measurement and study design</title><p>This is an explanatory sequential study in which a quantitative phase was first
implemented, which involved survey data collection and analysis, followed by a
qualitative phase, which encompassed interviews, interview recording and
transcription, and coding to develop themes.</p><p>In the quantitative phase, Kovner <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>.&#x02019;s
reliable and valid 31-item survey measuring organizational aspects that led to
turnover was used (<xref rid="ref039" ref-type="bibr">Kovner
<italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2007a</xref>). <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;1</xref> shows how their survey items and subdomains
relate to aspects of OC in the literature; moreover, many of the questions used
in the survey were derived from scales measuring aspects of OC, such as
procedural justice, as stated by <xref rid="ref009" ref-type="bibr">Ashkanasay
<italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. (2011)</xref>. Previous research in which
their survey was used on non-nurses showed a reliability score of 0.97 and a
validity score of 0.87 (<xref rid="ref034" ref-type="bibr">Johnson and Newman,
2024</xref>). Their survey instrument measures factors of OC, such as the
level of managerial support and teamwork in an organization via a Likert scale
that measures items from 1 (poor) to 5 (excellent). The subdomains of each
category are supervisor support (6 items), work-group cohesion (6 items), work
attitudes (12 items) and safety (7 items). Each of these subdomains reflects
aspects of OC. For example, perceptions of supervisor support, co-worker
cohesion and attitudes reflect whether the OC is supportive or encourages
collaboration (<xref rid="ref057" ref-type="bibr">Ogbonnaya
<italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="ref053" ref-type="bibr">Montminy, 2022</xref>; <xref rid="ref004" ref-type="bibr">Ahmed
and Bein, 2023</xref>). Employee attitudes also affect behavior, which,
thus, influences OC (<xref rid="ref064" ref-type="bibr">Schein, 2010</xref>;
<xref rid="ref053" ref-type="bibr">Montminy, 2022</xref>). The remaining six
items pertained to demographics. Further information about these domains,
including the items in each, is detailed elsewhere (<xref rid="ref035" ref-type="bibr">Johnson and Shamroukh, 2024</xref>).</p><p>Kovner <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>.&#x02019;s study aimed to estimate turnover
rates among newly licensed registered nurses (RNs) using a survey measuring
aspects of OC, such as teamwork and perceptions of supervisor support. Questions
were adapted from their survey to use in the current study and address the
research question of how non-patient-facing health system employees perceive
their OC. Furthermore, based on previously cited literature, factors such as
teamwork and leadership support impact perceptions of OC; Kovner
<italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>.&#x02019;s survey questions address these
influencers of OC. Moreover, Kovner <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>.&#x02019;s
survey questions are derived from several instruments measuring aspects of OC
(<xref rid="ref034" ref-type="bibr">Johnson and Newman, 2024</xref>). Their
survey questions also align with questions in the Organizational Culture
Assessment Questionnaire (OCAQ), which is used for the general population of
employees. Demographics questions were added to assess differences between
locations, employees&#x02019; positions, health system sizes, employees&#x02019;
departments and ownership status &#x02013; that is, who owns the health system,
such as the United States&#x02019; federal government; the public, which pays
taxes to support the health system; or a private party or private equity
investor (<xref rid="ref080" ref-type="bibr">Welch
<italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2023</xref>).</p><p>The survey was hosted on <ext-link xlink:href="http://JotForm.com" ext-link-type="uri">JotForm.com</ext-link>, and responses were
collected and participants recruited from February 2022 to October 2022.
Participants could complete the survey in any location because the survey was
hosted online.</p><p>Following the quantitative phase, a qualitative phase was implemented to assess
the nuances within and deepen understanding of the survey results. The
qualitative phase involved similar questions as the quantitative phase but
allowed the ability to ask more probing questions to understand the reasoning
behind several survey responses, such as whether respondents believed that their
OC was positive. An interview guide is included as a <xref rid="app1" ref-type="app">Supplementary Table</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="sec001.3"><title>Data collection</title><p>In the quantitative phase, an appropriate sample size for adequate statistical
power in a 95% confidence interval was determined to be 385 based on an
estimated population of 2,000,000 health system workers. purposeful sampling was
used in which all employees of subacute health systems were invited to
participate via trade organizations (organizations that advocate and provide
informational content for certain industries) and social media (e.g. LinkedIn).
The survey was shared via people of influence (e.g. manager-level and above) in
the first author&#x02019;s (TJ) social network, who included managers of health
systems, who then distributed the <ext-link xlink:href="http://JotForm.com" ext-link-type="uri">JotForm.com</ext-link> survey link to their
contacts to minimize bias. All responses were confidential and anonymous.
Participants provided informed consent at the beginning of the survey. The
survey was sent to over 100 trade organizations and health systems; however,
only 67 responses were received due to several trade organizations and health
systems either failing to respond to the first author or declining participation
for diverse reasons (<xref rid="ref035" ref-type="bibr">Johnson and Shamroukh,
2024</xref>). In the solicitation message, a definition of
non-patient-facing employees was included. Responses involving patient-facing
employees, such as bedside nurses, were excluded from the sample to focus
exclusively on non-patient-facing roles. However, non-patient-facing clinical
staff, including nurse and physician managers, were retained in the study to
ensure their perspectives were represented in the analysis. In the qualitative
phase, a convenient, purposeful sample of potential interviewees was contacted
via e-mail or social media, such as LinkedIn messages and Reddit posts on
communities targeting non-patient-facing health system employees. Additionally,
the author received interviewee recommendations from colleagues within the
American College of Healthcare Executives (ACHE), which is a trade organization
for healthcare professionals. At the end of the survey, participants were asked
to optionally provide their e-mail address if they wanted to be contacted for an
interview. To be included in the study, participants must be employees of a
hospital or health system (defined as having at least one hospital instead of
only another type of healthcare facility, such as primary care offices) and
non-patient-facing in their daily tasks (e.g. business intelligence developers
or nurses who worked as managers and did not clinically treat patients as part
of their daily work). Interested interviewees were invited to participate in a
virtual interview that occurred over Microsoft Teams or phone. The interviews
were recorded and transcribed for accuracy. Transcriptions and recordings were
entered into ATLAS.ti 22 for analysis.</p><p>In the qualitative phase, the first author invited employees who worked in health
systems located in the Mid-Atlantic United States to participate in a one-on-one
interview about their perceptions of OC via LinkedIn and e-mail. The first
author conducted semi-structured interviews until data saturation was reached,
for a total of 23 interviews from 23 individuals. Data saturation was determined
to have been reached when no new information or themes were obtained (<xref rid="ref026" ref-type="bibr">Guest <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>.,
2020</xref>). Triangulation was achieved via using a mixed-methods approach;
the interview responses deepened understanding of the survey results.
Additionally, the interviews were conducted among different non-patient-facing
employees in different health systems; for example, business intelligence
developers and non-patient-facing assistants were interviewed. Their responses
were similar, which corroborated the results. Therefore, the results are more
likely to be generalizable. Moreover, fidelity was ensured by recording and
transcribing the interviews word-by-word. The interviewer also asked
participants if her interpretation of their responses was correct, which is
known as member-checking.</p><p>The interviews were conducted from October 2022 to January 2023 via Microsoft
Teams and phone. Verbal and written consent was obtained prior to the
interviews. The interviews were recorded and transcribed using Microsoft Teams.
The interviewer used an interview guide from the questions and dimensions of the
OCAQ to ask participants open-ended questions (<xref rid="ref063" ref-type="bibr">Sashkin and Rosenbach, 1996</xref>). Each interview lasted
approximately 30- to 45-min. If further clarification was required, then probing
questions were asked. The interviewer uploaded the recordings and transcriptions
into ATLAS.ti 22 (a qualitative data analysis software package) for emergent
coding.</p><p>This research has been approved by Harrisburg University of Science and
Technology&#x02019;s Institutional Review Board (IRB# 20221026).</p></sec><sec id="sec001.4"><title>Analysis</title><p>The quantitative survey results were analyzed using R. Because all survey
questions were mandatory to answer, there were no missing data to address. The
means of each question response were found, and correlation analysis of
statistically significant correlations was conducted to assess trends and
relationships between scores. Moreover, each question addresses a driver of OC,
such as leadership support and teamwork.</p><p>The interview transcriptions were analyzed using ATLAS.ti 22. The analytical
categories, or codes, were derived emergently (inductively) in which the
transcriptions were first read and then codes were created from the
transcriptions line-by-line. The codes were identified as recurring, similar
responses to questions and were based on the values coding method, in which
codes were created that reflected participants&#x02019; worldviews and placed in
a codebook. The codes were refined iteratively based on the themes discovered in
the interviews. The codes were arranged into categories; the process continued
until all codes were sorted into categories. Themes were identified from the
categories by assessing the most common responses to questions, such as the
COVID-19 pandemic influencing the organization&#x02019;s culture. The themes and
codes were repeatedly checked against the transcriptions to ensure an accurate
representation of interviewees&#x02019; responses. For example, if several
interviewees repeatedly mentioned &#x0201c;lack of leadership support&#x0201d; in
their responses, then &#x0201c;lack of leadership support&#x0201d; was created as
a code and then categorized into the theme, &#x0201c;Interviewees perceived a
lack of leadership support.&#x0201d; To validate the interviews, the interviewer
conducted member-checking in which she asked clarifying questions to verify that
her interpretation of each interviewee&#x02019;s response was correct.
Additionally, a pilot interview was conducted to validate the questions.
Confirmability was achieved through peer debriefing in which the interview
questions and interview settings were assessed by co-authors and four members of
the research team prior to interviewing the participants (<xref rid="ref051" ref-type="bibr">McMahon and Winch, 2018</xref>). The co-authors and research
team thoroughly reviewed the transcripts to verify that the assigned categories
accurately reflected the quotes identified by the first author during the coding
and interpretation process. Following the interviews, the team recorded memos
and documented their reflections to capture insights and contextual
understanding. Reliability was ensured by reviewing and correcting the
transcriptions, defining the codes, continually comparing data with the codes,
and writing memos about the codes and their definitions. The coding tree is
shown in <xref rid="F_JHOM-05-2024-0197001" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Findings</title><sec id="sec002.1"><title>Quantitative phase</title><p>During the quantitative phase of our study, a robust response was garnered, with
a total of 67 healthcare personnel actively participating in the survey. This
ensured a comprehensive dataset characterized by completeness, as each question
necessitated a response, thereby eliminating any instances of missing values
from the results.</p><p>To ensure the integrity and relevance of the data, responses from individuals not
affiliated with non-patient-facing health systems were meticulously filtered
out. This exclusion encompassed various roles, including consultants,
non-managerial registered nurses employed in clinical departments and board
members, thus refining the dataset to focus solely on pertinent
participants.</p><p>The demographic makeup of the respondents, as delineated in <xref rid="tbl2 tbl3" ref-type="table">Tables 2 and 3</xref>, offers valuable
insights into the composition of our sample. Notably, the predominant
occupational category among participants was administration, with a substantial
count of 20 individuals. Within this administrative cohort, the roles of
administrators and assistant administrators were prevalent, comprising both
middle- and senior-level management personnel, with a combined count of 18
individuals.</p><p>An examination of <xref rid="tbl4 tbl5 tbl6 tbl7" ref-type="table">Tables
4&#x02013;7</xref> sheds light on additional demographic characteristics of
the participants. It emerges that a considerable proportion of respondents were
affiliated with non-profit health systems boasting substantial capacities,
specifically those with 500 beds or more. Additionally, the majority of
participants were situated in urban locales, underscoring the urban-centric
nature of our sample.</p><p>This meticulous curation and analysis of participant demographics provide a
nuanced understanding of the sample composition, enriching the subsequent
interpretation and generalizability of our study findings. The mean scores of
the survey responses that assess the drivers of OC are shown in <xref rid="tbl8" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;8</xref>. Most respondents believed
that their supervisors strongly supported staff. For example, respondents
reported that their supervisors listened to job-related difficulties
(mean&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;4.07). Additionally, respondents reported that
their supervisors inspire them to perform their best
(mean&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;3.69). A correlation analysis revealed that
supervisors&#x02019; inspiring respondents to perform their best, providing
honest feedback to their employees and listening to job-related difficulties
were positively associated with respondents believing that the overall culture
of their organization was positive
(<italic>r</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.57,
<italic>r</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.59, and
<italic>r</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.42 respectively) and respondents
stating that employees were involved in decisions that affected their work
(<italic>r</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.59,
<italic>r</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.32, and
<italic>r</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.52 respectively).</p><p>Many respondents also believed that their cultures showed strong patient
orientation, in alignment with the customer orientation dimension of the OCAQ,
and as demonstrated by the mean score of respondents believing that their OC is
conducive to providing high-quality patient care is 4.12. Furthermore, most
respondents self-reported that they and their co-workers use appropriate
language with patients, family and visitors (mean&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;4.48
for co-workers using appropriate language and 4.74 for self-reports of using
appropriate language with visitors). Respondents believed that patients were
likely to receive high-quality care in their health system
(mean&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;4.13). The correlation analysis revealed that
having all the supplies and equipment needed to perform one&#x02019;s job was
positively associated with respondents&#x02019; believing that patients received
high-quality care in their health system
(<italic>r</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.60).</p><p>Most respondents believed that they and other employees were somewhat involved in
decisions that directly affected their work (mean&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;3.75).
The correlation analysis revealed that the aforementioned score was positively
associated with respondents believing that their employer is great to work for,
the overall culture of the organization is positive, and that employees work as
a team to improve processes or systems
(<italic>r</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.37,
<italic>r</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.35 and
<italic>r</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.48 respectively).</p><p>Standard deviations for each response ranged about 1 point for each response, as
shown in <xref rid="tbl8" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;8</xref>. The
significant spread between responses could be due to the variety of respondents
from different health systems and positions.</p></sec><sec id="sec002.2"><title>Interviews</title><p>A total of 23 non-patient-facing health system employees participated in the
interviews that were conducted to further assess the drivers of OC. <xref rid="tbl9" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;9</xref> provides an overview of
the interviewees&#x02019; job positions. Based on the responses, four themes were
found.</p></sec><sec id="sec002.3"><title>Theme 1: communication and transparency</title><p>One theme was communication, which was necessary to inform employees, especially
during the COVID-19 pandemic and other times of change. One human resources vice
president stated:<disp-quote><p>We do a really decent job at communicating to
folks, especially as it relates to change. If I use COVID as an example,
there was a heck of a lot of communication. I think the unfortunate
piece with COVID is that it wasn't static and so you could have
put something out on Monday that said, Hey, look, you're good. No
mask is required. And then as things evolved it was like, holy cow, not
only do you need a mask, but it needs to be an N-95, and it needs to be
worn all the time. And so being able to communicate and pivot quickly
was really, really important.</p></disp-quote></p><p>During the pandemic, conflicting information came from different sources, such as
the news and the internet. Interviewees who were leaders stated that they
communicated frequently and, perhaps, overcommunicated to provide clarity to
both employees and patients. A senior director of marketing stated that the
health system CEO created several weekly videos that were published on social
media platforms to inform patients and address their anxieties and concerns. The
CEO also communicated frequently to employees.</p><p>However, non-executive (i.e. director-level and below) interviewees believed that
communication could be lacking or ambiguous, causing perceptions of a lack of
transparency and honesty. Because of the lack of communication, several
interviewees stated that they felt caught off-guard by decisions from executive
leadership. For example, one director of women&#x02019;s and children&#x02019;s
services felt caught off-guard when she was informed of a hiring freeze one day
before it was implemented. A data analytics manager shared the following when
direct reports could be laid off due to the pandemic&#x02019;s economic
effects:<disp-quote><p>I saw that [economic recovery plan] meeting on my
calendar [&#x02026;] 5:00 o'clock on Thursday and [my direct
reports] were laid off on a Friday. [&#x02026;] The day before, I got a
meeting on my calendar for the next day. [&#x02026;] It was 6:30 at
night. And I was talking to [my supervisors] [and] the vice-president,
and asking them what this meeting was all about the next day and why I
didn't know more detail and arguing with the fact that one of my
people was gonna be laid off and they were not telling me who it was
gonna be. [&#x02026;] And [the vice-president] still didn't want
to tell me even until Friday. And I was like, are you kidding me? I
can't believe you're not gonna tell me. Like, who? This
affects my life, my everyday work. And you're not gonna tell me
who and what the reasoning is, and what all happened behind this
decision or whatever. [&#x02026;] I felt like I was definitely blindsided
by that.</p></disp-quote></p><p>Both the manager and other employees conveyed concerns regarding insufficient
communication and transparency from executive leadership. Despite executive
leaders&#x02019; perception of effective communication and a transparent culture
within the organization, non-executive staff held differing views. They felt
that while they understood the need for some information to be withheld, they
desired greater transparency from their executive leaders. Non-executive
employees perceived that executive leaders tended to conceal matters within
their health systems, particularly within the OC.</p></sec><sec id="sec002.4"><title>Theme 2: coordinated teamwork</title><p>A second theme was coordinated teamwork among departments to adapt to changes,
alleviate workloads and accomplish organizational goals. Several interviewees
stated that they felt comfortable asking other departments for help and that
employees in other departments often asked them for help. Additionally, some
health systems used their employees creatively during staffing crises. For
example, when a hospital in one health system lacked pharmacists, they asked
pharmacists from other hospitals to assist. In contrast, one director of the
women&#x02019;s and children&#x02019;s service line stated that, when there was a
lack of staffing in the health system practices, the practices did not receive
assistance from other departments. The lack of staff throughout that health
system caused a lack of willingness to work as a team across departments, while
teamwork within the department remained strong.</p><p>According to various interviewees, opinions diverged on the extent of frontline
and non-managerial staff involvement in decision-making processes. While some
interviewees acknowledged existing involvement, others perceived potential for
increased engagement to foster a culture of teamwork. A director of operations
emphasized the benefits of employee involvement in decision-making, citing
improved employee support for challenging organizational changes. Interviewees
highlighted the importance of feeling valued through participation in decisions,
with the establishment of committees serving as a mechanism for soliciting
employee input. Moreover, several non-managerial interviewees expressed a keen
interest in actively participating in decision-making processes.</p></sec><sec id="sec002.5"><title>Theme 3: leadership supports employees</title><p>A third theme was leadership support. Interviewees described their leadership
supporting employees in several ways, such as by providing childcare during the
COVID-19 pandemic and encouraging staff to use their vacation time. Other
interviewees stated that leaders advocate for their employees. A
non-patient-facing assistant witnessed a situation in which an employee on
medical leave was going to be discharged from the organization. The chief
nursing officer persuaded other executive leaders to not discharge the employee.
Advocacy for employees was reiterated by a quality coordinator in another health
system:<disp-quote><p>I have spoken to her about just how I feel with
things culturally &#x02026; And one thing that I do notice, I feel she
has really been trying to, you know, at least get my name out there and
[&#x02026;] give me my credit where credit is due, which I can
appreciate.</p></disp-quote></p><p>However, the same interviewee expressed the lack of support from other levels of
leadership:<disp-quote><p>It just can't be one person that
[advocates for employees]. It&#x02019;s not just me &#x02026; There are so
many other people within the organization that are like me that are not
getting credit for the work that they're doing, that
aren't being recognized, that deserve to be directors and
executive directors and board members that are not because
they're being kept in a box.</p></disp-quote></p><p>Some interviewees expressed feelings of being overlooked in terms of their work
contributions and opportunities for advancement. While several health systems
boasted formal recognition programs, certain interviewees felt their efforts
were not duly acknowledged by leadership. For instance, a director within the
women&#x02019;s and children&#x02019;s service line found themselves burdened with
additional responsibilities without receiving a formal promotion or salary
increase, prompting them to explore alternative job prospects.</p><p>Nevertheless, the prevailing sentiment among both managerial and non-managerial
interviewees was one of perceived support from their leaders. Many leaders were
observed to prioritize work-life balance and actively address employees'
anxieties and apprehensions. For instance, a vice president overseeing ancillary
services noticed that employees were accumulating unused vacation hours and
encouraged them to take time off, emphasizing the importance of self-care.
Furthermore, leaders initiated formal programs aimed at supporting employee
well-being, such as providing lunch, designated relaxation areas and
implementing shortened workweeks. Additionally, several interviewees noted the
accessibility of their leaders, highlighting their readiness to provide
assistance whenever needed.</p></sec><sec id="sec002.6"><title>Theme 4: the COVID-19 pandemic changed and/or drives the culture</title><p>In some instances, the COVID-19 pandemic changed the culture. Several
interviewees stated that the pandemic changed how their health systems function.
In one health system, the pandemic created a culture of isolation and a lack of
teamwork for several units, such as the intensive care unit (ICU). Interviewees
noticed that employees who worked in the ICU felt isolated from other
departments; other employees did not visit that unit due to fear of COVID-19
exposure.</p><p>In some health systems, the pandemic improved support and teamwork. A director of
operations stated that, at the beginning of the pandemic, employees
&#x0201c;rallied&#x0201d; to support patient-facing clinicians. Moreover, when one
employee was infected with COVID-19, another employee used vacation time to care
for the sick employee&#x02019;s children. When directors were infected,
executives would lead those directors&#x02019; departments until the directors
returned.</p><p>While the pandemic improved organizational strengths, it also exposed negative
OCs. A director of ambulatory care expressed that the pandemic showed how the
health system&#x02019;s inflexibility would no longer suffice in everyday
operations. Furthermore, the pandemic exacerbated staffing and workload issues
at several health systems. One data analytics manager stated that in departments
that were understaffed prior to the pandemic, including the manager&#x02019;s own
department, the manager and other employees became more overwhelmed as their
workloads increased. Fewer people did the same jobs or had tasks added without
increased compensation or promotions. Two other employees at the same health
system expressed similar sentiments; workload increased due to resignations and
workforce reductions. A non-patient-facing assistant at another health system
stated that the pandemic exacerbated the existing toxic culture, such as
leadership not following through on their commitments or listening to their
staff.</p><p>In some cases, the pandemic improved the culture. A non-patient-facing assistant
stated that, when employees began to work remotely, the environment lost its
&#x0201c;anxiety-building, oppressive, rigorous&#x0201d; energy. The office became
quiet and peaceful. Furthermore, a director of nursing stated that when
pandemic-related issues prevented nurses from providing patient care, leaders
addressed those issues immediately due to focus on the pandemic. In that aspect,
the pandemic increased leadership support. Several interviewees stated that
leaders made decisions more quickly because information regarding the COVID-19
pandemic changed quickly, whereas prior to the pandemic, the same decisions
would have taken months to make and implement. Interviewees also expressed that
meeting virtually instead of in person increased organizations&#x02019; agility,
especially regarding decision-making.</p></sec><sec id="sec002.7"><title>Integrations between survey and interview responses</title><p>The survey results and interview responses are integrated in several ways. For
example, most survey respondents believed their OC to be positive. However,
several interviewees expressed dissatisfaction with their organization&#x02019;s
OC, such as one interviewee stating that the workplace was
&#x0201c;toxic.&#x0201d; Furthermore, several interviewees expressed
dissatisfaction with communication; decisions caught several by surprise, or
they did not receive communication about decisions such as position
eliminations.</p><p>The survey results showed that most respondents felt comfortable reporting
potential safety issues. The interviews revealed a nuance in which individual
contributors (i.e. non-managers) expressed distrust of leadership, which
resulted in their not speaking to their organization&#x02019;s leaders about
non-patient- and employee-safety-related issues. For example, several expressed
beliefs of co-workers and leaders harboring unconscious bias that caused a lack
of promotional opportunities. In contrast to the individual contributors&#x02019;
responses, most survey respondents and interviewees who were manager-level and
above believed that their leaders and supervisors were supportive and listened
to job-related issues. Interviewees who were individual contributors expressed
that, if they did speak about job-related issues to their supervisors, their
concerns were not addressed. The interviews showed that managers often felt as
though they could not control the issues of which their direct reports spoke due
to organizational limitations, such as budget constraints. The contrast between
individual contributors&#x02019; and leaders&#x02019; responses revealed a lack of
understanding of what individual contributors believed leaders could change and
influence. Oftentimes, leaders wanted to address their employees&#x02019;
concerns, such as one manager who attempted to secure a monetary raise and
promotion for one direct report. However, organizational constraints prevented
leaders from doing so. The constraints sometimes resulted in turnover, such as
one leader who stated that two individual contributors resigned from a health
system due to a lack of promotion because they did not have a university
degree.</p><p>The survey respondents indicated that they had sufficient technology, supplies
and equipment to perform their jobs. The interviews revealed that employees
believed that they were understaffed due to a high workload or position
eliminations resulting in additional tasks being given. While the interviewees
believed that they had adequate technology, equipment and supplies, they did not
believe that they had a sufficient amount of staff.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Discussion</title><p>The qualitative findings elucidate the pivotal role of communication and transparency
in shaping employees' perceptions of OC within health systems. Virtually all
interviewees underscored the paramount importance of effective communication and
transparency, highlighting their multifaceted benefits in fostering a positive work
environment. Notably, frequent communication channels were instrumental in assuaging
employee anxiety, mitigating feelings of uncertainty and curbing the proliferation
of rumors within the workplace. While the survey did not directly inquire about
communication practices, the recurring emphasis on communication in interviews,
coupled with insights from the OCAQ, suggests a significant association between
communication effectiveness and OC.</p><p>Previous research has delineated contrasting OCs characterized by communication
patterns, ranging from cultures of silence to cultures of voice (<xref rid="ref011" ref-type="bibr">Bogosian, 2018</xref>; <xref rid="ref063" ref-type="bibr">Sashkin and Rosenbach, 1996</xref>; <xref rid="ref030" ref-type="bibr">Hower <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2020</xref>). The absence of
clear communication channels, particularly during periods of financial instability
or organizational crises, engendered feelings of apprehension and uncertainty among
interviewees. Instances, where strategic plans were withheld or inadequately
communicated, exacerbated concerns among employees, especially amidst workforce
reductions or furloughs during the pandemic. Such lapses in communication
precipitated a toxic work environment typified by fear and anxiety, underscoring the
deleterious impact of inadequate communication practices on OC (<xref rid="ref078" ref-type="bibr">Wakefield <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>,
2016</xref>; <xref rid="ref048" ref-type="bibr">Machen
<italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2019</xref>; <xref rid="ref041" ref-type="bibr">Kreitzer <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>., 2020</xref>). A culture of
transparency reduces anxiety and, therefore, promotes a more peaceful work
environment (<xref rid="ref072" ref-type="bibr">Sun <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>,
2023</xref>).</p><p>Conversely, the qualitative analysis unveiled the pivotal role of teamwork in shaping
positive perceptions of OC among employees. Survey results corroborated this,
demonstrating a statistically significant positive correlation between teamwork and
perceptions of a positive OC across departments. Many interviewees attested to the
emphasis placed on teamwork within their health systems, with interdepartmental
collaboration being a prevalent practice. Such collaborative endeavors fostered a
culture conducive to feedback and safety, wherein every employee&#x02019;s
contribution was valued (<xref rid="ref024" ref-type="bibr">Ferguson
<italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2022</xref>). However, staffing constraints
posed significant challenges to teamwork, with understaffed departments struggling
to extend support to one another amidst heightened workloads. This underscores the
intricate interplay between staffing levels and teamwork dynamics within healthcare
organizations, necessitating further exploration in future research endeavors. The
American Association of Critical-Care Nurses found that a healthy OC includes
adequate staffing and teamwork among nurses (<xref rid="ref060" ref-type="bibr">Pun
<italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2022</xref>). Pun
<italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>.&#x02019;s study also found that teamwork
positively influences OC among nurses. The results of this study show that the same
results are true for non-patient-facing employees.</p><p>Being understaffed may have contributed to negative perceptions of OC among
interviewees. A non-patient-facing assistant expressed that the health system was
chronically understaffed; the lack of staff resulted in low employee morale. A
stressful OC was cultivated in which there was a continual sense of urgency. One
study found that understaffing contributed to a negative safety culture among nurses
but did not study the effects of understaffing among non-patient-facing personnel
(<xref rid="ref031" ref-type="bibr">Imes <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>,
2023</xref>). This study shows that understaffing affects non-patient-facing
personnel. Therefore, leaders should be attentive to resolving staffing issues among
non-patient-facing and patient-facing personnel. However, the non-patient-facing
assistant stated that employees tried to help one another, despite the lack of
staff, showing a high degree of teamwork. Further research is needed to determine
the relationship between staffing and teamwork.</p><p>Moreover, the survey findings elucidated the salience of supervisor support in
shaping employees&#x02019; perceptions of OC. Positive correlations were observed
between perceptions of a positive OC and various dimensions of supervisor support,
echoing findings from prior studies highlighting the pivotal role of organizational
support in fostering a psychologically safe work environment (<xref rid="ref032" ref-type="bibr">Iqbal <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2021</xref>; <xref rid="ref070" ref-type="bibr">Sj&#x000f6;blom <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>.,
2022</xref>). The qualitative insights underscored the significance of
supervisor advocacy in cultivating a culture of recognition and value among
employees. However, instances where advocacy failed to translate into tangible
outcomes, such as promotions or recognition, underscored the potential pitfalls of
unmet expectations and their implications for employee turnover (<xref rid="ref043" ref-type="bibr">Lee <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2018</xref>;
<xref rid="ref016" ref-type="bibr">Choudhuri, 2022</xref>).</p><p>Furthermore, the qualitative analysis shed light on the impact of the COVID-19
pandemic on OC within health systems. External forces, such as the pandemic, exerted
profound influences on OC, with interviewees attesting to both positive and negative
ramifications. While the pandemic laid bare existing issues, such as overwork and
communication deficits, it also catalyzed positive cultural shifts, such as enhanced
collaboration, organizational support and empathy among employees (<xref rid="ref007" ref-type="bibr">Al-Shamali <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>,
2022</xref>; <xref rid="ref067" ref-type="bibr">Shamsudin and Velmurugan,
2022</xref>). Leaders&#x02019; proactive measures, including improved
communication strategies, remote work allowances and initiatives to alleviate
employee burdens, emerged as critical factors in mitigating adverse effects and
fostering a resilient OC amidst crisis situations (<xref rid="ref082" ref-type="bibr">Zhang <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2022</xref>; <xref rid="ref083" ref-type="bibr">Zhou and Zhang, 2022</xref>).</p><p>Survey results reflected employee attitudes that affect OC, such as whether employees
showed concern for co-workers&#x02019; well-being and friendliness toward peers. Most
respondents believed that their co-workers showed concern. Further aspects of
perceived organizational support, such as supervisors listening to their employees,
were reflected in high survey scores in the support-related questions. The
literature also shows that supervisors listening to employees and showing concern
for employees&#x02019; well-being shape OC (<xref rid="ref014" ref-type="bibr">Buick
<italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2024</xref>; <xref rid="ref079" ref-type="bibr">Wang <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2024</xref>). However, little
literature studies how co-workers&#x02019; attitudes toward peers shape and reflect
OC. The survey results contrast to the literature in studying how co-worker
attitudes toward one another shape OC.</p><p>In addition, the survey results reflect moral behavior and OC; for example, most
respondents believed that they and their co-workers speak appropriately with
visitors and patients, which is moral. Moreover, most respondents believed that
safety was never sacrificed to complete more work. Caring for the client (i.e.
patients and visitors) demonstrates an organization&#x02019;s morality (<xref rid="ref056" ref-type="bibr">Nijsmans, 1991</xref>). Furthermore, having an
ethical climate in which employee and patient safety are not sacrificed for
performance and achieving goals contributes to perceptions of OC (<xref rid="ref073" ref-type="bibr">Thomas <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>,
2024</xref>). Data-driven decisions instead of decisions driven by politics also
demonstrate morality and organizational justice in which organizations do what is
best for employees and patients instead of doing what is best to achieve only their
goals (<xref rid="ref047" ref-type="bibr">Lotfi-Bejestani
<italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2023</xref>). The literature shows that
perceptions of organizational fairness affect whether employees view their
organization&#x02019;s culture as just (<xref rid="ref047" ref-type="bibr">Lotfi-Bejestani <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2023</xref>). Studies also find
that supervisors&#x02019; acting justly affects employees&#x02019; perceptions of OC;
while the survey results and interviews show that data-driven decision-making and
treating patients and visitors appropriately are two aspects of justice. One study
demonstrates how supervisors&#x02019; behavior affects perceptions of OC (<xref rid="ref071" ref-type="bibr">Skarlicki <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>,
2016</xref>). Supervisors have substantial influence over OC, which then affects
employee behavior. For example, supervisors including employees in decision-making
and allowing employees to express their opinions contribute to an inclusive OC
(<xref rid="ref008" ref-type="bibr">Ashikali, 2023</xref>). The survey results
reflect that most employees believed that their supervisors did both. In contrast to
this study&#x02019;s results, <xref rid="ref008" ref-type="bibr">Ashikali
(2023)</xref> finds that most employees do not believe that they are included in
decision-making. The interviewees similarly stated that they were often not included
in decision-making.</p><p>In summary, the qualitative findings underscore the multifaceted nature of OC within
health systems, highlighting the critical role of communication, teamwork,
supervisor support and external influences in shaping employees' perceptions
and experiences within the workplace. These insights provide valuable implications
for organizational leaders seeking to cultivate a positive and resilient OC amidst
dynamic and challenging environments.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The findings from both the survey outcomes and interview insights underscore the
critical importance of fostering a congenial, inclusive and supportive OC within
health systems, extending beyond the realms of nursing and medical personnel to
encompass non-patient-facing staff. It is evident that the prevailing OC
significantly influences the job satisfaction and retention rates of
non-patient-facing employees. Consequently, the cultivation of a robust OC emerges
as a pivotal strategy for health systems to mitigate turnover rates and the
associated costs and time investments incurred in replacing employees.</p><p>Moreover, this study sheds light on the convergence of perceptions regarding OC among
different echelons within health system hierarchies. Both frontline contributors and
managerial personnel alike grapple with the challenges posed by prevailing cultural
dynamics, such as pervasive overwork, particularly exacerbated amidst the exigencies
of the pandemic. Conversely, executive-level stakeholders tend to espouse more
sanguine views regarding communication efficacy, whereas non-executive employees
express reservations about the clarity and transparency of communication channels
within their respective health systems.</p><p>Efforts aimed at enhancing OC must prioritize expeditious and transparent
communication practices, ensuring that changes, objectives, and strategies are
conveyed promptly and comprehensively to all employees. Addressing prevailing
concerns regarding OC, including communication gaps and staffing inadequacies, is
paramount to fostering a culture of trust, collaboration and mutual support within
health systems. Such interventions not only bolster organizational resilience but
also contribute to bolstering employee morale and organizational cohesion.</p><sec id="sec004.1"><title>Research limitations</title><p>Despite its valuable contributions to both literature and the healthcare sector,
this study faces several notable limitations that warrant acknowledgment and
consideration. Firstly, the lack of generalizability of qualitative findings
arises from the restriction of interviews with employees within health systems
located specifically in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States. To enhance
the breadth and applicability of future research, it is advisable to conduct
interviews with employees from a more diverse array of health systems across the
entire nation.</p><p>Secondly, the absence of certain demographic information, including details
regarding race/ethnicity and age, was deliberate to encourage survey
participation and safeguard respondent anonymity. However, this limitation
impedes a comprehensive understanding of how perceptions of OC may vary among
individuals of different racial/ethnic backgrounds, age groups and other
demographic categories. Hence, forthcoming studies should incorporate additional
demographic questions to facilitate a more nuanced analysis of OC
perceptions.</p><p>Furthermore, the quantitative phase of the study is constrained by a relatively
small sample size, comprising 61 participants. Despite efforts to engage over
100 influential individuals, such as health system CEOs, COOs and board members,
alongside various trade associations, a significant proportion did not respond
to multiple solicitations. While this limitation was partially mitigated by
conducting 23 supplementary interviews to glean insights into OC drivers and
influencers, there remains an opportunity for future studies to bolster sample
size through incentivization strategies, such as offering participants the
chance to win a gift card upon survey completion.</p><p>While this study represents a valuable step toward understanding OC within
healthcare settings, its limitations underscore the need for ongoing research
endeavors aimed at broadening the scope, inclusivity and robustness of findings.
By addressing these limitations, future studies can make more substantial
contributions to the scholarly discourse and practical applications within the
healthcare industry. Moreover, despite the attempt to minimize bias,
interviewees were contacted via the first authors&#x02019; connections.
Therefore, there may have been bias in the selection of interviewees.</p></sec><sec id="sec004.2"><title>Research implications</title><p>This research contributes to the literature by examining the perceptions of OC
among mainly non-patient-facing health systems employees. Prior research has
focused on mainly nurses and physicians. However, this research shows the
importance and influence of OC on non-patient-facing employees&#x02019; work
performance, turnover rates and behavior.</p><p>Additionally, this research shows the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on
perceptions of OC among non-patient-facing health system employees. Prior
research has focused on the impact of the pandemic on patient-facing employees.
This study shows that the pandemic changed the OC or exposed issues of the OC in
health systems that non-patient-facing employees noticed, such as an increased
workload and lack of work/life balance. The results show that the pandemic did
not affect only patient-facing employees of health systems but also
non-patient-facing employees.</p><p>The survey results validate the use of the OCAQ tool for interviewing employees
about OC. The interview responses enrich the literature and research about OC
regarding non-patient-facing health system employees by providing the reasoning
behind survey responses. Prior research has either surveyed health system
employees or interviewed the employees but has not conducted both phases by
contacting the same group of employees who were contacted to distribute the
survey to their networks. The multifaceted implementation of this research is
new among non-patient-facing health system employees. Future studies could use a
similar technique for researching perceptions of non-patient-facing health
system employees regarding other subjects.</p></sec><sec id="sec004.3"><title>Practical implications</title><p>This research is intended for health systems managers and executives to pinpoint
opportunities for improvement that may not be highlighted in existing employee
engagement surveys. Additionally, this research highlights the drivers of OC.
This research has several implications for practice, such as demonstrating that
transparent and open communication can improve employees&#x02019; perceptions of
OC. Therefore, leaders should focus on improving communication within their
health systems. Additionally, employee autonomy and including employees in
decision-making cultivates an OC of teamwork. Leaders should ensure that
employees are autonomous by allowing employees to complete projects
independently and include them in decision-making so that they feel as though
they are a part of the team. Further research should be conducted to assess
whether addressing drivers of culture improves non-patient-facing
employees&#x02019; perceptions of culture through a survey or follow-up
interviews.</p><p>Due to the phased implementation of the study, the reasoning behind the survey
responses was gathered. Leaders can use the depth of the interview responses and
the interviewees&#x02019; practical advice to improve OC in their organizations.
Moreover, leaders can use this phased approach when conducting yearly employee
evaluation surveys; most surveys involve only a quantitative survey. However, by
implementing an interview phase in which a focus group of employees is
interviewed, they can gather insights beyond the survey results and, thus,
return from the survey with practical ways to improve OC.</p></sec><sec id="sec004.4"><title>Final remarks</title><p>OC is primarily shaped by the actions and attitudes of organizational leaders. As
such, it is imperative for leaders to prioritize the development of a supportive
and inclusive OC that fosters a sense of purpose among all employees. This
concerted effort not only enhances employee morale but also elevates the quality
of their work performance.</p><p>A positively perceived OC yields numerous benefits for healthcare organizations.
By nurturing a culture where employees feel valued and included, turnover rates
can be reduced, as individuals are more likely to remain committed to an
organization where they feel appreciated and supported. Furthermore, a conducive
OC contributes to heightened job satisfaction among employees, resulting in
increased motivation and engagement levels.</p><p>Importantly, the ripple effects of a positive OC extend beyond the
organization&#x02019;s internal dynamics to impact patient care outcomes. When
employees feel fulfilled and supported in their roles, they are more inclined to
deliver high-quality care and service to patients. Consequently, enhanced
patient satisfaction levels are often observed in healthcare settings
characterized by a nurturing and supportive OC.</p></sec></sec></body><back><bio id="bio1"><p>Teray Johnson is Corporate Faculty of Analytics at Harrisburg University
