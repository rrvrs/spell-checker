The use of serum in cell culture raises safety concerns in biological production. The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency have implemented stricter regulations on the use of animal-derived components in commercial protein manufacturing to ensure patient safety.</p></sec><sec><title>Objective</title><p>This study aims to develop new chemically defined media using peptone hydrolysate as a serum-free alternative.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A rational experimental design was employed to screen and optimize potential serum substitutes. Six types of peptones were tested at varying concentrations to determine the top three candidates. These candidates were subsequently combined into five mixtures to identify the two most effective serum-free media for Vero CCL-81&#x000a0;cells. The evaluation criteria included morphology observation and proliferation assay. The two most promising serum-free formulations were further evaluated for their ability to support virus production and using TCID<sub>50</sub> and absolute quantification by RT-qPCR.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The results of this study indicate that Mixture 4, consisting of 0.5&#x000a0;g/L Phytone&#x02122; Peptone, 0.5&#x000a0;g/L Difco&#x02122; Soytone, and 2&#x000a0;g/L Bacto&#x02122; Malt, significantly enhanced Vero CCL-81&#x000a0;cell proliferation and produced high viral titers. The developed medium demonstrated comparable performance to commercially available serum-free media.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Peptone-based serum-free media provide a robust alternative for supporting Vero CCL-81&#x000a0;cell growth and are suitable for virus production.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group id="kwrds0010"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Serum-free media</kwd><kwd>Protein hydrolysate</kwd><kwd>Vaccine</kwd><kwd>Manufacture process</kwd><kwd>COVID-19</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0010">Vero cells, a continuous cell line derived from the kidney of African green monkeys, are commonly used to produce viral vaccines [<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Although the addition of serum can promote Vero cell growth, its use has several significant drawbacks. One major concern is the potential risk of contamination by agents such as mycoplasma, viruses, and prions, which are associated with bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) [<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Moreover, the use of fetal bovine serum (FBS) in basic culture media raises ethical issues as it is sourced from the blood of bovine fetuses following the slaughter of pregnant cows. Other issues associated with FBS include batch-to-batch variability, inconsistent results, limited availability, complications in downstream processing due to its high protein concentration, and its high cost [<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p id="p0015">Due to the obstacles associated with serum use in cell cultures, developing chemically defined media (CDM), including serum-free media supplemented with peptone hydrolysate, offers a promising alternative [<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, no single CDM is universally suitable for all cell lines. Therefore, specific CDM formulations must be tailored to individual cell lines to optimize cell growth and productivity [<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Chemically defined media are culture media containing precisely known and controlled components, such as inorganic and organic substances as well as protein additives such as epidermal growth factor (EGF), insulin, vitamins, amino acids, fatty acids, cholesterol, or peptone hydrolysates [<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p id="p0020">Peptone hydrolysates are protein products hydrolyzed through acid, alkali, enzymatic, or fermentation processes. They consist of undefined mixtures of low-molecular-weight substances such as amino acids, peptides, vitamins, and trace elements that are commonly used as supplements in serum-free media (SFM) to supply nutrients for cell cultures. SFM supplemented with hydrolysates is a cost-effective and practical alternative. The addition of hydrolysates has been demonstrated to promote cell growth and stimulate protein production, enhancing viral titers and protein quality in mammalian cells [<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Although commercially available SFM, such as VP-SFM, are ready to use, they present challenges including high costs and limited availability. Therefore, developing a chemically defined medium containing serum-free media with peptone supplementation is a promising solution. By employing a rational experimental design, this study aims to develop a serum-free media formulation supplemented with peptone hydrolysates to enhance the proliferation of Vero CCL-81&#x000a0;cells specifically optimized for SARS-CoV-2 virus production.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec2.1"><label>2.1</label><title>Cell line</title><p id="p0025">The cell lines used in this study were Vero E6 (ATCC&#x000ae; CRL-1586&#x02122;) Passage 43 and Vero CCL-81 (ATCC&#x000ae; CCL-81&#x02122;) Passage 28 (ATCC, VA, USA) obtained from the cell bank repository of the Research Center for Vaccine Technology and Development, Institute of Tropical Disease (RCVTD-ITD), Universitas Airlangga.

However, the groups cultured in SFM without any supplementation failed to maintain normal cell morphology, with the cells appearing rounder and smaller. Morphological changes can occur due to the lack of nutrients in the SFM group, such as glutamine and galactose, which may promote apoptosis [<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Round-shaped apoptosis is a form of programmed cell death. During the early stages of apoptosis, microtubules and intermediate filaments are disorganized and the actin cytoskeleton aids in cell reorganization [<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Supplementation with FBS provides essential nutrients for cell survival, such as plasma proteins, peptides, fats, growth factors, hormones, and inorganic substances that may influence their biological behavior and stress response [<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In apical papilla cells, the absence of FBS has been shown to reduce proliferation and alter biological characteristics [<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Due to batch-to-batch variability, adverse effects in clinical use, and ethical concerns, the use of FBS in manufacturing processes has become increasingly discouraged [<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Numerous alternatives have been developed to replace the use of serum. One potential approach is the hydrolysate peptone supplementation [<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Hydrolysate peptones contain amino acids, vitamins, trace elements, and specific peptides that may resemble growth factors or survival factors [<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], along with glutamine, which might protect cells from apoptosis [<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In this study, plant-based peptone was chosen as an alternative supplement due to the animal-free composition, which alleviate challenges related to bio-product release licensure requirements by the regulator. In the past, concerns about batch-to-batch variation limited the use of peptones. Currently, the standardization and manufacturing processes for protein hydrolysates are well-established. A previous study showed that Vero cell proliferation rates were not affected by peptone supplementation from different production batches, suggesting that the inter-batch variation can be overcome by using commercially standardized peptones [<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p id="p0105">The MTT assay measures the metabolic activity of live cell mitochondria to convert the yellow color of tetrazolium salt (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) into a purple formazan crystal product [<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Since only live cells with intact mitochondria and cell membranes can catalyze this reaction, MTT has been frequently used to assess cell proliferation [<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. This method is based on the mitochondrial metabolic rate, which can indirectly reflect the number of viable cells [<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p id="p0110">According to the titration study, varying concentrations of each peptone were used to determine the proliferation rate of Vero CCL-81&#x000a0;cells. The results of this study indicate that the varying concentrations did not affect cell growth. A similar pattern in the cell proliferation assay was observed, where the proliferation rate increased daily until day 2, followed by a decrease on day 3. This phenomenon may be attributed to the cells fulfilling the surface of the entire container, inhibiting cell proliferation due to the lack of attachment sites on the well's bottom surface. According to Nelson, increased cell-to-cell contact in adherent cells prevents growth factor and integrin-mediated stimuli for cell division and proliferation. This density-dependent inhibition occurs at a saturation density specific to the cell culture [<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p id="p0115">The MTT results of this study identified the best three peptones as Phytone&#x02122; Peptone, Difco&#x02122; Soytone, and Bacto&#x02122; Malt. These peptones were subsequently used in the mixture study to determine the best two media formulations. The results of the mixture study showed that the highest cell proliferation was observed in Mixture 1 and Mixture 4. Cell proliferation is influenced by the nutrients present in the culture media, which provide all necessary nutrients for cell growth, proliferation, and metabolism [<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The required nutrients for cell culture generally include peptides, glucose, inorganic salts, and carbohydrates. These nutrients are present in peptone hydrolysates, making them suitable for supplementation in serum-free media. A previous study by Spearman et al. (2016) [<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] indicated that peptides containing arginine and lysine play important roles in the growth and proliferation of CHO cells. Peptides can function as signaling molecules and regulate various cellular processes, including proliferation, differentiation, and cell apoptosis. In addition, peptides can serve as growth factors and anti-apoptotic agents [<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Protein hydrolysates not only offer a supply of useable amino acids, but also contain peptides that can have specific effects, such as mimicking growth factors or survival factors [<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p id="p0120">The comparable virus yield in this study may be associated with the proliferation rate of the cells. Peptone-based serum-free media yielded comparable results in terms of the proliferation rate of Vero CCL-81&#x000a0;cells. Cell proliferation and metabolism play a crucial role in virus production as living cells actively engage in growth, division, and proliferation. When a virus infects and hijack the cell, it takes over the cell's replication mechanisms and utilizes them to produce viral RNA proteins. Viruses also exploit the metabolic resources of the cell. This aligns with the study conducted by Girdhar et al. (2021) [<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], which stated that viral regulation of host metabolism is a critical component of virus replication. The interaction between cell proliferation mechanisms and metabolism, influenced by viral infection, can contribute to virus production outcomes, leading to increased viral titers. This is consistent with the research by Ho et al. (2021) [<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], which indicated that peptone hydrolysates can enhance CHO cell proliferation and act as a protein production stimulant to increase viral titers and product quality. In this study, the two most promising peptone-supplemented serum-free media formulations yielded different levels of virus production. Although there is no clear explanation from previous studies, it can be hypothesized that the certain stress condition such as high-density condition of Vero cells can secrete antiviral properties (interferon gamma). This is supported by a previous transcriptomic study on Vero cells, which revealed that under stress conditions, there is an upregulation of the interferon gamma response and a downregulation of MYC targets (variants 1 and 2), E2F target pathways, and most importantly, the epithelial-mesenchymal transition pathway [<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec6"><label>6</label><title>Conclusion</title><p id="p0125">The use of serum-free media based on peptone hydrolysates from Mixture 4, consisting of a combination of 0.5&#x000a0;g/L Phytone&#x02122; Peptone; 0.5&#x000a0;g/L Difco&#x02122; Soytone; and 2&#x000a0;g/L Bacto&#x02122; Malt, has been shown to enhance Vero CCL-81&#x000a0;cell proliferation while maintaining normal morphology. This formula can serve as an alternative medium for the SARS-COV-2 propagation, yielding viral titers comparable to those obtained using commercially available serum-free media. These findings provide baseline data for the development of cell culture-based vaccine production for SARS-COV-2. Nevertheless, this study has limitations, as all experiments were conducted in a 2D culture system. Further research needs to be conducted in a larger scale using a 3D culture system to validate these results on SARS-COV-2 titers to support the translation into large-scale vaccine production.</p></sec><sec id="sec7"><title>CRediT authorship contribution statement</title><p id="p0130"><bold>Suryo Kuncorojakti:</bold> Writing &#x02013; review &#x00026; editing, Visualization, Validation, Supervision, Methodology, Funding acquisition, Formal analysis, Data curation, Conceptualization. <bold>Diena Delaiah:</bold> Writing &#x02013; original draft, Visualization, Methodology, Investigation, Formal analysis, Data curation. <bold>Ahmad Aswin:</bold> Writing &#x02013; review &#x00026; editing, Visualization, Methodology, Investigation. <bold>Yulianna Puspitasari:</bold> Writing &#x02013; review &#x00026; editing, Validation, Supervision, Project administration, Methodology. <bold>Yeni Damayanti:</bold> Writing &#x02013; review &#x00026; editing, Validation, Supervision, Project administration. <bold>Helen Susilowati:</bold> Writing &#x02013; review &#x00026; editing, Validation, Project administration, Investigation. <bold>Diyantoro:</bold> Writing &#x02013; review &#x00026; editing, Project administration, Methodology, Investigation, Writing &#x02013; review &#x00026; editing, Project administration, Methodology, Investigation. <bold>Iwan Sahrial Hamid:</bold> Writing &#x02013; review &#x00026; editing, Validation, Supervision. <bold>Mohammad Anam Al Arif:</bold> Writing &#x02013; review &#x00026; editing, Validation, Supervision, Formal analysis. <bold>Suwarno:</bold> Writing &#x02013; review &#x00026; editing, Validation, Supervision, Writing &#x02013; review &#x00026; editing, Validation, Supervision. <bold>Watchareewan Rodprasert:</bold> Writing &#x02013; review &#x00026; editing, Visualization, Supervision, Methodology, Conceptualization.</p></sec><sec id="sec8"><title>Funding Statement</title><p id="p0168">This study was supported by <funding-source id="gs1">Airlangga Research Fund (Penelitian Dasar Unggulan/PDU)</funding-source> Grant Number <award-id award-type="grant" rid="gs1">1512/UN3.FKH/PT.01.03/2024</award-id>.</p></sec><sec id="sec9"><title>Ethical approval</title><p id="p0135">Not required.</p></sec><sec id="sec10"><title>Ethics statement</title><p id="p0140">Not required.</p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="sec11"><title>Data availability</title><p id="p0145">The datasets used and/or analyzed in this study are available upon request to the corresponding author.</p></sec><sec sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Declaration of competing interest</title><p id="p0150">The authors declare the following financial interests/personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing interests:Suryo Kuncorojakti reports financial support was provided by <funding-source id="gs3">Faculty of Veterinary Medicine</funding-source> Universitas Airlangga.
