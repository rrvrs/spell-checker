However, the understanding of NP and the current treatment approaches available for its management are limited. Therefore, there is a significant need to address the dearth of effective therapeutic interventions. This study aims to investigate the regulation of transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) and cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) expression levels by miR-142-5p as a common upstream molecule, and to delve into the mature process of miR-142-5p from the perspective of <italic>N</italic><sup>6</sup>-methyladenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A) modification.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">To assess the RNA levels of TRPV1, CDK5, miR-142-5p, pre-miR-142, and pri-miR-142, quantitative PCR with reverse transcription (RT&#x02013;qPCR) was utilized. Western blot analysis was employed to determine changes in protein expression for TRPV1 and CDK5. For assessing the interaction mechanism and binding site between TRPV1 and CDK5, various techniques were applied, including mass spectrometry, coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP), and glutathione-<italic>S</italic>-transferase (GST)-pulldown assays. The subcellular localization of TRPV1 on the cell membrane was visualized through immunofluorescence, and the translocation was confirmed by western blot analysis after performing membrane-plasma separation in parallel. Moreover, intracellular calcium transport was monitored using calcium imaging as an indicator of cell excitability. The binding of miRNA-142-5p to the 3&#x02019;UTR of TRPV1 and CDK5 was investigated using the dual-luciferase reporter assay. The overall level of m<sup>6</sup>A was first determined by RNA m<sup>6</sup>A methylation assay, and subsequently the methylation level of pri-miR-142 was assessed using the meRIP assay to detect m<sup>6</sup>A modification. In addition, an in vivo rat chronic constriction injury (CCI) model was established, and miR-142-5p agomir or antagomir was injected intrathecally. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to measure the levels of IL-6 and TNF. Paw withdrawal mechanical threshold (PWMT) and paw withdrawal thermal latency (PWTL) were examined.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">The expression levels of TRPV1 and CDK5 were found to be upregulated not only in the in vivo CCI model but also in the in vitro lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment cell model as well. CDK5 was observed to phosphorylate TRPV1 at T406, prompting the translocation of TRPV1 to the cell membrane and consequent augmentation of cellular excitability. Notably, CDK5 was found to directly bind to TRPV1, and the binding region was localized within the 1&#x02013;390 amino acid sequence of TRPV1. According to database predictions, miR-142-5p, identified as a shared upstream molecule of TRPV1 and CDK5, exhibited downregulation following induction by NP. MiR-142-5p was shown to simultaneously bind to the mRNA of CDK5 and TRPV1, thereby inhibiting their expression. After LPS treatment, it was observed that pri-miR-142 expression increased, while pre-miR-142 and miR-142-5p expression decreased, suggesting inhibition of the maturation process of pri-miR-142. In addition, the overall level of m<sup>6</sup>A and in particular the pri-miR-142 m<sup>6</sup>A modification increased upon LPS treatment. Knockdown of METTL14 led to decreased pri-miR-124 expression, increased pre-miR-124 expression, and enhanced mature miR-142-5p expression, indicating the relief of miR-142-5p maturation repression. The in vivo results indicated that miR-142-5p negatively regulated the expression of CDK5 and TRPV1, suppressed the expression of inflammatory factors IL-6 and TNF, and improved the PWMT and PWTL.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">In this study, we perform a thorough investigation to examine the effects of CDK5 and TRPV1 on NP, elucidating their binding relationship and the impact of CDK5 on the membrane transport of TRPV1. Notably, our findings reveal that miR-142-5p, acting as a crucial upstream molecule, exhibits inhibitory effects on the expression of both CDK5 and TRPV1. Moreover, we observe that METTL14 facilitates the m<sup>6</sup>A modification of pri-miR-142, thereby impeding the maturation transition of pri-miR-142 and ultimately leading to the downregulation of mature miR-142-5p.</p></sec><sec><title>Graphical Abstract</title><p id="Par5">

Following the successful treatment of certain diseases, a subset of patients may experience ongoing and debilitating chronic pain, such as in cases of shingles, stroke, and severe trauma. It is estimated that approximately one in six individuals is affected by chronic pain, and the profound adverse impact of incessant pain on patients&#x02019; lives should not be underestimated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Abnormal pain and hyperalgesia represent prominent symptoms observed in nearly 15&#x02013;50% of patients with NP, and these manifestations are common in various peripheral neuropathies and central pain disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Dorsal root ganglion (DRG) contains the cell bodies of primary sensory neurons, some of which are nociceptive neurons. After experiencing a painful injury, maladaptive molecular changes occur in the cell bodies and axons of these primary sensory neurons within the DRG. Such changes contribute to the development of hypersensitivity and overexcitation of the sensory neurons, a phenomenon known as peripheral sensitization, which plays a pivotal role in the initiation and perpetuation of chronic pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par35">The transient receptor potential (TRP) channels are a crucial group of receptors responsible for pain signaling in DRG neurons. These channels are composed of four subunits and function as nonselective cation channels. Among the 28 TRP channel isoforms found in mammals, almost all of them conduct calcium ions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1), an important member of the TRP channel family, is preferentially expressed in sensory neurons of the peripheral nervous system. It is predominantly found in small and medium nociceptor neurons of DRG, trigeminal ganglion, and sympathetic ganglion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The modulation of pain signaling involves the alteration of protein phosphorylation mediated by protein kinases. Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5), one such kinase, exhibits significant epigenetic regulation during NP. Its upregulation contributes to the pathogenesis of chronic pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. CDK5 and its activator, p35/p25, are abundantly expressed in spinal nerves, DRG, spinal dorsal horn, and trigeminal ganglion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Previous studies have demonstrated that CDK5-mediated phosphorylation of TRPV1 at T407 (in humans and mice) and T406 (in rats) facilitates receptor transport to the plasma membrane and regulates Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. However, the detailed interaction mechanism between these molecules and the development of novel drugs in this context remain poorly investigated. Hence, one purpose of this study is to investigate the binding mechanism and explore common upstream regulatory molecules involved in this process.</p><p id="Par36">A growing emphasis on microRNAs (miRNAs) has taken place in recent years owing to their role as noncoding RNA molecules capable of regulating protein expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. MiRNAs have demonstrated potential in regulating the expression of specific genes relevant to the central nervous system and have implications in the development of chronic pain in the peripheral nervous system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Consequently, interfering with miRNA expression in the primary afferent pathway has shown to be effective in inhibiting the long-term development of injury-induced chronic pain-related behaviors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The biosynthesis of miRNA is affected by many factors, notably <italic>N</italic><sup>6</sup>-methyladenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A) modification plays an important role in regulating this process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. In this study, we focus on three aspects: the binding and direct action of TRPV1 and CDK5, the regulatory mechanism of upstream miRNA on CDK5 and TRPV1, and the effect of m<sup>6</sup>A modification on miRNA biosynthesis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Animal</title><p id="Par37">Our primary objective is to explore a novel mechanism and potential therapeutic target involving the progression of NP. Sample size was considered to empirically estimate variation in results and the required statistical power while minimizing the number of animals. Seven-week-old male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly assigned to each group, with five rats per group for each experiment to ensure the reproducibility of the observed results. The study was not blinded. Animal experiments in this study were conducted in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the US National Institutes of Health. All procedures were reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committee of the Animal Department of China Medical University (KT2023866).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Chronic constriction injury (CCI) surgery and behavioral analysis</title><p id="Par38">The CCI model of rats was established following established protocols [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Under intraperitoneal anesthesia using sodium pentobarbital (50&#x000a0;mg/kg), the rats were positioned in the ventral decubitus position following stabilization of anesthesia. A lateral incision was made slightly lateral to the right iliac crest, perpendicular to the hind limb, allowing for blunt dissection to locate the sciatic nerve. A section of approximately 7&#x000a0;mm in length was isolated along the sciatic nerve and then ligated using a 4&#x02013;0 gut cord with 1&#x000a0;mm spacing in front of the three branches. Attention was paid to ensure adequate knot tightness, as confirmed by the slight twitching of the toe tip and sliding of the knot over the nerve. Following irrigation with normal saline, the local area was sutured intermittently, encompassing the muscle, subcutaneous tissue, and skin. Postoperatively, the rats were housed in a warm and comfortable environment to facilitate recovery. The sham group underwent identical surgical procedures as the model group, with the exception of sciatic nerve ligation.</p><p id="Par39">The paw withdrawal mechanical threshold (PWMT) was assessed following the method described by Bennett [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Static allodynia in rats was evaluated at multiple time points (1, 3, 5, 7, and 14&#x000a0;days) post CCI surgery. To acclimate to the testing environment, all rats underwent an adaptation period of approximately 15&#x000a0;min in a ventilated plastic box with a wire mesh bottom. Static allodynia was then assessed by applying von Frey hairs (Danmic Global, American) to the plantar surface of the hind paw on the affected side, increasing the force until a withdrawal response was observed. Subsequently, the minimum force required to induce the paw withdrawal response was recorded as the PWMT. To evaluate thermal hypersensitivity to heat stimulus in a rat model, the hot plate analgesia meter (Yuyanbio, Shanghai, China) was employed with slight modifications to the previously described methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. To assess thermal hypersensitivity, rats were individually placed on a hot plate set to a temperature of 50.5&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C. The latency period, defined as the time taken for each rat to either lick its hind paw or show a jumping response, was measured and recorded.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Intrathecal injection</title><p id="Par40">In accordance with previously published methodologies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], the hair around the waist of the rats was removed, and the skin was sterilized using iodophor. Lumbar puncture was conducted by gently grasping the iliac crest of the rats and vertically inserting a 10-&#x003bc;l Hamilton microsyringe with a 30-gauge needle into the intervertebral space between L4 and L5. Successful puncture was confirmed by observing a tail shiver or flick. The liquid was injected evenly and slowly over approximately 15&#x000a0;s. As described in the study conducted by Zhang et&#x000a0;al., the miR-142-5p agomir (Huzhou Hippo Biotechnology Co, LTD. Huzhou, China) 1&#x000a0;nmol/day was injected prior to CCI surgery and administered continuously for 5&#x000a0;days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Following 5 days of continuous injection of antagomir (Huzhou Hippo Biotechnology Co, LTD. Huzhou, China) 1&#x000a0;nmol/day, subsequent experiments were conducted.

In summary, LPS treatment resulted in the downregulation of miR-142-5p, and miR-142-5p targeted both CDK5 and TRPV1 by binding to their 3&#x02032;UTRs.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;5</label><caption><p>MiR-142-5p targets both CDK5 and TRPV1 <bold>A</bold> The predicted conserved miRNAs of CDK5 and TRPV1 in Targetscan database. <bold>B</bold> The expression of miR-142-5p in rat DRG tissues was determined by FISH assay.

Previous studies have indicated that m<sup>6</sup>A modification of RNA can influence miRNA maturation process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Therefore, we investigated whether the inhibited miRNA maturation was related to the alterations in m<sup>6</sup>A levels.

Subsequently, the expressions of three common m<sup>6</sup>A methyltransferases were analyzed, and the most prominent difference was shown in the expression level of METTL14 induced by LPS (Supplementary Fig. 3). The knockdown efficiency of METTL14 was verified (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>D), and meRIP results demonstrated a significant downregulation of pri-miR-142 methylation levels after METTL14 knockdown (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>E).

The myriad neurotransmitters and other substances involved in the development and maintenance of NP also play a part in other neurobiological disorders. Pharmacological and genetic studies confirm that TRPV1 plays a role in a variety of pathological pain models. TRPV1 channels are sensitive ion channels activated by a number of noxious stimuli that alter many physiological functions upon activation. Pharmacological and genetic studies confirm that TRPV1 plays a role in a variety of pathological pain models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Extensive investigation of TRPV1 in NP has become predominant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. TRPV1 activity is primarily associated with the detection of noxious heat and the induction of inflammatory hyperalgesia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Emerging studies suggest that protein kinases modulate the phosphorylation levels of pain-signaling proteins, potentially contributing to NP development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Among multiple kinases activated in response to inflammation or nerve injury, CDK5 is noteworthy. Under conditions of neurotoxic stress, inflammation, or neuronal injury, the proteolytic cleavage of CDK5 activators p35 and p39 by calpain, in response to increased calcium influx, generates p25 and p29, respectively. The subsequent formation of CDK5/p25 or CDK5/p29 complexes allows for their cytoplasmic translocation, leading to the phosphorylation of diverse cellular targets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In this study, we investigate the direct binding mechanism and the binding site between TRPV1 and CDK5 for the first time. Furthermore, we discovered that miR-142-5p not only directly regulated the expression of TRPV1 but also indirectly modulated the phosphorylation and membrane transport of TRPV1 by regulating CDK5 expression. In addition, we proposed an innovative role for METTL14 in mediating the biosynthesis of miR-142-5p in an m<sup>6</sup>A dependent manner.</p><p id="Par69">Previous studies have shown that CDK5 reduces the interaction of TRPV1 with AP2&#x003bc;2 by phosphorylating AP2&#x003bc;2, which in turn mediates reduced internalization of TRPV1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. CDK5 also directly phosphorylates TRPV1 and upregulates the cell membrane surface localization of TRPV1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In previous studies of CDK5 phosphorylation of TRPV1, the F11 cell line was used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. The F11 cell line, derived from the fusion of a rat embryonic DRG and a mouse neuroblastoma cell line (NT18TG2), retains the chromosomes of both rat and mouse. To avoid this problem, the cells used in the in vitro experiments were entirely sourced from rats. Furthermore, calcium imaging experiments were implemented to observe the alterations of cellular excitability more directly. We devised the CDK5 plasmid and carried out its transfection, which led to a significant augmentation in the localization of TRPV1 on the cell membrane and a significant reduction in its localization in the cytoplasm. Subsequently, the interaction between CDK5 and TRPV1 was investigated, revealing that CDK5 regulates membrane transport through the phosphorylation of TRPV1 at T406. Upon transfection of the TRPV1 (T406A) plasmid into DRG cells, we isolated the plasma membrane and detected a marked decrease in the membrane localization of TRPV1. Importantly, an in-depth investigation was conducted on the binding domain of CDK5 and TRPV1. By analyzing the TRPV1 protein structure domains and the spatial conformation, two truncated forms were designed, highlighting a preference for CDK5 binding with the 1&#x02013;390 region of the truncated protein. Interestingly, the binding of CDK5 to TRPV1 is independent of the phosphorylation site T406. In the future, new drugs that target the phosphorylation site and the binding sites are expected to become new stars in the treatment of NP.</p><p id="Par70">In numerous research studies, the exploration of miRNA regulation on individual genes is typically carried out. Nevertheless, it is crucial to acknowledge that regulatory relationships within organisms frequently form intricate networks or display diverse patterns. In this breakthrough finding, miR-142-5p was identified as the sole highly conserved miRNA capable of concurrently regulating two downstream targets, namely CDK5 and TRPV1. The inhibitory effects of miR-142-5p on mRNAs were affirmed by luciferase reporter assays. Additionally, the reversal experiments provided evidence that miR-142-5p suppressed the excitability of DRG neurons by acting on TRPV1 and CDK5. Subsequently, we innovatively found that the expression of TRPV1 was directly targeted and regulated by miR-142-5p and also that the phosphorylation and membrane transport of TRPV1 were indirectly regulated by miR-142-5p via CDK5.</p><p id="Par71">Previous studies have primarily focused on the transcriptional regulation of miRNA expression. However, our findings in this study have revealed an unexpected inconsistency between the expression of pri-miR-142 and its corresponding pre-miR-142 and mature miR-142-5p. This observation strongly suggested that the differences in miR-142-5p expression induced by LPS are primarily attributed to the maturation process of pri-miR-142, rather than transcriptional regulation. The initial step in miRNA biosynthesis involves the processing of primary miRNAs (pri-miRNAs), which are cut into hairpin-structured precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs) by the nuclear microprocessor complex containing Drosha and DiGeorge critical region 8 (DGCR8) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. It is worth noting that the maturation of miRNAs is a complex process regulated by various factors including DROSHA cleavage, exportin-5 trafficking, and DICER cleavage. In mammalian mRNA, m<sup>6</sup>A modification is a prevalent post-transcriptional modification. Recent advancements in high-throughput sequencing techniques have revealed widespread <italic>N</italic><sup>6</sup>-methylation of pri-miRNAs, in addition to mRNA. In this study, we observed an increase in the overall m<sup>6</sup>A level and m<sup>6</sup>A modification, specifically within pri-miR-142 following LPS treatment. Methyltransferases, such as METTL14 and methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3), have been identified to methylate pri-miRNAs, thereby facilitating their recognition and processing by DGCR8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. In the present study, METTL14 exhibited the most significant upregulation in response to LPS treatment. Knockdown of METTL14 resulted in decreased methylation levels and promoted the maturation of pri-miR-142.</p><p id="Par72">In conclusion, we present novel findings regarding the binding domain of TRPV1 with CDK5 and the independent nature of their interaction from the phosphorylation site. The results in the present study suggest potential therapeutic implications in the clinical translation of TRPV1 modulation. Specifically, we proposed the direct inhibition of CDK5-mediated phosphorylation as a means to attenuate NP, as well as the indirect modulation of TRPV1 phosphorylation by targeting their binding regions. Moreover, the dual mechanisms of miR-142-5p for NP remission were demonstrated. Not only did it directly regulate TRPV1 expression but also modulated TRPV1 membrane transport through regulating CDK5 expression. In addition, we elucidated the inhibitory effects of METTL14 on the biosynthesis of miR-142-5p in an m<sup>6</sup>A-dependent manner. Given the favorable potency of miR-142-5p, enhancing endogenous miR-142-5p expression or supplementing exogenous miR-142-5p via exosomes and other pathways will be new approaches to treat NP.</p></sec><sec id="Sec31"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par73">Within this investigation, our research delineated a pronounced increase in TRPV1 channels and CDK5 expression within the DRG tissue of CCI model rats and DRG neurons subjected to LPS. Noteworthy findings demonstrate that the phosphorylation of TRPV1 was modulated by CDK5, thus orchestrating the membrane trafficking of TRPV1. Through methodologies such as immunofluorescence and membrane-cytoplasm fractionation in western blot analyses, the translocation of TRPV1 to the membrane was clearly illustrated. The interplay between TRPV1 and CDK5, alongside their binding sites, was also elucidated. Our analysis and research reveal that miR-142-5p operated as a pivotal upstream regulator, exerting inhibitory influences on the expression levels of both CDK5 and TRPV1. Furthermore, our observations suggest that METTL14 facilitates m<sup>6</sup>A modification of primary miR-142 in the CCI model, impeding the maturation process of primary miR-142 and consequently causing a reduction in mature miR-142-5p levels. The interaction between CDK5 and TRPV1, recognized as a key factor facilitating TRPV1 membrane translocation, indicates that synthetic short peptides rivaling CDK5 for the binding to TRPV1 might represent highly promising therapeutic modalities for managing NP.</p></sec><sec id="Sec32" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>
