Individuals with Lynch syndrome have an increased lifetime risk for CRC, ranging from 15% to 70% between the different germline mismatch repair gene variants (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). In this population, CRC incidence and mortality have reduced substantially through early detection of CRC and removal of precancerous adenomas, by means of biennial colonoscopy surveillance from age 25 years (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>).</p><p>However, colonoscopy surveillance also poses several limitations. First, individuals with Lynch syndrome experience the regular and lifelong colonoscopies and required bowel preparation as time-consuming, burdensome, and detrimental to their quality of life (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). These barriers, among others, also lead to a concerning lack of adherence to timely surveillance; as many as 28% of individuals demonstrate delayed surveillance, which significantly undermines the effectiveness of the surveillance program (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Another limitation is that colonoscopies are invasive, with a small risk for serious complications. Moreover, the procedures are costly and resource-intensive, therefore putting pressure on healthcare systems (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). All these limitations are further compounded by the fact that &#x0223c;70% of performed colonoscopies for Lynch syndrome do not reveal neoplasia requiring removal (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), thus were &#x0201c;unnecessary&#x0201d; in retrospect. Hence, it would be valuable to reduce the number of colonoscopies in those individuals unlikely to benefit from colonoscopy. On the other hand, some individuals may benefit from a shorter colonoscopy interval because postcolonoscopy CRCs still occur (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>).</p><p>In this context, noninvasive biomarkers might predict the presence of colorectal neoplasia and therefore select individuals for colonoscopy. A potential diagnostic biomarker test for CRC and advanced adenomas in Lynch syndrome is the fecal immunochemical test (FIT), a high-throughput, low-cost, and patient-friendly test which has been extensively studied in other populations and implemented in many CRC screening programs worldwide (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). In individuals at increased risk of CRC, FIT has shown high sensitivity for CRC&#x02014;particularly with thresholds &#x02264;20 &#x003bc;g Hb/g feces&#x02014;as well as for advanced adenomas on thresholds &#x02264;4 &#x003bc;g Hb/g feces (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Despite the routine use of FIT in other populations, the role of FIT for Lynch syndrome has not yet been determined.</p><p>Therefore, we designed a prospective multicenter observational study to evaluate diagnostic performance of FIT for CRC and precancerous lesions at different positivity thresholds in Lynch syndrome.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Study design</title><p>This prospective multicenter observational study was performed from February 2021 to February 2023 at 5 hospitals across the Netherlands&#x02014;3 academic hospitals (Amsterdam University Medical Center, Erasmus University Medical Center, University Medical Center Groningen), 1 comprehensive cancer center (Netherlands Cancer Institute), and 1 general hospital (Spaarne Gasthuis). The study was approved by the Research Ethical Committee of Amsterdam UMC (2020.317), and by local ethical committees of the other participating centers, and was registered at the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (NL8749). Written informed consent was obtained from all study participants.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Study participants and sample collection</title><p>We invited consecutive individuals with a pathogenic germline variant in one of the mismatch repair genes or <italic toggle="yes">EPCAM</italic>, who were scheduled for surveillance colonoscopy. In the Netherlands, colonoscopy surveillance for Lynch syndrome starts at age 25 years (independent of gene variant) and is generally performed every 2 years, with some exceptions at 1-year intervals. The Dutch guideline for Lynch syndrome does not recommend chemoprevention by means of aspirin (an agent that could have skewed FIT results). Individuals who had a history of bowel resection could be included in our study, except for (sub)total colectomy.</p><p>Individuals participating in our study were asked to perform a FIT in the 3 months before surveillance colonoscopy. FIT was performed before bowel preparation using the &#x0201c;FecesCatcher&#x0201d; (TAG Hemi, Zeijen, the Netherlands), which eases sample collection and prevents contamination from urine and toilet water. FITs were collected alongside fecal samples for another study, and therefore stored in participant's own freezer, within 1 hour after stool collection. Subsequently, samples were transported to the hospital either by the participant using cooling gel packs (200 &#x000d7; 282 mm segmented; De Ridder Packaging, Assendelft, the Netherlands) or by a researcher using dry ice. On arrival at the hospital, FITs were stored at &#x02212;20 &#x000b0;C until further analysis. Although freezing FIT is not a standard approach in other studies and CRC screening programs, we previously observed that hemoglobin levels measured by FIT were not affected by freeze-thaw cycles (<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>).</p><p>Individuals were excluded if during surveillance colonoscopy the cecum landmarks or ileocolic anastomosis were not identified, the Boston Bowel Preparation Score was not &#x02265;2 in each segment, the endoscopist observed inflammation or infection (e.g., diverticulitis or active inflammatory bowel disease), or polypectomy was performed, but no histopathology report was available. Other exclusion criteria were bowel preparation within 7 days before sample collection or insufficient fecal sample for analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Colonoscopy and histopathology</title><p>Colonoscopies were either performed or supervised by consultant gastroenterologists, who had performed more than 2,000 colonoscopies. In line with the European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy guideline for endoscopic management of Lynch syndrome, colonoscopies were performed using high-definition white light endoscopy, with additional use of advanced imaging techniques at the discretion of the endoscopist (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Following the European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy quality measures, minimum withdrawal time was 6 minutes (<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Except from obvious hyperplastic lesions &#x02264;5 mm in the rectosigmoid (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), all detected neoplasia were resected using standard polypectomy techniques. Histopathology was evaluated by experienced gastrointestinal pathologists and was reported according to the Vienna classification of gastrointestinal neoplasia (<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Serrated lesions were classified according to the 2019 World Health Organization criteria as sessile serrated lesion (SSL, with or without dysplasia), traditional serrated adenoma, or hyperplastic polyp (<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>FIT analysis</title><p>Similar to the Dutch population-based CRC screening program, we used the SENTiFIT&#x02014;fecal occult blood (FOB) gold test (Sentinel Diagnostics, Milan, Italy) for quantitative fecal hemoglobin analysis. FITs were analyzed in 4 batches after a median storage of 340 days (interquartile range [IQR] 169&#x02013;432) and with no difference in positivity rates between batches (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.691), using an automatic analyzer (SENTiFIT 270; Sentinel Diagnostics) according to manufacturer's protocols. The analyzer was calibrated, and checked for quality control at the beginning of each batch analysis, and had a lower limit of quantitation of 2.5 &#x003bc;g Hb/g feces and a lower limit of detection of 1.8 &#x003bc;g Hb/g feces. Laboratory personnel was blinded with respect to colonoscopy results.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Definitions and outcomes</title><p>Individuals were classified by their most relevant neoplasia at colonoscopy. Relevant neoplasia included CRC, advanced adenoma (defined as adenomas &#x02265;10 mm, with (tubulo)villous histology or showing high-grade dysplasia (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>)), advanced serrated lesion (defined as serrated lesions &#x02265;10 mm or showing dysplasia (<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>)), or non-advanced adenoma. Individuals with non-advanced serrated lesions only, along with those having no colorectal lesions, were deemed as controls, because recent research showed that they have a negligible risk for metachronous CRC within the 3 years after colonoscopy (<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Neoplasia size, location, and the Paris classification for morphology were retrieved from the endoscopy report; neoplasia located in the cecum, ascending colon and transverse colon, were classified as proximal, whereas neoplasia in the splenic flexure, descending colon, sigmoid, and rectum as distal.</p><p>Diagnostic performance of FIT was evaluated at different positivity thresholds&#x02014;ranging between the lower limit of quantitation and the 20 &#x003bc;g Hb/g feces threshold which is used in most CRC screening programs worldwide (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>)&#x02014;and for different outcome measures: all relevant neoplasia (CRC, advanced serrated lesions, all adenomas), advanced neoplasia (CRC, advanced adenomas, advanced serrated lesions), and CRC plus advanced adenomas.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data were presented as medians with IQRs or as numbers with percentages. Differences in baseline demographics between the neoplasia and control group were assessed using the Mann&#x02013;Whitney <italic toggle="yes">U</italic> test for continuous variables and the &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> or Fisher exact test (in case &#x02265;20% of cells had expected counts less than 5) for categorical variables.</p><p>Using IBM SPSS Statistics version 28, diagnostic performance of FIT was calculated in terms of sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value (NPV), positive predictive value (PPV), and the area under the curve including the corresponding <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> value. Receiver operating characteristic analysis established the most accurate threshold. Fagan's nomogram in RStudio version 4.2.1 visualized the estimated probability that an individual has neoplasia following negative or positive FIT, with the neoplasia prevalence being considered as the pretest probability (<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Finally, per 100 individuals tested by FIT at various thresholds, we calculated the number of missed neoplasia and the number needed to colonoscope&#x02014;that is, the number of individuals undergoing colonoscopy to detect at least 1 neoplasia, a simple indicator of cost-effectiveness. Calculations were based on the neoplasia prevalence as observed in our cohort, given that no other data are available using our definition of relevant neoplasia in Lynch syndrome.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Patient and public involvement</title><p>The design and conduct of the study were established in collaboration with the Dutch Lynch Polyposis patient association.

Our study shows that FIT at threshold 4.1 &#x003bc;g Hb/g feces maximized detection of CRC and advanced adenomas to 89% sensitivity and 99% NPV, along with 94% specificity. Per 100 individuals tested by FIT at 4.1 &#x003bc;g/g, 11 individuals would proceed to colonoscopy while only 1 individual with advanced adenoma would be missed, with a high efficiency in terms of number needed to colonoscope (n = 4) as surrogate measure for cost-effectiveness. The 20 &#x003bc;g Hb/g feces threshold, which is used in most CRC screening programs, detected CRC and advanced adenomas with only 56% sensitivity.</p><p>In population-based CRC screening, the goal of FIT is to accurately detect CRC, and therefore, a high test specificity for CRC is prioritized over adenoma detection. However, in Lynch syndrome, FIT should detect CRC as well as advanced adenomas and, ideally, non-advanced adenomas with high sensitivity and NPV, accepting a suboptimal specificity. Our study confirms previous research showing that accuracy of FIT to detect CRC and advanced adenomas is highly dependent on the FIT threshold, with sensitivity improving significantly&#x02014;although at the expense of specificity&#x02014;the lower the threshold, predominantly through enhanced detection of adenomas (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). In line with our study, thresholds &#x02264;20 &#x003bc;g Hb/g feces have shown high sensitivity and specificity for CRC in recent meta-analyses which evaluated either average-risk individuals or individuals with a familial or personal history of CRC (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). On the other hand, a threshold as low as the limit of detection (2 &#x003bc;g Hb/g feces) seemed to be required to detect advanced adenomas with high sensitivity in individuals under colonoscopy surveillance (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). A slightly higher threshold of 6 &#x003bc;g Hb/g feces resulted in suboptimal sensitivity when individuals with Lynch syndrome were tested by FIT as an emergency service during the coronavirus pandemic, although accuracy was based on only 123 individuals without reporting detailed patient characteristics and the number of CRCs and advanced adenomas (<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>).</p><p>Regardless of the FIT threshold, we found that FIT has poor diagnostic accuracy for both non-advanced adenomas and advanced serrated lesions, which seemed to be more pronounced for lesions located in the proximal colon. These findings are in line with those in previous studies and may be explained by the low tendency of such polyps to bleed (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). While identification of non-advanced adenomas is relevant in Lynch syndrome given the accelerated progression of adenomas to CRC (<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>), the independent risk of serrated lesions in this population remains unknown. Nevertheless, the prevalence of serrated lesions in individuals with Lynch syndrome seems to be similar to that of the general population (<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>), in whom most advanced serrated lesions have no dysplasia (<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>) and probably little to no malignant potential in the short term (<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>), granting a window for their detection. To improve sensitivity of FIT for advanced serrated lesions and non-advanced adenomas in Lynch syndrome, potential strategies might be to sample 2 FITs per patient, repeat FIT at short intervals, or add other biomarkers such as stool DNA (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). When devising novel biomarkers, the molecular pathways of colorectal tumorigenesis identified in Lynch syndrome should be considered (<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>).</p><p>Even if sensitivity for advanced serrated lesions and non-advanced adenomas remains poor, FIT might still enable personalized surveillance in Lynch syndrome by selecting those high-risk or low-risk carriers who might benefit from either a shorter or longer colonoscopy interval, respectively. Although risk group-specific performance of FIT could not be assessed in our study, individuals having variants in the higher-risk genes <italic toggle="yes">MLH1</italic> or <italic toggle="yes">MSH2</italic> (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>) could potentially be tested with FIT halfway through the 2-yearly colonoscopy interval, aiming to reduce the postcolonoscopy CRC rate. <italic toggle="yes">MLH1</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">MSH2</italic> variants accounted for all CRCs and most advanced adenomas in our study, although these variants were under-represented because of their lower prevalence (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>) and (sub)total colectomy being an exclusion criterion. For individuals at lower risk for neoplasia&#x02014;such as those having <italic toggle="yes">MSH6</italic> or <italic toggle="yes">PMS2</italic> variants (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>) and no other risk factors for CRC (e.g., personal history of colorectal neoplasia, smoking, and overweight) (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>)&#x02014;a negative FIT could potentially extend the 2-year surveillance interval with, for example, 6&#x02013;12 months, or even further if subsequent FITs also yield negative results. Reducing colonoscopy frequency could be of great benefit for lower-risk individuals, provided that CRC prevention remains intact through accurate detection of advanced adenomas.</p><p>Ideally, future clinical studies should compare the effectiveness and harm of fixed colonoscopy intervals with FIT-guided colonoscopy intervals. Such studies should evaluate both the FOB-gold test and the other widely used quantitative FIT called the OC sensor (which has a slightly higher limit of quantitation of 4&#x02013;5 &#x003bc;g Hb/g feces), as well as high-quality qualitative FITs at specific very low thresholds as they become available (<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). Various thresholds that have precision to 0.1 &#x003bc;g should be assessed to determine the optimal threshold, which should be an integer to be practical in clinical practice. Regarding outcome measures, such studies should evaluate neoplasia detection rates and (modelled) long-term impact on CRC incidence and mortality per risk group, as well as patient acceptability and adherence over multiple surveillance rounds. Although a recent study showed that the uptake of 3 rounds of FIT was similar to 1-time colonoscopy in surveillance-na&#x000ef;ve individuals with familial CRC (<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>), uptake of FIT may be superior when taking multiple surveillance rounds into account, especially in individuals with Lynch syndrome who require surveillance more frequently than those with familial CRC. Moreover, individuals with Lynch syndrome have shown to be receptive to noninvasive, less-burdensome surveillance strategies (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Other aspects that a clinical trial should compare are complication rates, costs, and burden to health systems including endoscopy practice. That endoscopy capacity can be a bottleneck became unmistakably evident during the coronavirus pandemic, although FIT demonstrated clinical value in prioritizing individuals with Lynch syndrome for colonoscopy (<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>).</p><p>This study has several strengths, as well as some limitations. A strong aspect is that it is the first prospective multicenter study assessing the diagnostic performance of FIT for Lynch syndrome, with evaluation of different positivity thresholds in a cohort of 217 individuals. Other strengths are the consecutive recruitment of participants and that all participants underwent high-quality colonoscopy as the reference standard (<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>), thereby limiting the possibility of spectrum bias. Moreover, neoplasia prevalence was comparable with other high-quality studies in Lynch syndrome (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>), FIT positivity rates at all thresholds were consistent with a large trial on FOB-gold in individuals with a similar advanced neoplasia prevalence (<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>), and baseline characteristics were detailed and not biased (the neoplasia and control group differed only in age and sex, which is unavoidable as these are known risk factors for neoplasia (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>)). As our study population was under strict colonoscopy surveillance, the number of advanced neoplasia assessed was relatively small, leading to rather wide confidence intervals for sensitivity and PPV, although this effect was minimal for specificity and NPV. Nevertheless, our study may have been adequately powered to prove that FIT was noninferior to colonoscopy (15% absolute margin) in detecting CRC and advanced adenomas, according to the post hoc sample size calculation that was performed as part of the manuscript preparation process (see Supplementary Digital Content 1,&#x000a0;<ext-link xlink:href="http://links.lww.com/AJG/D384" ext-link-type="uri">http://links.lww.com/AJG/D384</ext-link>). The small number of advanced neoplasia also hampered comparison of median fecal hemoglobin concentration between advanced neoplasia types and resulted in only 2 stage I CRCs being included (the other 2 CRCs were stage III). A recent meta-analysis showed that stage I CRC, in particular T1 CRC, has a lower FIT sensitivity than later stages (<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>), although this meta-analysis did not evaluate very low thresholds (&#x0003c;10 &#x003bc;g Hb/g feces) and stage-specific sensitivity by tumor location. As detection of early-stage CRCs (stages I and II) is most relevant for reducing CRC morbidity and mortality, further larger studies should ensure that FIT at thresholds below 10 &#x003bc;g Hb/g feces can accurately detect both proximal and distal early-stage CRC in Lynch syndrome. Finally, because the Dutch guideline for Lynch syndrome does not recommend aspirin for chemoprevention, the impact of this agent on FIT performance remains to be determined.</p><p>In conclusion, the noninvasive FIT at positivity thresholds &#x02264;4.1 &#x003bc;g Hb/g feces may be a promising strategy to postpone colonoscopy in approximately 9 of 10 individuals with Lynch syndrome. Large validation studies that also evaluate risk group-specific performance, patient acceptability and cost-effectiveness should be prioritized&#x02014;in an effort to personalize colonoscopy surveillance in Lynch syndrome and thereby reduce colonoscopy burden as well as postcolonoscopy CRC rates.</p></sec><sec sec-type="COI-statement" id="s5"><title>CONFLICTS OF INTEREST</title><p><bold>Guarantor of the article:</bold> Dewkoemar Ramsoekh, MD, PhD.</p><p><bold>Specific author contributions:</bold> E.L.S.A.v.L., N.K.H.d.B., M.E.v.L., E.D., M.A.J.M.J., J.J.K., J.P.K., M.C.W.S., B.C., and D.R.: conceived the study design.
