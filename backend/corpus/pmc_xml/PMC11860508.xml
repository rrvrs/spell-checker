Borderline personality disorder first manifests itself, as a rule, in adolescence, so it is easy to mistake it for manifestations of &#x0201c;difficult age&#x0201d; characteristic of the period of growing up. In this sense, the typical signs of borderline personality disorder are not original: low self-esteem, emotional excitability, impulsive behavior and sudden mood swings, to one degree or another characteristic of all adolescents. An alarming exception is, perhaps, only a tendency to self-harm and, the so-called, desocialization of a teenager, the loss of social skills and connections (for example, friendships). Recently, experts have increasingly mentioned desocialization in connection with the development of Internet technologies and gadgets that replace communication in real life for many teenagers</p></sec><sec id="sec4982"><title>Methods</title><p>An anonymous survey of 57 older teenagers conducted. The degree of borderline personality disorder assessed using IPDE, STAI, and CDI. Statistical processing of the results carried out in Microsoft Excel using measures of the central trend (arithmetic mean, standard deviation) and correlation analysis. The significance of the differences between the groups was determined using the Student&#x02019;s t-test (p &#x0003c; 0.05)</p></sec><sec id="sec4983"><title>Results</title><p>On average, the level of BPD among the respondents was at a low level of 9.81 (&#x000b1;4.43) points. The severity of personal anxiety was at a high level of 45.02 (&#x000b1;13.25) points, situational anxiety was also at a high level of 41.14 (&#x000b1;14.93). The severity of depression was above average and amounted to 55.84 (&#x000b1;14.33) points</p></sec><sec id="sec4984"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Teenage girls are more prone to anxiety and depression than boys are. High anxiety causes a tendency to depression, and these two factors affect the occurrence of PRL.
