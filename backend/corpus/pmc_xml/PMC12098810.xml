Alcohol acts as a teratogenic agent and can have adverse and varying impacts on a developing fetus depending on the amount, frequency, and timing of consumption, as well as maternal factors, such as age, genetics, body composition, and metabolism of alcohol (Aiton,&#x000a0;<xref rid="acer70040-bib-0001" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>; Bower et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="acer70040-bib-0009" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). There is no safe limit of PAE established in the literature, and the risk of harm to the fetus is higher with increased frequency and amount of PAE (National Health and Medical Research Council,&#x000a0;<xref rid="acer70040-bib-0044" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>).</p><p>In Australia, FASD is a recognized disability, with the Australian Guidelines for Assessment and Diagnosis of FASD (Bower et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="acer70040-bib-0008" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>) currently under review following initial stakeholder consultation (Hayes et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="acer70040-bib-0031" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>) and public consultation in April 2024 (FASD Hub Australia,&#x000a0;<xref rid="acer70040-bib-0024" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>). The estimated global prevalence of FASD is 7.7 cases per 1000 individuals in the general population (Lange et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="acer70040-bib-0039" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Popova et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="acer70040-bib-0049" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>, <xref rid="acer70040-bib-0050" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). In Australia, higher prevalence rates have been established in a juvenile justice setting (36%; Bower et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="acer70040-bib-0057" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>) and in one remote Aboriginal community (12%; Fitzpatrick et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="acer70040-bib-0025" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), with some calls for focused screenings for FASD in these populations, as well as children in out&#x02010;of&#x02010;home care (Fogliani,&#x000a0;<xref rid="acer70040-bib-0027" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>; Popova et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="acer70040-bib-0047" ref-type="bibr">2023</xref>). It is important to note FASD can occur in families from all types of cultural backgrounds and psychosocial contexts (Bower et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="acer70040-bib-0009" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Connor et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="acer70040-bib-0015" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>).</p><p>It has recently been established that Australian psychologists are broadly familiar with FASD as a diagnostic term and are aware there is no safe time or amount of alcohol to consume in pregnancy (Kerimofski et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="acer70040-bib-0037" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>). However, the majority of these psychologists were not confident in their ability to assess PAE, and despite feeling more confident in their ability to apply the diagnostic criteria for other neurodevelopmental disorders compared with FASD, they were largely unaware of clinical guidelines, as well as state and federal government recommendations to screen for PAE in assessments for intellectual disability (ID), learning difficulties, and behavioral concerns (FASD Model of Care, Department of Health, State of WA,&#x000a0;<xref rid="acer70040-bib-0058" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; National FASD Strategic Action Plan 2018&#x02013;2028, Department of Health,&#x000a0;<xref rid="acer70040-bib-0021" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>; Kerimofski et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="acer70040-bib-0037" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>). Despite the well&#x02010;established link between PAE and disruption to neurodevelopment (DeJong et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="acer70040-bib-0020" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>), Australian psychologists surveyed reported not wanting to shame the biological mother and not knowing how to assess for PAE as the main reasons for not asking about PAE during clinical interviews (Kerimofski et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="acer70040-bib-0037" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>).</p><p>Stigma and stereotypes have developed about biological mothers and individuals with FASD (Roozen et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="acer70040-bib-0053" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>), including public stigma about biological mothers being seen as morally culpable (Roozen et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="acer70040-bib-0053" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>) and some condemned as &#x0201c;child abusers&#x0201d; who &#x0201c;lack empathy&#x0201d; (Corrigan et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="acer70040-bib-0017" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>, p. 172). This stigma is also seen in the false stereotype that FASD is solely an &#x0201c;Indigenous problem&#x0201d; (Jandu Yani U Project Team,&#x000a0;<xref rid="acer70040-bib-0035" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>, p. 8). The National Drug Strategy Household Survey [NDSHS] 2022&#x02013;2023&#x000a0;(<xref rid="acer70040-bib-0004" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>) highlighted that alcohol consumption in pregnancy is declining in Australia, from 42% of women aged 14&#x02013;49 in 2013 to 28% in 2022&#x02013;2023. Of those who consumed alcohol in pregnancy, most did not know they were pregnant, but 15% continued to consume alcohol once aware of their pregnancy (NSDHSD,&#x000a0;<xref rid="acer70040-bib-0004" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>). Women who continued to consume alcohol in pregnancy tended to be older, have higher incomes, education, and socioeconomic status (Anderson et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="acer70040-bib-0003" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Hutchinson et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="acer70040-bib-0034" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Kingsbury et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="acer70040-bib-0038" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; McCormack et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="acer70040-bib-0041" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>).</p><p>There are a number of barriers to FASD assessment and diagnosis, including the aforementioned public stigma (Bell et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="acer70040-bib-0007" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Howlett et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="acer70040-bib-0059" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>; Mukherjee et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="acer70040-bib-0043" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), as well as a lack of sufficient training in FASD (McCormack et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="acer70040-bib-0042" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>), limited diagnostic capacity (Commonwealth of Australia,&#x000a0;<xref rid="acer70040-bib-0014" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>) and limited referral pathways (Panton et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="acer70040-bib-0045" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>). A further difficulty in diagnosing FASD is the overlap with other neurodevelopmental conditions (Tanfield et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="acer70040-bib-0054" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>). Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most common comorbid neurodevelopmental disorder (52.9%; Lange et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="acer70040-bib-0040" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>), followed by ID (23%; Weyrauch et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="acer70040-bib-0055" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Autism was found to be comorbid with FASD at a 2.9% rate (Lange et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="acer70040-bib-0040" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>), although this may be an underrepresentation as a recent meta&#x02010;analysis indicated this figure could be closer to 7% when looking at individuals who have PAE but no FASD diagnosis (Clark et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="acer70040-bib-0013" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>). Chasnoff et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;(<xref rid="acer70040-bib-0012" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) studied children who were fostered and adopted and found that 80% of children had a missed diagnosis of FASD, with their PAE unrecognized prior to the study's multidisciplinary assessments.</p><p>Individuals with FASD, as well as their parents and caregivers, have expertise in their lives and offer valuable insights into the assessment process and ways to improve service delivery. Hayes et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;(<xref rid="acer70040-bib-0032" ref-type="bibr">2023</xref>) conducted a systematic review of studies based on lived experiences of FASD diagnostic assessments with four overarching topics: (1) preassessment concerns and challenges, (2) the diagnostic assessment process, (3) receipt of the diagnosis, and (4) postassessment adaptations and needs. It was often reported that while caregivers were proactive in recognizing concerning behaviors and contacting health professionals, their concerns were frequently dismissed, and FASD was not considered or acknowledged by health professionals. Misconceptions about FASD and PAE by clinicians were reported in seven studies in Hayes et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;(<xref rid="acer70040-bib-0032" ref-type="bibr">2023</xref>) and stereotypes about facial features delayed FASD diagnosis. Despite barriers to accessing FASD assessment and feelings of grief and shame for some, families also report a sense of hope and relief, with benefits, including improved understanding of their child, as well as being a means to access appropriate and individualized support (Hayes et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="acer70040-bib-0032" ref-type="bibr">2023</xref>).</p><p>By interviewing Australian psychologists, as well as the parents, caregivers, and adults who have lived experience of the assessment process, we aimed to better understand the current landscape of clinical practice assessing PAE and FASD. While lived experiences of FASD assessment have been studied (Hayes et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="acer70040-bib-0032" ref-type="bibr">2023</xref>), the perspectives of psychologists conducting the assessments have been missed. By interviewing both groups, we aimed to integrate the perspectives and knowledge to understand current practices within Australia, in order to identify potential training gaps for psychologists.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials-and-methods" id="acer70040-sec-0007"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="acer70040-sec-0008"><title>Research design</title><p>A semi&#x02010;structured interview guide was developed to examine contemporary lived experiences of FASD assessment, as well as the experiences of psychologists with FASD assessment.

Questions and themes from these studies were reviewed, and a consensus decision was made about the interview questions. Additionally, a question was developed regarding universal screening of PAE following a recommendation for screening during infant health assessments and upon children entering child protection and justice systems from a coronial investigation in WA highlighting the link between FASD and suicide (Fogliani,&#x000a0;<xref rid="acer70040-bib-0027" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>).</p><p>Participants were interviewed through video calls, which were recorded and transcribed, then analyzed with NVivo.

PP were recruited via professional networks, including past and present students of a graduate training program for FASD diagnosis in Australia, the Australia New Zealand FASD Clinical Network, LinkedIn, Facebook psychology groups, and the University research repository page of the co&#x02010;authors. LEP were recruited via the National Organisation for Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (NOFASD Australia) and were a mixture of biological parents, caregivers, and individuals with lived and living experience of FASD and FASD assessment. NOFASD Australia runs a parent, carer, and individuals with lived experience Expert Advisory Group (PEAG) with members asked whether they would like to participate in the project. These members were contacted, and additional people with lived experience were recruited via professional networks.</p><p>Participants were 10 psychologists and nine people with lived experience, biological parents, caregivers, and adults with FASD.

Half of the psychologists interviewed reported using the AUDIT&#x02010;C (Bush et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="acer70040-bib-0011" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>) to quantify alcohol use, once they have established rapport. Normalizing alcohol use in context was a strategy used to understand what was happening in a person's life when they became pregnant. &#x0201c;We tend to drink a lot. So again, you know, I'm trying to sort of normalize the fact that this is Australian culture. There's nothing special about people drinking a lot when they're not intending to get pregnant &#x02026; that could be any of us&#x0201d; (PP7/LE 1).</p><p>The experience of PAE assessment varied for biological parents compared with caregivers. One biological mother reported informing her GP about two or three binge drinking occasions prior to discovering the pregnancy and being advised to not &#x0201c;drink at that level again, now that you know you're pregnant&#x0201d; and then she &#x0201c;was never asked again. Obviously, it was never discussed and the number of clinicians throughout my son's first 13&#x02009;years when I was asking questions, nobody ever asked me about alcohol, and I never thought to mention it&#x0201d; (LE5). For caregivers, some were aware of the biological mother's substance use (including alcohol) when their children were placed in their care or they reported being &#x0201c;lucky&#x0201d; (LE4) that PAE was documented in medical, police or child protection records. The frustrations of a lack of documentation or birth mothers denying alcohol use due to child protection concerns were also raised across both groups. Participants also reported concern that &#x0201c;There are still doctors who are recommending women have a drink. Calm your nerves, settle you down&#x0201d; (LE7).</p></sec><sec id="acer70040-sec-0015"><title>Concerns and barriers to asking about PAE</title><p>A number of concerns and barriers were raised, including the need to be sensitive when asking about PAE and not wanting to shame the biological mother. Psychologists and caregivers also spoke of the difficulties in getting confirmation about PAE, either where there are doubts about the information provided by the birth mother or in cases where PAE is being confirmed through medical records or through other family reporting on the birth mother's drinking history. &#x0201c;When you ask that question, did you drink during pregnancy? &#x02026; They'll often say no. And what they also mean is that the minute I found out that I was pregnant, I stopped drinking&#x0201d; (PP7/LE1). &#x0201c;There is a really deep problem with the birth mothers in admitting that they drink. So a lot of people either don't believe that it's a problem. It doesn't matter if I have a couple of glasses on the weekend, it's not gonna matter. They don't believe the one glass can do damage story&#x0201d; (LE7).</p><p>For the psychologists working in private practice, FASD is not a referral they report receiving. Clients will be referred with ADHD, learning, and behavioral queries, but the possible impact of PAE is not considered by referring families, pediatricians, or psychiatrists. One psychologist working in the private and public sector found that in &#x0201c;private practice, if I approach that question, it's kind of like, why are you asking? &#x02026;Of course not. Why would I?&#x0201d; (PP9). &#x0201c;I think that they're very afraid, particularly with white upper&#x02010;class women, to even bring it up because these women react very poorly because they think that it is a lower socioeconomic status Aboriginal problem in society that doesn't concern them and that could not possibly happen to them or their child&#x0201d; (PP4).

The difficulties of recording and sharing this information were reported as mother and child records are kept separately, and public and private systems vary considerably.

</p><p>Both the psychologists and lived experience groups discussed differential, comorbid and missed diagnoses. For the lived experience groups, additional diagnoses included anxiety, autism, ADHD, intellectual disability, depression, dyslexia, dyscalculia, as well as experiences of gender dysphoria, psychosis and trauma. Some children were diagnosed early with global developmental delay, with caregivers reporting a reluctance on behalf of the pediatricians to diagnose FASD and preferring to diagnose GDD or Autism because &#x0201c;it's a lot easier to get that type of diagnosis, yeah, than it is to do the multidisciplinary approach to FASD&#x0201d; (LE10).</p><p>The lived experience group participants reported early signs that their child was not developing typically, including physical health concerns, as well as developmental delays and difficult behavior. Some caregivers began to question FASD early, based on known PAE, with some children in the group diagnosed prior to starting school. Other parents and caregivers reported &#x0201c;knowing there was something&#x0201d; (LE5) but being dismissed by clinicians. &#x0201c;I was made very much in those early years to feel like an anxious parent, a helicopter parent&#x0201d; (LE5). &#x0201c;CAMHS (Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services) just wiped it off as bad parenting&#x0201d; (LE7).</p><p>The sense of missed diagnoses was also reported by psychologists, who reported that &#x0201c;Once you've done the FASD training, you then look back on &#x02026; kids that you've worked with or done assessments for and you kind of realize &#x02026; oh yeah, I totally missed that. This is actually FASD happening for them&#x0201d; (PP3). The idea that the more diagnoses a child has, the more likely it is to be FASD was discussed frequently. &#x0201c;I think it would be good for psychologists to know, like, hey, if you have a child with this shopping list of diagnoses that includes ADHD, language disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, you know, depression, anxiety, &#x02026; maybe it's a good idea to start thinking about FASD&#x0201d; (PP1). The continued stigma and varied presentation of FASD were discussed as a reason that psychologists feel other clinicians &#x0201c;doubt the validity of it (FASD) as a diagnosis&#x0201d; (PP1).</p><sec id="acer70040-sec-0020"><title>Barriers to assessment and diagnosis</title><p>Additional difficulties of getting diagnosed included a lack of FASD&#x02010;informed clinicians, difficulties confirming PAE, and the length of time it took from discovering PAE and beginning to query FASD to getting a diagnosis. &#x0201c;It took five years from that point to actually obtain the diagnosis&#x0201d; (LE3). For the adults with FASD, it was particularly difficult to find clinicians that would assess adults, as most Multidisciplinary Team (MDT) clinics in Australia are designed to support children. The adults had to self&#x02010;source assessments via several different clinicians, most of whom reported having no FASD knowledge or training. One adult was ultimately diagnosed by a specialist pediatrician. One adult reported being turned away by a university clinic for psychological assessment, being told &#x0201c;Your case seems complex, and I don't think we can help you&#x0201d; (LE2).</p></sec><sec id="acer70040-sec-0021"><title>Diagnosing FASD and autism in aboriginal populations</title><p>Misdiagnosis of Autism and FASD was discussed by both groups, with psychologists discussing an article by a prominent Aboriginal psychologist that &#x0201c;FASD is damaging to Aboriginal communities&#x0201d; (PP1). The same participant reported that &#x0201c;my hunch is that FASD is probably just as common in white populations as it is in Aboriginal populations probably just diagnosed less, but I don't think the answer is like, stop diagnosing it in Aboriginal populations.&#x0201d; This difference in diagnostic formulation was also reported to be seen in Pediatricians&#x02014;&#x0201c;I've heard a couple of pediatricians say quite openly.

I was deeply depressed, and depression lifted straight away&#x0201d; (LE3). Others spoke of the isolation, shame, and a lack of understanding from the people around them, as well as clinicians involved in their care or the care of their children. There was a sense that individuals were receiving a diagnosis and then needing to find their own supports because &#x0201c;their job is about assessment&#x0201d; (LE4). It was widely agreed that a diagnosis did not guarantee support, with participants citing a lack of NDIS (National Disability Insurance Scheme) and school&#x02010;based funding. &#x0201c;A lot of kids don't get their plans (funding) for FASD&#x0201d; (LE6).</p></sec><sec id="acer70040-sec-0024"><title>School supports and experiences</title><p>Parents and caregivers spoke about their need to advocate for their children, particularly in the school setting. &#x0201c;Unless the parent is prepared to get up and actually help educate people from within the school themselves, there's not really any stuff put into place for that to happen&#x0201d; (LE10). There was a widespread lack of understanding of FASD in schools, with parents and caregivers reporting they were the ones to educate the teachers and school leaders about FASD in order to support their children. Issues with engagement and supportive planning were also highlighted, with a sense that because FASD was not recognized as a funded disability across most school systems, their children were being disadvantaged. &#x0201c;The school system is not set up for them&#x0201d; (LE8).</p><p>School psychologists were discussed by both groups, with varied experiences. One caregiver described them as being &#x0201c;so overworked and they're not actually able to do assessments&#x0201d; (LE8). Another felt that &#x0201c;school psychologists actually can have a lot of influence in being able to get the right supports in place in schooling for these kids, because schooling is such a massive issue, it really is&#x0201d; (LE4). Psychologists had mixed feelings about school psychologists conducting assessments. &#x0201c;I had several conversations with school psych(ologist)s last year who told me that FASD did not exist, and they said it's not a thing. It's just ADHD or it's just autism, or it's just a really complex psychiatric case. They've probably got PTSD. And they absolutely do not think that FASD is a condition and those children are going to be severely disadvantaged if that's the psych(ologist) that is assessing them&#x0201d; (PP4). One participant working in a school does assess for FASD but was clear &#x0201c;it's not our role we've been told to hypothesize that it could be FASD. You would ask in the history taking, but it's not our role because the sensitive nature of it, that it must come from a medical forum first. So if I get a referral from pediatricians here, then I will go ahead with that. But it doesn't occur the other way around&#x0201d; (PP6).</p></sec><sec id="acer70040-sec-0025"><title>Lack of support for secondary conditions associated with FASD</title><p>One caregiver highlighted the lack of support for both individuals and caregivers. &#x0201c;Lack of support for carers and parents to help us with how to manage it. Because it is such a difficult disability to manage. The life expectancy for these kids, for people with FASD is 35 because they commit suicide. These are very, very at risk people. Probably the most at risk people in the society&#x0201d; (LE7). One adult highlighted the difficulty of their employer becoming aware of their FASD diagnosis and the stigma and stress involved. Additional difficulties included children understanding and accepting their diagnoses, particularly as they became teenagers. Secondary impacts became more prevalent in this age group, including needing support to live independently, suicide attempts, significant mental health support needs, and difficulties with the law. For the psychologists who do assess FASD, they did not also offer therapy services. &#x0201c;The assessment is one part of it. But then it's kind of like, OK, well, where to from here?

</p><p>Both groups discussed the lack of training at university for psychologists and other health professionals and the importance of training more FASD&#x02010;informed professionals. The psychologists interviewed reported having at most one workshop during their Master's degree that included FASD, with no information about FASD or PAE discussed at an undergraduate level. Some psychologists were told explicitly by supervisors in their courses not to ask about PAE. &#x0201c;My adult and pediatric internal supervisors did not provide any training in that and one of them suggested that we don't even ask&#x0201d; (PP4). Additional barriers include not being in the DSM (APA,&#x000a0;<xref rid="acer70040-bib-0002" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>) and debate about whose role it is to assess and diagnose FASD. Most psychologists reported their current training and knowledge of FASD being due to their own research, attending professional development or having a supervisor that was passionate about the impact of PAE. The psychologists wanted training to include information on appropriate supports and interventions, when to assess and when to refer on and when to consider FASD in their case formulation for both assessment and therapy clients.</p><p>For both groups, there was debate centered around single clinician versus MDT diagnosis. While some psychologists were trained to assess facial features, they expressed a preference for input from a pediatrician and other allied health clinicians. &#x0201c;Although I technically can do it, I don't like to do things like measure head circumference or measure facial (features). I don't feel that that's within my scope and I would prefer to leave that to someone who is an expert in doing &#x02026; the medical and obviously refer for genetic testing if we need to rule out other genetic syndromes. They can diagnose any &#x02026; comorbid neurological stuff&#x02026; I think they need to have a role in it. I don't want to see it turn into a single clinician diagnosis the way autism has&#x0201d; (PP1). For those with lived experience, &#x0201c;a one stop shop would be ideal&#x0201d; (LE10), although both groups spoke directly of experiences where FASD had been overlooked by MDTs.</p><p>Additional discussion around training included differing opinions about whose role it is to assess and diagnose FASD. Some psychologists expressed that &#x0201c;neuropsych(ology) is specialized and people who don't have neuropsych(ology) training, I see them do (assessments) badly&#x02026; But I think that to expect every single psych to do (assessment) is a bit of a big ask&#x0201d; (PP1). Other psychologists were more open to upskilling psychologists with general registration or other areas of endorsement. &#x0201c;I think, that there needs to be better training not only for neuropsychologists in FASD, but also anybody who is when it's within their scope to do an assessment, such as a school psychologist, because they're expected to by their school and understand what they're administering and how to interpret the findings and how to report on it, and also knowing when to refer on&#x0201d; (PP4). The LE participants were less focused on the endorsement of psychologists and more focused on clinicians being FASD&#x02010;informed. One adult reported that despite seeing &#x0201c;a well&#x02010;respected and prolific working neuropsychologist,&#x0201d; she &#x0201c;probably was aware of FASD, but she was not someone that could assess and make a diagnosis of FASD,&#x0201d; highlighting the need for further training across endorsements.</p><sec id="acer70040-sec-0027"><title>Training priorities from a lived experience perspective</title><p>The lived experience group had some key priorities for FASD training. &#x0201c;Rapport building is everything and that psychological safety and physical safety of that person coming into that interaction&#x0201d; (LE5). Understanding FASD through the lens of &#x0201c;brain&#x02010;based behavior&#x0201d; (LE10) and respecting lived experience were critical. &#x0201c;It's not just a foster child to me. I'm invested in making a difference for their futures. I don't have any specialized training, but please acknowledge me as someone that has his best interests at heart and work with me. And don't just dismiss me because you have that training and expertise&#x0201d; (LE9).</p><p>Additionally, they stressed the uniqueness of individuals with FASD and the stereotypes that persist around facial features. &#x0201c;Still on the NOFASD helpline, you'll have parents who've been waiting for six months, nine months, to get to see a pediatrician, and then they get told when they see the pediatrician, that it, well, it can't be FASD &#x02018;cause they don't have facial features.

In Australia, alcohol consumption is widespread, although alcohol consumption in pregnancy is declining, from 42% of women aged 14&#x02013;49 in 2013 to 28% in 2022&#x02013;2023, and for those who consumed alcohol in pregnancy, 64% did not know they were pregnant (NDSHS 2022&#x02013;2023,&#x000a0;<xref rid="acer70040-bib-0004" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>). Addressing and reducing PAE is an important issue in public health, given the social and economic costs associated with secondary conditions of FASD (Greenmyer et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="acer70040-bib-0028" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>; Popova et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="acer70040-bib-0048" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>).

Clinicians, such as obstetricians, midwives, and GPs would likely benefit from training on the importance of screening for PAE, as well as how to ask about PAE in a sensitive and culturally informed way for all pregnant women, in order to increase the number of women asked about PAE and ultimately reduce PAE.</p><p>Participants from both groups recommended all women should be asked about PAE and the information recorded in medical records during routine antenatal care. The AUDIT&#x02010;C (Bush et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="acer70040-bib-0011" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>) is an appropriate tool to address and record PAE; however, participants noted that there would need to be careful consideration around how this information is then used. Opportunities were also identified to screen for PAE and FASD in early child health settings and at school entry. For example, in Victoria, maternal and child health nurses were trained to use the Social Attention and Communication Surveillance (SACS)&#x02010;Revised and SACS&#x02010;Preschool tools during well&#x02010;child checkups at 12, 18, 24, and 42&#x02009;months of age for early autism detection, with the SACS&#x02010;R having an 83% positive predictive value and 99% negative predicted value of identifying autism (Barbaro et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="acer70040-bib-0006" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>).

In Australia, the demand for FASD diagnosis is far greater than the availability of diagnostic services, with no consistency in the model of service (Panton et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="acer70040-bib-0045" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>). While the traditional multidisciplinary team (MDT) approach is considered the gold standard (Bower et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="acer70040-bib-0008" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>), training clinicians outside of this approach can improve access to assessment and diagnosis (Burd &#x00026; Popova,&#x000a0;<xref rid="acer70040-bib-0062" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). In particular, the adults with FASD interviewed highlighted that there were no MDTs for adult FASD assessment in Australia, and not all states have dedicated FASD clinics.</p></sec><sec id="acer70040-sec-0031"><title>Developing FASD training</title><p>In addition to a lack of diagnostic services, participants with lived experience highlighted the lack of FASD&#x02010;informed clinicians available to offer therapeutic support. The psychologists interviewed for this study considered FASD to be a niche area of both assessment and intervention, with the psychologists' knowledge about FASD coming from professional development that they had sought out or from an informed supervisor at university. Both groups stated the importance of embedding teaching about the impact of PAE on neurodevelopment at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels in Australia. For practicing psychologists, there have been recommendations to allocate government funding for training in FASD assessment, test interpretation, and diagnosis (Commonwealth of Australia,&#x000a0;<xref rid="acer70040-bib-0014" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>; Reid,&#x000a0;<xref rid="acer70040-bib-0051" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>; Reid et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="acer70040-bib-0052" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Online training has previously been reported to be the preferred option for Australian psychologists; however, this was in the context of psychologists who already work in the field (Kerimofski et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="acer70040-bib-0037" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>).</p><p>When considering developing further FASD training, there was an emphasis from participants on recognizing that assessments and interventions should be individualized. Culture was not discussed directly by participants in the interviews; however, the FASD Indigenous Framework (Hewlett et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="acer70040-bib-0033" ref-type="bibr">2023</xref>) suggests ways for non&#x02010;Aboriginal clinicians and Aboriginal peoples to access healing&#x02010;informed, strengths&#x02010;based, and culturally responsive FASD assessments and supports. The framework establishes elements of knowledge for clinicians, &#x0201c;knowing,&#x0201d; such as understanding the legacies of colonization and Aboriginal perspectives, as well as ways of being, &#x0201c;unlearning&#x0201d; and doing, &#x0201c;yarning&#x0201d; and applying a strengths&#x02010;based approach and advocacy.</p><p>Additional consideration for future training should be given to the diagnostic terminology. Eliason et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;(<xref rid="acer70040-bib-0023" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>) raised concerns that the term FASD contributes to a culture of racism and discrimination and should be revised to a broader diagnostic term, such as &#x0201c;neurodevelopmental disorder&#x0201d; as it is difficult to confirm that PAE is the primary cause of neurodevelopmental impairment. Others argue that by replacing the term FASD, the FASD community may be further marginalized and the important public health messaging about the risks of PAE will be impacted (Kachor,&#x000a0;<xref rid="acer70040-bib-0036" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>). Currently, there is no unified diagnostic approach, with more than 10 different diagnostic criteria globally (Reid et&#x000a0;al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="acer70040-bib-0063" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>). Inclusion in the next edition of the DSM (APA,&#x000a0;<xref rid="acer70040-bib-0002" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>) could support a cohesive approach to diagnostic criteria and terminology.</p></sec></sec><sec id="acer70040-sec-0032"><title>LIMITATIONS</title><p>This study was limited by the sample size and generalizability of results. The lived experience participants were derived from the NOFASD PEAG and are actively involved in support and advocacy for FASD. They are not necessarily representative of all individuals, parents, and caregivers affected by FASD.</p><p>Similarly, the psychologists interviewed had a higher baseline level of FASD knowledge than psychologists previously surveyed in Kerimofski et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;(<xref rid="acer70040-bib-0037" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>). This was helpful in terms of achieving productive discourse about FASD and their experiences but may not reflect most Australian psychologists' experiences.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="acer70040-sec-0033"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>The importance of asking about PAE in a sensitive manner, including universal screening opportunities, was highlighted by both groups of participants. A call to increase the number of FASD&#x02010;informed clinicians to offer both assessment and individualized support will require embedding knowledge about FASD and PAE within all university training programs for psychologists, as FASD is currently considered a niche area of assessment, with clinicians holding outdated views at times. Future research could focus on developing culturally appropriate and sensitive screening tools for PAE and FASD, as well as training for psychologists in these assessments to improve early identification and support. Additionally, the broad support for universal screening of PAE suggests training clinicians involved in antenatal care to consistently screen for PAE in a sensitive and culturally informed manner.</p></sec><sec id="acer70040-sec-0035"><title>FUNDING INFORMATION</title><p>This research received no specific grant from any agency in the public, commercial or not&#x02010;for&#x02010;profit sectors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="COI-statement" id="acer70040-sec-0036"><title>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT</title><p>The authors declare no conflict of interest.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material id="acer70040-supitem-0001" position="float" content-type="local-data"><caption><p>
