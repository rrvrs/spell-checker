Although liver biopsy is necessary to confirm the disease and outline different stages of liver fibrosis, it is associated with several risks due to its invasiveness. Shear-wave elastography (SWE) has recently emerged as a non-invasive imaging modality, representing liver stiffness and providing additional fibrosis assessment. This study aims to validate SWE for diagnosing and discriminating liver fibrosis stage in AIH patients.</p><p>Methodology</p><p>This retrospective cohort study was conducted at the Sindh Institute of Urology and Transplantation, Karachi, with the enrollment of 162 patients diagnosed with AIH between March 2022 and December 2023. All participants underwent SWE and liver biopsy. The stages of fibrosis were assessed using the Metavir scoring system. Demographic, biochemical, and serological data were analyzed, including autoantibody and serum IgG levels. Diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of SWE were compared with histopathological findings.</p><p>Results</p><p>Of the 162 patients, 71 (43.8%) were males, and 91 (56.2%) were females, with a mean age of 35.8 &#x000b1; 16.6 years. SWE had an overall diagnostic accuracy of 92.11%, sensitivity of 82.86%, and specificity of 98.7% in predicting fibrosis stages. SWE was effective in differentiating early fibrosis (F1-F2), while it showed reduced sensitivity for advanced fibrosis (F3-F4). Female gender (p = 0.009), elevated bilirubin (p = 0.009), autoantibody titers, and serum IgG levels (p = 0.043) were significant factors related to advanced fibrosis.</p><p>Conclusions</p><p>SWE has shown high diagnostic accuracy and specificity for the estimation of liver fibrosis in AIH, especially in the early stages. Sensitivity is lowered in advanced fibrosis. SWE is a very valuable non-invasive alternative to liver biopsy. Its use may decrease procedural risks, accelerate diagnosis, and improve outcomes in AIH. Further multicenter studies are recommended for confirmation and to explore the comparative performance of SWE against other non-invasive approaches.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>autoimmune hepatitis (aih)</kwd><kwd>diagnostic accuracy</kwd><kwd>liver fibrosis</kwd><kwd>non-invasive</kwd><kwd>shear-wave elastography (swe)</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is an immune-mediated inflammatory process that progressively leads to chronic liver disease, decompensation, and liver failure, ultimately requiring liver transplantation [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Its onset has a bimodal distribution, with age peaking at 10-30 years and 40-60 years, predominantly occurring in the female population (71-95% women) [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The annual incidence of AIH ranges from 0.67 to 2.0 cases per 100,000 depending on the geographical distribution [<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The incidence has increased over the years, and its clinical presentation varies in different ethnic groups, with Asians and other non-European individuals having poor disease outcomes.</p><p>Early diagnosis is crucial as untreated AIH has a high mortality rate. Around one-third of adult patients and a half of children with AIH have cirrhosis at the time of presentation [<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The diagnosis of AIH is based on histological, clinical, and laboratory findings (elevated serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels and increased serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) concentration) and the presence of autoantibodies specific for AIH [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Histopathological findings include lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates and the presence of rosettes, emperipolesis, and plasma cells, affecting the interface, commonly described as interface hepatitis [<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>The aim of treatment in AIH is to achieve disease&#x000a0;remission and prevent further progression of liver disease, achieved with the administration of steroids and immunosuppressant therapy [<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Liver fibrosis results in the development of portal hypertension, including ascites, variceal hemorrhage, hepatic encephalopathy, as well as hepatocellular carcinoma [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>There are invasive and non-invasive methods for diagnosing and monitoring disease progression. Although liver biopsy is the gold standard for diagnosing fibrosis and follow-up treatment response, it is associated with significant risk and potential complications of pain, bleeding, infection, perforation, and even death [<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Mehran et al. reported that post-biopsy hemorrhage is the major cause of mortality, occurring in up to 10.9% of cases [<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In contrast to liver biopsy, electrography is accessible and repeatable, making it easier to use at a population level to evaluate fibrosis.</p><p>Furthermore, liver biopsy has a few limitations due to its small specimen size, specimen mishandling, inter and intraobserver reliability with histologic assessment, and the associated risk of bleeding and infection [<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Hence, there is a need for a non-invasive and accurate method to characterize fibrosis in individuals with AIH.</p><p>Elastography helps in the estimation of liver fibrosis. Two-dimensional shear-wave elastography (2D-SWE) is a real-time two-dimensional elastography technique that relies on acoustic radiation force to generate shear waves, determining liver stiffness quantitatively [<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>-<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Elastography has a well-established role in the staging of liver fibrosis in patients with hepatitis B-related chronic liver disease [<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, limited studies are available regarding the role of elastography in AIH. According to previous studies, serum tests are inferior to imaging tests when evaluating fibrosis in AIH and overlap diseases [<xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Determination of a non-invasive index of AIH will be helpful for the community in predicting fibrosis and disease severity without the need to perform a liver biopsy and identify individuals at risk of future complications such as liver cirrhosis. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to determine the diagnostic performance of SWE by comparing histologic liver fibrosis with SWE measurements of liver stiffness.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>After obtaining approval from the Ethical Review Committee, Sindh Institute of Urology and Transplantation (approval number: 839), this retrospective cohort study was conducted at the Hepatogastroenterology Unit of the Sindh Institute of Urology and Transplantation, Karachi.

The diagnostic accuracy of SWE was 92.11%, the specificity was 98.7%, and the PPV was 97.4%. However, sensitivity showed a progressive decline with advancing fibrosis stages from 89.8% for F1 to 60% for F4. These findings emphasize the potential of SWE as a non-invasive diagnostic modality and highlight some challenges in the detection of advanced fibrosis.</p><p>Our findings are in concordance with previous reports on the efficacy of SWE in assessing liver fibrosis, especially due to chronic hepatitis B and C. Samir et al. reported the high diagnostic accuracy of SWE when staging for fibrosis &#x02265;F2. However, they also documented an overall reduced sensitivity at more advanced, cirrhotic stages, as evident in our findings [<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Such similarities lead us to believe that the performance of SWE may share some common limitations in different chronic liver diseases regarding the identification of severe fibrosis. Zeng J et al., in their study of autoimmune liver diseases, emphasized the role of SWE in reducing dependence on liver biopsy and observed that the overall accuracy was more than 80% with excellent sensitivity in predicting different stages of liver fibrosis [<xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However, our study predicted a higher diagnostic accuracy of over 90% in predicting advanced liver fibrosis in patients with AIH. The discrepancy may be due to differences in patient groups or study techniques.</p><p>Serum biomarkers, including AST and ALT, normally used for assessing fibrosis, have always shown limited sensitivity and specificity, especially in AIH [<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="REF14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. This deficiency underlines the superiority of the imaging modality represented by SWE, which is a quantitative real-time technique for measuring liver stiffness. The strong correlation in this study between SWE-derived values of stiffness and biopsy-confirmed fibrosis stages further validates its diagnostic utility.</p><p>The high specificity of SWE, especially for the detection of F1-F2 fibrosis, is indicative of its high efficiency in excluding significant fibrosis among AIH patients, thus preventing these patients from undergoing invasive liver biopsies associated with risks for bleeding, pain, or infection [<xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. It also provides a reliable method for staging early fibrosis and can lead to timely intervention that may prevent disease progression.</p><p>Our study demonstrated a strong association of advanced liver fibrosis with female gender, increasing age, and high serological markers represented by elevated bilirubin, ANA, and ASMA titer. These results also correspond to the already-accepted epidemiology regarding AIH, where it predominantly presents among females and often has significantly enhanced autoantibody activities [<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="REF14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>High serum IgG levels, typical for AIH, in this study, were significantly associated with severe fibrosis. The correlation of IgG with disease severity is in line with previous studies indicating that IgG may serve as a biomarker for disease severity [<xref rid="REF15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The significant association of autoantibody titers with the progression of fibrosis further underlines the diagnostic and prognostic value of serological markers in the management of AIH [<xref rid="REF16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="REF17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>This study has several limitations. First, the retrospective nature of the study increases the possibility of selection bias and incomplete data, which might impact the findings and observations of this study. Second, the single-center design of this study may limit the general application of these results to a wide and diverse population. Third, although this study established the effectiveness of SWE, it did not make extensive comparisons of SWE with other non-invasive modalities or composite fibrosis scores that might place the modality in its rightful position of relative diagnostic performance.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study highlights the diagnostic value of SWE as a non-invasive and reliable method for assessing liver fibrosis in patients with AIH. The high specificity and overall excellent diagnostic accuracy, particularly for early stages of fibrosis, represent an added value with respect to liver biopsy. On the other hand, limitations of sensitivity in advanced fibrosis highlight the need for complementary approaches in severe cases. SWE has the potential to minimize the dependency on invasive procedures, thus improving patient outcomes and streamlining clinical workflows for optimized resource utilization in AIH management.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group content-type="conflict"><title>Disclosures</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Human subjects:</bold> Consent for treatment and open access publication was obtained or waived by all participants in this study.
