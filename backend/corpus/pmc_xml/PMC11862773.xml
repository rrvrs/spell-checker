While many studies have identified strong associations between specific SDoH and health outcomes, most people experience multiple SDoH concurrently in their daily lives [<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>-<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. For example, limited access to education, unstable employment, and lack of access to health care tend to frequently co-occur across individuals, leading to long-term stress and depression [<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Such complex interactions among multiple SDoH make it critical to analyze combinations of SDoH versus single factors. However, analysis of such co-occurrences and their risks of adverse health outcomes requires the integration of personal, clinical, social, and environmental information, critical for designing cost-effective and targeted interventions. Unfortunately, the lack of databases containing such multiple datatypes from the same individuals has resulted in a fragmented understanding of how SDoH co-occur and impact health, which is critical for designing targeted interventions.</p><p>The <italic>All of Us</italic> program [<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>-<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] provides an unprecedented opportunity to address this fragmented view of SDoH. This program aims to collect data from multiple sources related to 1 million or more individuals, with a focus on populations that have been traditionally underrepresented in biomedical research. These data sources include electronic health records (EHRs), health surveys, whole-sequence genome data, physical measurements, and personal digital information. Critically, <italic>All of Us</italic> provides several survey modules containing a wide range of SDoH-related questions, which, in combination with other data sources, could transform our understanding of high-risk combinations of SDoH [<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>However, little is known about the range of and responses to SDoH questions in <italic>All of Us</italic> and how they co-occur to form subtypes, which are critical for designing targeted interventions. To address these gaps, we characterized 110 SDoH in <italic>All of Us</italic>, which guided the methods we used to analyze how they co-occur to form subtypes and their risk of adverse health outcomes. The results helped highlight the opportunities and challenges for conducting subtype analysis in <italic>All of Us</italic>, which integrates multiple datatypes through the use of scalable and generalizable machine learning methods aimed at designing targeted interventions.</p></sec><sec><title>Models and Research Related to SDoH</title><p>The World Health Organization defines SDoH as the &#x0201c;non-medical factors that influence health outcomes&#x0201d; [<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Specifically, these include the conditions in which people are born, grow, work, live, and age. Furthermore, such conditions are shaped by a wider set of forces, such as economic and social policies, and systems, such as discriminatory laws and structural racism.</p><p>Several models have proposed the factors and mechanisms involved in SDoH [<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. These models were motivated by the concept of <italic>social gradient</italic> [<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], an empirical phenomenon observed within and across nations [<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] consistently showing that the lower an individual&#x02019;s socioeconomic position, the worse their health. To help explain the factors underlying the social gradient, the model by Dahlgren and Whitehead [<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] proposed several interconnected layers of social determinants that influence health. As shown in <xref rid="figure1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> [<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], the innermost layer comprises demographic and genetic factors, which are largely unmodifiable. In contrast, the outer layers are modifiable to different degrees, such as lifestyle (eg, exercise and smoking); social and community networks (eg, contact with supportive friends and family); living and working conditions (eg, access to health care and employment); and broader socioeconomic, cultural, and environmental conditions (eg, crime in the neighborhood). While this model was not intended to provide explicit testable hypotheses [<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], the factors within each layer are expected to co-occur and impact each other in addition to responding to external forces such as systemic racism and capitalism when it is focused on financial profits at the expense of societal benefits.</p><fig position="float" id="figure1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>The Dahlgren-Whitehead conceptual model aimed at visually showing the interrelated layers of social determinant of health domains that influence health (reproduced from Dahlgren and Whitehead, 2021).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jmir_v27i1e48775_fig1" position="float"/></fig><p>These early SDoH models motivated numerous studies [<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] that analyzed associations among specific SDoH (eg, immigration status and home density [<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]), their association with health outcomes (eg, education and mortality [<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]), and how they manifest within subpopulations (eg, patients with diabetes [<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]). More recently, organizations such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and <italic>Healthy People 2030</italic> (HP-30) have classified these empirical results into SDoH domains that roughly map to the Dahlgren-Whitehead model. For example, HP-30 organized SDoH empirical studies into five SDoH domains: (1) economic stability, (2) education access and quality, (3) health care access and quality, (4) neighborhood and built environment, and (5) social and community context. Furthermore, the PhenX program (which provides well-established measurement protocols for use in biomedical and translational research) has identified SDoH data collection protocols to enable more systematic data collection and analysis [<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>-<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>While the aforementioned findings and categorizations have greatly improved our understanding of SDoH and their impact on health, they have been mostly analyzed based on snapshots of associations between a few factors and health outcomes. In contrast, SDoH models and recent empirical studies suggest that multiple SDoH tend to co-occur and impact each other. For example, during the pandemic, Hispanic and Black or African American individuals not only had a higher exposure to COVID-19 due to their frontline jobs and overcrowded living conditions but also had a higher risk of serious infections due to previous health conditions not addressed due to lack of health care access [<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Similarly, undocumented immigrants with lower incomes living in neighborhoods with high pollution, combined with the stress of deportation, have an increased risk of multiple chronic conditions such as depression and lung cancer [<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Such studies have resulted in the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services emphasizing that SDoH are a multilevel construct that includes both individual and contextual factors that have complex interactions [<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Furthermore, a distinction has been made between the aforementioned SDoH at the community level and social needs at the individual level [<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. However, while this distinction is critical when designing care pathways, there is growing consensus [<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] that SDoH is an umbrella term that covers both levels, and it is an approach that has been adopted by both the PhenX Toolkit [<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and the <italic>All of Us</italic> surveys on SDoH widely used for analysis [<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>-<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Therefore, we use <italic>SDoH</italic> to include all levels of nonmedical factors that impact health and well-being.</p><p>The aforementioned co-occurrences of multiple SDoH and their impact on health directly reflect the interconnected layers of the Dahlgren-Whitehead model shown in <xref rid="figure1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>. However, analysis of such co-occurrences and their health outcomes requires large datasets with multiple datatypes that have only recently been made available through the <italic>All of Us</italic> program.</p></sec><sec><title>All of Us: Multiple Datatypes Across a Large Cohort of Underrepresented Americans</title><p>The <italic>All of Us</italic> research program [<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>-<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] (<italic>All of Us</italic>), funded by the National Institutes of Health since 2015, aims to accelerate biomedical research to enable discoveries leading to individualized and equitable prevention and treatment. Such research is currently hampered due to the <italic>limited range</italic> of personal, clinical, social, and environmental variables available for the same individuals; <italic>limited representation</italic> in research datasets of socially marginalized populations; and <italic>limited access</italic> to individual-level data due to privacy laws.</p><p>To overcome these hurdles, <italic>All of Us</italic> provides three critical features: (1) a data repository that is projected to contain 1 million or more participants with data from multiple sources, including EHRs, health surveys, whole-sequence genomic data, physical measurements, and personal digital information such as from Fitbit trackers; (2) a cohort targeted to include 75% of participants from populations underrepresented in research (race, ethnicity, gender, sex, sexual orientation, and disability) oversampled from the US population; and (3) strictly enforced rules to prevent reidentification of participants by disallowing the download of any participant data or reporting of research results for subgroups of &#x0003c;20. These rules allow for analysis of the <italic>All of Us</italic> data to be categorized as non&#x02013;human subjects research, which, combined with training and personal authentication by researchers, has resulted in a substantial reduction in administrative hurdles.</p><p>As of December 30, 2022 (Controlled Tier; version 6), <italic>All of Us</italic> contained 372,397 total participants, with 8.6% who had attempted all 9 health surveys (7 related to demographics and general health and 2 related to COVID-19) and 26.5% who had genomic data. Critical to this study is the recent addition of a survey specifically targeted to SDoH questions, which has been attempted by 15.5% in the <italic>All of Us</italic> cohort. A preliminary analysis revealed that SDoH appear to be distributed across multiple health surveys and EHR codes, with participants providing those data at different times on a rolling basis. However, little is known about the range of and responses to SDoH questions in <italic>All of Us</italic> and how SDoH co-occur to form subtypes, a critical step for selecting the methods to identify and interpret SDoH subtypes.</p></sec><sec><title>Computational Methods to Identify and Interpret Subtypes</title><p>A wide range of studies [<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>-<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] on topics ranging from molecular to environmental determinants of health have shown that most humans tend to share a subset of characteristics (eg, comorbidities, symptoms, and genetic variants), forming distinct subtypes (also referred to as <italic>subgroups</italic> or <italic>subphenotypes</italic> depending on the condition and variables analyzed). A primary goal of precision medicine is to identify such subtypes and infer their underlying disease processes to design interventions targeted to those processes [<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Methods to identify subtypes include (1) investigator-selected variables such as race for developing hierarchical regression models [<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] or assigning patients to different arms of a clinical trial, (2) existing classification systems such as the Medicare Severity Diagnosis Related Group [<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] to assign patients to a disease category for purposes of billing, and (3) computational methods such as classification [<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>-<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] and clustering [<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] to discover subtypes.</p><p>Several studies have used computational methods to identify subtypes, each with critical trade-offs. Some studies have used <italic>combinatorial</italic> approaches [<xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] (eg, identify all pairs, all triples, and so on), which are intuitive but which can lead to a combinatorial explosion (eg, enumerating combinations of the 31 Elixhauser comorbidities would lead to 2<sup>31</sup> or 2,147,483,648 combinations), with most combinations not incorporating the full range of symptoms (eg, the most frequent pair of symptoms ignores what other symptoms exist in the profile of patients with that pair). Other studies have used <italic>unipartite</italic> clustering methods [<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] (clustering patients or comorbidities but not both together), such as k-means and hierarchical clustering, and dimensionality reduction methods, such as principal component analysis, to help identify clusters of frequently co-occurring comorbidities [<xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>-<xref rid="ref48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. However, such methods have well-known limitations, including the requirement of inputting user-selected parameters (eg, similarity measures and the number of expected clusters) in addition to the lack of a quantitative measure to describe the quality of the clustering (critical for measuring the statistical significance of the clustering). Furthermore, because these methods are unipartite, there is no agreed-upon method to identify the patient subgroup defined by a cluster of variables, and vice versa.</p><p>More recently, bipartite network analysis [<xref rid="ref49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] (see <xref rid="app1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Multimedia Appendix 1</xref> [<xref rid="ref48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="ref50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>-<xref rid="ref55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] for additional details) has been used to address the aforementioned limitations by automatically identifying <italic>biclusters</italic> consisting of patients and characteristics simultaneously. This method takes as input any dataset, such as <italic>All of Us</italic> participants and their SDoH, and outputs a quantitative and visual description of biclusters (containing both participant subgroups and their frequently co-occurring SDoH). The quantitative output generates the number and members of the biclusters, in addition to the statistical significance of the biclusteredness [<xref rid="ref50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>-<xref rid="ref52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], and the visual output displays the quantitative information of the biclusters through a network visualization [<xref rid="ref53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>-<xref rid="ref55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Therefore, bipartite network analysis enables (1) the automatic identification of biclusters and the significance of their biclusteredness and (2) the visualization of the biclusters critical for their clinical interpretability. Furthermore, the attributes of participants in a subgroup can be used to measure the subgroup risk of an adverse health outcome, develop classifiers for categorizing a new participant into one or more of the subgroups, and develop a predictive model that uses that subgroup membership for measuring the risk of an adverse health outcome for the classified participant.</p><p>However, while several studies [<xref rid="ref52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="ref56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>-<xref rid="ref63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>] have demonstrated the usefulness of bipartite networks for the identification and clinical interpretation of subgroups, there has been no systematic attempt to identify SDoH subtypes, mainly because of the lack of large cohorts containing a wide coverage of SDoH. The <italic>All of Us</italic> program provides an opportunity to use bipartite networks for the identification and interpretation of SDoH subtypes using a wide range of variables in a large cohort and for analyzing their risk of adverse health outcomes, a critical step in advancing precision medicine.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Research Questions</title><p>Our analysis was guided by two research questions targeting the <italic>All of Us</italic> dataset:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>What are the range of and responses to survey questions related to SDoH?</p></list-item><list-item><p>How do SDoH co-occur to form subtypes, and what are their risks for adverse health outcomes?</p></list-item></list></sec><sec><title>Expert Panel</title><p>The selection of the research questions, variables, cohort, methods, and results and their interpretation were guided by an expert panel consisting of SDoH researchers with a professional background in applied demography, gerontology, and rehabilitation who worked closely with the machine learning and biostatistics researchers.

As the questions with a finer level of granularity tend to be more strongly corelated to each other in comparison to other coarser-grained questions, they also tend to cluster together more strongly, confounding the interpretation of the subtypes.

To adjust the demographic distribution of the cohort to match the full <italic>All of Us</italic> cohort, we used inverse probability weighting (IPW) [<xref rid="ref73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>,<xref rid="ref74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>].

The consistent &#x0201c;book ends&#x0201d; result where Cluster 1 had significantly higher ORs than Cluster 4 across all 4 variables was of strong interest and interpreted as follows: (1) Cluster 1 was labeled <italic>Socioeconomic barriers</italic> as it comprised multiple high-risk SDoH. These co-occurring SDoH could have resulted from cascades over time, such as low educational attainment, potentially leading to lower rates of employment and lower income with higher rates of food and housing insecurity. Such cascading factors can be perceived as being relatively unmodifiable, leading to a higher risk of chronic stress and depression. Furthermore, the strong association of this subtype with the outcomes <italic>Delayed medical care</italic> and <italic>ER visits in the last tear</italic> and the fact that participants in this subtype were more likely to be from a US state with <italic>No Medicaid expansion</italic> provided a more comprehensive understanding of this high-risk SDoH subtype; (2) Cluster 4 was labeled <italic>Sociocultural barriers</italic> as it contained a combination of SDoH related to disadvantaged neighborhood characteristics and low supportive relations in addition to language barriers and mismatched provider interactions. In contrast to the socioeconomic barriers in Cluster 1, many of the sociocultural barriers could be perceived as potentially modifiable, resulting in a lower risk of depression, delayed medical care, and ER visits. Participants who matched this profile could be screened for language and communication barriers, useful for providing culturally competent care, identifying providers who better match the profile of the individuals, and providing resources to facilitate contact with matching nationality or cultural groups in the vicinity or on the web.</p><p>While Clusters 1 and 4 formed the &#x0201c;book ends&#x0201d; of risk across the 3 outcomes, potentially caused by relative differences in the unmodifiability of their frequently co-occurring SDoH, Cluster 2 was flagged as critical and labeled <italic>Lived experience barriers</italic>. The SDoH in this cluster included discriminatory experiences in everyday life and in medical settings in addition to poor interactions with providers and difficulty affording medical care. These frequently co-occurring SDoH could explain why this subtype had a significantly higher OR for <italic>Delayed medical care</italic> than Cluster 1. Finally, Cluster 3 was labeled <italic>Social context barriers</italic> as the SDoH were related to poor neighborhood cohesion and relationships with others. While not as critical as Clusters 1 and 2, this cluster still had a significantly higher OR for Depression than Cluster 4. Together, the 4 clusters could explain how different degrees of unmodifiability in frequently co-occurring SDoH might impact health outcomes.</p><p>The expert panel and the ethicist concluded that clinicians treating patients who match each subtype profile could be alerted of specific risks and, consequently, motivate a discussion about mental health and consequences of delayed medical care with the goal of collaboratively exploring options and solutions with the patients. The results could also be useful for resource planning in hospitals to ensure that there is adequate staff to address the needs of the populations they serve, and for proposing health care policies to address the critical connection between specific combinations of SDoH and their impact on public health. For example, many health equity policies categorize Americans based on sociodemographic variables like race and income, which are proxies of need rather than the needs themselves. Instead, such policies could categorize Americans based on SDoH subtypes and their risks to more precisely allocate resources based on combinations of real-world needs.</p><p>Furthermore, the subtypes did not have a one-to-one mapping to the 5 SDoH domains defined by HP-30. As shown in <xref rid="figure8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>, these data-driven clusters have a complex relationship with the SDoH domains and factors. While one subtype belonged to a single domain (the <italic>Social context</italic> subtype belonged to the <italic>Social and community context</italic> domain), 3 of the 4 subtypes belonged to &#x02265;2 domains (eg, the <italic>Socioeconomic barriers</italic> subtype belonged to the <italic>Economic stability</italic> and <italic>Education access and quality</italic> domains). Such interdomain relationships reflect how SDoH co-occur in the real world, reflecting the complex cross-domain interactions described in the Dahlgren-Whitehead model (<xref rid="figure1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). These relationships could be useful for refining conceptual models to explain the complex association between SDoH and adverse health outcomes and build more accurate SDoH models for predicting adverse health outcomes.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec><title>Principal Findings</title><p>The mechanisms through which SDoH precipitate adverse health outcomes are complex, consisting of many interacting factors and feedback loops among individual and environmental and contextual factors. While this phenomenon has been studied for &#x0003e;3 decades, critical hurdles for researchers have included the <italic>limited range</italic> of datatypes, <italic>limited representation</italic> of populations that have been socially marginalized, and <italic>limited access</italic> to individual-level data at scale due to privacy laws. Recognizing that <italic>All of Us</italic> has well-articulated plans and resources to overcome these limitations but is still in a rapidly evolving stage, we conducted a systematic characterization of &#x0003e;100 SDoH survey questions available in <italic>All of Us</italic> and used them to identify SDoH subtypes with the future goal of designing targeted interventions.</p><p>For question 1, we identified 110 SDoH questions across 4 surveys, which covered all 5 domains in HP-30. However, the results also revealed a large degree of missingness in survey responses (1.76%-84.56%), with later surveys having significantly fewer responses than earlier ones, and significant differences in race, ethnicity, and age of participants among those who completed the surveys with SDoH questions compared to those in the full <italic>All of Us</italic> dataset. Furthermore, as the SDoH questions varied in granularity, they were categorized by an expert panel into 18 SDoH factors. For question 2, the subtype analysis identified 4 biclusters with significant biclusteredness and significant replication. Furthermore, there were statistically significant associations between specific subtypes and the outcomes, as well as with Medicaid expansion, each with meaningful interpretations and potential targeted interventions. Finally, the identified subtypes spanned one or more HP-30 domains, revealing the difference between the current knowledge-based SDoH domains and the data-driven subtypes.</p><p>While the results revealed the nature of and responses to SDoH questions in <italic>All of Us</italic> and significant and interpretable SDoH subtypes, the analysis revealed critical opportunities and challenges related to data, methods, and theory. Such insights are useful for future researchers conducting similar analyses on <italic>All of Us</italic> and, therefore, are discussed in the following sections.</p></sec><sec><title>Data: Missingness and Granularity</title><sec><title>Missingness</title><p>The analysis revealed 3 types of missingness. The first was <italic>rollout missingness</italic>. This type of missingness was largely dictated by how the surveys were rolled out to participants. As all participants at enrollment are required to do <italic>The Basics</italic> and <italic>Overall Health</italic> surveys, these surveys had the highest number of responses, followed by the later solicited <italic>Healthcare Access and Utilization</italic> and <italic>SDoH</italic> surveys rolled out more recently in 2022. This order of rollout was the main source of missingness, resulting in a precipitous reduction in cohort size for those who had answers to all the SDoH questions. The second type was <italic>valid answer missingness</italic>. As participants can choose not to answer any survey questions, the data contained &#x0201c;skip&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;choose not to answer&#x0201d; responses. However, these responses accounted for a much smaller reduction in cohort size for complete data than rollout missingness. The third type was <italic>low use missingness</italic>. Although there were 259 SDoH SNOMED codes, only 93 (35.9%) had such information for &#x0003e;20 participants that are allowed to be reported. This could be because most clinicians currently do not screen for SDoH as it is typically done by a social worker. Furthermore, we also attempted to use 3-digit zip codes to determine which subtypes had a significant association with living in a state that did not offer Medicaid expansion. However, 13.07% (1688/12,913) of the participants did not have zip code information (which was adjusted by using IPW).</p><p>Together, the aforementioned 3 types of missingness impacted the size of the resulting cohort that had valid answers in the following 2 ways, which is the minimum number of participants that are allowed to be reported by <italic>All of Us</italic>. First, there was a drastic reduction in cohort size by 93.5%. However, because of the size of the overall dataset (N=372,397), we were still left with a large cohort (n=12,886), which, to the best of our knowledge, is the largest set of individuals to be analyzed for such a wide range of SDoH. Second, there were significant differences in the proportion of race, ethnicity, and age in the aforementioned cohort when compared to the overall <italic>All of Us</italic> population. Specifically, the cohort with valid answers had significantly more White, non-Hispanic, or older participants when compared to the overall cohort. This could potentially be because, once a participant has been enrolled, there is a 90-day delay in sending subsequent solicitations to complete surveys, a policy that is currently being reassessed due to its impact on missingness. Therefore, we had to correct this imbalance in demographic proportions by using IPW with the goal of identifying subtypes that were representative of the overall <italic>All of Us</italic> cohort.</p></sec><sec><title>Granularity</title><p>Because our goal was to use machine learning methods to identify SDoH subtypes, we encountered uneven granularity in the SDoH questions. Some questions were fine grained and highly correlated and, therefore, would cluster more strongly because of the nature of the granularity of the questions, not because of the SDoH mechanisms. To address this uneven granularity and make the results more interpretable, we used SDoH factors that had a coarser but more consistent level of granularity. We chose this approach because SDoH factors had already been defined; were understood by the expert panel, enabling high domain fidelity; and appeared to be at the right level of abstraction useful for clinical applications, such as referring a patient to the appropriate social services. However, because the use of coarse-grained variables loses information, future research could explore aggregating only those SDoH questions that are highly correlated while preserving the rest at the finer level of granularity and explore computational methods to merge SDoH questions into SDoH factors.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Method: Scalability, Generalizability, and Extensibility</title><p>We designed the HIT analytical framework to be scalable, enabling its use for the growing size of the data in <italic>All of Us</italic>; generalizable across cohorts and conditions; and extensible for including additional methods as needed in the future. Testing the HIT framework on the <italic>All of Us</italic> dataset provided insights into the strengths and limitations of the framework and the <italic>All of Us</italic> workbench where the analysis was conducted.</p><sec><title>Scalability</title><p>We used 3 types of code to conduct the analysis for both research questions. The first was automatically generated code to extract the cohort, produced by <italic>All of Us</italic> once a cohort was selected using the point-and-click interface. This code was adequately scalable and generalizable and so will not be discussed further. The second was customized code to extract specific parts of the data. For example, the analysis of co-occurrences required customized code in R (R Foundation for Statistical Computing) to plot the diagrams in <xref rid="figure4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>&#x02013;6. As expected, these tasks required strong programming skills, but fortunately, we did not encounter any coding or execution problems using the R or Python (Python Software Foundation) programming languages. However, there were significant server issues that hampered our analysis. Although the workbench instructions stated that code running on the workbench for &#x0003e;2 weeks would be terminated and all intermediate results would be deleted, we frequently encountered our work disappearing at shorter intervals. These disruptions resulted in a higher consumption of the free server time credits resulting in fewer analyses that could be conducted. The third type of code was machine learning code that we had previously developed and disseminated on Comprehensive R Archive Network [<xref rid="ref78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>-<xref rid="ref80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>] to conduct the bipartite network analysis and the significance testing and visualize the network. As this code was designed to be generalizable and scalable, we did not encounter any issues in the execution of our code (in addition to the same server issues mentioned previously). Finally, the visualization of our networks worked as expected, and we used them to help interpret the patterns in the data.</p></sec><sec><title>Generalizability</title><p>Our code for the first 2 steps of the HIT framework is in Project Jupyter notebooks and has been used to analyze other cohorts that were filtered for age and previous conditions. For example, we extracted a cohort (n=4090) of participants with diabetes aged &#x02265;65 years with complete data on 18 SDoH variables selected through consensus by 2 experienced health services researchers and guided by the Andersen behavioral model. The analysis [<xref rid="ref81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>,<xref rid="ref82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>] revealed 7 SDoH subtypes with statistically significant modularity compared with 100 random permutations of the data (<italic>All of Us</italic>=0.51; random mean 0.38 SD 0.0065; <italic>z</italic>=20; <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;.001) and that were not only clinically meaningful but also significant in different degrees for the outcome. Our subsequent attempt at increasing the number of SDoH variables from 18 to 110 for participants with diabetes who had valid answers led to an extremely small cohort size (n=926; <xref rid="app5" ref-type="supplementary-material">Multimedia Appendix 5</xref>) due to the missingness that we described previously. While this reduction resulted in our current strategy of analyzing all participants regardless of condition or age, these experiments demonstrate that our approach is generalizable to other subsets of the data.</p></sec><sec><title>Extensibility</title><p>The HIT model is designed to be extensible to include other methods. For example, the model could use other biclustering (eg, nonnegative matrix factorization [<xref rid="ref83" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]) and causal modeling methods and different types of classification (eg, deep learning [<xref rid="ref84" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]) and prediction methods (eg, subgroup-specific modeling [<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]) to build the decision support system in the translational step (<xref rid="figure2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). Furthermore, the model can integrate a wide range of datatypes to enable analysis of how each subtype is associated with them, resulting in a layered interpretation of the SDoH subtypes, as we have demonstrated. For example, as the percentage of participants who have genomic information increases (currently, &#x0003e;25% of our cohort have missing genomic information), our pipeline will be able to integrate such information into our analysis. Finally, the integration of different datatypes required a diverse team consisting of experts in machine learning, biostatistics, programming, clinical care, health services research, gerontology, and ethics to enable a 360&#x000b0; analysis and interpretation of the subtypes that was, therefore, aligned with the human-centered artificial intelligence approach [<xref rid="ref64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>-<xref rid="ref66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Furthermore, the use of the workbench to share results through visualizations operationalized <italic>team-centered informatics</italic> [<xref rid="ref85" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>] designed to facilitate multidisciplinary translational teams [<xref rid="ref86" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>] working more effectively across disciplinary boundaries with the goal of analyzing subtypes and designing targeted interventions.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Theory: Model Building and Translational Implications</title><p>The identification of SDoH subtypes has strong implications for model building in addition to translational applications. As shown in <xref rid="figure8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>, while the current classification of 5 SDoH domains has a hierarchical relationship with the SDoH factors, the data-driven clusters have a more complex association with the same SDoH factors. This reflects the complexity of how SDoH occur in the real world while at the same time being interpretable for purposes of translation.</p><p>Future studies should develop prediction models using the data-driven subtypes to determine whether they improve the accuracy of predicting adverse health outcomes when compared to models that do not use those subtypes. Because the subtypes were clinically interpretable, they could be used to build classification and prediction models and used with an interface to develop a clinical decision support system that helps triage patients to critical services. For example, the St Vincent&#x02019;s House [<xref rid="ref87" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>] in Galveston, Texas, United States, provides several services to address SDoH, including free walk-in clinical care, nurse practitioners with reduced insurance co-payments, English- and Spanish-speaking free mental health counseling, free dental health clinic, utility and rental assistance, case management, financial literacy, expanded food pantry, weekly free home delivery of pantry groceries, snack pack for people experiencing homelessness, free transportation to clinician&#x02019;s appointments, immigration legal services, and spiritual counseling. Given the availability of this wide range of services in many communities across the United States, a decision support system could help classify an individual based on their SDoH profile into one or more of the subtypes and measure their risk of an adverse health outcome. Such information could be used by clinicians to collaboratively explore solutions with the patient to consider one or more of such local services based on the membership strength to a subtype and the associated risk (<xref rid="figure2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>, step 3). At a population level, understanding health risks associated with clusters may assist institutions and organizations in developing more effective prevention programs.</p></sec><sec><title>Notebooks for <italic>All of Us</italic> Community Use</title><p>Because the missingness in SDoH variables is expected to decrease, their characterization and subtyping will need to be repeated and verified for different cohorts. Therefore, we have made the following 2 sets of code available for general use by the <italic>All of Us</italic> researcher community (accessible after creating a free account on <italic>All of Us</italic> and completing the required training).</p><sec><title>SDoH Valid Answer Tracker</title><p>This set of notebooks generates four plots that can be used by other researchers on <italic>All of Us</italic> to characterize any cohort: (1) valid response plot to show how many participants have data with valid responses and colored by SDoH domain, (2) Venn diagram showing how many participants have valid responses for all questions within each survey, and (3) frequency distribution plot showing co-occurrence of SDoH across the selected cohort. This set of tools should enable researchers to characterize SDoH across different cohorts to help determine methods that are appropriate to adjust for missingness in those cohorts.</p></sec><sec><title>SDoH Subtyper</title><p>This set of notebooks can be used to conduct the following analyses: (1) bicluster modularity of a cohort with the 18 SDoH factors to identify the number and members of biclusters and the measure <italic>Q</italic> representing the quality of the biclustering, (2) visualization of the bipartite network, and (3) significance of the network with respect to null models.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>This study has 2 main limitations. The first emerges from the large amount of missingness in the survey data, precluding the use of imputation methods that assume a random distribution of missingness. Therefore, we could use only complete data, which led to a large drop in cohort size and which also introduced a bias in the demographics requiring a rebalancing through IPW. While such rebalancing is typically done for large datasets, the IPW method requires judgment to decide which variables to include in the model and, therefore, could have introduced additional unknown biases. Therefore, the model should be refined to determine which variables to include in the regression models that estimate the IPW-generated weights. However, because the clustering was similar between the unweighted and IPW-weighted networks, we believe that the current subtypes are stable and meaningful and represent the demographic composition of the full <italic>All of Us</italic> dataset, but this needs to be verified by redoing the analysis as the data become more complete. The limitation of missingness in the surveys is expected to be addressed as <italic>All of Us</italic> has recently removed the requirement of waiting 90 days before a subsequent survey is given to an enrollee in the program, potentially reducing the degree of missingness. The second limitation is due to the high computational cost of empirically determining the significance of the biclustering. As such analysis is computationally expensive and time-consuming, it limited the experiments we could do to test different cohorts and models. Therefore, we look forward to the <italic>All of Us</italic> workbench providing the ability to run batch processes more efficiently and uninterruptedly for extended periods (exceeding the current time window), which together could help alleviate this computational hurdle in the future.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>How SDoH impact health is a complex phenomenon involving many interconnected social, biological, and environmental factors that have yet to be fully elucidated. While this phenomenon has been studied for &#x0003e;30 years, the analyses have been hampered by the lack of large cohorts representing diverse populations with a wide range of SDoH variables measured, multiple datatypes, and easy access by researchers. <italic>All of Us</italic> provides an unprecedented opportunity to directly address these limitations with the goal of doing justice to early conceptual models such as the social gradient and the Dahlgren-Whitehead model, both of which drew international attention to the complex ways in which individual and contextual SDoH factors impact health. The <italic>All of Us</italic> dataset is also timely because of the extensive health disparities that were revealed during the pandemic, which highlighted the critical need to address SDoH in the public and policy realms. However, because <italic>All of Us</italic> is still rapidly evolving to meet its target of 1 million participants or more, we conducted a systematic characterization of SDoH variables in <italic>All of Us</italic> and used the results to guide the analysis of SDoH subtypes. The identified subtypes, along with their risks, could be used to design data-informed interventions, resource-planning strategies, and public health policies aimed at reducing the risks of adverse health outcomes. However, careful consideration would be required to ensure that the identification of high-risk subtypes is not used in a way that stigmatizes subpopulations.</p><p>Our first goal of characterizing the data revealed the nature of the missingness in SDoH and the uneven granularity in the SDoH questions. Both of these results led us to select the IPW method to address the missingness and to analyze subtypes using SDoH factors to address the uneven granularity. Our second goal of identifying SDoH subtypes led not only to statistically significant biclusteredness but also to their statistically significant replication and meaningful domain interpretations. These results set the stage for further investigations to build and evaluate classification and prediction models for designing decision support systems that alert clinicians of specific risks that their patients face due to a combination of SDoH factors. Furthermore, the SDoH subtypes could be used to design public health care policies that are multifactorial and need based, enabling more targeted interventions compared to policies that are based on a few sociodemographic factors such as race and income.</p><p>The results also led to the design, use, and dissemination of general-purpose tools currently available on <italic>All of Us</italic> for other researchers, which will be useful to reanalyze the <italic>All of Us</italic> dataset as it grows over the next few years to directly address the high rate of missingness. These collaborative advances should position <italic>All of Us</italic> to revolutionize research for analyzing complex phenomena such as how SDoH impact health and beyond, with the goal of enabling a more equitable future that all of us deserve.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank Gautam Vallabha, PhD, for his assistance in refining the analysis and the manuscript.
