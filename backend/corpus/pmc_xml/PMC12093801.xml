However, the roles and regulatory mechanisms of circRNAs during influenza A virus (IAV) infection remain largely unexplored. In this study, we screened the circRNA transcription profiles of WSN-infected cells to identify circRNAs involved in viral replication and identified a novel differentially expressed circular RNA, circMYO9A. Mechanistically, circMYO9A acts as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) for SERPINE1/PAI-1 by sponging miR-6059-3p, thereby increasing SERPINE1/PAI-1 expression, which restricts IAV haemagglutinin cleavage and subsequently reduces the infectivity of progeny viruses. Importantly, our findings demonstrate that circMYO9A significantly inhibits viral replication in the lungs of infected mice, potentially increasing their survival during IAV infection. These results demonstrate that circRNAs play crucial roles in inhibiting IAV replication and provide novel insights into potential therapeutic strategies involving circRNAs.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><title>KEYWORDS</title><kwd>Influenza virus</kwd><kwd>circMYO9A</kwd><kwd>SERPINE1</kwd><kwd>CeRNA</kwd><kwd>haemagglutinin cleavage</kwd></kwd-group><support-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>

Owing to the absence of RNA ends, circRNAs exhibit resistance to cellular exoribonucleases and are thus extremely stable. Previously, circRNAs were thought to be byproducts of unusual splicing with no function or minute functional activity. However, owing to rapid progress in the fields of high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and circRNA-specific computational biology, a wide array of circRNAs have been reported in eukaryotes, and their functions are being explored [<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Although circRNAs are single-stranded RNAs, they vary from linear RNAs because they are closed covalently, which endows circRNAs with fascinating properties, such as parental gene modulation, protein complex scaffolding, microRNA (miRNA) or protein sponging, and RNA-protein interactions [<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Recent studies have shown that circRNAs participate in many physiological and pathological processes by regulating epigenetic modifications, gene transcription, alternative splicing, RNA stability, and protein translation and serve as new diagnostic and treatment strategies for disease [<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5&#x02013;7</xref>]. Nevertheless, compared with coding RNAs, miRNAs and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), there are still significant gaps in our understanding of circRNAs. The biological and molecular mechanisms of circRNAs in the development of various diseases are not yet fully understood. Further studies will reveal the functions of the vast majority of circRNAs in terms of both physiological and pathological processes.</p><p>Analysis of RNA-seq data obtained from cells infected with diverse viruses revealed changes in host circRNAs in response to viral infection [<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8&#x02013;10</xref>]. Increasing evidence suggests that circRNAs are involved in viral infection and progression through distinct mechanisms [<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11&#x02013;13</xref>]. A study by Li and colleagues revealed that NF90/NF110 in the nucleus promotes circRNA biogenesis and is often found in the circRNP complex; however, upon viral infection, NF90/NF110 is released from circRNP complexes and binds to viral RNAs, thereby inhibiting virus replication [<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. miRNA sponging is one of the well-established functions of circRNAs, where they can inhibit the function of miRNAs by binding target miRNAs directly or indirectly. Multiple reports have revealed various differentially expressed host circRNAs and established a circRNA-miRNA-mRNA regulatory network involved in immune responses to infections with multiple viruses, including Zika virus, Seneca virus A, influenza A virus, and coxsackievirus B3 [<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15&#x02013;18</xref>]. Owing to the absence of the 5&#x02019;cap and the poly(A) tail, circRNAs are unable to undergo cap-dependent translation. However, increasing evidence has demonstrated that some circRNAs can encode peptides through cap-independent translation mechanisms, including internal ribosome entry sites (IRESs) and N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modifications, such as circMORC3 and circEZH2, which further expands our understanding of their roles in immune responses [<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Increasing evidence indicates that circRNAs participate in innate and adaptive immunity. However, the underlying mechanisms of most circRNAs in virus infection remain largely unexplored. Analysing the relationship between circRNAs and viral infection will provide fresh insights into antiviral immunity, facilitating the development of potential therapeutics.</p><p>Influenza A viruses (IAVs), zoonotic pathogens that continuously circulate, pose serious burdens and threats to global public health [<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21&#x02013;23</xref>]. IAV belongs to the family Orthomyxoviridae and contains the envelope glycoproteins haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). The influenza virus haemagglutinin (HA) mediates the first essential step in the viral life cycle: virus entry into target cells [<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The HA protein binds sialic acid-terminating surface receptors and actively induces membrane fusion within endosomes during the process of viral entry [<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Influenza virus HA, which is synthesized as an uncleaved HA0 precursor in infected cells, is unable to cause membrane fusion and must first be cleaved by host cell proteases into a fusion-competent HA1/HA2 complex [<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. After virus budding and HA0 cleavage, an influenza virus is capable of infecting a new host cell. Analysis of RNA-seq data obtained from cells infected with IAV revealed that the expression levels of most circRNAs changed significantly after IAV infection [<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27&#x02013;29</xref>], but the role of circRNAs in IAV infection remains largely unexplored. According to recent studies, circRNAs have the potential to affect IAV replication. The upregulation of the circRNA AIVR by IAV inhibits viral replication by sponging miRNAs and promoting the expression of CREBBP to facilitate IFN-&#x003b2; production [<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. circVAMP3 serves as a decoy for the viral NP and NS1 proteins, which interfere with vRNP complex activity and inhibit the effect of NS1 on the RIG-I signalling pathway [<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. However, the biogenesis processes, underlying functions, and potential mechanisms of circRNAs in IAV infection remain elusive.</p><p>In this study, we screened the circRNA transcription profiles of WSN-infected cells and identified dysregulated circRNAs closely related to the pathogenic process of influenza virus. We determined that circMYO9A, whose expression was greatest upon IAV infection, inhibited IAV replication and revealed the underlying mechanism by which circMYO9A exerts its antiviral effects. Mechanistically, circMYO9A inhibits viral replication by sponging miR-6059-3p as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) for SERPINE1/PAI-1 and upregulating SERPINE1 expression, which restricts IAV haemagglutinin cleavage and subsequently reduces the maturation of progeny particles. Importantly, our findings demonstrate that circMYO9A significantly inhibits viral replication in a mouse model, potentially enhancing mouse survival during IAV infection. These results demonstrate that circRNAs play crucial roles in inhibiting IAV replication and provide novel insights into potential therapeutic strategies involving circRNAs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" disp-level="1" id="S002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec disp-level="2" id="S002-S2001"><title>Viruses</title><p>Influenza viruses A/WSN/33 (H1N1) and A/Hong Kong/1/68(H3N2) were grown on MDCK cells.

The expression patterns of these dysregulated circRNAs are shown in <xref rid="F0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>(B). A total of 1008 dysregulated circRNAs were identified in WSN-infected A549 cells, including 784 upregulated and 224 downregulated circRNAs.

These circRNAs were identified through transcriptome sequencing and bioinformatics analysis. To minimize false-positive data, four upregulated and two downregulated circRNAs, comprising three known circRNAs from circBase and three newly identified circRNAs, were selected for further validation. These circRNAs were validated by RT-qPCR and RT&#x02013;PCR (<xref rid="F0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>(C, E right panel)). RT-qPCR confirmed that the expression patterns of these six circRNAs were consistent with the RNA-seq results. Notably, circMYO9A (hsa_circ_0006509) was the most significantly upregulated circRNA upon IAV infection. To further confirm the presence of these circRNAs, divergent primers were designed for cDNA and genomic DNA (gDNA) PCR amplification (<xref rid="F0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>(E left panel)). Sanger sequencing validated the PCR product, confirming that the head-to-tail splice junction site was amplified by the divergent primers (<xref rid="F0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>(F)).

At an MOI of 3, the circMYO9A level slightly decreased compared with that at an MOI of 1, possibly due to reduced cell numbers following infection at high MOI.

Owing to the unique sequence characteristics of the circRNA splicing site, only one siRNA targeting the junction site of circMYO9A was designed. As shown in <xref rid="F0003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>(A), siRNA-mediated knockdown of circMYO9A decreased circMYO9A expression, but silencing circMYO9A did not significantly affect viral replication (<xref rid="F0003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>(B)). Given the low abundance of circMYO9A in uninfected A549 cells and its significant upregulation after viral infection, we constructed a plasmid to overexpress circMYO9A to explore its function further. The pcDNA-circMYO9A plasmid was successfully constructed and significantly increased circMYO9A levels compared with those in virus-stimulated A549 cells (<xref rid="F0003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>(C and H)). Since circRNAs are known to trigger immune responses [<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], we focused on the role of circMYO9A in regulating the expression of interferons (IFNs), ISGs, and inflammatory cytokines. As shown in <xref rid="F0003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>(D&#x02013;G), the overexpression of circMYO9A significantly increased the expression levels of the inflammatory cytokines TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-6, and IFN-&#x003b2; and the antiviral gene ISG15 after WSN infection. We subsequently assessed the effect of circMYO9A on IAV replication to understand its biological importance in the host response. The results revealed that circMYO9A overexpression significantly inhibited the replication of various IAV subtypes 24&#x02005;h after infection (<xref rid="F0003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>(I, J and K)). In summary, circMYO9A acts as a positive regulator of antiviral immunity, upregulating the expression of inflammatory cytokines and antiviral genes. The upregulation of circMYO9A in virus-infected cells is a host antiviral strategy against IAV infection.

Notably, bioinformatic analysis via IRES finder identified an IRES in circMYO9A, suggesting its potential to encode a protein. The cORF pipeline script was used to detect potential ORFs spanning the junction of the circRNA. A potential ORF in circMYO9A encoding a 305-amino acid protein (referred to as circMYO9A-305aa), which contains a novel sequence with 24 specific amino acids, was identified (<xref rid="F0004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>(A)). To investigate whether the putative ORF possesses antiviral activity, the full-length ORF of circMYO9A was cloned and inserted into the pcDNA3.1 vector. As shown in <xref rid="F0004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>(B), overexpression of the linear circMYO9A ORF significantly inhibited viral replication at 24&#x02005;h post-infection. While the linear ORF of circMYO9A inhibits IAV replication, further studies are needed to confirm that the 305aa peptides can be translated by circMYO9A. To verify the presence of a natural IRES in circMYO9A, which is required for cap-independent translation initiation, we conducted an IRES activity assay. As shown in <xref rid="F0004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>(C), both mCherry and EGFP were expressed with the putative IRES (173&#x02005;bp, spanning nucleotides 251 to 424 of circMYO9A), whereas EGFP expression was absent in the absence of the IRES, indicating that the IRES sequence in circMYO9A facilitates ribosome entry and translation initiation. To confirm the presence of circMYO9A-305aa, we constructed three flag-tagged vectors: Linear-ORF-FLAG (FLAG-tagged linear circMYO9A ORF), circMYO9A-FLAG (FLAG-tagged circMYO9A cloned and inserted into the pcDNA3.1 backbone as mentioned above), and circMYO9A-FLAG-mut (FLAG-tagged circMYO9A with a mutated start codon, ATG&#x02192;ACG) (<xref rid="F0004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>(D)). However, following transfection, the FLAG-tagged circMYO9A-305aa protein was detected at approximately 35&#x02005;kDa only in the linear ORF group via anti-Flag antibodies. These results collectively demonstrated that the IRES in circMYO9A mediate ribosome entry and can initiate translation. While the putative ORF inhibits IAV replication, circMYO9A does not encode a protein that exerts antiviral effects.

To this end, RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assays were performed to pull down RNA transcripts bound to Argonaute-2 (Ago2). After A549 cells were transfected with Ago2-Flag or pcDNA3.1-Flag, RIP assays revealed that circMYO9A could be pulled down by Ago2-Flag (<xref rid="F0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>(A)), suggesting that circMYO9A might have a binding site for miRNA. To identify miRNAs that interact with circMYO9A, we used miRNA target prediction tools such as TargetScan and miRanda and selected seven candidate miRNAs on the basis of overlap with the miRNA sequencing data (<xref rid="F0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>(B and C)) (all: the whole detected miRNAs in the miRNA-seq data; filter: the dysregulated miRNAs in the miRNA-seq data). The expression levels of these miRNAs were compared in A549 cells transfected with an overexpression plasmid (circMYO9A) or an empty vector (EV). Among the seven candidate miRNAs, hsa-miR-3180-5p, hsa-miR-6509-3p, hsa-miR-7974 and hsa-miR-485-5p were significantly reduced upon overexpression of circMYO9A (<xref rid="F0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>(D)). Next, to confirm the direct interaction between circMYO9A and these miRNAs, an RNA pulldown assay with a biotin-labelled circMYO9A probe was performed. The circMYO9A probe, which is specifically antisense to the spliced junction sequence, was conjugated with biotin to enrich both circMYO9A and its associated miRNAs. The results (<xref rid="F0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>(E)) confirmed that hsa-miR-3180-5p, hsa-miR-6509-3p, hsa-miR-7974 and hsa-miR-485-5p could be sponged by circMYO9A. To exclude the influence of non-specific factors and to assess the ability of these miRNAs to bind to circMYO9A, we subsequently cloned the linear sequence of circMYO9A into the pmirGLO luciferase reporter vector and transfected it with control mimics, hsa-miR-3180-5p, hsa-miR-6509-3p, hsa-miR-7974 and hsa-miR-485-5p mimics into 293T cells (<xref rid="F0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>(F)). Luciferase assays revealed that compared with NC-miR-transfected cells, cells transfected with these miRNAs presented significantly reduced luciferase activity (<xref rid="F0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>(G)). To investigate whether these four miRNAs affect IAV infection, we transfected A549 cells with each miRNA or an NC-miR, followed by WSN infection at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01. The results showed that hsa-miR-6509-3p mimics facilitate IAV replication, while the viral titres in the other three miRNA-transfected cell lines were similar to those in the NC-miR-transfected cells. These findings suggest that circMYO9A is able to regulate the expression and activity of these four miRNAs and that circMYO9A might function as a sponge of hsa-miR-6509-3p to inhibit viral replication.

A549 cells were subsequently transfected with miR-6509-3p or NC-miR, as well as with miR-6509-3p inhibitors or a control inhibitor (NC inhibitor), and then infected with WSN at an MOI of 0.01. As shown in <xref rid="F0006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>(B and C), the viral titres significantly increased in the miR-6509-3p-transfected group compared with those in the NC group. Conversely, viral titres were lower in the miR-6509-3p inhibitor-transfected group than in the NC inhibitor group. To determine whether the predicted miR-6509-3p binding site in circMYO9A was essential for its interaction, we constructed wild-type and mutated versions of the circMYO9A sequence (<xref rid="F0006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>(D)) and inserted them into the pmirGLO luciferase reporter vector. Luciferase assays revealed a decrease in activity in 293T cells transfected with the wild-type circMYO9A, but this reduction was not fully reversed after mutation at site 1. Furthermore, there was no significant difference between the site 1 and site 2 double mutants and the control, and this reduction was fully restored (<xref rid="F0006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>(E)). These findings suggest that circMYO9A contains two miR-6509-3p binding sites.

We hypothesized that circMYO9A inhibits IAV replication by sponging miRNAs. MiRNAs regulate the posttranscriptional expression of target mRNAs by binding to their 3&#x02019;UTRs. Using TargetScan and ENCORI, we predicted potential target genes of miR-6509-3p (<xref rid="F0006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>(F)). We performed functional annotation and pathway enrichment on the overlapping results of TargetScan and ENCORI, and combined with the GeneCards database, screened out 12 candidate genes involved in antiviral response or innate immunity for further validated (Table.S3). We compared the mRNA levels of these candidate mRNAs in A549 cells transfected with miR-6509-3p or NC, as well as in cells transfected with the circMYO9A overexpression construct and empty vector. As shown in <xref rid="F0006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>(G), compared with NC-miR-transfected cells, miR-6509-3p mimics significantly reduced the expression of the SERINC1, SERPINE1, TBK1, TRAF5 and HK2 genes. Since circMYO9A interacts with miR-6509-3p, it may regulate downstream gene expression by sponging miR-6509-3p. Therefore, we tested whether circMYO9A could modulate the expression of these five candidate genes. As shown in <xref rid="F0006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>(H), only the SERPINE1 mRNA level was upregulated upon circMYO9A overexpression, indicating that circMYO9A might regulate SERPINE1 expression through miR-6509-3p. Thus, SERPINE1 was selected as a target gene of miR-6509-3p for further investigation. To confirm the results of the bioinformatics prediction analysis, the SERPINE1 3&#x02019;UTR sequence was cloned and inserted into the pmirGLO luciferase reporter plasmid. As shown in <xref rid="F0006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>(I), miR-6509-3p suppressed luciferase activity in the wild-type SERPINE1 3&#x02019;UTR plasmid, confirming direct binding between miR-6509-3p and the SERPINE1 3&#x02019;UTR sequence. Collectively, these results demonstrated that circMYO9A directly binds to miR-6509-3p and that miR-6509-3p is able to directly bind to the SERPINE13&#x02019;UTR to regulate its expression and activity, while circMYO9A modulates SERPINE1 expression via miR-6509-3p. circMYO9A regulates IAV replication by acting as a sponge for miR-6509-3p.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2" id="S003-S2258"><title>The circMYO9A-miR-6509-3p-SERPINE1 axis regulates IAV replication</title><p>The SERPINE1 3&#x02019;UTR sequence was subsequently analysed, and two complementary binding sites for miR-6509-3p were identified (<xref rid="F0007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>(A)). Both the wild-type and mutant forms of the SERPINE1 3&#x02019;UTR were cloned and inserted into the pmirGLO luciferase reporter vector and co-transfected with miR-6509-3p mimics or control mimics. Luciferase assays revealed that the miR-6509-3p mimic significantly inhibited luciferase activity when the cells were transfected with the wild-type 3&#x02019;UTR or a single-site mutant 3&#x02019;UTR, whereas the dual mutant (with both binding sites mutated) did not respond to the miR-6509-3p mimic (<xref rid="F0007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>(B)). Given that circMYO9A interacts with miR-6509-3p and that miR-6509-3p regulates SERPINE1 mRNA expression, we tested whether circMYO9A and miR-6509-3p could influence SERPINE1 protein levels. The SERPINE1 CDS containing the 3&#x02019;UTR was cloned and inserted into the PCMV-Flag vector (<xref rid="F0007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>(C)), which was subsequently co-transfected with circMYO9A or miR-6509-3p mimics. Western blot analysis revealed that, compared with the control, miR-6509-3p decreased SERPINE1 protein levels, whereas circMYO9A overexpression increased these levels (<xref rid="F0007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>(D and E)). Collectively, these results indicate that miR-6509-3p is able to bind to the SERPINE1 3'UTR directly. MiR-6509-3p or circMYO9A can regulate SERPINE1 protein levels, which is consistent with its role in regulating SERPINE1 mRNA levels, and circMYO9A can regulate SERPINE1 protein levels via miR-6509-3p.

SERPINE1/PAI-1 has also been shown to block surface glycoprotein maturation of influenza A virus, thus reducing virus spread in the airways [<xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. We hypothesized that the overexpression of SERPINE1/PAI-1 might restrict viral replication. In A549 cells overexpressing SERPINE1/PAI-1, viral titres and NP protein levels were significantly lower in WSN-infected cells than in control cells at 24&#x02005;h post-infection (<xref rid="F0007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>(F,G)). SERPINE1/PAI-1 overexpression reduced the specific infectivity of IAV WSN/33 in the presence of trypsin. As IAV does not encode its protease, HA cleavage depends on host proteases during IAV replication [<xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Several proteases known to cleave HA, including urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA; known to be a target of PAI-1), trypsin, human airway trypsin, and tryptase, are inhibited by PAI-1, indicating that PAI-1 can regulate HA cleavage [<xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. We examined the influence of SERPINE1/PAI-1 overexpression on HA cleavage in WSN infection in the presence of trypsin. After 24&#x02005;h of viral infection, overexpression of SERPINE1/PAI-1 blocked trypsin-mediated cleavage of HA0 into HA1 and HA2 (<xref rid="F0007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>(J)), suggesting that SERPINE1/PAI-1 regulates HA maturation and reduces viral infectivity, thereby inhibiting viral replication. Finally, the influence of circMYO9A or miR-6509-3p overexpression on HA cleavage in WSN infection was investigated (<xref rid="F0007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>(H,I)). The overexpression of circMYO9A dramatically reduced HA cleavage, whereas the expression of miR-6509-3p slightly increased HA cleavage during IAV WSN/33 infection. These data collectively demonstrated that circMYO9A acts as a ceRNA for miR-6509-3p, regulating SERPINE1/PAI-1 expression and blocking IAV surface glycoprotein maturation, ultimately reducing viral infectivity and titres. The circMYO9A-miR-6509-3p-SERPINE1 axis plays a crucial role in regulating IAV replication.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2" id="S003-S2277"><title>CircMYO9A restricts viral replication and attenuates pathogenicity in a mouse model</title><p>To investigate the effect of circMYO9A on IAV infection in a mouse model, AAV6-expressing circMYO9A (AAV6-circMYO9A) or negative control AAV6 (AAV6-NC) was delivered into the lungs of BALB/c mice via intratracheal intubation, with PBS used as a control (<xref rid="F0008" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>(A)). After treatment with AAV6 for 3 weeks, an EGFP signal was present in the lung tissue, indicating that AAV6 was successfully delivered into the lungs of the BALB/c mice (<xref rid="F0008" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>(B)). RT&#x02013;PCR confirmed that exogenous circMYO9A was expressed in the lungs of the mice at 3 weeks post-infection (<xref rid="F0008" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>(C)). We intranasally infected BALB/c mice with WSN and measured their body weights and daily survival. Compared with those treated with AAV6-NC or PBS, the mice treated with AAV6-circMYO9A lost less body weight (<xref rid="F0008" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>(D)). Additionally, the mortality rate of the AAV6-circMYO9A-treated mice was lower than that of the AAV-NC- or PBS-treated mice. The AAV6-NC- and PBS-treated mice died within 7&#x02005;dpi, whereas 40% of the AAV6-circMYO9A-treated mice were still alive at the end of the experiment (<xref rid="F0008" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>(E)). The effect of circMYO9A on viral pathogenicity in these mice was also assessed. Histological analysis of the lungs revealed that alveolar damage and interstitial inflammatory cell infiltration were less severe in the AAV6-circMYO9A-treated mice than in the AAV6-NC- or PBS-treated mice at 3, 5, and 7&#x02005;dpi (<xref rid="F0008" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>(G)). To explore the viral load in the lungs, the viral titres in the lungs of the mice at 3 and 5&#x02005;dpi were examined via plaque assays, and immunofluorescence staining of the lungs was performed with anti-NP mAb. At 3&#x02005;dpi, although the virus titres were not significantly different among the three groups, those of the AAV6-circMYO9A-treated group were slightly lower than those of the other two groups. The viral titres in the lungs of the AAV6-circMYO9A-treated mice were significantly lower than those in the lungs of the AAV-NC- or PBS-treated mice at 5&#x02005;dpi (<xref rid="F0008" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>(F)).

These results indicate that circMYO9A can inhibit viral replication and attenuate pathogenicity in a mouse model, thus increasing the survival of mice during IAV infection, which demonstrates that circRNAs play crucial roles in inhibiting IAV replication and provides novel insights into potential therapeutic strategies involving circRNAs.

However, only a limited number of influenza A virus (IAV)-related circRNAs have been well characterized. In this study, we screened the circRNA transcription profiles of WSN-infected cells and identified a total of 1107 dysregulated circRNAs in WSN-infected A549 cells, of which 794 circRNAs were upregulated, and 313 circRNAs were downregulated. Notably, we identified a circRNA, circMYO9A, which plays a critical role in regulating innate antiviral immune responses and inhibiting IAV replication. Mechanistically, circMYO9A inhibits viral replication by sponging miR-6059-3p as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) for SERPINE1/PAI-1 and upregulating SERPINE1 expression, which restricts IAV haemagglutinin cleavage and subsequently reduces the maturation of progeny particles. In addition, circMYO9A significantly inhibited viral replication in a mouse model, potentially enhancing mouse survival during IAV infection. These results demonstrate that circRNAs play crucial roles in inhibiting IAV replication and provide novel insights into potential therapeutic strategies involving circRNAs.</p><p>Accumulating evidence indicates that circRNAs play vital roles in regulating IAV infection and its progression through distinct mechanisms [<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. However, the functions of many circRNAs in IAV infection remain unexplored, and further investigations are necessary to elucidate their interactions with the host immune system in antiviral responses. Previous studies have demonstrated that the translation of circRNAs can proceed via a cap-independent mechanism that requires an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) or N6-methyladenosine (m6A)-modifying sequences [<xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Zhao et al. identified an 87-amino-acid peptide encoded by the circular form of the long intergenic nonprotein-coding RNA p53-induced transcript (LINC-PINT), which suppresses glioblastoma cell proliferation both in vitro and in vivo, thereby establishing its potential role in glioblastoma tumorigenesis [<xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Zheng et al. discovered a novel circRNA (circMIB2) in lower vertebrate fish that is translated into a 134 amino acid protein (MIB2-134aa) through m6A modification; this circRNA participates in innate immunity and provides a reference for circRNA therapy in the treatment of pathogenic diseases in economic fish [<xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Our bioinformatic analysis via IRES finder revealed that circMYO9A contains a ribosome entry site (IRES), prompting us to investigate whether it encodes a protein that inhibits viral replication. However, our data indicated that while the IRES in circMYO9A facilitates ribosome entry, circMYO9A does not encode a protein that exerts antiviral effects.</p><p>The competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) hypothesis proposes that RNA transcripts, such as mRNAs, long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), and circular RNAs (circRNAs), share microRNA (miRNA) response elements, compete for binding to miRNAs, and thereby regulate the expression of each other, constructing a complex posttranscriptional regulatory network [<xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. It has been reported that exonic circRNAs are abundant in the cytoplasm and function as miRNA sponges [<xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. CircMYO9A, an exonic circRNA primarily localized in the cytoplasm, may regulate viral replication by acting as a miRNA sponge. It is widely well-established that miRNAs regulate target gene expression by binding to Argonaute-2 (Ago2), an essential component of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). In this study, we confirmed the interaction between circMYO9A and AGO2 through RNA immunoprecipitation. Additionally, RNA pulldown and dual-luciferase reporter assays revealed interactions between circMYO9A and candidate miRNAs. The results demonstrated that circMYO9A efficiently absorbs four distinct miRNAs in A549 cells, although only one was associated with viral replication. While the interaction between circMYO9A and the other three miRNAs has not been further investigated, it is reasonable to assume that circMYO9A may have multiple biological functions affecting mRNAs associated with the other three miRNAs. Given the roles of miR-6509-3p and circMYO9A in viral replication, miR-6509-3p was verified as a binding target of circMYO9A. In addition, our study revealed that the miRNA miR6509-3p binds to the untranslated region (UTR) of SERPINE1, suppressing its expression; this suppression could be partially prevented by the upregulation of circMYO9A upon influenza virus infection. Our results indicated that circMYO9A modulates SERPINE1 expression via miR-6509-3p, suggesting a mechanistic role for the circMYO9A-miR-6509-3p- SERPINE1 axis in regulating viral replication.</p><p>SERPINE1, which encodes plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1), is a 50&#x02005;kDa glycoprotein and the main physiological inhibitor of urokinase and tissue plasminogen activator (uPA/tPA), both of which are major regulators of the fibrinolytic system [<xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. In addition to inhibiting uPA/tPA, PAI-1 also inhibits multiple serine proteases of the chymotrypsin type with varying efficiencies [<xref rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Notably, SERPINE1/PAI-1 is also a somewhat unconventional interferon-stimulated gene (ISG), as it is constitutively expressed but can be further upregulated by IFN and other cytokines, such as IL-6, IL-1, TGF-&#x003b2;, and TNF-&#x003b1; [<xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. As shown in Fig.S1, exogenous IFN-&#x003b2; stimulation could upregulate SERPINE1 expression in A549 cells, suggesting that SERPINE1 could function as an ISG. Our results showed that circMYO9A could facilitate the upregulation of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-6) and antiviral factors (IFN-&#x003b2;, ISG15) following WSN infection, which, in turn, might further enhance SERPINE1 expression, suggesting a potential synergy between circMYO9A-mediated immune activation and its ceRNA function in regulating SERPINE1. Previous studies have reported that PAI-1 targets host proteases such as human tryptase, HAT, TMPRSS2 and Furin to protect the host during natural IAV infection [<xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Haemagglutinin (HA) can be transported to the cell surface and incorporated into virions in an uncleaved form, with cleavage subsequently mediated by soluble proteases such as plasmin in the extracellular space or by unknown serine protease(s) in endosomal vesicles of target cells [<xref rid="CIT0050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Our results suggest that the overexpression of SERPINE1/PAI-1 reduces HA cleavage in WSN infection in the presence of trypsin, further indicating that SERPINE1/PAI-1 may target different proteases at various cellular locations, thereby inhibiting IAV haemagglutinin cleavage and reducing the infectivity of progeny viruses. This effect directly reduces the infectivity of progeny viruses, particularly during multiple rounds of infection. circMYO9A inhibited IAV replication by sponging miR-6059-3p as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) for SERPINE1/PAI-1 and upregulating SERPINE1 expression, which restricted IAV haemagglutinin cleavage and subsequently reduced the maturation of progeny particles. Meanwhile, the immune activation mediated by CircMYO9A also induces the expression of SERPINE1 to a certain extent, suggesting that it may cooperate with the ceRNA function to jointly regulate SERPINE1. Thus, the upregulation of circMYO9A may represent an antiviral strategy for the host following viral infection, which may tip the balance back towards the host. In addition, we further evaluated the effect of circMYO9A on the IAV entry process, including attachment, internalization, membrane fusion, and uncoating (Fig.S4), employing the methodologies described in prior studies [<xref rid="CIT0051" ref-type="bibr">51&#x02013;53</xref>]. The results indicated that circMYO9A has no effect on the step of viral entry. Because circMYO9A does not have a homologous circRNA in mice, we investigated the effect of circMYO9A on IAV infection in a mouse model. Our results indicate that circMYO9A can inhibit viral replication and attenuate pathogenicity in a mouse model, thus potentially increasing the survival of mice during IAV infection. These findings demonstrate that circRNAs play crucial roles in inhibiting IAV replication and provide novel insights into potential therapeutic strategies involving circRNAs.</p><p>Our study thus provides new insights into the roles of circRNAs in the cellular innate antiviral response. CircRNAs have attracted significant attention because of their involvement in various biological processes. However, the functions of many circRNAs during viral infection remain unknown, necessitating further investigations to understand their interactions with the host immune system in antiviral defence responses. Exploring the physiological functions of circRNAs will enhance our understanding and offer potential therapeutic strategies for influenza virus infection.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="SM1041" position="float" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>SUPPLEMENTARY_MATERIALS.docx</title></caption><media xlink:href="TEMI_A_2502007_SM1041.docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="SM1040" position="float" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>SupplementaryFigure_3.eps</title></caption><media xlink:href="TEMI_A_2502007_SM1040.eps"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="SM1039" position="float" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>TableS3.xlsx</title></caption><media xlink:href="TEMI_A_2502007_SM1039.xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="SM1038" position="float" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>SupplementaryFigure_1.eps</title></caption><media xlink:href="TEMI_A_2502007_SM1038.eps"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="SM1037" position="float" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>TableS2.xlsx</title></caption><media xlink:href="TEMI_A_2502007_SM1037.xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="SM1036" position="float" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>SupplementaryFigure_2.eps</title></caption><media xlink:href="TEMI_A_2502007_SM1036.eps"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="SM1035" position="float" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>TableS1.docx</title></caption><media xlink:href="TEMI_A_2502007_SM1035.docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="SM1034" position="float" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>graphical_abstract.tif</title></caption><media xlink:href="TEMI_A_2502007_SM1034.tif"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="SM1033" position="float" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>SupplementaryFigure_4.eps</title></caption><media xlink:href="TEMI_A_2502007_SM1033.eps"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="COI-statement" disp-level="1" id="S005"><title>Disclosure statement</title><p>No potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s006"><title>Supplemental Material</title><p>Supplemental data for this article can be accessed online at <ext-link xlink:href="10.1080/22221751.2025.2502007" ext-link-type="doi">https://doi.org/10.1080/22221751.2025.2502007</ext-link>.</p></sec><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="CIT0001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><string-name><surname>Liu</surname>
