Difficulties with sustained access to cryptococcal rapid tests is cited as a major barrier to the routine screening for cryptococcus in many LMIC. Thus, clinicians in these countries often resort to empirical treatment based solely on clinical suspicion of cryptococcosis. To address this challenge, we aim to evaluate the re-introduction of India ink testing for diagnosis of cryptococcosis among HIV-infected patients in southern Mozambique. India ink testing was historically a common first choice, low-cost, laboratory diagnostic tool for cryptococcal infection. This study uses implementation science methods framed by the Dynamic Adaption Process (DAP) and the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance (RE-AIM) conceptual frameworks to develop a multi-phase, stepped-wedged trial using mixed-methods approaches. The study will be conducted in six hospitals from southern Mozambique over a period of 15 months and will include the following phases: pre-implementation (baseline assessment), Adaptation-implementation (gradual introduction of the intervention), and post-implementation (post-intervention assessment). This study aims to promote the use of India Ink staining as a cheap and readily available tool for cryptococcosis diagnosis in southern Mozambique. Lessons learned in this study may be important to inform approaches to overcome the existing challenges in diagnosis of cryptococcosis in many LMICs due unavailability of readily diagnostic tools. <bold>Trial registration:</bold> ISRCTN11882960, Registered 06 August 2024.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>Fogarty International Center of the United States National Institutes of Health </institution>

In 2020, the global annual incidence of cryptococcosis was estimated at 152,000 cases, resulting in roughly 112,000 cryptococcosis-related deaths [<xref rid="pone.0324792.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. More than 70% of cryptococcosis deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) [<xref rid="pone.0324792.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324792.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>HIV-associated cryptococcosis is a major cause of hospital admissions and clinic visits in LMIC [<xref rid="pone.0324792.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324792.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], particularly affecting the most economically productive age groups. This is especially true in SSA where opportunistic infections such as cryptococcosis continues to be a common occurrence among HIV-infected patients, despite recent efforts to expand access to antiretroviral therapy (ART) [<xref rid="pone.0324792.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324792.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324792.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Nevertheless, as much as 75% of HIV-infected adults in LMIC do not have access to cryptococcal diagnostic testing, and suspected cases are commonly treated empirically [<xref rid="pone.0324792.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324792.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>In Mozambique, the prevalence of HIV-infection in the adult population is currently estimated at 12.5% [<xref rid="pone.0324792.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Accurate data on cryptococcosis prevalence in the country are scarce and most often patients are diagnosed based only on clinical suspicion. It is estimated that the number of cryptococcosis cases in the country are around 18,600 cases per year (70.5 cases per 100,000 persons) [<xref rid="pone.0324792.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324792.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], and in one study of hospitalized HIV patients in southern Mozambique, the prevalence was approximately 5.3% [<xref rid="pone.0324792.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Health care facilities in resource-limited settings frequently experience a variety of different challenges such as financial constraints, scarcity of laboratory consumables, lack of basic essential equipment, limited numbers of skilled personnel, lack of educators and training programs, and inadequate logistical support. Consequently, limited or no access to point-of-care (POC) diagnostics negatively impacts care and results in both delays in diagnosis and delays in initiating treatments [<xref rid="pone.0324792.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324792.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. These limitations likely contribute to 1) patient loss-to-follow-up due to a need for frequent visits to the facility to get results; 2) diagnosis being made empirically, based solely on clinical symptoms which can be nonspecific, unreliable, and may contribute to an increase in mortality; and/or 3) no diagnosis being made at all, due to a lack of awareness or due to limited clinician training with regards to clinically complex cases [<xref rid="pone.0324792.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0324792.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>India ink microscopy has been used to diagnose cryptococcosis for more than a century [<xref rid="pone.0324792.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. This method is relatively simple, inexpensive, and easy to perform in the laboratory, however, the introduction and expansion of rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) for a variety of illnesses has contributed to an overall reduction in the use of microscopy [<xref rid="pone.0324792.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324792.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Furthermore, India ink microscopy specifically, had fallen out of favor as a diagnostic test due to it being associated with a relatively low sensitivity (approximately 70&#x02013;90%) and due to the introduction of newer RDT&#x000b4;s that were anticipated to be a superior alternative to India ink [<xref rid="pone.0324792.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0324792.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>The rapid cryptococcal antigen (CrAg) test, for example, has shown to have good sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing cryptococcosis. However, in some resource-limited settings it has not reached its full potential and its utilization for routine cryptococcal diagnosis remains limited [<xref rid="pone.0324792.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324792.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>In Mozambique, for example, the National Health System (NHS) has had challenges maintaining appropriate stocks of the CrAg RDT and has faced difficulties in ensuring quality control of the tests that are performed [<xref rid="pone.0324792.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. As such, cryptococcosis in Mozambique is significantly underdiagnosed, or is empirically diagnosed only once a patient&#x000b4;s symptoms have progressed to being severe and in advanced stages.</p><p>To address this, we propose an initiative to reintroduce the routine use of India ink microscopy on urine samples as an alternative to CrAg for cryptococcosis diagnosis, particularly among HIV-infected patients. Studies have shown that in persons infected with HIV, cryptococcus can be eliminated in the urine on average 22 days before the onset of cryptococcal meningitis (CM) symptoms [<xref rid="pone.0324792.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324792.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Even with its lower reported sensitivity as a screening test, in the absence of good access to CrAg or other definitive diagnostics, we feel that routine testing of urine with India ink constitutes a &#x0201c;window&#x0201d; of opportunity for screening and subsequent initiation of treatment prior to the full establishment of cryptococcal meningitis manifestations. In this context, urine samples can be easily collected and tested for cryptococcosis at a relatively early stage of systemic infection, without need for invasive procedures such as lumbar puncture.</p><p>Therefore, we hypothesize that the adoption of India ink testing as a low-cost laboratory diagnostic for cryptococcosis in the hospitals will increase the opportunities to diagnose the disease among HIV- infected patients during the intervention period as compared to the control period.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>This protocol was developed following the SPIRIT guidelines (Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Intervention Trials)[<xref rid="pone.0324792.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><sec id="sec003"><title>Study aim</title><p>The overall aim of this study is to evaluate the re-introduction of India ink microscopy of urine samples, as a low-cost, POC diagnostic test for HIV-infected patients suspected of having cryptococcal disease.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Objectives</title><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>1) To explore the opportunities and barriers to re-introduction of India ink microscopy of urine samples, as a diagnostic test for cryptococcal infections among HIV-infected patients in southern Mozambique (Pre-implementation phase).</p></list-item><list-item><p>2) To develop strategies for implementing low-cost, POC diagnostic test for cryptococcal infection in southern Mozambique (Adaptation and implementation phase)</p></list-item><list-item><p>3) To assess the reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance of the intervention in Southern Mozambique (Post-implementation phase).</p></list-item></list></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Expected results of the research</title><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>1) Make available a low-cost POC laboratory-backed diagnosis of cryptococcal infection for HIV-infected patients in study sites and eventually expand nationwide.</p></list-item><list-item><p>2) Train laboratory technicians to perform microscopy to diagnose cryptococcal infection and interpret results.</p></list-item><list-item><p>3) Raise awareness on the occurrence of cryptococcal infection among HIV-infected patients in the country and the possibility of performing an etiologic diagnosis of suspected cases by using a low-cost POC technique (which we expect to introduce nationwide)</p></list-item></list></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>Study setting</title><p>This study will take place in six hospitals conveniently selected within Maputo and Gaza Provinces, in the southern part of Mozambique.

Early detection and management of cryptococcal infection among HIV-infected patients can prevent complications from disease and reduce mortality [<xref rid="pone.0324792.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, many challenges remain in the diagnosis and management of cryptococcosis in sub-Saharan Africa [<xref rid="pone.0324792.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324792.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. International protocols for cryptococcal diagnosis among HIV-infected patients have promoted utilization of the CrAg diagnostic test due to its favorable sensitivity and specificity and its potential as a rapid POC diagnostic test. However, the reality in Mozambique has been that CrAG is not readily available, and the relatively simple microscopy technique has become a lost skill among most laboratory technicians. As a result, cryptococcal management has been based on clinical suspicion and subsequent empirical treatment.</p><p>We propose the reintroduction of the India Ink microscopy technique on urine samples in patients suspected of having cryptococcosis. The stepped-wedge design of our intervention roll-out will strengthen our results, through providing a scenario through which each site will serve as its own control and through which the study team can manage the limited resources for intervention roll-out. Additionally, by framing our work within the context of the DAP conceptual framework, roll-out of India Ink microscopy will be informed by stakeholder perceptions of barriers and opportunities and a baseline assessment of current facility capacity. The DAP framework then allows for continuous feedback and ability to implement adaptations throughout intervention implementation.</p><p>Overall, we expect that the findings from this study could be scaled to other health facilities in Mozambique. Furthermore, the findings of this study may be useful for other countries with resource-limited socio-economic and health system contexts such as Mozambique.</p><sec id="sec021"><title>Limitations</title><p>The limitations of our study include the selection of physicians and specialists that more frequently engage in attending adult HIV-infected patients.
