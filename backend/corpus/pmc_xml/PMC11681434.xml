It is characterized by bilateral or unilateral, numerous small white-yellow dots encircling the fovea [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. BYDM has a childhood onset and is asymptomatic&#x000a0;and non-progressive, usually being identified through routine examination [<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In the six reports available&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], optical coherence tomography (OCT) is generally normal, although ellipsoid zone (EZ) and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) irregularities have been reported [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. All cases display hyperautofluorescence of the dots on fundus autofluorescence (FAF) and normal electroretinography [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. BYDM may be sporadic or follow a presumed autosomal dominant (AD) inheritance (a genetic locus has not yet been identified) [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>A range of macular diseases, with variable prognoses, are characterized by white-yellow dots. Differential diagnoses of BYDM include&#x000a0;but are not limited to&#x000a0;Stargardt&#x000a0;disease, Best disease, age-related macular degeneration, autosomal dominant drusen, congenital grouped albinotic spots, drug-induced retinopathies, Bietti crystalline dystrophy, North Carolina macular dystrophy, and oxalosis. It is therefore essential to expand on the body of knowledge of the 46 BYDM cases published thus far [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. We aim to characterize a group of Portuguese patients with features of BYDM.</p></sec><sec sec-type="cases"><title>Case presentation</title><p>Five patients with clinical features of BYDM were included, originating from three Portuguese centers.

The yellow dots were mostly incidental findings, the exception being patient #2 who was studied after the findings of patient #1.

These findings were bilateral in four of the five patients, except for patient #5 who had findings in the right eye only.</p><p>The distribution pattern of yellow dots varied among patients. In patients #1 and #2, the pattern was similar, with a uniform distribution around the fovea (Figures <xref rid="FIG1" ref-type="fig">1A</xref>, <xref rid="FIG1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>), even though in patient #2, overlapping areas of hypopigmentation could be identified (Figures <xref rid="FIG2" ref-type="fig">2A</xref>, <xref rid="FIG2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>).

Since then, five further case reports have been published [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>-<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], including the first unilateral case reported by Mishra et al. in 2021 [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>In this report, we presented a series of five cases of BYDM from three Portuguese centers. The ocular history of our cohort was diverse and unrelated to the presence of yellow dots. On examination, characteristic macular changes were observed, consisting of multiple small yellow dots at the level of the RPE around the fovea. The dots were evenly distributed throughout the macula or preferentially conglomerated in the nasal region. This distribution pattern of the dots was consistent with what is known in the literature [<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Four out of five patients showed bilateral dots, with the exception being patient #5, the second case of unilateral BYDM described in the literature thus far [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>As previously reported, these dots were hyperautofluorescent on FAF imaging in all cases, which appears to be a hallmark of this macular phenotype. The dots were small and did not show progression on clinical evaluation of fundus photographs, which makes it unlikely that there is a significant visual impact. As expected, OCT and OCTA were globally normal although some small irregularities could be noted in the EZ and RPE. No abnormalities were found at the level of inner retinal layers, as seen in the white dot fovea phenotype, which is similar but characterized by hyperreflective granulation in the inner retinal layers [<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Within our patient cohort, we observed significant demographic variability. The mean age of our patients was 31 years, which is relatively higher than the average age of 16 years reported in all 46 known cases to date [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. We speculate that this age difference may be attributed to two patients who went undiagnosed due to a lack of knowledge about this phenotype. All our patients were female, in contrast to previous reports where male cases were also present. However, given the relatively small sample size, it is difficult to draw a conclusion regarding the correlation between gender and disease prevalence. None of our patients were symptomatic and VA remained unchanged between the first and last examination as was expected.</p><p>Limitations of our study include its retrospective nature and the small number of cases, although we present the third-highest number of cases in the literature. There is also a selection bias, as only selected cases from three Portuguese centers are reported, without a comprehensive survey of all possible diagnosed or underdiagnosed cases.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We conclude that BYDM is a rare phenotype characterized by the presence of bilateral or unilateral small white-yellow dots encircling the fovea, as identified through routine fundus examination or familial screening. Their stable clinical status during long-term follow-up confirms the benign and stationary nature of this phenotype.&#x000a0;Multimodal imaging techniques, such as OCT, OCTA, and FAF, are helpful in its diagnosis. This study expanded on the small body of knowledge on BYDM and characterized the first five Portuguese cases, including the second described unilateral case globally.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Miguel Santos and Nuno Oliveira contributed equally to the work and should be considered co-first authors.</p></ack><fn-group content-type="conflict"><title>Disclosures</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Human subjects:</bold> Consent for treatment and open access publication was obtained or waived by all participants in this study.</p><p><bold>Conflicts of interest:</bold> In compliance with the ICMJE uniform disclosure form, all authors declare the following:</p><p><bold>Payment/services info:</bold> All authors have declared that no financial support was received from any organization for the submitted work.</p><p><bold>Financial relationships:</bold> All authors have declared that they have no financial relationships at present or within the previous three years with any organizations that might have an interest in the submitted work.</p><p><bold>Other relationships:</bold> All authors have declared that there are no other relationships or activities that could appear to have influenced the submitted work.</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="other"><title>Author Contributions</title><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Concept and design:</bold>&#x000a0; Miguel Santos, Sara Vaz-Pereira, Nuno Oliveira</p><p><bold>Drafting of the manuscript:</bold>&#x000a0; Miguel Santos, Nuno Oliveira</p><p><bold>Critical review of the manuscript for important intellectual content:</bold>&#x000a0; Miguel Santos, Sara Vaz-Pereira, Jo&#x000e3;o Pedro Marques, Pedro Arede, Margarida Baptista</p><p><bold>Supervision:</bold>&#x000a0; Sara Vaz-Pereira</p><p><bold>Acquisition, analysis, or interpretation of data:</bold>&#x000a0; Jo&#x000e3;o Pedro Marques, Pedro Arede, Margarida Baptista, Nuno Oliveira</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="REF1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><article-title>Benign yellow dot maculopathy: a new macular phenotype</article-title><source>Ophthalmology</source><person-group>
