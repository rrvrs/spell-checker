[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] which reported a case of peritoneal loose body (PLB) and reviewed relevant literature, summarizing key information about these cases, including gender, age, symptoms, size and weight of the PLBs, and the surgical approaches employed. We would like to supplement this report with a case of our own. The patient is a 68-year-old male who presented with a four-day history of abdominal pain, accompanied by dysuria and painful urination. Upon investigation, an abdominal CT scan revealed the presence of a round, mixed-density mass in the pelvis, with an approximate diameter of 11.5&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;8.6&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;7.4&#x000a0;cm (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The mass exhibited a triangular central region, a high-density border circumferentially, and soft tissue density at the outermost circumference, with clear boundaries. The patient had a history of appendicitis surgery, a two-month course of hepatitis B infection, impaired liver function, and no abnormalities in all other laboratory tests. We hypothesized that the patient&#x02019;s symptoms were due to the mass. Therefore, a laparotomy was performed. During the surgical procedure, a hard, smooth, yellowish-white mass was identified within the pelvis, exhibiting no discernible adhesion to the abdominal organs. It was found that the visible liver capsule was severely adhered to the omentum, the liver was hard and could not be palpated, the small intestine was mildly adherent with abdominal wall, the appendix at the ileocecal region had been removed, and the remaining pelvic and abdominal organs appeared normal. We removed the mass and separated the adhesions in the small intestine. The cut surface of the mass was gray, hard, and tough, with the presence of hard bone-like tissue observable in the center (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). After measuring the mass to be approximately 10&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;8.5&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;7&#x000a0;cm, a histopathological examination was conducted. The pathological diagnosis was hyalinized fibrous connective tissue with focal calcification (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>), and it was ultimately determined to be a PLB. The patient recovered well and was discharged seven days after the surgery.</p><p id="Par4">We agree that this is a rare case, and apart from the symptoms of abdominal discomfort and compression, PLBs typically do not cause other specific symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The size of PLBs in most literature reports are about 2&#x02013;10&#x000a0;cm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], while this PLB is one of the largest so far, with the longest part reaching 10&#x000a0;cm. The patient had a history of appendectomy and intraoperative findings of severe intra-abdominal adhesions. Therefore, we concur with the prevailing view among scholars that PLBs originate from intestinal fat prolapse, fragments of fat tissue from the greater omentum and pancreas, and the free body gradually absorbs proteins in the peritoneum, eventually undergoing saponification, calcification, and fibrogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par5">Preoperative diagnosis of PLBs remains challenging for both clinicians and imaging specialists, as they must be distinguished from intestinal stromal tumors, teratomas, abdominal lymph node calcifications, and tuberculosis granulomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The mobility of PLBs, which varies with body position, is a key distinguishing feature that can help prevent misdiagnosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Histopathological examination after surgery remains the gold standard for diagnosis, which can determine the benign or malignant nature of the disease and differentiate it from other diseases, thus providing a basis for subsequent treatment. Histopathology of PLBs usually shows calcified necrosis of adipose tissue with hypocellular fibrolamellar tissue with numerous microcalcifications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].This case meets the above characteristics.</p><p id="Par6">The accurate diagnosis and subsequent treatment of this disease necessitate the collaboration of multiple disciplines. First, a radiologist is essential for make the most precise diagnosis possible. Following this, a clinician evaluates the patient&#x02019;s health status and selects an appropriate treatment method. Finally, a pathological examination is conducted to ascertain the nature of the pathology. Given the rarity of these cases in clinical practice, it is anticipated that future researchers will compile comprehensive patient medical histories and ancillary examinations, conduct in-depth molecular analyses of PLBs, elucidate the underlying pathogenesis, and provide evidence to enhance the diagnosis and treatment of PLBs.</p><p id="Par7">
