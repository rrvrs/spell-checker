Adults often experience tooth loss, whether partially or completely, resulting from various reasons such as trauma, congenital absence, decay, or gum disease. This loss significantly impacts both the function and appearance of one's smile. Fortunately, several solutions exist for individuals&#x000a0;with missing teeth, with dental implants being the preferred treatment for tooth replacement.</p><p>The main concern regarding plaque removal from implant surfaces is the risk of potential damage to the implant surface. If plaque accumulates and persists, inflammation around the implant can swiftly spread to the surrounding bone [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. This escalation of inflammation could lead to bone resorption, hindering the process of osseointegration. The biological side effects of dental implants that result from infections triggered by bacterial biofilm and subsequent inflammation of the soft tissues and bone surrounding implants are known as peri-implant diseases, including peri-implant mucositis and peri-implantitis [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Dental biofilm, commonly called plaque, is a dense, sticky layer of bacteria and their byproducts that adheres to the surfaces of teeth, dental implants, gums, and other areas in the mouth. It forms when microorganisms in the mouth accumulate on the tooth or dental implant surfaces and form a protective layer primarily comprising bacteria, saliva proteins, and food particles. It is highly structured, with bacteria embedded in a matrix of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), allowing it to adhere firmly to tooth or dental implant surfaces, especially along the gum line.&#x000a0;Plaque&#x000a0;develops from these oral microbiota accumulations [<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Peri-implant mucositis around dental implants can be largely reduced by reducing plaque build-up [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Regular maintenance of dental implants by both patients and dental healthcare professionals is essential for preventing peri-implant diseases [<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The primary goal is to minimize plaque buildup on dental implant surfaces. Patient home care involves activities like tooth brushing, using interdental cleaning tools such as floss and interdental cleaners, and employing locally applied treatments like chlorhexidine gluconate and water flossers such as Hydro Floss&#x000ae; [<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Professional implant hygiene care includes various methods such as laser, plastic curette, titanium curette, air-powder abrasive system, and rubber cup with non-abrasive paste [<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, these hygiene care instruments can potentially modify the implant surface. As a result, the surface profile and roughness produced by these modalities may significantly affect the newly formed biofilm, thereby playing an important role in peri-implant health maintenance [<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Dental implants' sustained effectiveness largely depends on regular maintenance and follow-up procedures. General dentists are becoming more and more responsible for providing this continuing care as dental implants become more widespread. The structure of the implant surface and the cleaning techniques used significantly influence how well the implant surface is cleaned [<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Plaque and calculus must be effectively removed from the implant surface by the maintenance instruments to minimize any possible damage. Implant surfaces are significantly altered by traditional sonic and ultrasonic scalers [<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Therefore, recommendations have been made to use rubber polishing, graphite or nylon instruments, and plastic curettes. However, as per the literature, there is currently no widely accepted method for cleaning and polishing oral implants without potentially causing harm to the implant surfaces.</p><p>This study investigated the impact of three different types of tools used for implant maintenance. It aims to provide a new understanding and perspective on how these tools affect the roughness of titanium surfaces. We believe this knowledge will aid dentists in choosing the most effective and least intrusive methods to maintain the health of implants. Therefore, the study's objective was to utilize a scanning electron microscope (SEM) to analyze the surface topographies of titanium implant fixtures in groups that were untreated and those treated with an airflow; erbium, chromium-doped: yttrium, scandium, gallium, and garnet (Er, Cr: YSGG) laser; and titanium brush.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>This research employed an experimental laboratory study design. The PS Power and Sample Size Calculation software [<xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] was used to determine the sample size based on the comparison of two means. A type one error of 0.05 and a study power of 0.8 were set. The expected change in mean surface roughness, based on previous study results, was 0.20, with a standard deviation (SD) of 0.06 [<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The calculated sample size was 73 fixtures per group. However, as this was an exploratory study and due to limitations in cost and time, the sample size was reduced to five fixtures per group.</p><p>Twenty MegaGen ST titanium implant fixtures&#x000a0;(MegaGen Implant Co., Ltd., Seoul, Republic of Korea) were used for this study. Five titanium implant fixtures were randomly classified into four different groups: untreated/control group (n=5); airflow group (n=5); Er, Cr: YSGG laser system group (n=5); and titanium brush group (n=5). They were mounted on a 2&#x000a0;x 2&#x000a0;x 2 cm stone stand for the hygiene instrumentations.</p><p>Hygiene instrumentations</p><p>(i)&#x000a0;Control Group</p><p>The samples were taken directly from sealed sterile packages and no further treatment was applied to these samples.</p><p>(ii)&#x000a0;Airflow Group</p><p>Samples were treated with an airflow (Mectron Starjet) using NaCOH<sub>3</sub>-based powder (Mectron prophylaxis powder soft). The device was connected to the dental unit turbine. Fixtures were treated using high-pressure air and water jets in combination with a specially formulated powder (sodium bicarbonate). An airflow was performed for 20 seconds at a distance of 5 mm from the surfaces by moving the tip of the handpiece at an inclination of 30 degrees with pendular brushing movements [<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Standard water pressure (from one to three bars) and standard air pressure (two to three bars) were used for the dental unit turbine, as recommended by the manufacturer.</p><p>(iii)&#x000a0;Er, Cr: YSGG Laser Group</p><p>The laser system used was Er, Cr: YSGG (Waterlase ExpressTM, Biolase Technology, San Clemente, CA). A wavelength of 2780 nm was utilized with a radical firing perio tip (RFTP5-14mm, Biolase). The laser settings were configured to a power output of 1.5 W. During application, the laser tip was positioned parallel to the implant surface at a focal distance of 0.5 mm for 120 seconds. The laser pulse frequency was set at 30 Hz, accompanied by air and water irrigation at 50% of the maximum flow rate [<xref rid="REF14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>(iv)&#x000a0;Titanium Brush Group</p><p>A titanium rotary brush (Ti brush, Titanium Brush DTST-6352, 38 mm; MegaGen Implant Co., Ltd.) was used with a force of 0.25 N. It began at 300 rpm and could increase to 1000 rpm as needed. It was compatible with a slow-speed implant handpiece. The instrumentation was performed with water irrigation in a rotative direction on the surfaces [<xref rid="REF15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>All fixtures from each group were thoroughly rinsed with normal saline, fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde, and then examined using SEM.</p><p>Scanning electron microscope (SEM)</p><p>A random sample from each group was selected and analyzed with an SEM to evaluate surface roughness topography. The samples shown in Figure <xref rid="FIG1" ref-type="fig">1A</xref>&#x000a0;were coated with gold powder using a SC005 Leica Sputter Machine to improve visibility during SEM analysis. The samples were subsequently mounted onto a stub and analyzed as shown in Figure <xref rid="FIG1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>, using a FEG Quanta 450 for high-resolution imaging, with careful selection and standardization of the scanning surface. It was occupied with a high-resolution field emission column, optimized for high brightness/high, low, and extended low vacuum, thus producing clearer, less electrostatic distorted images with spatial resolution down to 1.4 nm, three to six times better than conventional SEM.</p><fig position="anchor" fig-type="figure" id="FIG1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>(A) SC005 Leica Sputter Machine was used to coat each sample with gold powder prior scanning.

Literature has made it abundantly evident that there is currently no cleaning and polishing procedure for oral implants that can be used anywhere without harming the surfaces of the implants [<xref rid="REF16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="REF17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Many techniques such as air abrasives, plastic instruments, and polishing rubber cups have been proposed, but there is no clear-cut best practice as yet [<xref rid="REF18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="REF19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Using hygiene instruments during supportive implant therapy affects the surface modification of implant surfaces as it affects the rates of bacterial adhesion. These therapies may harm the titanium oxide stable protective coating on implant surfaces, despite being the recommended approach for addressing peri-implant diseases [<xref rid="REF20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. To achieve an anti-adherent and plaque-reducing effect, every micro-structured component that encounters the oral cavity needs to be highly polished.</p><p>This study engaged in a comparison between three hygiene instrumentation methods on titanium implant fixtures under SEM. For this study, the magnification of 50x, 1000x, 2000x, and 5000x were used. The findings indicated that at a magnification of 50x, all groups exhibited the same surface topography, as compared to the control/untreated group, which displayed typical sharp-edged elevations. However, at magnifications of 1000x, 2000x, and 5000x, the polishing effect of the powder led the airflow group to exhibit smoother surfaces with simpler and more organized structures than the control group, effectively reducing the pits found on rougher surfaces.</p><p>Sawai et al. [<xref rid="REF21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] found that with the varied rpm, pressure or load, time spent polishing each surface, and coarseness of the polishing pastes used in different studies, it was difficult to directly compare the results of previous studies on the impact of airflow with powder groups to the alterations of implant surfaces. In contrast with Ichioka et al. [<xref rid="REF22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], they revealed that there were no noticeable changes to the titanium surface when employing airflow techniques. In the study by Tavakoli et al. [<xref rid="REF23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>],&#x000a0;titanium brushes and curettes produced a larger change in roughness in comparison to the control group, even though they produced a smoother surface. After polishing with the airflow, the surface was the roughest, but the group that received airflow also showed the least changes (in comparison to the control group).</p><p>Inconsistent with the previous studies, studies utilizing SEM have documented the effectiveness of Er, Cr: YSGG laser irradiation as an implant decontamination method without producing any surface modification [<xref rid="REF14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="REF24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="REF25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The distance of Er Cr: YSGG laser irradiation in this study was similar, but the laser tip, duration, power, and scanning technique utilized in the previous research varied [<xref rid="REF24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. It was demonstrated that the 1.5 W power setting did not create significant changes in surface micro-roughness, similar to the power level and tip type [<xref rid="REF14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], where they used radial firing tips to treat failed implants. Nevertheless, the SEM result for the Er, Cr: YSGG laser group was noted to produce surface roughness, as the surfaces exhibit a more rugged topography, particularly at 5000x. This laser group displayed a more intricate, disorganized structure. This observation is consistent with Chegeni et al. [<xref rid="REF26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], who found that implant surface modifications showed greater damage, such as melting effects, when the energy per pulse was increased to 84 mJ (2.5 W/30 Hz), compared to an Er, Cr: YSGG laser with side-firing and conical tips operating at 50 mJ (1.5 W/30 Hz).</p><p>Titanium surfaces are altered when instrumented either with a nylon brush or&#x000a0;a metal brush. Hence,&#x000a0;nylon or metal brushes should be used with caution to avoid damaging the implant fixture/abutment surface [<xref rid="REF27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The titanium brush reveals the areas of the implant fixture surfaces like leveling of typical sharp edges and flatter, smoother surfaces, yielding optimum results across all magnifications [<xref rid="REF15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Al-Hashedi et al. [<xref rid="REF28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] evaluated the ability of clinically available methods, such as metal and plastic curettes, titanium brushes, and the erbium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet (Er: YAG) laser to decontaminate implant surfaces. The surface morphology, chemical composition, and properties of the machined titanium discs were analyzed before and after the contamination of oral biofilms by SEM and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Titanium brushes were found to be more effective than curettes (metal or plastic) and the Er: YAG laser in decontaminating titanium implant surfaces, although neither technique was able to fully remove surface contamination. These results align with the study by Toma et al. [<xref rid="REF29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], which showed better results in the decontamination of the implant surface in the group using titanium brushes vs. the plastic curettes group or the abrasive air group.</p><p>In line with previous research, our findings indicate that the titanium brush produces smoother and flatter surfaces, effectively decontaminating titanium implant surfaces.</p><p>Limitations</p><p>This study has several limitations. Firstly, it involved a one-time instrumentation assessment, and the results may vary in future applications within real clinical settings. Additionally, previous studies have indicated that titanium disks were typically utilized as samples due to their more homogeneous and flat surfaces, which aid in reducing errors during instrumentation manipulation. Finally, an issue arose regarding the number of uses for the titanium brush. Previous research employed a single-use titanium brush for implant decontamination. However, according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s guidelines, the MegaGen&#x000ae; titanium brush can be reused multiple times, as long as there are no visible signs of corrosion, cracks, or pinholes. The impact of multiple uses in the context of routine professional mechanical plaque removal remains unclear and speculative.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In this study, the surface topography treated with the laser group showed the least effective results with a more complex and disorganized structure compared to the other groups. The airflow group seemed to have generalized micropores due to the high velocity of airflow and powder, and the titanium brush group showed the most effective results as the surfaces were flatter and smoother and showed fewer complex structures which will be less prone to implant health and periodontal diseases.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by a Universiti Sains Malaysia Research University Grant (Grant Number:1001/PPSG/8012365) and the School of Dental Sciences, Universiti Sains Malaysia.</p></ack><fn-group content-type="conflict"><title>Disclosures</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Human subjects:</bold> All authors have confirmed that this study did not involve human participants or tissue.</p><p><bold>Animal subjects:</bold> All authors have confirmed that this study did not involve animal subjects or tissue.</p><p><bold>Conflicts of interest:</bold> In compliance with the ICMJE uniform disclosure form, all authors declare the following:</p><p><bold>Payment/services info:</bold> All authors have declared that no financial support was received from any organization for the submitted work.</p><p><bold>Financial relationships:</bold> All authors have declared that they have no financial relationships at present or within the previous three years with any organizations that might have an interest in the submitted work.</p><p><bold>Other relationships:</bold> All authors have declared that there are no other relationships or activities that could appear to have influenced the submitted work.</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="other"><title>Author Contributions</title><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Concept and design:</bold>&#x000a0; Akram Hassan, Mohamad Arif Awang Nawi, Haslina Taib, Hareem Ghaffar</p><p><bold>Acquisition, analysis, or interpretation of data:</bold>&#x000a0; Akram Hassan, Mohamad Arif Awang Nawi, Haslina Taib, Hareem Ghaffar</p><p><bold>Drafting of the manuscript:</bold>&#x000a0; Akram Hassan, Mohamad Arif Awang Nawi, Haslina Taib, Hareem Ghaffar</p><p><bold>Critical review of the manuscript for important intellectual content:</bold>&#x000a0; Akram Hassan, Mohamad Arif Awang Nawi, Haslina Taib, Hareem Ghaffar</p><p><bold>Supervision:</bold>&#x000a0; Akram Hassan, Mohamad Arif Awang Nawi, Haslina Taib</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="REF1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><article-title>Long-standing plaque and gingivitis at implants and teeth in the dog</article-title><source>Clin Oral Implants Res</source><person-group>
