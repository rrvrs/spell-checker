The latest studies on etiopathogenesis with MRI show an inhibitory response on the limbic system by hyperactivation of the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex as well as a decrease in the autonomic response, the initial result being the attenuation of the processing of emotions. Among the differential diagnoses: post-anxiety illness disorder, major depressive episode, other dissociative disorders, panic disorder, psychotic disorder, substance-induced disorder There are several partially effective treatments, although the results so far are poor. SSRIs, quetiapine and naltrexone have been tried. Partial efficacy with lamotrigine together with SSRIs and, if high levels of anxiety coexist, SSRIs together with clonazepam. There are studies where psychodynamic psychotherapy, behavioral therapy and hypnosis have obtained partially effective results.</p></sec><sec id="sec4387"><title>Disclosure of Interest</title><p>None Declared</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="2"/></counts></article-meta></front></article>
