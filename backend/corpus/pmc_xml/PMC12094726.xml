</self-uri><abstract><sec id="sec001"><title>Background</title><p>As new SARS-CoV-2 variants emerge and as treatment of COVID-19 ARDS remains exclusively supportive, there is an unmet need to better characterize its different phenotypes to tailor personalized treatments. Clinical, biological, spirometric and CT data hardly allow deciphering of Heavy (H), Intermediate (I) and Light (L) phenotypes of COVID-19 ARDS and the implementation of tailored specific strategies (prone positioning, PEEP settings, recruitment maneuvers). We hypothesized that the ratio of two pivotal COVID-19 biomarkers (interleukin 6 [IL-6] and Krebs von den Lungen 6 [KL-6], related to inflammation and pneumocyte repair, respectively) would provide a biologic insight into the disease timeline allowing 1) to differentiate H, I and L phenotypes, 2) to predict outcome and 3) to reflect some of CT findings.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Methods and findings</title><p>This was a retrospective analysis of prospectively acquired data (COVID HUS cohort). Inclusion concerned any patient with severe COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to two intensive care units between March 1<sup>st</sup> and May 1<sup>st</sup>, 2020, in a high-density cluster of the first epidemic wave (Strasbourg University Hospital, France). Demographic, clinical, biological (standard, IL-6 [new generation ELISA], KL-6 [CLEIA technique]), spirometric (driving pressure, respiratory system compliance) and CT data were collected longitudinally. CT analysis included semi-automatic and automatic lung measurements and allowed segmentation of lung volumes into 4 (poorly aerated, non-aerated, overinflated and normally aerated) and 3 (ground-glass, restricted normally aerated, and overinflated) zones, respectively. The primary outcome was to challenge the IL-6/KL-6 ratio capacity to decipher the three COVID-19 ARDS phenotypes (H, I and L) defined on clinical, spirometric and radiologic grounds. Secondary outcomes were the analysis of the prognostic value of the IL-6/KL-6 ratio and its correlates with CT-acquired data. Multivariate analysis was based on principal component analysis.</p><p>One hundred and forty-eight ventilated COVID-19 ICU patients from the COVID HUS cohort were assessed for eligibility and 77 were included in the full analysis. Most were male, all were under invasive mechanical ventilation and vasopressor therapy and displayed high severity scores (SAPSII: 48 [42&#x02013;56]; SOFA: 8 [7&#x02013;10]). The L, I and H COVID ARDS phenotypes were identified in 11, 15 and 48 patients, respectively. In three patients, the phenotype could not be defined precisely. Thirty patients (39%) died in the ICU and the number of ventilator-free days was 2 [0&#x02013;2] days. The IL-6/KL-6 ratio was not significantly different between the L, I and H phenotypes and evolved according to similar patterns over time. Surviving and deceased patients displayed an inverse kinetic of KL-6. IL-6 and the IL-6/KL-6 ratio were linearly associated with ground-glass volume on semi-automatic and automatic CT lung measurements.</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In our population of severe ventilated COVID ARDS patients, the IL-6/KL-6 ratio was not clue to differentiate the H, I and L phenotypes and tailor a personalized ventilatory approach. There was an interesting correlation between IL-6/KL-6 ratio and ground-glass volume as determined by automated lung CT analysis. Such correlation deserves more in-depth pathophysiological study, at best gathered from a prospective cohort with a larger sample size and histological analysis.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Trial registration</title><p>COVID HUS Trial registration number: <ext-link xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04405726" ext-link-type="uri">NCT04405726</ext-link></p></sec></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source>

In a short time, this pathology became a pandemic which considerably affected health systems worldwide and imposed drastic restrictions that profoundly altered the professional and social life of humanity.</p><p>As of March 3, 2024, COVID-19 has resulted in over 774 million confirmed cases and over 7 million deaths worldwide [<xref rid="pone.0321533.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) have a high mortality rate [<xref rid="pone.0321533.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The COVID-ICU Group&#x02019;s prospective study conducted in French, Belgian and Swiss hospitals in Europe during the first wave of the COVID-19 epidemic showed that 35% of patients admitted to the ICU died during their ICU stay [<xref rid="pone.0321533.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The improvement of our knowledge of SARS-CoV-2, and the introduction of therapies have led to a reduction in ICU mortality, with a death rate of around 20% at the end of this first wave, regardless of age, gender, or comorbidities.[<xref rid="pone.0321533.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Currently, there are treatments that can prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection or its progression to a severe form of COVID-19 (vaccine, corticosteroid therapy, anticoagulation, monoclonal antibodies), but none of them can either cure full-blown severe COVID or eradicate SARS-CoV-2 from the face of the earth. This, together with numerous mutations in SARS-CoV-2 which are responsible for new and potentially more contagious variants, explains the genesis of several successive epidemic waves, highlighting the need to improve our understanding of the pathogenicity of severe forms of COVID-19 to better manage patients.</p><p>It appears that the pattern of COVID-19 pneumonia is progressive and variable depending on the time elapsed since primary infection, the patient&#x02019;s ventilatory responsiveness to hypoxemia, and host response.[<xref rid="pone.0321533.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Indeed, Gattinoni <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>. argue that the interaction between these factors leads to the development of a time-related spectrum of diseases within two main &#x0201c;phenotypes&#x0201d;: type L (light), and type H (heavy) phenotypes characterized by clinical, spirometric and radiological criteria. This phenotypic classification mainly relies on static respiratory compliance values measured at the bedside. It should be noted that the classification of L and H phenotypes proposed by Gattinoni et al.[<xref rid="pone.0321533.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] has given rise to much discussion in the medical literature concerning its validity and clinical usefulness in the management of COVID-19 pneumonia. In several articles published in the <italic toggle="yes">European Respiratory Journal</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0321533.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0321533.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], researchers have raised concerns about the simplistic and rigid nature of this categorization. It has been suggested that the progression between these phenotypes is more fluid than the initial article suggests. Other studies have highlighted the complexity of inflammatory responses and underlying mechanisms in COVID-19, making it difficult to reduce patients to two distinct categories [<xref rid="pone.0321533.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. For instance, in their Letter to the Editor, Gattinoni, Camparota and Marini admit that the L/H classification is primarily theoretical and intended to guide respiratory therapeutics, and that it must be interpreted with caution [<xref rid="pone.0321533.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Other critics point out that parameters such as inflammatory status and early management of hypoxemia play a major role and cannot be neglected, thus complicating clinical management based solely on these phenotypes. Finally, alongside these two main phenotypes, an intermediate phenotype [<xref rid="pone.0321533.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] (phenotype I) refers to a subgroup of patients with compliance characteristics that do not correspond to phenotypes L and H.</p><p>In addition to this clinical presentation, the anatomical-pathological data [<xref rid="pone.0321533.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] also suggest that both phenotypes may coexist. Initial autopsy findings revealed a lymphocytic viral pneumonia corresponding to an inflammatory infiltrate of the pulmonary tissue that could be considered as type L. Conversely, recently gathered pathologic specimens showed another histological signature called acute fibrinous and organizing pneumonia (AFOP). AFOP is characterized by extensive intra-alveolar fibrin balls, embedded by fibroblasts, type 2 pneumocyte hyperplasia and without hyaline membrane deposition, which could be considered as type H. Further autopsy findings revealed distinctive vascular features such as initial injury to the pulmonary endothelium, intussusceptive angiogenesis, widespread thrombosis, impairment of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (both contributing to intrapulmonary shunt) and limited epithelial damage [<xref rid="pone.0321533.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Some drug strategies are effective at an early stage, when viral replication is active and inflammatory processes are at the forefront, but are not useful or even potentially harmful at a more advanced stage of the disease when other therapies may be more advisable. Similarly, the ventilatory strategy must be adapted to the different stages of alveolar damage (L phenotype versus H phenotype), which are difficult to identify based on clinical, spirometric and scanographic criteria alone [<xref rid="pone.0321533.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0321533.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Indeed, the compliance of the respiratory system (C<sub>RS</sub>) can only be measured in ventilated patients. With successive waves, less and less severe ICU COVID-19 patients were invasively ventilated, and many were maintained on non-invasive support (high-flow nasal oxygenation or non-invasive mask ventilation with pressure support). Second, measured C<sub>RS</sub> is intricately linked to extent of the aerated lung at the time of measurement, which largely depends on the timing of endotracheal intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation. Third, accurate measurement of C<sub>RS</sub> requires an end-inspiratory hold manoeuvre during volume-controlled continuous mandatory ventilation with constant flow. Such manoeuvre reveals easy in patients passively ventilated under muscle relaxants but may prove difficult and provide inaccurate measurement of C<sub>RS</sub> in patients with respiratory efforts and increased inspiratory &#x0201c;drive&#x0201d;. This is true even with new generation ventilators using the linear least squares fitting method for the equation of motion [<xref rid="pone.0321533.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. We and others have observed that severe COVID-19 patients regularly displayed a large respiratory drive [<xref rid="pone.0321533.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and profound inspiratory effort, even on mechanical ventilation and sedation when they were not given muscle relaxants. Such conditions may impede accurate measurements of C<sub>RS</sub>.</p><p>Thus, we believe that biomarkers would facilitate the differentiation of the H, I and L phenotypes when C<sub>RS</sub> measurement is not possible or flawed and allow for an individualized approach of the severe COVID-19 ARDS patient. Indeed, use of standard positive end-expiratory pressure/FiO<sub>2</sub> tables, higher positive end-expiratory pressure strategies, and higher tidal volumes may all be potentially deleterious in L phenotype [<xref rid="pone.0321533.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. So, we wondered whether biological criteria could possibly distinguish these two phenotypes, to allow a tailored management of ventilated ICU patients with a severe form of COVID-19-associated ARDS (CARDS). Based on current knowledge, we challenged the ratio of two COVID-19 pivotal biomarkers (interleukin 6 and Krebs von den Lungen 6 protein) to match this goal.</p><p>Early clinical studies in China have reported an association between SARS-CoV-2-induced hyperinflammation syndrome and disease severity [<xref rid="pone.0321533.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0321533.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. This hyperinflammatory state is called &#x0201c;cytokine storm&#x0201d;. Cytokine storm&#x0201d; is characterized by an increased level of pro-inflammatory cytokines exacerbating inflammation and contributing to tissue injury. Among all cytokines released in the COVID-19 cytokine storm, interleukin 1 (IL-1), interleukin 6 (IL-6), TNF-&#x003b1; and IFN-&#x003b3; are prominent. TNF-&#x003b1; is a major player in the induction of systemic inflammation and the destruction of healthy cells [<xref rid="pone.0321533.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Similarly, IFN-&#x003b3;, which is involved in the antiviral immune response, may trigger an amplification of the inflammatory response when released in excess, aggravating lung lesions [<xref rid="pone.0321533.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>According to Liu and Hill [<xref rid="pone.0321533.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], IL-6 plays a central role in the worsening of the inflammatory response and is strongly associated with the severity of symptoms, particularly in acute respiratory distress syndrome. This is interesting because IL-6 was found to be strongly associated with COVID-19 outcome [<xref rid="pone.0321533.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0321533.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. It has therefore been hypothesized that the rate of IL-6 release could be high, and probably more in the early phase of the disease and in the L phenotype because the latter is contemporary to an inflammatory profile.</p><p>On the other hand, it was seen earlier that the histological appearance that corresponds to the H phenotype is AFOP with pneumocyte 2 hyperplasia. Krebs von den Lungen 6 protein (KL-6) is a glycoprotein expressed predominantly by type 2 pneumocytes and expressed more prominently during proliferation of these cells [<xref rid="pone.0321533.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0321533.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. KL-6 has been shown to be higher in patients with severe COVID-19, who are more likely to progress to an H phenotype, than those with mild to moderate COVID-19 [<xref rid="pone.0321533.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. So, KL-6 may be a promising biomarker of interest for the H phenotype.</p><p>Taken as a whole, IL-6 and KL-6 are two prognostic biomarkers whose concentrations kinetics, taken independently, seem to evolve in an opposite way over the course of COVID-19 and among the two prevailing phenotypes. In the clinical arena, the IL-6/KL-6 ratio may prove useful as 1) the accurate determination of the L and H phenotypes (or the transition from L- to H-type within a same patient) requires extensive reiterated, high-end spirometric and computed tomography analysis [<xref rid="pone.0321533.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and 2) treatments tailored to one or the other phenotype may improve care and outcome [<xref rid="pone.0321533.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0321533.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] even if the existence of different phenotypes is still debated [<xref rid="pone.0321533.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0321533.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Phenotyping COVID-ARDS [<xref rid="pone.0321533.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] but also ARDS from other causes than SARS-CoV-2 infection [<xref rid="pone.0321533.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0321533.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] was recently determined a promising way for personalized precision medicine.</p><p>Confronting the ratio of these two biomarkers with a set of clinical, CT-scan and spirometric data could allow us to determine whether the IL-6/KL-6 ratio is a good candidate to better identify the phenotypic profiles of our patients with severe COVID-19. The aim of our study was therefore to provide full clinical, spirometric and CT data of severe ICU COVID-19 patients hospitalized in a high-density cluster of the first wave (alpha variant) and confront them to the IL-6/KL-6 ratio to challenge its ability to adequately distinguish COVID-19 ARDS phenotypes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>1.

In comparison, in the COVID-ICU group study [<xref rid="pone.0321533.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], the duration of mechanical ventilation was 12 days, duration of hospitalization in the ICU was 16 days, and the ICU mortality rate was 35%.</p><p>This increased severity in our cohort could be explained by the fact that the Hautepierre Hospital is one of the two reference centers in the Alsace region. As a result, the most severe cases with high comorbidities were referred to this center, especially during this first epidemic wave when the Grand-Est region was severely affected with peripheral hospitals overwhelmed by the surge of COVID-19 cases, especially in the ICU. In addition, for the sake of bed availabilities, the most stable patients were selected daily to be transferred to regions less affected than Alsace by the COVID-19 pandemic [<xref rid="pone.0321533.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>], resulting in an overrepresentation of patients with hypertension, diabetes, chronic renal failure, chronic respiratory disease or a history of cancer, in proportions greater than those published in the literature [<xref rid="pone.0321533.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0321533.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0321533.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Despite this severity, at admission patients had moderate level of hypoxemia with a median PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub> ratio of 158, similar to the COVID-ICU group [<xref rid="pone.0321533.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Static compliance on admission was 34.4&#x02009;ml/cmH<sub>2</sub>O, which is far from the almost &#x0201c;normal&#x0201d; compliance (median 50&#x02009;ml/cmH<sub>2</sub>O) reported by Chiumello et al. [<xref rid="pone.0321533.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>] in 32 patients with severe COVID-19; however, this compliance value is like those reported in many studies [<xref rid="pone.0321533.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0321533.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>] with much larger cohorts of COVID-19 patients. The severity of our cohort and the fact that we had a cohort with a highly inflammatory state can be seen in the biological characteristics of our patients, and in particular the biological variables that have been retained as prognostic factors for the severity of COVID-19, i.e., D-dimer levels [<xref rid="pone.0321533.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>], CRP [<xref rid="pone.0321533.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>] and lymphopenia.</p><p>Even if the association of these variables with the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection has been demonstrated, their optimal cut-offs allowing the accurate prediction of patient outcome with satisfying sensitivity and specificity remain to be determined. Thus, the median D-dimer value of 2085 &#x003bc;g/ml is well above that found in the COVID-ICU group [<xref rid="pone.0321533.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] cohort, of 1600 &#x003bc;g/ml.</p><p>Similarly, the median CRP concentration of 204&#x02009;mg/l is well above the median CRP of 136.3&#x02009;mg/l found in 990 critically ill patients in the New York study [<xref rid="pone.0321533.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>] among a cohort of 5279 patients hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 infection. This significant inflammatory state is well represented by lymphopenia, which was 0.75 Giga/L, similar to that found in the literature [<xref rid="pone.0321533.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>].</p><sec id="sec026"><title>IL-6 at admission</title><p>The median IL-6 level on admission in our cohort was 173 pg/ml corroborating patients&#x02019; severity, who presented hyperinflammation and probably a cytokine storm. The level of IL-6 found was much higher than those reported in other studies [<xref rid="pone.0321533.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>].</p><p>These previous studies, reporting lower plasma concentrations of several pro-inflammatory cytokines (including IL-6) in COVID-19 patients verses those with ARDS, cytokine release syndrome or in septic patients, have cast doubt on the very existence of the cytokine storm in COVID-19 for some authors [<xref rid="pone.0321533.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>].</p><p>The higher IL-6 levels in our study compared to those usually found in cytokine storm may be explained by the fact that a large proportion of patients in previously published studies had moderate disease severity which may have minimized the mean IL-6 titers. Moreover, the recently published study by Gorham et al. [<xref rid="pone.0321533.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>], which assessed the outcome of patients with IL-6 levels measured repeatedly during COVID-19 in patients admitted to the ICU, found much higher levels, like those in patients with hypoinflammatory ARDS [<xref rid="pone.0321533.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. We also have excluded from our analysis COVID patients whose duration of ICU stay was below 14 days. This probably has excluded many &#x0201c;less severe&#x0201d; (and possibly less inflamed) patients and may also explain the higher pro-inflammatory cytokines reported in this compared to other ones.</p><p>Another factor that may explain the low levels of IL-6 reported in other studies relies on the paucity of measurements, mainly at admission [<xref rid="pone.0321533.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], which neither reflects the inflammatory peak, nor the evolution of inflammation in patients with SARS-CoV-2, particularly those with moderate forms.</p><p>Finally, there was real clinical improvement over time in patients on corticosteroids or anti-IL-6 therapies. However, a change in therapeutic strategies during the first epidemic wave of COVID-19 due to the rapid acquisition of new knowledge, may have modified the IL-6 levels of the various cohorts, with a possible decrease after the widespread use of corticosteroids or anti-IL6. Thus, initially, some patient cohorts were treated with antibiotics systematically, some with antivirals such as Ritonavir, while others used corticosteroids from the beginning of the epidemic wave. In our cohort, these changes in treatment also took place, as shown by the proportions of patients treated with corticosteroids, hydroxychloroquine, and antivirals.</p></sec><sec id="sec027"><title>KL-6 at admission</title><p>The median KL-6 level on admission was 478 U/ml, which is in the same order of magnitude as that found by Frix et al. [<xref rid="pone.0321533.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>] with a median level of 405 U/ml; however, this study involved patients with COVID-19 who were hospitalized without distinction between severe and moderate forms. The study by Deng et al. [<xref rid="pone.0321533.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] suggests a median level of 898 U/ml in patients in a severe state, which is much higher than what was found in our study but encompasses the entire hospital stay.</p><p>The comparison of these two studies with ours is very interesting. It suggests that our patients were not at a very advanced stage in the evolution of COVID-19 when they were first sampled for KL-6 assay. This is also suggested by the short duration of evolution (approximately 1 week) between the onset of symptoms and hospitalization in intensive care. Conversely, as highlighted in the study by Deng et al. [<xref rid="pone.0321533.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], the peak of KL-6 is situated for patients with a severe form of SARS-CoV-2 around the third week after the onset of symptoms, which probably explains the level of 405 U/ml at admission in our cohort.</p></sec><sec id="sec028"><title>Phenotypes classification and IL-6/KL-6 ratio</title><p>According to our results, the proportion of patients with a H phenotype on admission was 65% compared to 15% of patients with an L phenotype and 20% with the intermediate I phenotype. In the paper by Chiumello et al. [<xref rid="pone.0321533.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>], which sets the stage for a relatively normal compliance in patients with severe COVID-19 compared to other ARDS patient populations, there were 34% of patients with a H phenotype and 47% with an L phenotype on admission. Our asymmetry in proportions may have led to a loss of comparability between the L and H phenotypes because of limited data for L phenotype patients. Comparing the median duration of symptom evolution until hospitalization, which is similar to what is found in the literature [<xref rid="pone.0321533.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], and the median duration of hospitalization prior to ICU admission, we find a difference of 6 days. Given that after one week of symptom evolution, a proportion of patients are already evolving towards an H phenotype, our results suggest that a large proportion of our cohort were either in transition or already in an H phenotype.</p><p>Our choice of study entry date, which corresponded to the date of admission to the hospital, may therefore have been too late. The challenge of taking patients at the onset of symptomatology lies in the retrospective nature of our study in which the date of symptoms onset was declarative and early important spirometric and biological data unavailable.</p><p>Another important limitation is the small number of patients included in our study, leading to an asymmetry in the proportions of patients per phenotype. A solution to prevent this asymmetry would have been to include patients with a shorter duration of follow-up in the ICU. This would have allowed the inclusion of 47 additional patients in our cohort. However, the risk of having too much missing data guided our choice to exclude them from analysis.</p><p>Yet, in view of the overall results concerning the IL-6/KL-6 ratio, IL-6 and KL-6 concentrations, which seem to have similar levels across the different phenotypes without statistical significance, one may wonder whether these elements are simply not discriminating enough to distinguish the phenotypes, or whether we lacked statistical power. Gatinnoni et al. [<xref rid="pone.0321533.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] also concede that the COVID-19 ARDS phenotypes are temporally dynamic, not mutually exclusive, and therefore there may be overlap between them. This was also recently demonstrated to hold true in other non-COVID ARDS.[<xref rid="pone.0321533.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]</p><p>We may also wonder whether our study, which combines a single spirometric parameter (compliance, proposed in Gatinnoni&#x02019;s classification [<xref rid="pone.0321533.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]) with biological parameters, is sufficiently discriminative to decipher the phenotypes previously described. It is likely that the addition of supplementary parameters, and in particular CT scan analysis, would have enabled us to refine our results.</p></sec><sec id="sec029"><title>Prognostic and IL-6, KL-6, ratio IL-6/KL-6</title><p>One of the hypotheses of our study concerned the possible prognostic character of the IL-6/KL-6 ratio.</p><p>For IL-6, in our severe ICU cohort, we were able to demonstrate a statistically significant difference in mean levels between survivors and deceased patients over the first 28 days, which supports what has already been shown in the literature [<xref rid="pone.0321533.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0321533.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]; however, we did not show a difference in the time course of IL-6 levels over time between living and deceased patients. This difference in evolution, particularly between the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> week after the onset of symptoms in COVID-19 patients, has already been shown in the literature [<xref rid="pone.0321533.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0321533.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. The hypotheses that may underpin this lack of difference in relation to the literature lie in the type of population under study. For example, the study by Zhou <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0321533.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] assessed a population of patients with moderate to critical illness, and the mean IL-6 level may have been minimized over time in the survivors, compared with our cohort of more homogeneous severe ICU patients with much higher IL-6 levels even in the survivors. On the other hand, the number of patients in our cohort may not have been large enough to demonstrate such a difference. Furthermore, there was a significant loss of data after day 14 in the group of patients who died, due to this unfavorable evolution from day 15. It should be noted that the peak of IL-6 for deceased patients and survivors in our study was at the first follow-up timepoint which corresponds to a median of 8 days after the onset of symptoms. For survivors, this is consistent with what has been described in the literature. For instance, Santa Cruz <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0321533.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>] also found a peak of IL-6 in survivors between 7 and 10 days after the onset of symptoms. For deceased patients, the literature also shows an initial peak with a decreasing evolution of IL-6 over time [<xref rid="pone.0321533.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0321533.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. This notion of an initial peak is important in explaining the evolution of the IL-6/KL-6 ratio, which we will develop later.</p><p>Regarding KL-6, a very interesting result in our study is the inverse and statistically significant evolution of the mean KL-6 level during the 28 days of follow-up between the survivors and the deceased patients. Thus, for the deceased patients, we describe an initial peak with subsequent decrease. For the survivors, there was an increasing trend without a peak after 28 days of follow-up, which corresponds to about 1 month of evolution, as shown in the study by Deng <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0321533.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. This is the first study showing this evolution between survivors and decedents in a cohort of ICU patients with COVID-19 ARDS. Previously Kondo <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0321533.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>] compared KL-6 levels in ARDS patients over time between survivors and deceased patients. This study did not reveal any difference in the evolution of KL-6 levels in serum between these two populations, but it was found in bronchoalveolar fluid. It should be noted that in our study we did not find any difference in mean KL-6 between survivors and decedents, understandably so because of an inverse evolution of mean KL-6 levels over time with similar orders of magnitude.</p><p>The pathophysiological hypothesis of this inverse evolution is interesting. KL-6, which is a prognostic factor of severity in ARDS, interstitial lung disease and in COVID-19, is released by type II pneumocytes and in particular in greater quantities when there is damage to the alveolar-capillary membrane or in the process of regeneration linked to hyperplasia [<xref rid="pone.0321533.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0321533.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. This seems to explain the initial KL-6 level in survivors, with lower levels than in deceased patients because these are patients with less severe forms of ARDS [<xref rid="pone.0321533.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0321533.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. Subsequently, due to a mechanism of regeneration of these type II pneumocytes, and hyperplasia, fibrosis may occur in surviving COVID-19 patients [<xref rid="pone.0321533.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. The KL-6 level should therefore increase over time, in analogy to what is found in the follow-up of interstitial lung disease [<xref rid="pone.0321533.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0321533.ref080" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. In deceased patients, the KL-6 level is initially high in association with very severe ARDS [<xref rid="pone.0321533.ref081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. Afterwards, and potentially due to the absence of possible regeneration of type II pneumocytes in these patients with a poor outcome, the KL-6 level will progressively decrease.</p><p>All this suggests on the one hand that KL-6 is indeed a prognostic biomarker for mortality and on the other hand that it could allow clinicians to follow the fibrotic process in our ICU patients. This pathophysiological explanation remains an extrapolated hypothesis from our exploratory results and the published literature.</p><p>Finally, for the IL-6/KL-6 ratio, this is the first time that it has been analyzed as a possible prognostic factor according to living or deceased status. The only element highlighted was a more important kinetic decrease of the ratio for survivors than for deceased patients. This is evidenced by a statistically significant difference in the evolution of the mean log IL-6/KL-6 ratio in survivors between T1 and T5, which was not found in decedents. This decreasing kinetics for both survivors and deceased patients seems to be largely related to the evolution of IL-6; however, no difference in the overall mean or over time between survivors and decedents was found, (unlike IL-6), disqualifying the IL-6/KL-6 ratio as a suitable predictor of mortality.</p></sec><sec id="sec030"><title>Radio-biological correlates</title><p>Concerning the possible association between the IL-6/KL-6 ratio and lung damage as assessed by CT, this could be predictive of the severity of lung involvement in COVID-19 like IL-6 [<xref rid="pone.0321533.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] or KL-6 [<xref rid="pone.0321533.ref082" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>].</p><p>The PCA analysis unveiled a very interesting linear association between the IL-6/KL-6 ratio and ground glass lung volume, an association which was stronger than with IL-6. This suggests that the IL-6/KL-6 ratio may be predictive of the severity of certain typical lung lesions associated with COVID-19 ARDS. While an association between KL-6 blood concentration and lung involvement on semiquantitative CT score was already reported [<xref rid="pone.0321533.ref083" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>], our study reports a stronger correlate of IL-6/KL-6 ratio with ground glass volume in severe ventilated ICU patients. Moreover, it is also the first time that a comparison between two biomarkers is performed to determine which one better predicts the severity of lung lesions. The IL-6/KL-6 value in COVID-19 patients might be valuable to speed-up diagnostic workflow in symptomatic and hypoxemic patients in whom transfer to the CT facility is sometimes risky. Further studies evaluating this association will be necessary to confirm this potential breakthrough.</p></sec><sec id="sec031"><title>Strengths and limitations of the study</title><p>Our study had some strengths, which rely on innovative techniques and robust methodology. VP-Lab&#x000ae; software was used as a new tool for measuring lung volumes. This automated quantification is innovative, in a way that it can be used to monitor GROGLAS, which is a marker of the severity damage in COVID-19. Furthermore, static and dynamic modeling approaches were compared in patients with COVID-19-related ARDS [<xref rid="pone.0321533.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0321533.ref084" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. These studies revealed the added value of modeling variation as a function of time to understand the heterogeneity of ARDS. The dynamic pattern of COVID-19 ARDS was taken into account in our study with multiple clinical and biological analysis across different time points. Finally, the collaboration with a team of mathematicians with a solid biostatistics background, almost naive to the medical field, allowed the use of unsupervised and supervised Bayesian approaches for the processing of data, bringing a new perspective to what is usually done.</p><p>Our study also had some limitations. The main one being its retrospective nature with the inherent biases of this type of study. As a result, a significant amount of data was missing, which could have affected our results despite using a multiple imputation method. Another limitation is the monocentric nature of the study, which led to a selection bias. Third, 48% of our initial cohort was excluded to harmonize our population over time. This may have led to a selection bias that we accept for the sake of data completeness. Fourth, the fast-changing therapeutic regimen over time (discontinuation of choroquine, introduction of corticosteroids and tocilizumab) may have altered the levels of some cytokines, limiting the generalizability of our results. Fifth, the extra-regional transfer of the less severe patients to relieve the surge [<xref rid="pone.0321533.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] also led to a strong selection bias. Sixth, the failure to take into account all the elements defining phenotypes according to the classification of Gattinoni <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0321533.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] probably did not make it possible to be more discriminating in identifying the phenotypes described in his study. Seventh, measurement of cytokine levels in COVID-19 has low specificity. According to Liu et al. [<xref rid="pone.0321533.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], although cytokines such as IL-6, TNF-&#x003b1; and IFN-&#x003b3; are often used as biomarkers of inflammation in severe cases of COVID-19, their clinical interpretation remains complex. Indeed, cytokine levels can vary considerably between patients, making it difficult to establish precise thresholds for diagnosing or monitoring disease severity. Furthermore, the cytokine response is not specific to COVID-19, as elevated levels of cytokines can also be observed in other infections or inflammatory conditions. Therefore, this low specificity may reduce the usefulness of cytokine measurements to reliably predict clinical course. In addition, the variation in assay methods and delays in detection of cytokines in serum add to the complexity, limiting their usefulness in rapid and effective clinical decision-making. Measurement of overinflated lung volume would have been of real value with regards to lung compliance and response to PEEP [<xref rid="pone.0321533.ref085" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. Unfortunately, we were not able to decipher overdistension from emphysematous lung areas in the &#x0201c;overinflated&#x0201d; category defined by the software. Finally, to test the normality of the model, we had to express our biomarker values in logarithmic form after transformation, resulting in a loss of comparability of our rates with those found in the literature, and requiring us to consider trends only and not raw values.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec032"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This retrospective study is the first to cross-reference a new biomarker (IL-6/KL-6 ratio) with the L, I and H clinico-radiological phenotypes as described in the study by Gattinoni et al. no statistically significant difference was shown in the evolution of the ratio to decipher the 3 phenotypes at any time, and therefore we could not confirm our main hypothesis. The principal component analysis revealed that the log IL-6/KL-6 ratio was linearly related to automatically-determined ground glass volume on lung CT and may therefore be predictive of lung involvement in COVID-19. Other studies combining lung epithelial and endothelial biomarkers with clinical and CT criteria may facilitate the rapid distinction of COVID-19 ARDS phenotypes and pave the way for both ventilatory and drug-based personalized approaches.</p></sec><sec id="sec033" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material id="pone.0321533.s001" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S1 Data</label><caption><title>Demographic, clinical, spirometric and biological data of the included patient population.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0321533.s001.xlsx"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank Jo-Ann Elicia West, MSc, (<ext-link xlink:href="http://www.jewestms.com" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.jewestms.com</ext-link>) of KerWestPen Consulting SARL, an independent publication consultant in Cartigny L&#x02019;Epinay, France, for providing editorial and manuscript submission support, which was funded by H&#x000f4;pitaux Universitaires, Strasbourg, France in accordance with Good Publication Practice guidelines.</p><p>The authors thank also VP lab for their invaluable help in reconstructing the images.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0321533.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><collab>WHO</collab>.
