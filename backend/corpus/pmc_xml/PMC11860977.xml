The single-injection start regimen for aripiprazole once-monthly 400 mg (AOM 400) in patients with schizofrenia requires a single intramuscular injection in the gluteal or deltoid site and 14 days of concurrent oral therapy. Based on a population-pharmacokinetic model, the European Medicines Agency and Canada has recently approved a simplified starting strayegy of aripiprazole once a month with single-day regimen of two injections at separate gluteal and deltoid injection sites, together with a single 20 mg dose of oral aripiprazole on the 1<sup>st</sup> day.</p></sec><sec id="sec7791"><title>Objectives</title><p>The aim of the study is to evaluate the two injection start (TIS) regimen in inpatients in the Psichiatric Unit (SPDC) of the Hospital of Rimini.</p></sec><sec id="sec7792"><title>Methods</title><p>We retrospectively reviewed medical records of patients, from February 2021 to April 2023, that have more than 18 years, who received the newly approved 2-injection start regimen as part of their standard care, evaluating if exist changes in clinical indicators, safety and tolerability of this regimen.</p><p>We valuated retrospectively the days of hospitalization after the aripiprazole 400 mg TIS and the number of emergency room access, analyzing the &#x0201c;repository of AUSL della Romagna&#x0201d; and discharge letters and the &#x0201c;CURE&#x0201d; program of the Psychiatric Service of Rimini.</p></sec><sec id="sec7793"><title>Results</title><p>We evaluated 24 patients from February 2021 to April 2023, 11 male (45,8%), 13 female (54,2%); average age 37,95, average lenght of stay in hospital was 11,75 days. 10 patients with diagnosis of psychosis/schizophrenia (41,7%), 6 patients with bipolar disorder (25%), 4 patients with personality disorder (16,6%), 2 patients with substance induced psychosi (8,3%), 1 patients with delusional disorder (4,2%), 1 patient with schizoaffective disorder (4,2%). 6 patients had the two-injection start regimen in 2021 (25%), 13 patients in 2022 (54,2), 5 patients in 2023 (20,8%); 20 patients did not have admission in hospital after the TIS (83,3%), 4 patients had 1 or more admission after the injection (16,7%). 3 patients (12,5%) had accesses in emergency-room after Abilify Maintena. 15 patients (62,5%) continue therapy; 9 patients (37,5%) had suspended the injection for drop-out or because of change of therapy not correlated at adverse effects (1 female patient had suspended treatment after the two-injections due to pregnancy). Just 1 patient that continue Abilify Maintena 400 mg had 2 accesses in the emergency-room.</p></sec><sec id="sec7794"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The coadministration of 2 injections of 400 mg aripiprazole was not associated with safety concerns beyond those expected with a single-injection start regimen. From the study it appears that the long-acting therapy with Alibify Maintena 400 mg once-monthly helps to stabilize the patient to prevent hospitalization and accesses in emergency-room.</p></sec><sec id="sec7795"><title>Disclosure of Interest</title><p>None Declared</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="1"/></counts></article-meta></front></article>
