During adolescence, physical, physiological, psychological, social and emotional changes occur and there is an increase in emotional vulnerability. MBIs can bring benefits to this population, as they are already used in therapeutic processes, for instance. In the literature, studies involving MBIs with adolescents, eating behavior and body image are still incipient. Mapping the contexts and duration of MBIs can assist in the construction and implementation for researchers and clinicians in promoting dietary health and preventing situations such as body dissatisfaction/distortion and eating disorders. Thus, MBIs can be part of adjuvant treatments for these conditions.</p><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s40337-025-01238-6.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Adolescent</kwd><kwd>Body image</kwd><kwd>Feeding behavior</kwd><kwd>Mindfulness-based interventions</kwd><kwd>Mindful eating</kwd><kwd>Mindfulness</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par7">Adolescence is a phase of life characterized by physical, physiological, psychological and emotional changes.

During adolescence, this behavior is influenced positively or negatively by factors such as practicing restrictive diets, sharing family meals, conversations and teasing about weight among family members and other people important to adolescents, and self-assessment of body image [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par9">Disordered eating behavior or even an eating disorder can arise from environmental influences and lead individuals to an inadequate relationship with food and their body [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Sociocultural factors such as family, peers and the media play a role in the formation of adolescents&#x02019; body image, according to the Tripartite Influence Model of Thompson et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par10">Body image is the perspective that individuals have of their body: how they imagine themselves, see themselves, feel, perceive themselves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Their dissatisfaction generates consequences such as social, academic, professional, relationship, identity and cognitive losses, in addition to being associated with depreciation of sleep quality and a decrease in psychological well-being [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Body dissatisfaction makes it difficult to engage in self-care behaviors among young people, resulting in a risk for engaging in disordered eating behaviors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par11">Despite the influence of sociocultural factors on body image formation, it is important to mention that some of these can also act as protective factors.

MBIs can reduce concerns about weight/shape, in addition to acting on dietary restriction, reducing the Body Mass Index (BMI), eating in the absence of hunger, binge eating, increased willingness to eat new healthy foods and reduced psychopathology of eating disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p id="Par14">There is little research in the literature on MBIs, body image and eating behavior among adolescents (especially in universal prevention settings, such as schools).

The authors suggested that such interventions may be suitable for preventing and protecting adolescents from body dissatisfaction. The effects of the MaiStep protocol demonstrated a relationship with the reduction of negative affect. The authors found positive results in the avoidance of thoughts and behaviors related to body image in the total sample and a reduction in body dissatisfaction post-intervention in the group of adolescents who did not screen positive for eating disorders; however, this last result did not persist in follow-up. It is worth mentioning that the protocol used in the aforementioned study is based not only on mindfulness. Experience-based approaches, group discussions and role-playing are also part of the teaching methods used.

The main objective of this scoping review was to explore the benefits of MBIs and their relationships with body image and eating behavior in non-clinical adolescent populations. The results were the scarcity of the topic in the literature and the positive effects of MBIs on body image and eating behavior. Of the six studies selected, all were published in the last nine years, which demonstrates the relevance of the topic.</p><p id="Par50">Most studies took place in a school setting, and this can be considered a positive factor, given the importance of universal programs such as those applied in schools in prevention and/or identification of adolescents with subclinical or already established eating disorders who do not have access to the necessary interventions individually or who do not seek help [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p id="Par51">As for the sex of the populations, the majority worked with both sexes, and this is important since men, like women, suffer social pressure to adapt their bodies to hegemonic beauty standards and masculinity ideals, which can be a risk factor for eating behaviors and physical exercise practices that compromise health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Despite this, literature on the investigation of eating disorders in men is still scarce.</p><p id="Par52">The ages covered by the studies found in this review varied, making it possible to analyze the effects of interventions that used mindfulness in different age groups. Of the six studies analyzed, three found some positive relationship between interventions that used mindfulness, eating behavior and/or body image. Of these three studies that demonstrated some effect, all adopted the smallest time intervals for the duration of interventions, such as three [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], five [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] or six [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] weeks, and two covered the age range of 14&#x02013;18 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Johnson et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. mention that older adolescents present important differences in neurocognitive maturity, which may contribute to the effectiveness of MBIs, and this age group may respond better. However, older students may be more resistant to participating in MBI programs because they interfere with their study time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Possibly, interventions that last fewer weeks are more attractive to this audience, and this makes an exception to what Krebs et al.. propose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], who, studying MBIs in children and adolescents aged 9&#x02013;12 years, observed that interventions with shorter and more frequent sessions can be positive in maintaining participants&#x02019; involvement and attention.</p><p id="Par53">In 85% of studies found, there was follow-up. Atkinson and Wade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] highlighted the need for this follow-up, as there is an increase in the size of the effects throughout practice, i.e., mindfulness takes time to confer benefits. Despite carrying out follow-up after six months, the authors suggested longer follow-ups to monitor the potential of mindfulness in producing these benefits, including the importance of qualitative analyzes for discussing strong topics that quantitative data were unable to identify.</p><p id="Par54">Salmoirago-Blotcher et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], when using an adaptation of the traditional Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) program modified to meet adolescents&#x02019; needs during health education classes, they did not observe statistically significant differences in eating habits. The authors analyzed the effects before, immediately after the interventions and after six months, and one of the limitations cited was the collection of only one 24-hour recall.</p><p id="Par55">Using digital technologies such as an app is an approach that can attract adolescents. &#x0201c;The b@Ease Mindfulness App&#x0201d; was created for adolescents, aiming to encourage improvements in diet, physical exercise and sleep, in a flexible, light and fun manner. The interventions were successfully used to improve mindfulness with a focus on nutrition and physical exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Supporting these findings, Zhang, Q., O&#x02019;Connor, D.B. and Hugh-Jones, S [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]., studying the application of an MBI via a smartphone to Chinese adolescents living with excess weight, observed significant positive changes in eating behavior as well as the feasibility and effectiveness of the methodology. Using Information and Communication Technology (ICT) has the advantage of conveying information in a more interactive and personalized manner, having greater acceptance among young people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The strategy of &#x0201c;entering the world of adolescents&#x0201d; is necessary, and in order to directly reach this audience, there is a need to understand that a large part of their world takes place virtually. Taking advantage of this opportunity is a way to even bring more quality to screen time.</p><p id="Par56">Of the six articles selected by this scoping review, the study by Atkinson and Wade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] was the only one that observed effects of MBIs on both eating behavior and body image. Despite finding no relationship between mindfulness and negative affect, aiming to improve body image, the authors identified positive impacts of MBIs on concerns about weight and shape, sociocultural pressures as well as dietary restrictions, reinforcing that important findings such as these can act in eating disorder prevention in the adolescent population.</p><p id="Par57">A secondary data analysis described by Atkinson and Wade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] conducted by Osborne et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] demonstrated that MBIs reduced concerns about weight and body shape as well as negative affect, through improved emotional regulation. The authors cited that the effects of mindfulness may have a positive impact on factors such as diet and prevention of disordered eating behaviors.</p><p id="Par58">Observational evidence suggests that MBIs can act to reduce impulsivity&#x02013; a common characteristic of adolescents&#x02013; and thus improve issues related to eating [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] suggested that units or contents of programs that have proven to be effective in preventing eating disorders be compiled into a single program, thus avoiding wasting time creating other protocols.</p><p id="Par61">Among the studies analyzed in this scoping review, some authors cited difficulties in generalizing results due to the populations studied being too specific, small samples, large intervention groups -with difficulties in providing support to all participants, doubts regarding the need for an instructor with training in mindfulness as well as their expertise in practice with adolescents.</p><p id="Par62">This scoping review identified a variability in sample sizes. A small sample size can be seen as a limitation of this study; however, for conducting interventions, this factor can be seen as beneficial, as it provides more attention and individual instruction to participants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. We also identified in the selected studies a heterogeneity in the instruments used to assess eating behavior and body image as well as MBI protocols, with different educational resources, duration and frequency of meetings, presence of follow-up and training of facilitators.</p><p id="Par63">Some scientific gaps were identified, among which the definition of the ideal content and dosage for MBIs aimed at adolescents (frequency, duration of each meeting, application of follow-up) stand out. Johnson et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] highlighted that the identification of mediators and moderators can contribute important information to determine the ideal dose for this audience. Buerger et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] emphasized the need to establish ideal doses in universal prevention programs, in addition to suggesting that booster sessions be included to ensure the acquisition of long-term effects, a statement corroborated by other authors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Atkinson and Wade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] suggested that a 6-month follow-up is short when the aim is to prevent problems related to body image and eating behavior. The authors suggested that longer follow-ups may be beneficial for maintaining the observed effects. The suggestions raised are in line with something seen in this review and previously mentioned: the three studies that demonstrated the effects of MBIs on body image and eating behavior in adolescents adopted the shortest time intervals for the duration of the interventions: three [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], five [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] or six [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] weeks.</p><p id="Par64">Conducting research that adopts mixed methods can offer important contributions to filling many of these gaps. Qualitative analyses, in particular, allow for a deeper exploration of adolescents&#x02019; reflections on their impressions of the encounters, the topic, and the insights (reflections, feelings, thoughts, etc.) perceived during the practices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. In this regard, listening to participants&#x02019; opinions on aspects such as the content covered, the duration and number of meetings can guide the scientific community towards a more homogeneous and well-founded understanding.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par65">From the research carried out for this scoping review, it was possible to identify a lack of investigations that analyze the effect of MBIs on eating behavior and body image in adolescents.</p><p id="Par66">Through the studies investigated, we identified that MBIs and interventions that use mindfulness as part of their program appear to positively influence eating behavior (reducing dietary restrictions and symptoms of eating disorders) and body image acceptance (through improved emotional regulation and, consequently, negative affect). However, further research is needed to establish a more robust statement about the efficacy and mechanisms underlying these effects. Heterogeneity among the methodologies used was observed: variations in sample sizes, age groups and gender of participants, and protocols used, which prevents generalization of results to adolescents and corroborates the need to create an ideal protocol for practicing mindfulness with this population.</p><p id="Par67">Analyses using mixed methods can investigate participants&#x02019; perceptions about the most effective approach to implementing interventions, considering aspects such as duration and number of meetings. Such contributions can therefore provide valuable insights for improving future research involving MBIs, body image and eating behavior of adolescents.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.</p><p>
