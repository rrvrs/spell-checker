Microbial degradation plays a crucial role in mitigating its impact, yet complete mineralization pathways remain poorly understood. In this study, we isolated <italic>Micrococcus</italic> sp. F3Y, an oxyfluorfen&#x02012;degrading actinobacterium, and evaluated its degradation efficiency in yeast powder&#x02012;supplemented mineral medium (YPM) medium and oxyfluorfen&#x02012;contaminated soil. Optimal conditions, pH, temperature, initial optical density (OD<sub>600nm</sub>) were determined. Metabolites were analyzed via UPLC/Q&#x02012;TOF MS, and a putative gene cluster was identified through draft genome sequencing. Strain F3Y completely degraded 100 mg/L oxyfluorfen within 12 h under optimal conditions (pH 7.0, 30&#x000b0;C, OD600=2.0), maintaining over 55% efficiency at 25&#x02012;42&#x000b0;C and above 62% across a pH range of 6.5&#x02012;8.0. When the initial oxyfluorfen concentration was &#x02264;150 mg/L, the degradation rate exceeded 74%. Moreover, in oxyfluorfen&#x02012;contaminated soil (0.06 mg/kg), inoculation with strain F3Y restored soybean (<italic>Glycine max</italic>) growth, increasing shoot length from 4.22 cm (severely inhibited) to 28.8 cm, a nearly 7&#x02012;fold improvement. Additionally, F3Y achieved 98.2% degradation of oxyfluorfen (50 mg/kg) within 25 d in unsterilized soil. Eleven metabolites, including six new intermediates, were identified. Based on these, two novel degradation pathways were proposed: one initiated by nitro reduction and the other by diaryl ether cleavage. Both pathways culminated in aromatic ring opening and complete mineralization. In addition, a potential 24.3 kb gene cluster, <italic>pao</italic>, was suggested. Comprising thirteen genes, it was hypothesized to participate in the ring cleavage of intermediate products during oxyfluorfen degradation. This study provided the first comprehensive evidence of <italic>Micrococcus</italic> mediated oxyfluorfen mineralization, offering new insights into actinobacterial metabolic versatility. With its high degradation efficiency, environmental resilience, and detoxification ability, F3Y was an ideal candidate for bioremediation. These finding not only enhanced the understanding of herbicide degradation but also provided a sustainable solution to address oxyfluorfen contamination in agricultural and natural ecosystems.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>oxyfluorfen biodegradation</kwd><kwd><italic>Micrococcus</italic> sp.

The herbicidal activity of oxyfluorfen is attributed to its inhibition of protoporphyrinogen oxidase (PPO), which disrupts chlorophyll synthesis and hampers photosynthesis in plants (<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">Nandihalli et al., 1992</xref>; <xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">Phung and Jung, 2015</xref>). Its ultralow dosage requirement, high efficacy, long shelf life, and compatibility with various other herbicides make oxyfluorfen a cost&#x02013;effective solution (<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2022</xref>; <xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al., 2016</xref>). However, the environmental persistence of oxyfluorfen presents significant threats to both ecosystems and human health (<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">Majid et al., 2024</xref>; <xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2023</xref>; <xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">Mantzos et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">Mohamed et al., 2011</xref>). For instance, <xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">Hussein et al. (2012)</xref> indicated that oxyfluorfen may lead to a decrease or increase in the number of certain microorganisms, alter the diversity of microbial communities, and affect the metabolic activity of microorganisms in loam and sandy loam soils; <xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">Tejada et al. (2022)</xref> found that oxyfluorfen could reduce the relative abundance of Firmicutes and Acidobacteria in soil; <xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al. (2022)</xref> reported that oxyfluorfen disrupts zebrafish cellular migration and induces oxidative stress and apoptosis; <xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">Bonnar and Tjeerdema (2025)</xref> showed that oxyfluorfen accumulates significantly in Californian rice paddy sediments, degrading slowly under anaerobic conditions (half&#x02013;life &#x0003e;600&#x0202f;days), thereby elevating risks to benthic invertebrates and algal communities. Furthermore, emerging toxicological evidence has identified oxyfluorfen as an endocrine-disrupting compound. <xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">Murr et al. (2025)</xref> revealed that prepubescent male rats exposed to oxyfluorfen exhibited marked suppression of thyroid hormone synthesis, accompanied by delayed puberty onset, specifically, a 1.3&#x02013;3.5&#x02013;day deferral in preputial separation (a validated marker of rodent puberty), and reduced growth of androgen-sensitive tissues, including the prostate and seminal vesicles. These findings align with the U.S. EPA&#x02019;s classification of oxyfluorfen as a probable human carcinogen due to its documented carcinogenic potential (<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">Carmichael et al., 2016</xref>). Collectively, these findings highlight the critical need for developing efficacious remediation strategies to attenuate oxyfluorfen residues in ecosystems and mitigate their adverse environmental and health impacts.</p><p>Microbial degradation has gained significant recognition as an effective approach for oxyfluorfen remediation, owing to its superior efficiency, environmental compatibility, and economic viability (<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">Gao et al., 2024</xref>; <xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al., 2024</xref>). To date, several microbial strains with oxyfluorfen&#x02013;degrading capabilities have been identified, such as <italic>Bacillus licheniformis</italic> ATCC 21415 (<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">Tejada et al., 2022</xref>), <italic>Bacillus methylotrophicus</italic> A1 and <italic>Streptomyces</italic> sp.

(<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">Chakraborty et al., 2002</xref>). These comprehensive studies have elucidated specific metabolites and proposed corresponding metabolic pathways. However, although these strains demonstrated distinct degradation routes, they all shared a common shortcoming in attaining complete mineralization. That is, none of them could fully transform oxyfluorfen into inorganic end products. While <xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al. (2025)</xref> have identified cytochrome P450, methyltransferases, glycosyltransferases, and acetyltransferases as key enzymes participants in oxyfluorfen degradation in rice (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic>), and <xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">Bhatt (2017)</xref> revealed <italic>B methylotrophicus</italic> A1 and <italic>Streptomyces</italic> sp. B1 degrade oxyfluorfen via laccase and esterase, respectively, the molecular mechanisms governing microbial degradation of this herbicide remained largely elusive. Significant gaps persist in our understanding of both the enzymatic pathways involved and their associated genetic regulation mechanisms.</p><p><italic>Micrococcus</italic>, a genus of gram&#x02013;positive, non&#x02013;spore&#x02013;forming actinomycetes within the family <italic>Micrococcaceae</italic>, demonstrates remarkable environmental ubiquity, colonizing diverse habitats ranging from activated sludge and soil ecosystems to human skin microbiota, cryospheric environments, dairy waste systems, and atmospheric samples. Although nine distinct species have been taxonomically classified within this genus, few of them have demonstrated significant catabolic potential towards both natural and xenobiotic compounds (<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2022</xref>). In this study, the strain <italic>Micrococcus</italic> sp. F3Y, capable of utilizing oxyfluorfen as its sole energy source for growth and completely degraded it, was isolated from activated sludge. The underlying degradation mechanisms were elucidated based on the comprehensive analysis of intermediate metabolites and genomic prediction of potential catabolic genes. Furthermore, the bioremediation potential of strain F3Y in oxyfluorfen&#x02013;contaminated soil systems was evaluated by employing soybean plants as biological indicators to assess detoxification efficiency. This investigation not only expanded the known microbial resources for oxyfluorfen degradation but also provided novel insights into the metabolic versatility of the <italic>Micrococcus</italic> genus in xenobiotic compound transformation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec3"><label>2.1</label><title>Chemicals and media</title><p>Oxyfluorfen (&#x0003e;98% purity) was purchased from Sigma&#x02013;Aldrich Chemical Co., Ltd.

An activated sludge sample was collected from the aerobic tank of a wastewater treatment system at an oxyfluorfen production facility (32.54&#x000b0;N, 121.07&#x000b0;E) located in Nantong City, Jiangsu Province, China. 10&#x0202f;g of the sample was added to 100&#x0202f;mL of MSM medium with the addition of 50&#x0202f;mg/L oxyfluorfen. The mixture was incubated at 30&#x000b0;C on a rotary shaker at 160&#x0202f;rpm for 7 d. The enrichments were performed over five rounds, and the concentration of oxyfluorfen increased by 10&#x0202f;mg/L each round. The enrichment solution with degradation effects was subsequently serially diluted, spread onto LB agar plates, and cultured at 30&#x000b0;C for 3 d. The different single colonies were picked, purified by the spread plate method. The oxyfluorfen&#x02013;degrading abilities of the strains were detected using a UV&#x02013;1800 spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Japan). Initially, the strains were cultured in LB liquid medium at 30&#x000b0;C until they reached the logarithmic growth phase.

Triplicate cultures were incubated at 30&#x000b0;C with constant agitation at 150&#x0202f;rpm. A control group without bacterial inoculation was included to account for abiotic degradation processes. After 24&#x0202f;h of incubation, the culture filtrates were collected and extracted with an equal volume of dichloromethane.

The oxyfluorfen&#x02013;degrading ability of each strain was evaluated by comparing the absorbance changes of the samples from different strains with that of the control sample. Based on these results, a pure strain named F3Y, which exhibited the highest degradation efficiency, was selected for further investigation.</p><p>The morphology of F3Y cells was observed via transmission electron microscopy (H&#x02013;7650; Hitachi). 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis and identification of the bacterium were performed as described by <xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al.

Pathway A began with the direct cleavage of the diaryl ether bond, resulting in the immediate formation of M3. This intermediate might undergo either hydroxyl oxidation to produce M4 or nitro reduction to yield M7. Both M4 and M7 were subsequently converted through complementary reactions (nitro reduction and hydroxyl oxidation, respectively) to form the presumed intermediate 4&#x02013;amino&#x02013;5&#x02013;ethoxybenzene&#x02013;1,2&#x02013;diol (M12). Following <italic>N</italic>&#x02013;acetylation, M12 was transformed into M5, which underwent aromatic ring cleavage to produce M10. Pathway B initiated with the nitro reduction of oxyfluorfen, followed by <italic>N</italic>&#x02013;acetylation to form metabolite M1. The subsequent hydrolysis of the diaryl ether bond in M1 generated M6, which may undergo <italic>O</italic>&#x02013;demethylation to produce (2&#x02013;ethoxy&#x02013;4&#x02013;hydroxyphenyl)acetamide carbamic acid (M13) (not detected in this study). M13 was then transformed into M8 through hydroxyl oxidation, followed by aromatic ring cleavage to yield the final product M9. The terminal products from both pathways were ultimately assimilated into the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Additionally, M11 might be derived from an intermediate product generated during the cleavage of the oxyfluorfen and M1 ether bond, which was not detected due to its low concentration or instability in the HPLC analysis.</p><fig position="float" id="fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Proposed metabolic pathway of oxyfluorfen degradation by strain F3Y.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fmicb-16-1599015-g004" position="float"/></fig></sec><sec id="sec14"><label>3.5</label><title>Genes related to oxyfluorfen metabolism</title><p>The draft genome of strain F3Y was sequenced to identify potential genes associated with oxyfluorfen metabolism. The genome assembly revealed a total size of 2,485,282 base pairs (bp) with a G&#x0202f;+&#x0202f;C content of 73.44%. Sequence assembly resulted in 148 contigs, with an N50 length of 50,633 bp. Gene prediction identified 2,166 protein&#x02013;coding sequences (CDSs) in the draft genome. Functional annotation of these CDSs was performed through comprehensive homology analysis against multiple databases, including NR, KEGG, COG, and Swiss&#x02013;Prot. Notably, genes potentially involved in oxyfluorfen degradation and intermediate metabolism were supposed and summarized in <xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S3</xref>. In the draft genome scaffold of strain F3Y, a 24,284&#x0202f;bp gene cluster named <italic>pao</italic> was proposed. This cluster consisted of thirteen genes, namely <italic>paoY</italic> and <italic>paoABCDEFGH1H2IKZ</italic> (as shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). Among these genes, <italic>paoY</italic> was determined to encode phenol&#x02013;2&#x02013;monooxygenase, an enzyme known to catalyze the hydroxylation of phenol to catechol. Given the structural similarity between phenol and several identified metabolites (M3, M6, M7, and M13), we hypothesized that <italic>paoY</italic> may similarly hydroxylate these phenolic intermediates during oxyfluorfen degradation. The remaining twelve genes appeared to constitute a complete phenylacetic acid (PhAc) degradation pathway, organized into four functional modules: (<italic>i</italic>) PhAc activation, <italic>paoK</italic> encoded a phenylacetyl&#x02013;CoA ligase (PhAc&#x02013;CoAL), which convert PhAc to PhAc&#x02013;CoA; (<italic>ii</italic>) ring&#x02013;hydroxylation, <italic>paoABCDE</italic> encoded the five subunits of phenylacetyl&#x02013;CoA epoxidase, forming a multicomponent complex for PhAc&#x02013;CoA hydroxylation; (<italic>iii</italic>) ring cleavage, <italic>paoZ</italic> encoded a bifunctional ring&#x02013;opening enzyme; and (<italic>iv</italic>) <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>&#x02013;oxidation&#x02013;like system, <italic>paoFGHI</italic> encoded enzymes homologous to fatty acid <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>&#x02013;oxidation components (enoyl&#x02013;CoA hydratase, isomerase, dehydrogenase, and thioesterase). Comparative genomic analysis revealed striking conservation of this cluster across diverse bacteria.

While bacteria within this phylum were primarily recognized for their ability to synthesize bioactive compounds, their potential for degrading organic pollutants has received comparatively less attention. Nevertheless, few researches have demonstrated the functional degradation of recalcitrant compounds by <italic>Micrococcus</italic> species. For instance, <italic>M. yunnanensis</italic> strain HY001 was reported to reduce soil paclobutrazol residue by 75.18% over 5&#x0202f;months (<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">Jiang et al., 2025</xref>); <italic>M. flavus</italic> RS124 effectively degraded high-density polyethylene (<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">Sardar, 2025</xref>); <italic>M. aloeverae</italic> MAGK3 degraded 66.65% of 500&#x0202f;&#x003bc;L/L malathion within 15 d (<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">Dar et al., 2022</xref>); and <italic>M.</italic> sp. KS2 achieved 99.67% degradation of 289.19&#x0202f;mg/L dimethyl phthalate under optimal conditions (pH 7.05, 31.5&#x000b0;C) (<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">Patil and Jena, 2023</xref>). <italic>Micrococcus</italic> sp. F3Y was demonstrated to utilize oxyfluorfen as a carbon source for growth and completely degrade the herbicide in the present study. Further exploration of the metabolic capabilities of this strain will not only highlight the versatility of <italic>Actinomycetota</italic> but also expand our understanding of their ecological roles, particularly their biodegradation potential, beyond their well-established capacity for secondary metabolite production.</p><p>To date, several strains capable of degrading oxyfluorfen have been isolated and characterized. Strain <italic>B licheniformis</italic> ATCC 21415 was used to ferment sewage sludge to prepare two biostimulants BS1 and BS2, which were used and found decrease the concentration of oxyfluorfen by 37.5 and 25%, respectively, after 72 d (<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">Tejada et al., 2022</xref>). <italic>B methylotrophicus</italic> A1 and <italic>Streptomyces</italic> sp. B1 demonstrated 450&#x0202f;mg/L oxyfluorfen degradation efficiencies of 81.33 and 79.75%, respectively, over 15 d in minimal media (<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">Bhatt, 2017</xref>). <italic>A. chroococcum</italic> (Beijerinck) demonstrated the ability to degrade 60% of 240&#x0202f;mg/L oxyfluorfen within 7 d (<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">Chakraborty et al., 2002</xref>), and <italic>S. wittichii</italic> RW1 degraded approximately 75% of 100&#x0202f;mg/L oxyfluorfen within 7 d in M9 medium (<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">Keum et al., 2008</xref>). Additionally, <italic>C. aquifrigidense</italic> R21 achieved a degradation rate of 92.1% for 50&#x0202f;mg/L oxyfluorfen within 5 d (<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al., 2016</xref>). Other reported strains exhibited degradation efficiencies of on higher than 95.6% for 45&#x0202f;mg/L oxyfluorfen within 21 d (<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">Mohamed et al., 2011</xref>). Although these strains possessed the ability to degrade oxyfluorfen at relatively high concentrations, their degradation rates and extents were markedly lower compared to those of F3Y. Under optimized conditions, F3Y could completely mineralize 100&#x0202f;mg/L of oxyfluorfen within 12&#x0202f;h. Furthermore, the strain maintained robust degradation efficiency across various environmental conditions, removing over 62% of 100&#x0202f;mg/L oxyfluorfen within a pH range of 6.5&#x02013;8.0, and retaining more than 55% degradation efficiency at temperatures between 25&#x02013;42&#x000b0;C. Additionally, F3Y achieved a degradation rate exceeding 74% when the initial oxyfluorfen concentration was &#x02264;150&#x0202f;mg/L. This striking difference highlighted the exceptional catalytic activity and adaptability of F3Y. Morever, F3Y exhibited remarkable soil remediation efficiency, alleviating oxyfluorfen&#x02013;induced phytotoxicity in soybean (shoot length recovery to 82% of controls) and degrading 98.2% of the herbicide in unsterilized soil, which significantly surpassing the degradation by native microbiota (40.94%). This finding suggested synergistic interactions between F3Y and indigenous microbes (the impact data of strain F3Y on soil microbial community was not displayed), highlighting its practical applicability in agricultural soil remediation.</p><p>Here, the intermediate and terminal products were identified so as to elucidate the complete degradation pathways of oxyfluorfen by strain F3Y. The results revealed that strain F3Y primarily degraded oxyfluorfen through two distinct initial modes, initiated by either nitro reduction or diaryl ether cleavage. Although these initial reactions align with those reported in other oxyfluorfen&#x02013;degrading bacteria (<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">Keum et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">Chakraborty et al., 2002</xref>), the subsequent reactions and the extent of degradation differ significantly, highlighting the unique metabolic capabilities of strain F3Y. In the first pathway, M3, generated through direct diaryl ether cleavage of oxyfluorfen, underwent a series of transformations, including monooxygenation, nitro reduction, and <italic>N</italic>&#x02013;dealkylation, to form M4 and M5. These two compounds, identified as novel intermediates in oxyfluorfen degradation, were detected for the first time in this study. Subsequently, M5 was converted into M10 through ring-opening reactions, ultimately entering the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle for complete mineralization. However, <italic>A. chroococcum</italic> (<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">Chakraborty et al., 2002</xref>) and <italic>C. aquifrigidense</italic> R21 (<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al., 2016</xref>) convert M3 into 4&#x02013;nitrobenzene&#x02013;1,3&#x02013;diol via <italic>O</italic>&#x02013;dealkylation, with no further transformation of this compound. In the second pathway, oxyfluorfen initially degraded by nitroreduction, and then underwent <italic>N</italic>&#x02013;acetylation and ether bond cleavage to generate M6. Strain F3Y could further converte M6 into a newly identified intermediate, M8, through <italic>O</italic>&#x02013;demethylation and monooxygenation. M8 was then transformed into the final product M9, which entered the TCA cycle, achieving complete mineralization. In <italic>A. chroococcum</italic> and <italic>C. aquifrigidense</italic> R21, the same intermediate M6 was also iedtified, but the two strain did not have the ability to further utilize and degrade M6. Notably, strain F3Y also exhibited the ability to degrade chlorinated organic compounds, as evidenced by the formation of M11 through the opening of the chlorobenzene ring in the oxyfluorfen structure. This capability highlighted the strain&#x02019;s potential to effectively mitigate the toxicity of oxyfluorfen to sensitive plants during bioremediation processes, particularly in environments contaminated with chlorinated pollutants. In conclusion, this study provided a comprehensive understanding of the metabolic fate of oxyfluorfen in strain F3Y. We detected a greater number of intermediate compounds compared to previous studies, and both metabolic pathways demonstrated the ring-opening degradation processes and ultimately lead to its complete mineralization. These findings underscore the complex and efficient degradation mechanisms employed by strain F3Y, offering valuable insights for the bioremediation of oxyfluorfen&#x02013;contaminated environments.</p><p>Although the <italic>pao</italic> gene cluster was initially hypothesized to participate in oxyfluorfen degradation, a closer examination revealed a more nuanced role. The widespread presence of the <italic>pao</italic> core genes in both oxyfluorfen&#x02013;degrading strains like <italic>S. wittichii</italic> RW1 and non&#x02013;degrading strains such as <italic>M. luteus</italic> NCTC 2665 and <italic>E. coli</italic> K12, along with their conserved synteny, strongly suggested that this cluster primarily functions in the metabolism of aromatic compounds. This was a function that has been conserved across a diverse range of bacterial lineages. To illustrate this point, consider the <italic>paa</italic> operon, which has been identified in <italic>E. coli</italic> W (<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">Grishin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">Fern&#x000e1;ndez et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">Ferr&#x000e1;ndez et al., 1998</xref>) and <italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic> (<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">Hooppaw et al., 2022</xref>). Similarly, the <italic>pha</italic> operon has been reported in <italic>Pseudomonas putida</italic> U (<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">Olivera et al., 1998</xref>). These operons, which were homologous to <italic>pao</italic>, endowed bacteria with the ability to utilize a wide array of aromatic compounds as sources of carbon and energy. This included substances like phenylacetic acid (<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">Sathyanarayanan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">Teufel et al., 2010</xref>), 2&#x02013;phenylethylamine, phenylacetaldehyde, trans&#x02013;styrylacetic acid, styrene, and various phenylalkanoic acids with an even number of carbon atoms (<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">Grishin et al., 2011</xref>). In the case of strain F3Y, the <italic>pao</italic> cluster might play a part in the ring&#x02013;cleavage of oxyfluorfen intermediates, such as M5 and M8. However, its presence in non&#x02013;degrading strains clearly indicated that it alone was insufficient for oxyfluorfen degradation. Instead, the unique ability to degrade oxyfluorfen likely depended on additional enzymes. For example, nitroreductases or ether hydrolases might be required for the initial nitro reduction or diaryl ether cleavage steps. These enzymes could then work in tandem with the <italic>pao</italic> pathway to achieve complete mineralization of oxyfluorfen.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec16"><label>5</label><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this study, an actinobacteria strain F3Y, capable of utilizing oxyfluorfen as the sole carbon source for growth, was isolated from activated sludge and taxonomically identified as <italic>Micrococcus</italic> sp. Under laboratory conditions, strain F3Y exhibited efficient oxyfluorfen degradation, with optimal performance at pH 7.0, 30&#x000b0;C, initial pollutant concentrations &#x02264;150&#x0202f;mg/L, and a cell density of OD<sub>600nm</sub>&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;2.0. Notably, F3Y achieved &#x0003e;98% removal of 50&#x0202f;mg/kg oxyfluorfen in soil within 25 d, concurrently alleviating its phytotoxic effects and restoring soybean growth to near&#x02013;normal levels. Eleven degradation products were identified, six of which are reported here for the first time. Two distinct initial degradation pathways were proposed, both involving aromatic ring cleavage and completel mineralization of oxyfluorfen. A conserved <italic>pao</italic> gene cluster was proposed, which was hypothesized to participate in the aromatic ring cleavage of degradation intermediates (e.g., M5, M8). However, its presence in both degrading and non&#x02013;degrading strains suggested that it functions as part of a broader aromatic metabolism network, with strain&#x02013;specific enzymes likely responsible for the initial steps of oxyfluorfen degradation. These findings enhance our understanding of the biochemical pathways underlying oxyfluorfen degradation and provide a foundation for developing innovative bioremediation strategies.</p><p>While laboratory results are promising, the applicability of F3Y for <italic>in situ</italic> bioremediation requires validation in real&#x02013;world agricultural systems, where environmental conditions differ significantly from controlled settings. The strain&#x02019;s functional pH range (6.5&#x02013;8.0) aligns with neutral to slightly alkaline farmland soils (typical pH 5.5&#x02013;8.0), and its temperature tolerance (25&#x02013;42&#x000b0;C) partially overlaps with seasonal temperate in temperate to tropical regions (15&#x02013;35&#x000b0;C), suggesting potential for seasonal deployment during warmer periods (e.g., spring or summer) to leverage its 30&#x000b0;C optimum. Given that oxyfluorfen residues in agricultural soils typically range from 0.002&#x02013;0.03&#x0202f;mg/kg (well below the 50&#x0202f;mg/kg tested in this study), F3Y is likely effective for remediating conventional contamination levels. However, challenges remain for translating laboratory findings to field applications, including enhancing the strain&#x02019;s environmental adaptability, persistence, and stability across diverse soil types and climatic conditions. Future research should prioritize these aspects to facilitate the practical implementation of F3Y&#x02013;based bioremediation technologies.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn0001"><p>
