The study will span 6 months, with assessments at baseline (T0), and with follow-ups at 1 month (T1), 3 months (T2), and 6 months (T3) post intervention. The primary outcome measure is CPAP adherence, defined as using the CPAP device for more than 70% of sleep time, with a minimum of 4 hours per night. Secondary outcomes will evaluate the common adverse effects associated with CPAP therapy, device usability, and time required for CPAP machine use education.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>This study is funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan (August 2023 to July 2026) and was registered in August 2024 (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT06520592).

It has been associated with significant health risks, including cardiovascular diseases [<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], cognitive impairment [<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], and decreased quality of life [<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy is a strongly recommended treatment for OSA according to the clinical practice guidelines of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. It effectively mitigates the associated risks by maintaining airway patency during sleep [<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. However, adherence to CPAP therapy remains a significant challenge, as many patients struggle to use the device consistently due to physical discomfort [<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and lack of proper guidance or without follow-up care [<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Guiding patients in disease-related knowledge through educational materials to change their adherence to medical treatment is a commonly used method in clinical practice [<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, the effectiveness of guiding middle-aged and older individuals through printed educational materials is often limited. Kim and Oh [<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] conducted qualitative interviews with 16 frontline nurses in South Korea and attempted to examine the situation of older adults in receiving health education and health literacy through their perspective. The study found that older adults struggle to understand educational content due to declines in physical and cognitive functions.</p><p>The Information-Motivation-Behavioral Skills model suggests that patients&#x02019; adherence behavior is driven by their level of information, motivation, and behavioral skills [<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Augmented reality (AR) applications have the potential to significantly enhance patient adherence to therapeutic regimens through engagement and understanding [<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. AR applications can provide personalized real-time information in an engaging format. A systematic review and meta-analysis, which included 11 articles, found that AR can be a tool in physiotherapy to improve older adults&#x02019; balance, especially in patients with Parkinson disease [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In addition, AR can enhance motivation through interactive features, such as progress tracking and gamification, which make the therapy experience more rewarding [<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Ideally, by guiding patients in the correct use of their devices, AR can also enhance the behavioral skills necessary for successful adherence.</p><p>Previous studies have explored various interventions to improve CPAP adherence, including standardized care procedures [<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], cognitive behavioral therapy [<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], troubleshooting [<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], and telemonitoring [<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. However, the integration of AR technology into CPAP management is a novel approach. Limited research has been conducted on the application of AR in this context, making this study one of the first to investigate its potential impact on OSA management. By addressing the gap in the literature, this study aims to contribute to the growing body of knowledge on innovative strategies to enhance adherence to CPAP therapy.</p><p>This study hypothesizes that AR-guided CPAP therapy can enhance patient engagement and understanding of CPAP therapy among patients with OSA, and patients receiving AR-guided CPAP therapy will show higher adherence rates compared to those receiving standard care.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study Design</title><p>This parallel group randomized controlled trial is designed to evaluate the effectiveness of AR-guided CPAP therapy on patient adherence among individuals diagnosed with OSA. Participants will be randomly assigned to either the experimental group (AR-guided therapy) or the control group (standard care) by the blocking sample method. Aside from the AR component, both groups will receive identical standard care. An assistant researcher (Ms Ng) generated the random allocation sequence, case managers enrolled participants with OSA, and an assistant researcher (Ms Jhong) assigned participants to interventions. In this study, we will blind assessors and investigators. The study will follow participants over 6 months, with data collection points at baseline (T0), and follow-ups at 1 month (T1), 3 months (T2), and 6 months (T3) post intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Participants</title><p>Patients with OSA will be randomly assigned to either the experimental group or the standard care group.</p><sec><title>Inclusion Criteria</title><p>Our study will enroll adults 20 years or older diagnosed with moderate to severe OSA (Apnea-Hypopnea Index &#x02265;15) confirmed by polysomnography who are CPAP therapy naive at the time of enrollment.</p></sec><sec><title>Exclusion Criteria</title><p>We will exclude those with previous use of positive pressure ventilators, a diagnosis of central sleep apnea, a presence of uncontrolled acute mental illness, or a terminal illness.</p></sec><sec><title>Sample Size</title><p>The sample size was determined based on a power analysis conducted for the CPAP adherence rate.

A power of 0.85 was used to detect a significant difference at <italic>P</italic>=.05 (2-sided).

Adherence refers to the patient&#x02019;s adherence to CPAP therapy, which means using CPAP for more than 70% of the total sleep time during the night, with a minimum duration of 4 hours. The calculation method involves dividing the number of days with CPAP use exceeding 4 hours by the total number of days and multiplying by 100 to obtain the average percentage of CPAP use [<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Subjective Measure: Adherence to CPAP Therapy Questionnaire</title><p>We developed a self-assessed CPAP adherence and comfort levels questionnaire to allow participants to track their daily adherence and comfort levels, providing a comprehensive overview of their subjective CPAP experience.</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Adherence is defined as using CPAP for at least 70% of total sleep time per night, with a minimum duration of 4 hours.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Comfort levels are self-rated on a 0 to 10 scale, where 0 is extremely uncomfortable and 10 is extremely comfortable.</p></list-item><list-item><p>If participants experience discomfort, they will be asked to document the specific reasons contributing to their discomfort (<xref rid="app1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Multimedia Appendix 1</xref>).</p></list-item></list><p>This structured daily assessment enables a detailed evaluation of patient experiences, helping to identify potential barriers to CPAP use and providing valuable insights into factors influencing adherence and comfort over time.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Secondary Outcomes</title><sec><title>Common Adverse Effects Associated With CPAP</title><p>Common discomforts of using CPAP were collected and categorized based on symptoms identified by Australian scholars Ghadiri and Grunstein [<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Device Usability</title><p>At the end of the study, participants will fill out a system usability scale (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Multimedia Appendix 2</xref>) to evaluate system usability. This scale is a questionnaire assessing the usability of emerging technologies or systems, consisting of 10 items scored from 0 to 4 (from strongly disagree to strongly agree). The overall score is then multiplied by 2.5, with a maximum score of 100. According to Sauro [<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], based on nearly 500 studies, a score of 68 is used as the benchmark for the system usability assessment: if the score is greater than 68, it indicates that the system&#x02019;s usability is above 50%; if it is less than 68, the opposite is true.</p></sec><sec><title>Accuracy of Estimated Nasal Size</title><p>The AR system&#x02019;s recommended nasal size compared to the case manager&#x02019;s estimation shows an agreement rate approaching 95% at T0.</p></sec><sec><title>Time Required for CPAP Machine Use Education</title><p>We will calculate the time during the initial education session, hands-on training, patient questions and answers, and troubleshooting guidance at T1.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Covariates</title><sec><title>Demographic Data</title><p>We will collect participants&#x02019; gender, height, weight, waist circumference, blood pressure values, education level, presence of other comorbidities (eg, hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, cancer), smoking habits (none, once a week, once a month, once a year), drinking habits (none, once a week, once a month, once a year), exercise habits (none, once a week, once a month, once a year), history of being diagnosed with mental health disorders, napping habits, and the approximate duration of naps.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Indicators</title><p>The Apnea-Hypopnea Index, average blood oxygen saturation, and minimum blood oxygen saturation will be measured through polysomnography and a CPAP machine.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Procedure</title><p>Participants diagnosed with moderate to severe OSA through polysomnography will be assessed for their willingness to participate in the study by the principal investigator.

Specifically, the study focuses on facilitating the selection of appropriately fitting mask sizes, providing hands-on training on proper mask use, and offering troubleshooting support. If the hypothesis is validated, AR technology could emerge as a powerful tool to enhance patient engagement and address machine interface barriers to CPAP adherence, such as discomfort, leakage, and lack of motivation. The study&#x02019;s results could have broader implications for the management of OSA and other chronic conditions that require long-term adherence to therapeutic regimens.</p></sec><sec><title>Comparison to Prior Work</title><p>Previous studies have explored telemonitoring and cognitive behavioral therapy to improve CPAP adherence, but research integrating AR technology into CPAP management remains limited. By addressing this gap, our study contributes to the growing evidence on technology-assisted interventions for chronic disease management.</p></sec><sec><title>Strengths and Limitations</title><p>A strength of this study is the comprehensive assessment of adherence, incorporating both objective adherence tracking and subjective self-reported adherence evaluation. This multidimensional approach enhances the study&#x02019;s ability to identify barriers to CPAP adherence and potential intervention strategies to improve long-term compliance. Additionally, this study has a randomized controlled design, which enhances the validity and reliability of the findings. Another strength is that the integration of AR technology allows for real-time patient education and support, which has the potential to improve CPAP adherence through enhanced engagement and interactive learning.</p><p>However, some potential limitations should be considered. First, generalizability may be limited due to the specific population studied. Since the study is conducted in a single region with a particular demographic profile, findings may not be fully applicable to other populations with different cultural, socioeconomic, or health care structures. Second, the novelty of AR technology may present implementation challenges, particularly among older adults or patients with low technology literacy, potentially limiting the accessibility and effectiveness of the intervention. Lastly, variations in AR device compatibility across different CPAP models could pose practical barriers to widespread adoption.</p></sec><sec><title>Future Directions</title><p>To address these limitations, future research should explore multicenter studies across diverse populations and investigate strategies to enhance AR accessibility for less tech-savvy users, such as simplified interfaces or additional training modules.</p></sec><sec><title>Dissemination Plan</title><p>The results of this study will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications, conference presentations, and clinical workshops. Additionally, findings may inform the development of AR-based educational modules for sleep medicine practitioners.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study is expected to provide valuable insights into the role of AR-guided CPAP therapy in improving adherence among patients with OSA. By integrating real-time interactive guidance, the intervention aims to enhance patient engagement, improve mask fitting, and address adherence barriers such as discomfort and lack of motivation. While findings from this study may support the use of technology-driven interventions in CPAP management, further research will be needed to explore long-term effectiveness, broader applicability across different populations, and strategies to optimize accessibility for patients with lower technology literacy. If validated, this study could inform future clinical practice by integrating AR-based patient education and support tools into standard CPAP care, potentially improving adherence and long-term treatment outcomes for patients with OSA.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was supported by grants from the Ministry of Science and Technology, Executive Yuan of Taiwan (MOST 112-2628-B-006-013-MY3).
