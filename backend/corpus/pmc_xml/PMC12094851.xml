Although various reconstructive strategies exist, the use of a vascularized chin fat flap (CFF) for mandibular soft tissue restoration has not been previously reported. We describe a 61-year-old woman with stable ECDS and anterior mandibular depression. After disease stabilization with methotrexate, a pedicled fat flap was harvested from the submental region and inset via a single incision while preserving its native vascular supply. At six months, the patient exhibited sustained volume, restored facial symmetry, excellent scar quality, and no complications. The CFF combines vascular reliability, anatomical compatibility, and minimal invasiveness. Its ability to achieve natural, long-lasting results in a single stage, potentially under local anesthesia, makes it a promising alternative to conventional methods such as fat grafting, fillers, or implants in ECDS-related facial atrophy.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>autologous reconstruction</kwd><kwd>chin fat flap</kwd><kwd>facial atrophy</kwd><kwd>localised scleroderma</kwd><kwd>mandibular reconstruction</kwd><kwd>scleroderma en coup de sabre</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Scleroderma en coup de sabre (ECDS) is a rare subtype of linear scleroderma characterized by linear, atrophic depressions affecting the face or scalp, typically along Blaschko&#x02019;s lines [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. With an estimated prevalence of 0.4-2.7 per 100,000 individuals, ECDS predominantly affects females (approximately 3:1 female-to-male ratio) and typically presents during childhood or adolescence, although adult-onset cases occur [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>-<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. ECDS is thought to result from a localized autoimmune process that induces inflammatory fibrosis and microvascular dysfunction, leading to progressive atrophy of the skin, subcutaneous tissue, and occasionally bone [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Although not life-threatening, ECDS can cause progressive atrophy of the skin, subcutaneous fat, and underlying bone, resulting in facial asymmetry and psychosocial distress. The condition typically progresses through an inflammatory phase lasting two to five years, followed by persistent residual deformities [<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Up to 64% of patients develop osseous involvement, complicating reconstruction [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Medical therapy, particularly methotrexate, is the primary treatment to halt progression, demonstrating high efficacy when initiated early [<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. A minimum disease-free interval of six to 12 months is recommended before surgical intervention [<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Reconstructive options for correcting soft tissue deficits in ECDS include autologous fat grafting, hyaluronic acid (HA) fillers, dermal-fat grafts, botulinum toxin, alloplastic implants, tissue expanders, and free flaps [<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>-<xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However, challenges persist due to unpredictable volume retention, multiple procedural requirements, and donor-site morbidity [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Reconstructive efforts in this population are further complicated by poor tissue pliability, compromised vascularity, increased fibrosis, and the potential risk of disease reactivation triggered by surgical manipulation [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The inherently thin and tethered overlying skin also complicates the achievement of natural contours and symmetry with conventional techniques [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Given these limitations, this report introduces the vascularized chin fat flap (CFF) as a novel, anatomically compatible, and minimally invasive reconstructive option for lower facial volume restoration in stable ECDS. Here, we describe the surgical approach and evaluate its position within current reconstructive strategies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="cases"><title>Case presentation</title><p>A 61-year-old woman presented with a longstanding, progressive linear depression extending from her forehead to the left anterior mandible. She had not received prior treatment and was diagnosed with ECDS at the age of 60. Following one year of methotrexate therapy (10 mg/week), the disease stabilized clinically, and she was subsequently referred to our Department of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery at the University of the Ryukyus Hospital for correction of mandibular contour.</p><p>Clinical examination revealed a sharply demarcated atrophic depression measuring approximately 8 cm in length and 1-2 cm in width, with a depth ranging from 3 to 8 mm. Digital analysis estimated an affected surface area of approximately 14 cm&#x000b2;. Quantitative analysis of the CT scan data demonstrated a 32% soft tissue volume deficit on the affected side compared to the contralateral side. Although CT scan is not traditionally the first-line modality for superficial soft tissue assessment, it allowed reliable volumetric comparison of subcutaneous tissue depth in this case. This objective measurement was instrumental in determining the required dimensions for the planned reconstruction. While dedicated virtual surgical planning software was not utilized, standardized photographic analysis and CT-based volumetric comparison guided our flap design. The overlying skin appeared thin and tethered (Figure <xref rid="FIG1" ref-type="fig">1A</xref>, <xref rid="FIG1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>).</p><fig position="anchor" fig-type="figure" id="FIG1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Preoperative views</title><p>(A) Frontal view showing a depressed lesion on the left anterior mandible.

Differential diagnoses methodically excluded included Parry-Romberg syndrome (PRS, due to lack of deeper tissue and neurological involvement), traumatic or postsurgical scarring (ruled out by clinical history and lesion progression), linear morphea without craniofacial involvement (dismissed based on strictly facial localization), post-radiation atrophy (excluded by absence of radiation history), and hemifacial microsomia (eliminated given the clearly acquired and progressive presentation). This comprehensive diagnostic evaluation confirmed stable ECDS, thus providing a solid foundation for the subsequent reconstructive approach.</p><p>Preoperative markings were made to guide scar excision and flap design (Figure <xref rid="FIG2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>).</p><p>Under general anesthesia (GA), a 7.2 cm incision was made along the mentolabial fold to excise the scar and release adhesions (Figure <xref rid="FIG3" ref-type="fig">3A</xref>). Given the moderate volume deficit, local tissue availability, and patient preference for minimal morbidity, a pedicled fat flap measuring 5.3 cm &#x000d7; 3.2 cm &#x000d7; 1.8 cm (approximately 30.5 cm&#x000b3;) was harvested from the right submental region through the same incision. Dissection was performed in a submuscular plane, carefully preserving the mentalis and depressor muscles. The vascular pedicle, approximately 1.2 cm wide, included branches from the facial, submental, and mental arteries (Figure <xref rid="FIG3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>).</p><fig position="anchor" fig-type="figure" id="FIG3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Intraoperative flap harvest</title><p>(A) Scar excision and exposure of atrophic tissue.

The patient was advised to limit strenuous activity and excessive facial movement for two weeks. Sutures were removed on postoperative day 7, and gentle massage was initiated at three weeks.</p><p>At six months postoperatively, the flap remained volumetrically stable. Caliper measurements demonstrated correction within 1 mm of the contralateral side, and three-dimensional photographic analysis confirmed a 91% restoration of the preoperative volume deficit. The patient reported high satisfaction, rating her outcome as 9/10 on a visual analogue scale. The Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS) yielded excellent scar quality scores of 12/60 (patient assessment) and 9/60 (observer assessment). No complications were observed (Figure <xref rid="FIG5" ref-type="fig">5B</xref>, Figure <xref rid="FIG6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Given the limited existing data on long-term outcomes of CFF reconstruction in ECDS, annual follow-up visits were scheduled to assess sustained flap viability and aesthetic stability.</p><fig position="anchor" fig-type="figure" id="FIG6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>Six-month postoperative oblique view confirming volume maintenance and symmetry</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="cureus-0017-00000082741-i06" position="float"/></fig></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This case demonstrates the feasibility and favorable outcomes achievable through the use of a vascularized CFF for mandibular contour restoration in a patient with stable ECDS. Although various reconstructive methods have been described to address soft tissue atrophy in ECDS, each carries trade-offs related to invasiveness, durability, and predictability. To our knowledge, this is the first report describing the application of a pedicled CFF specifically for this indication.</p><p>Autologous fat grafting remains the most commonly employed technique due to its simplicity, repeatability, and tissue compatibility. However, unpredictable graft resorption often necessitates multiple procedures to achieve satisfactory symmetry [<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Dermal fillers, such as HA, represent minimally invasive alternatives offering immediate aesthetic results; however, their temporary nature and risk of foreign-body granulomatous reactions limit their long-term utility [<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Botulinum toxin can effectively address dynamic asymmetry but provides no volumetric restoration [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>More invasive methods, including tissue expansion, free flaps, and bone grafting, can adequately correct larger or more complex deformities but are technically demanding and carry significant risks of morbidity [<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="REF14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Alloplastic implants and bone cement offer durable structural solutions but pose substantial risks of infection, extrusion, and aesthetic mismatch [<xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. A recent review of 39 ECDS patients reported that autologous fat grafting was utilized in 41% of cases, surgical reconstruction in 18%, and implants in 10% [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. This discussion integrates established methods with recent clinical reports, such as patient-level outcomes detailed by Skorochod et al. [<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and the combined fat graft and demineralized bone matrix series presented by Menk&#x000fc; &#x000d6;zdemir et al. [<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], thus positioning the CFF within contemporary reconstructive approaches.

As a pedicled, vascularized flap harvested from adjacent adipose tissue, it provides reliable perfusion, anatomical compatibility, and minimal donor-site morbidity, all achievable through a single-stage procedure. The concept of utilizing local submental fat tissue for chin augmentation was first described by Robertson in 1965, who developed a double CFF with preserved blood supply for chin enhancement [<xref rid="REF15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Later, Hamra expanded on techniques for addressing the aging chin through mentalis-periosteal flap advancement [<xref rid="REF16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Our application adapts these foundational concepts specifically for facial volume restoration in ECDS, preserving the key principle of vascular integrity while tailoring the approach to address the unique challenges of localized scleroderma.</p><p>The submental region is richly vascularized by branches of the facial artery, specifically the submental and mental arteries (Figure <xref rid="FIG7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>) [<xref rid="REF17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In our patient, the flap was elevated within a submuscular plane, carefully preserving facial musculature. It was inset without tension and securely anchored to the periosteum. At six months postoperatively, the flap demonstrated stable volume retention with 91% restoration confirmed by three-dimensional photographic analysis, and patient satisfaction was excellent.</p><fig position="anchor" fig-type="figure" id="FIG7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><title>Schematic illustration of flap perfusion anatomy</title><p>The submental region receives blood supply from the FA and its branches: SMA, ILA, and MA. The lateral pedicle preserves vascular continuity during CFF elevation.</p><p>CFF, chin fat flap; FA, facial artery; ILA, inferior labial artery; MA, mental artery; SMA, submental artery</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="cureus-0017-00000082741-i07" position="float"/></fig><p>Compared to fat grafting, the inherent vascularity of the CFF may reduce resorption and enhance long-term volume retention. Unlike free flap procedures, the CFF eliminates the need for microsurgical expertise and significantly shortens operative time. Moreover, aligning the flap with the natural mentolabial groove resulted in inconspicuous scarring and a harmonious aesthetic transition, validated by favorable POSAS scores. Although additional contouring procedures such as autologous fat grafting, HA, or dermal fillers were not indicated at this stage due to the excellent initial results and sustained volume retention, these adjunctive treatments were discussed with the patient preoperatively and at follow-up visits as options should residual or future contour discrepancies emerge. The reliable vascularization of the CFF provided distinct advantages over fat grafting alone, particularly in maintaining stable volume and reducing the need for repeated interventions.</p><p>While this is a single case report and therefore has limited statistical generalizability, we incorporated objective and semi-objective assessments where appropriate. These included caliper-based thickness comparison, validated scar scoring using POSAS, and a patient-reported visual analogue scale rating for satisfaction. Future studies may benefit from incorporating additional tools such as magnetic resonance imaging for volumetric monitoring and the Facial Appearance-Related Psychosocial Impact Questionnaire (FACE-Q) to standardize patient-reported aesthetic and quality-of-life outcomes.</p><p>PRS, which shares overlapping clinical characteristics with ECDS, has been similarly addressed using local volume augmentation techniques [<xref rid="REF18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Despite differences in etiology, both conditions may benefit substantially from autologous, vascularized soft tissue reconstruction.</p><p>While the procedure was performed under GA in this study, the limited operative field and minimal dissection suggest it could alternatively be performed under local anesthesia (LA) with appropriate nerve blocks, potentially offering reduced recovery time and hospital stay for suitable candidates.</p><p>This approach is best suited for moderate-volume defects in patients with adequate submental adiposity. However, it may be inappropriate for cases with extensive or multi-zone facial atrophy. Short-term results were favorable, but the absence of longer-term follow-up and the limitation of this single-case report restrict the generalizability of the findings. Further studies involving larger cohorts and prolonged observation periods are necessary to validate the technique&#x02019;s durability, refine patient selection criteria, and assess long-term aesthetic and functional outcomes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This case demonstrates the clinical utility of the vascularized CFF as an effective and underutilized option for mandibular soft tissue reconstruction in stable ECDS. The single-incision technique enables reliable volume restoration using adjacent, vascularized tissue, minimizing morbidity and eliminating the need for implants or microsurgery. Our patient achieved over 90% volumetric restoration, excellent scar quality, and high satisfaction at six months.</p><p>The CFF is best suited for moderate-volume defects in patients with adequate submental fat and may be feasible under LA. While early outcomes are promising, further studies with larger cohorts and longer follow-up are necessary to confirm durability and define optimal indications. This report supports the CFF as a valuable addition to the reconstructive armamentarium for facial atrophy in ECDS.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group content-type="conflict"><title>Disclosures</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Human subjects:</bold> Consent for treatment and open access publication was obtained or waived by all participants in this study.</p><p><bold>Conflicts of interest:</bold> In compliance with the ICMJE uniform disclosure form, all authors declare the following:</p><p><bold>Payment/services info:</bold> All authors have declared that no financial support was received from any organization for the submitted work.</p><p><bold>Financial relationships:</bold> All authors have declared that they have no financial relationships at present or within the previous three years with any organizations that might have an interest in the submitted work.</p><p><bold>Other relationships:</bold> All authors have declared that there are no other relationships or activities that could appear to have influenced the submitted work.</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="other"><title>Author Contributions</title><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Concept and design:</bold>&#x000a0; Naoki Matsuura, Yuki Odagiri, Yusuke Shimizu</p><p><bold>Drafting of the manuscript:</bold>&#x000a0; Naoki Matsuura, Yuki Odagiri, Yusuke Shimizu</p><p><bold>Supervision:</bold>&#x000a0; Naoki Matsuura, Yusuke Shimizu</p><p><bold>Acquisition, analysis, or interpretation of data:</bold>&#x000a0; Yuki Odagiri, Edward H.
