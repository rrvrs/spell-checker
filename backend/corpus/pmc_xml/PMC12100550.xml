impact climate, air quality, and human health. Hydroxyl dicarboxylic
acids (OHDCA) are generally of secondary origin and ubiquitous in
the atmosphere, with high concentrations in South China. This study
explored the formation of representative OHDCA species based on time-resolved
measurements and explainable machine learning. Malic acid, the most
commonly studied OHDCA, had higher concentrations in the noncontinental
air (63.7 &#x000b1; 33.3 ng m<sup>&#x02013;3</sup>) than in the continental
air (7.5 &#x000b1; 1.4 ng m<sup>&#x02013;3</sup>). Machine learning quantitatively
revealed the high relative importance of aromatics and monoterpenes
SOA, as well as aqueous processes, in the noncontinental air, due
to either shared precursors or similar formation pathways. Isoprene
SOA, particle surface area, and ozone corrected for titration loss
(O<sub>
<italic toggle="yes">x</italic>
</sub>) also elevated the concentrations
of malic acid in the continental air. Aqueous photochemical formation
of malic acid was confirmed given the synergy between LWC, temperature,
and O<sub>
<italic toggle="yes">x</italic>
</sub>. Moreover, the OHDCA-like SOA might
have facilitated a relatively rare particle growth from early afternoon
to midnight in the case with the highest malic acid concentrations.
This study enhances our understanding of the formation of OHDCA and
its climate impacts.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical"><graphic xlink:href="vg4c00119_0009.jpg" position="float"/></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc-graphic"><graphic xlink:href="vg4c00119_0007.jpg" id="tgr1" specific-use="not-for-print" position="float"/></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>hydroxyl dicarboxylic acid</kwd><kwd>malic acid</kwd><kwd>secondary

the climate.<named-content content-type="bibref-group">

necessitate the understanding of sources

fruits and used as food additives, evidence for their direct release

</named-content> Using thermal desorption aerosol
gas chromatography coupled with time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TAG),
we conducted time-resolved measurements of organic aerosol (OA) molecular
markers, including OHDCA, at a coastal background site. The results
suggested that anthropogenic emissions were likely a primary source
of OHDCA precursors and that certain environmental conditions (e.g.,
high relative humidity, highly aged continental outflows and ship
emissions) might have promoted the formation of OHDCA.<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr"/> A subsequent study at the same site confirmed
that the elevated levels of OHDCA were related to aqueous-phase photooxidation
of both biogenic and anthropogenic precursors, and the limiting factors
for OHDCA formation differed between coastal and continental air.<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr"/> In summary, the OHDCA are a type of relatively
aged SOA species with diverse precursors and complex formation mechanisms.
The previous research findings on the chemistry of OHDCA in HK were
qualitative in nature, and there is a lack of quantitative understanding
of the factors regulating OHDCA concentrations. Moreover, the implications
of OHDCA on climate have not been well understood.</p><p>In this study,
we conducted an intensive field campaign at a mountainous
site in HK in November 2021, with time-resolved measurements of submicron
particulate matter (PM<sub>1</sub>) components, molecular OA markers,
including four OHDCA species, size-resolved particle number concentrations,
and other supporting data. The potential precursors and influencing
factors of OHDCA formation were identified, and their relative importance
and synergistic effects were quantitatively assessed by explainable
machine learning. The role of OHDCA-like SOA in particle growth was
unraveled in a case with the highest levels of OHDCA for the entire
sampling period. The results of this study enhance our understanding
of OHDCA formation mechanisms and provide some insights for refining
air quality and climate models.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec2.1"><label>2.1</label><title>Sampling Campaign</title><p>With the elevation
of 957 m a.s.l., Mount Tai Mo Shan (Mt. TMS) is the highest peak in
HK and located in the central part of the land. During November 6&#x02013;14,
2021, the sampling campaign was conducted at a youth hostel on the
mountainside (22.405&#x000b0; N, 114.118&#x000b0; E, 640 m a.s.l.), as shown
in <ext-link xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsenvironau.4c00119/suppl_file/vg4c00119_si_001.pdf" ext-link-type="uri">Figure S1</ext-link>. To the south of the site,
a bustling town with a dense population, advanced transportation networks,
and a busy freight harbor lies at the foothills. The mesoscale circulation,
i.e., mountain-valley breeze, was shown to be capable of transporting
air pollutants from the foot of the mountain to the site.<named-content content-type="bibref-group">
<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr"/>,<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr"/>
</named-content> Biogenic emissions were also likely to be a significant source of
volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the study area due to the dense
vegetation cover. Affected by the COVID-19, there were few visitors
to the youth hostel, except for a small influx of campers during the
weekends. Additionally, the site was influenced by inland air from
the neighboring mainland to the north, especially in the cool seasons.</p><p>The Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT)
model was employed to compute the 48 h backward trajectories of air
masses arriving at the site hourly. Meteorological data were sourced
from the Global Data Assimilation System archive, with a horizontal
resolution of 1&#x000b0; &#x000d7; 1&#x000b0;. To avoid incorrect grid sampling
in mountainous and valley areas, atmospheric pressure was used as
a proxy for modeling height, as adopted by Lyu et al.<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr"/> During the sampling period, the average observed atmospheric
pressure at the site was 950 hPa. The hourly trajectories were classified
into three clusters, according to their origins and paths. The 80.4%
of trajectories originating from and passed over mainland China were
defined as continental air (orange trajectories in <ext-link xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsenvironau.4c00119/suppl_file/vg4c00119_si_001.pdf" ext-link-type="uri">Figure S1</ext-link>), the 12.4% from the South China Sea represented
marine air (blue trajectories), and the remaining 7.2% was close to
the coastline and denoted coastal air (brown trajectories). The latter
two are collectively referred to as noncontinental air in this study.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><label>2.2</label><title>Measurement Techniques</title><p>A PM<sub>1</sub> cyclone was installed at the entry point of the particulate matter

to quantitatively measure OA markers, including OHDCA. It was the
first commercially available TAG developed by Aerodyne Research Inc.
in conjunction with the University of California, Berkeley. Detailed

desorption cell. After the derivatization of polar compounds by <italic toggle="yes">N</italic>-methyl-<italic toggle="yes">N</italic>-(trimethylsilyl)&#x000ad;trifluoroacetamide,
the samples were transferred to a focusing trap to expel the nontarget
compounds. Then, the remaining species were analyzed by gas chromatography
coupled to time-of-flight mass spectrometry. We set a relatively long
sampling duration (90 min) to ensure that the mass loading of many
OA markers was high enough to be analyzed. Besides, the sample treatment,
sample transfer, and other intermediate steps occupied an additional
30 min. The sample analysis was synchronized with the collection of
the next sample. Therefore, a complete TAG cycle had a duration of
2 h, and the bihourly data represented the average over the 90 min
sampling period every 2 h.</p><p>The OA markers were identified based
on their retention times and ion fragments followed by peak fitting
and integration and response-to-concentration conversion (calibration).
A fixed amount of internal standard (IS) mixture was injected onto
each sample and subjected to exactly the same treatment, transfer,
and analysis procedures as ambient samples. The mixture was composed
of dozens of deuterated or <sup>13</sup>C-containing compounds in
a wide range of volatility, chemically resembling but different from
the target compounds.<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr"/> This was to track
and correct for any changes in the instrument sensitivity and retention
time drift. The response curves were made by analyzing authentic or
surrogate standards at five different concentrations in the same manner
as that for ambient samples. <ext-link xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsenvironau.4c00119/suppl_file/vg4c00119_si_001.pdf" ext-link-type="uri">Table S1</ext-link> lists

To enhance the robustness of the results, the observational data obtained
in an earlier sampling campaign at a coastal background site (Hok
Tsui) was combined with the TMS data. This combination was based on
the fact that there were few anthropogenic emissions around both sites
and that the two measurements were conducted using the same instruments
by us. The Hok Tsui data was presented and discussed in a previous
paper.<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr"/> Except for the Sa, the two sets
of data were highly consistent in terms of analytical techniques and
species detected. The SMPS used in the two field campaigns differed,
leading to a discrepancy in the scanning range of the particle size
distribution. Given the strong correlation between Sa and PM<sub>1</sub> (<ext-link xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsenvironau.4c00119/suppl_file/vg4c00119_si_001.pdf" ext-link-type="uri">Figure S2</ext-link>), we used the concentration
of PM<sub>1</sub> instead of Sa as an input of the RF model. Besides,
the LWC data was incomplete in the Hok Tsui dataset, owing to a long
period of AMS maintenance. With sulfate, nitrate in fine particulate
matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>), and other parameters as input, the RF was
employed to simulate the missing LWC data at Hok Tsui. The predicted
LWC agreed moderately with the calculated values, with an <italic toggle="yes">R</italic>
<sup>2</sup> of 0.53 (<ext-link xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsenvironau.4c00119/suppl_file/vg4c00119_si_001.pdf" ext-link-type="uri">Figure S3</ext-link>).</p><p>The variables were selected based on prior knowledge and
the results of this study that imply relationships between malic acid
and influencing factors (see <xref rid="sec3.2" ref-type="sec">Section <xref rid="sec3.2" ref-type="sec"/>
</xref>). We selected the OA markers that might
reflect potential precursors or formation pathways of malic acid,
such as 2,3-dihydroxy-4-oxopentanoic acid (DHOPA) and 2-methylglyceric
acid (2-MGA). Some factors indicating chemical processes were also
adopted: LWC and sulfate for aqueous processes, O<sub>
<italic toggle="yes">x</italic>
</sub> for photochemical processes, and PM<sub>1</sub> (proxy for
Sa) to reflect the role of particle surfaces. Additionally, the temperature
was selected due to its influence on a wide range of chemical reactions.
The physical implications of these variables are listed in <ext-link xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsenvironau.4c00119/suppl_file/vg4c00119_si_001.pdf" ext-link-type="uri">Table S3</ext-link>. Next, we tested the model with other
variables, such as solar radiation, wind direction, wind speed, gaseous
pollutants (e.g., CO), and OA markers (e.g., levoglucosan, mannosan,
palmitic acid, and fructose). However, the model performance did not
improve, as indicated by the decrease in <italic toggle="yes">R</italic>
<sup>2</sup> and relatively low importance for these variables (<ext-link xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsenvironau.4c00119/suppl_file/vg4c00119_si_001.pdf" ext-link-type="uri">Figure S4</ext-link>). To test the impact of HT data on the results,
ML was trained on the combined dataset and the TMS data only. We did
not see significant differences in the ranking of the relative importance
of the variables. However, due to significant underpredictions for
the three highest concentrations and an overprediction for one low
concentration, the model trained on TMS data alone showed a much worse
performance in replicating the observed malic acid concentrations,
with the <italic toggle="yes">R</italic>
<sup>2</sup> of 0.32 compared to its counterpart&#x02019;s <italic toggle="yes">R</italic>
<sup>2</sup> of 0.79. Thus, we adopted the results of ML
trained on the combined dataset.</p><p>A total of 394 sets of valid
data were fed into the ML model (87
from TMS and 307 from Hok Tsui). The data were randomly divided into
two subsets, and 80% of the data was used to train the model and the
remaining 20% for validation. Hyperparameter tuning was performed
using 5-fold cross-validation with a grid search approach. The key
hyperparameters optimized included the number of trees (n_estimators),
maximum tree depth (max_depth), and the minimum number of samples
required to be at a leaf node (min_samples_leaf). The optimal hyperparameters
were n_estimators = 600, max_depth = 30, and min_samples_leaf = 1.
The model&#x02019;s accuracy was confirmed using 10-fold cross-validation.
As shown in <ext-link xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsenvironau.4c00119/suppl_file/vg4c00119_si_001.pdf" ext-link-type="uri">Figure S3</ext-link>, the model performance
is reasonably good, with the <italic toggle="yes">R</italic>

tartaric acid had the highest concentration (160.2 &#x000b1; 53.4 ng

malic acid.</p><p>
<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"/>

were the highest in the marine air (3.8 &#x000b1; 1.3 &#x003bc;g m<sup>&#x02013;3</sup>), followed by that in the most common continental

(1.8 &#x000b1; 0.4 &#x003bc;g m<sup>&#x02013;3</sup>). Similarly, the concentrations
of some SOA tracers, such as DHOPA, 2-MGA, 2-methyltetrols (2-MTs),
and 3-hydroxy-4,4-dimethylglutaric acid (HDMGA), were also significantly
increased in the marine air (<ext-link xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsenvironau.4c00119/suppl_file/vg4c00119_si_001.pdf" ext-link-type="uri">Figure S6 and Table S4</ext-link>). With an average concentration of up to 554 &#x000b1; 375
ng m<sup>&#x02013;3</sup>, the marine air also witnessed the highest
level of OHDCA for the entire sampling period at 4:00 am on November
7. This was in contrast to the prevailing notion that marine air is
relatively clean. In fact, the marine air descended and passed over
the urban areas of HK before arriving at the site (<ext-link xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsenvironau.4c00119/suppl_file/vg4c00119_si_001.pdf" ext-link-type="uri">Figure S7</ext-link>). Sea-land breezes might also be involved in this
process and brought secondary air pollutants formed in the offshore
areas during the day to the site (<ext-link xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsenvironau.4c00119/suppl_file/vg4c00119_si_001.pdf" ext-link-type="uri">Figure S8</ext-link>). These mesoscale circulations were indirectly proved by the elevated
levels of many primary (e.g., CO, NO<sub>
<italic toggle="yes">x</italic>
</sub>,
levoglucosan, and mannosan) and secondary air pollutants (e.g., O<sub>3</sub>, nitrate, and sulfate) in the case with the highest OHDCA.
Thus, the emissions in the urban areas might have replenished the
precursors of SOA including OHDCA (see <xref rid="sec3.3" ref-type="sec">Section <xref rid="sec3.3" ref-type="sec"/>
</xref>). Besides, the wind speed was the lowest
in the marine air case (0.4 &#x000b1; 0.2 m s<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>), which
tended to facilitate air pollutant accumulation. The highest temperature
(22.9 &#x000b1; 1.6 &#x000b0;C) could also contribute to biogenic emissions
and subsequent formation of SOA, including 2-MGA, 2-MTs, and HDMGA,
which might be further enhanced by the highest LWC. Our recent studies
indeed suggested that the high levels of OHDCA observed at Hok Tsui
were formed through aqueous photooxidation processes.<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr"/>

Although the high levels of primary air pollutants (e.g., NO<sub>
<italic toggle="yes">x</italic>

SOA formation, the concentrations of many SOA tracers including the
anthropogenic DHOPA were notably reduced, indicating that SOA formation
was suppressed by the unfavorable meteorological conditions. The concentration
of total OHDCA was also the lowest in continental air (89.5 &#x000b1;

for this unexpected diurnal pattern remain unclear. An exception occurred
in the case of marine air, where synchronized variations of malic

It is also worth noting that malic acid correlated moderately with
4-OHBA, a tracer of biomass burning (BB) and BB-derived SOA. However,
there was no correlation between malic acid and levoglucosan or mannosan.
Previous studies<named-content content-type="bibref-group">

Although plastic incineration also releases 4-OHBA,<xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr"/> other coemitted tracers were not detected and there existed
a strong correlation between 4-OHBA and vanillic acid in the continental

the contributions of some types of BB, which remain to be clarified.</p><p>Moreover, malic acid also showed close relationships with O<sub>

increase <italic toggle="yes">R</italic>

be explained by the possibility that the aqueous formation of malic
acid requires certain levels of oxidants, which is supported by the
synergistic effect of O<sub>

acid formation, as discussed in <xref rid="sec3.3" ref-type="sec">Section <xref rid="sec3.3" ref-type="sec"/>

environment for chemical reactions.<xref rid="ref47" ref-type="bibr"/> The
correlation of malic acid with Sa indicated that the aerosol surface
offered favorable conditions for malic acid formation, such as surface
adsorption of precursors and the provision of water and oxidants.
It is worth noting that the three samples with malic acid concentrations
higher than 200 ng m<sup>&#x02013;3</sup> also witnessed proportionally
high levels of O<sub>
<italic toggle="yes">x</italic>

these factors were likely to enhance malic acid formation, even for
the three nighttime samples. Further, the slopes of the regression
lines for the noncontinental air were consistently higher than those
for the continental air. We suspect that there were other reasons
besides the aforementioned factors that made malic acid formation
more efficient in the marine and coastal air.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.3"><label>3.3</label><title>Relative Importance and Combined Effects of
Influencing Factors</title><p>To understand in a more holistic way
the relative importance of the factors influencing malic acid concentrations,
we employed the RF algorithm and calculated the SHAP values of the
factors (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"/>

Based on the mean absolute SHAP values at TMS (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"/>

affecting malic acid concentrations due to shared precursors (aromatics)

The lower but still positive SHAP values of 2-MGA implied a weak connection
with isoprene oxidation under high-NO<sub>

in the absolute SHAP values, respectively, reiterating the important

of LWC and O<sub>
<italic toggle="yes">x</italic>

pronounced when the LWC and O<sub>
<italic toggle="yes">x</italic>
</sub> rose simultaneously.
This provides strong evidence for aqueous photochemical formation
of malic acid, a process that was proposed but not fully substantiated
previously.<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr"/> Besides, a similar synergy
was also identified between LWC and temperature, as well as between
O<sub>
<italic toggle="yes">x</italic>

of aqueous processes, also increased malic acid concentrations alongside
the levels of O<sub>
<italic toggle="yes">x</italic>
</sub>, temperature, and PM<sub>1</sub>, with the effect being particularly pronounced at higher
sulfate levels. The inconsistent effects of LWC and sulfate at their
low levels might be due to their different thresholds for indicating
aqueous processes and/or stimulating malic acid formation. Particle
surface area (represented by PM<sub>1</sub>) also showed some synergies
with the other factors, which however were weaker, as indicated by
the contours being more parallel to the PM<sub>1</sub> axis (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig"/>

except that the effect of DHOPA was much less dependent upon the factors
including LWC, O<sub>

temperature with unknown reasons. Despite this, there was still an
enhancement of malic acid concentration with an increase in LWC or

the differences. It was found that DHOPA contributed the most (55.6%,
31.0 ng m<sup>&#x02013;3</sup>) to the increase in malic acid concentrations
in the noncontinental air, followed by LWC (24.1%, 13.4 ng m<sup>&#x02013;3</sup>), PA (7.2%, 4.0 ng m<sup>&#x02013;3</sup>), HDMGA (6.6%, 3.7 ng m<sup>&#x02013;3</sup>), and sulfate (4.0%, 2.3 ng m<sup>&#x02013;3</sup>). Therefore, it was likely that aqueous-phase oxidation of aromatics
and monoterpenes, and/or the similar formation pathways of their resulting
SOA, caused the increase in malic acid concentrations in the noncontinental
air. While the effects of the other factors are understandable, the
significant contribution of aromatics, if presented as precursors,
was surprising. As discussed above, the noncontinental air masses
with high levels of malic acid might have carried aged land-based
air pollutants from offshore areas and passed through urban areas
before arriving at the site. Namely, the critical role of aromatics
could be explained by urban emissions and aging under mesoscale circulations.
However, this did not necessarily mean that continental air lacked
aromatic compounds. Instead, it was likely the unfavorable meteorological
conditions (e.g., low relative humidity) that inhibited the oxidation
efficiency of aromatics. Conversely, the SHAP value of O<sub>

</xref>b, the high values of continental malic acid
were mainly associated with PA, DHOPA, and 2-MGA, demonstrating the
mixed contributions of multiple precursors including monoterpenes,
aromatics, and isoprene and/or similar formation pathways of malic
acid with these SOA tracers. As isoprene SOA tracers, the ratio of
2-MGA to 2-MTs in the continental air was 11.2 times higher than in
noncontinental air, which might explain the different effects of 2-MGA
(a proxy for isoprene oxidation in NO<sub>
<italic toggle="yes">x</italic>
</sub>-rich environments) on malic acid concentrations in the two types
of air masses. Additionally, the particle surface area (represented
by PM<sub>1</sub>) and O<sub>
<italic toggle="yes">x</italic>
</sub> also elevated
malic acid concentrations. In contrast to the positive difference
for sulfate, the difference in the SHAP value for LWC between samples
above and below the fifth percentile was negative. Again, this could
be due to the inconsistent thresholds of sulfate and LWC in indicating
aqueous processes. Given that sulfate in the continental air had much
lower concentrations and could be formed through nonaqueous pathways,
aqueous formation seemed not to be a primary factor leading to the
increase in malic acid concentrations in the continental air.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.4"><label>3.4</label><title>Implications for Particle Growth</title><p>Particle growth significantly affects the climate effects of atmospheric
particulate matter.<named-content content-type="bibref-group">
<xref rid="ref48" ref-type="bibr"/>,<xref rid="ref49" ref-type="bibr"/>
</named-content> Here, we focus on a special event,
where the particles started to grow at &#x0223c;14:00, which happened
to be the marine air case with the highest concentrations of the OHDCA
concentrations. As illustrated in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig"/>
</xref>, the geometric mean diameter (GMD) of particles
increased from &#x0223c;50 nm at 16:00 to &#x0223c;110 nm (CCN-size
scale) at 00:50 on the following day, corresponding to a growth rate
of 6.5 nm/h. Consistently, the concentrations of total organics, nitrate,
and ammonium in PM<sub>1</sub> also increased significantly. In this
period, GMD showed excellent correlations with PM<sub>1</sub>-OM and
nitrate and moderate correlations with the other PM<sub>1</sub> components
(<ext-link xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsenvironau.4c00119/suppl_file/vg4c00119_si_001.pdf" ext-link-type="uri">Figure S11</ext-link>). Further, it correlated fairly
well (<italic toggle="yes">R</italic>
<sup>2</sup> = 0.88) with the CO<sub>2</sub>
<sup>+</sup> ion (<italic toggle="yes">m</italic>/<italic toggle="yes">z</italic> 44) measured
by the AMS, an indicator of SOA.<xref rid="ref50" ref-type="bibr"/> This
event also featured a striking rise in the level of OHDCA and the
highest levels of OHDCA concentrations throughout the sampling period.
Moreover, a close relationship between the GMD and malic acid with
an <italic toggle="yes">R</italic>
<sup>2</sup> of 0.93 was identified. There also
existed similar correlations between the GMD and some other SOA tracers,
higher than the correlations with primary OA tracers (<ext-link xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsenvironau.4c00119/suppl_file/vg4c00119_si_001.pdf" ext-link-type="uri">Figure S12</ext-link>). Therefore, this relatively rare
particle growth might have been partially enhanced by particulate
organic matter including OHDCA-like SOA. It is noteworthy that the
temperature decreased from the afternoon to midnight, which was conducive
to gas-to-particle partitioning of semivolatile species, such as nitrate.
However, the volatilities of OHDCA species were much lower, so their
concentrations in PM<sub>1</sub> were less dependent upon temperature.
The increase in the concentrations of OHDCA was likely a result of
chemical formation and/or transport, which potentially contributed
to the particle growth.</p><fig position="float" id="fig6" fig-type="figure"><label>6</label><caption><p>A particle growth event on November 6&#x02013;7:

OHDCA has been detected at high concentrations
in many regions around the world, including South China. The high
proportions of hydrophilic groups make it a potential climate mediator.
Studies identified various precursors and chemical processes that
account for the formation of OHDCA. However, there has been a deficiency
in a quantitative understanding of the relative importance and synergistic
effects of these factors. In this study, we measured several OHDCA
species at a higher-than-usual temporal resolution in an area with
compounded air pollution sources. With the aid of ML, this study revealed
the dominant contributions to malic acid (a representative of OHDCA)
of aromatics and monoterpenes and/or similar formation pathways with
their resulting SOA in the noncontinental air, which was intertwined
with aqueous processes. These factors might also explain the highest
concentrations of the OHDCA for the entire sampling period observed
in the marine air. The leading role of aromatics, if presented as
precursors, in the noncontinental air was counterintuitive, yet it
seemed to be explained by mesoscale circulations. In addition to these
factors (excluding LWC), isoprene, particle surface area, and O<sub>
<italic toggle="yes">x</italic>
</sub> also contributed to the elevated levels
of malic acid in the continental air. Moreover, ML also confirmed
the synergistic effects of LWC (or sulfate), O<sub>
<italic toggle="yes">x</italic>
</sub>, and temperature on malic acid concentrations, indicating
aqueous photochemical formation processes. Our results also shed light
on the climate effects of the OHDCA, which likely facilitated the
growth of atmospheric particles on the CCN-size scale. Despite the
above, limitations also exist, mainly in the form of model uncertainties
caused by the limited number of data points and variables. Future
research should aim to improve the generalizability of ML results
by utilizing more comprehensive data.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="sifile1" position="float" content-type="local-data"><media xlink:href="vg4c00119_si_001.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="ack1"><p>This study was supported by the
