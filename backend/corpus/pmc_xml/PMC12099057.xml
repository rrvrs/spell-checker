However, the variability and poorly defined therapeutic contents of EVs produced under standard 2-dimensional culture conditions present challenges for their clinical application. In this study, we investigated how the therapeutic properties of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-derived EVs can be enhanced by culturing MSCs within 3-dimensional hydrogels that have tunable mechanical properties. Our results demonstrate that different mechanical cues from the culture environment can induce specific gene expression changes in MSCs without compromising their inherent characteristics. Furthermore, EVs derived from these MSCs exhibited distinct angiogenic and immunomodulatory activities, which were dependent on the mechanical properties of the hydrogels used. A comprehensive analysis of the cytokines and microRNAs present in the EVs provided additional validation of these findings. By utilizing a noninvasive culture method that eliminates the need for genetic modification or exogenous biochemical supplementation, our approach presents a novel platform for the tailored production of EVs, thereby enhancing their therapeutic potential in regenerative medicine.</p></abstract><funding-group specific-use="FundRef"><award-group id="ID0EOBAG4302"><funding-source>

EVs derived from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) engage in the multifactorial therapeutic effects of MSCs, such as angiogenesis, tissue regeneration, and immunomodulation [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Therapies using MSC-EVs, which demonstrate a better safety profile and lower immunogenicity than MSC transplantation therapies, could circumvent existing limitations in cell-based treatments, such as pulmonary embolism, ectopic tissue formation, immune rejection, and tumorigenesis [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In addition, as a therapeutic agent, EVs offer logistical advantages for large-scale manufacturing, storage, and shipping compared to their parent cells, thus extending the range of clinical application strategies for patient administration [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Therefore, the therapeutic applications of MSC-EVs targeting various intractable diseases are at the forefront of clinical investigations.</p><p>Despite their potential for application to regenerative therapies, MSC-EVs are limited in their clinical uses owing to the indistinct therapeutic contents obtained by routine 2-dimensional (2D) culture conditions [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Thus, it is crucial to regulate the wide-ranging therapeutic contents of MSC-EVs to maximize their therapeutic efficacy for targeted disease treatment. Many studies have attempted to induce changes in the therapeutic contents of EVs through gene transfection or additional biochemical supplementation during parent cell culture [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. However, these methods often directly alter the parent cell characteristics, involve high costs, and introduce complexities into the stability assessment of genetic and/or chemical supplementary combinations [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Overcoming these challenges requires the development of advanced culture techniques that can offer the sustained and controlled modulation of parent cell characteristics, thus leading to their successful integration into the therapeutic capacities of the EVs [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Cells modulate their behavior by responding to their 3-dimensional (3D) physical microenvironment, which consists of the extracellular matrix (ECM) that they produce themselves [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In recent years, hydrogels, characterized by a network of hydrophilic porous polymers capable of retaining substantial amounts of water, have been regularly used as effective 3D cell culture platforms [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]; 3D cell cultures using hydrogels with modulation of mechanical properties could provide cells with controlled physical stimuli to alter their characteristics, thereby possibly allowing the manipulation of cargo sorting in EVs without external chemical interventions [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Gelatin methacrylate GelMA) hydrogels can be covalently cross-linked via the radical photopolymerization of methacryloyl substituents incorporated into gelatin in the presence of a photoinitiator and exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. GelMA hydrogels have emerged as promising biomaterials because, as a 3D cell culture matrix, they can provide the advantages of both the arginine&#x02013;glycine&#x02013;aspartic acid sequence and metalloproteinase-responsive peptide motifs. They also display reproducible and tunable physicochemical properties while being biocompatible, biodegradable, noncytotoxic, and nonimmunogenic [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>In this study, we aimed to modulate the angiogenic and immunomodulatory capacities of EVs by culturing MSCs encapsulated in GelMA hydrogels with controlled mechanical properties. Our in&#x000a0;vitro efficacy testing models, related to immunomodulation, angiogenesis, and wound-healing processes, demonstrated the differentiated therapeutic capacities of EVs according to their culture matrix properties. We systematically characterized and examined the resulting EVs and their cargo compounds, including cytokines and microRNAs (miRs). In addition, comprehensive proteomic analysis of EVs using liquid chromatography&#x02013;mass spectrometry (LC&#x02013;MS) and bioinformatics further supported our results (Fig. <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Our study demonstrates the possibility of regulating the therapeutic capacity of MSC-EVs by providing MSCs with different mechanical microenvironments, rather than using genetic modification or biochemical factor supplementation during culture.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>Schematic diagram of the regulation of the differentiated multifactorial therapeutic cargo of extracellular vesicles (EVs) and their efficacies through mechanical microenvironment alteration.

Methacrylic anhydride (Sigma-Aldrich), serving as a cross-linking agent, was slowly added to the gelatin solution at 50 &#x000b0;C under continuous magnetic stirring, at a volume equivalent to 20% of PBS. To ensure effective methacrylation, special attention was given to preventing abrupt pH fluctuations caused by the addition of methacrylic anhydride. The reagent was added at a rate of 0.5 ml/min, and whenever the pH dropped below 5.5, the addition was carefully controlled to maintain the pH at 5.5 or above. After 2 h, the reaction was terminated by reducing the temperature to 40 &#x000b0;C and diluting the starting gelatin solution 4-fold with PBS. The solution was dialyzed against fresh distilled water through Spectra dialysis tubing with 12- to 14-kDa molecular weight cutoffs (Repligen, Waltham, MA, USA) for a week, followed by lyophilization.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>Cell encapsulation into GelMA hydrogel</title><p>Glass slides were washed with 10% (w/v) sodium hydroxide (Duksan General Science, Seoul, Korea) and distilled water to remove impurities. The washed slides were treated with a solution of 3-trimethoxysilyl propyl methacrylate (TMS-PMA; Sigma-Aldrich) and a polyethylene glycol dimethacrylate (PEG; Polysciences, Inc., Warrington, PA, USA) solution containing 20% PEG and 0.05% (w/v) 2-hydroxy-4&#x02032;-(2-hydroxyethoxy)-2-methylpropiophenone (Irgacure 2959; Sigma-Aldrich), as a photoinitiator, in PBS to prevent nonspecific cell absorption. Before encapsulation, polydimethylsiloxane (SYLGARD 184 Silicone Elastomer, Dow Corning, Midland, MI, USA) spacers with a height of 300 &#x003bc;m were fabricated for the encapsulation process. For MSC encapsulation, GelMA hydrogel solution containing 10% (w/v) GelMA and 0.05% (w/v) Irgacure 2959 in PBS was freshly prepared and used immediately. MSC pellets were suspended in GelMA solution and medium at a ratio of 5:1 and a density of 1.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> cells, resulting in a final GelMA concentration of 8.3%. Subsequently, 75 &#x003bc;l of GelMA solution containing suspended MSCs was prepared on a TMS-PMA- and PEG-precoated slide glass. MSCs were encapsulated within cross-linked GelMA with differently regulated mechanical stiffnesses, namely, soft (3.8 mW/cm<sup>2</sup> for 3 s), medium (3.8 mW/cm<sup>2</sup> for 10 s), and hard (3.8 mW/cm<sup>2</sup> for 20 s), using UV radiation (OmniCure S2000, Excelitas Technologies Corp., Waltham, MA, USA). The encapsulated MSCs were subsequently cultured for 5 d with 3D orbital shaking at 20 rpm (FINEPCR, Gunpo, Korea).

Force&#x02013;distance curve measurements were performed in a liquid environment filled with PBS solution, with data recorded at 5 randomly selected points for each sample and averaged. A pyramidal silicon nitride probe (NanoWorld, Neuch&#x000e2;tel, Switzerland) with a nominal spring constant of 0.08 N m<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> was used for the measurements.

The hydrogels on the PEG-coated glass slides were affixed to a copper stub using carbon tape. A liquid nitrogen slush was induced by evacuating the freezing chamber. The samples were then submerged in the chamber and directly transferred to a cold stage. Samples were etched at &#x02212;90 &#x000b0;C for 3 min to remove the ice formed during rapid freezing. The sample substrates were coated with Au/Pd to prevent charging.

Briefly, the LIVE/DEAD solution, consisting of a calcein AM/ethidium homodimer ratio suggested by the manufacturer, was applied to the samples, which were then incubated for 30 min at room temperature (RT) and washed with PBS. LIVE/DEAD (calcein AM/ethidium homodimer)-labeled cells were visualized using a confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany). A DNA quantification assay (Life Technologies Corporation) was performed to quantify the number of encapsulated MSCs after 5 d of culture, following the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. Before assessment, collagenase A (Sigma-Aldrich) was used for GelMA hydrogel degradation.</p></sec><sec id="sec9"><title>Immunocytochemistry</title><p>MSCs were fixed in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde (Biosesang, Seongnam, South Korea) for 10 min at 4 &#x000b0;C and permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100 (SAMCHUN, Seoul, Korea) for 15 min. Each sample was blocked in 4% bovine serum albumin (BSA; Sigma-Aldrich) and Alexa Fluor 488 phalloidin (Life Technologies Corporation) to visualize the cytoskeletal structure of the cells. To characterize the MSCs, 2D control MSCs were incubated with CD105 primary antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) and Alexa Fluor 488 anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG) secondary antibody (Abcam), both at a 1:1,000 dilution. The samples were incubated with 4&#x02032;,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Life Technologies Corporation) in a dark room. Throughout the process, PBS washing was performed.

Collagenase A (Sigma-Aldrich) was used for GelMA hydrogel degradation. Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies Corporation) for subsequent gene expression analysis. Complementary DNA was prepared by reverse transcription using ReverTra Ace qPCR-RT Master Mix (TOYOBO, Osaka, Japan). Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction reverse transcription (qRT-PCR) was carried out using RT2 Profiler PCR arrays (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The RNA secreted by each hydrogel group was compared with that from the control group, and the results are presented as a heat map. Subsequently, the RNA results were categorized by pathway, and the pathways with the most marked differences compared to the control group were highlighted.

Following the removal of the media from each well, 4 ml of PBS was added to every 3 wells and gently shaken before harvesting any residual EVs. The harvested media were then ultracentrifuged at 2,500 &#x000d7; g for 10 min at RT, and the supernatant was filtered using a 0.22-&#x003bc;m polyethersulfone membrane filter bottle (Corning) to eliminate cell debris. Subsequently, the filtered media were loaded into a tangential flow filtration (TFF) system (Cole Parmer, Vernon Hills, IL, USA) with an Omega 300-kDa membrane (Pall, New York, NY, USA). In the TFF process, a concentration of 190 ml was used, and diafiltration with 10 ml of PBS was repeated 10 times using 200 ml of medium. This resulted in a final concentration of 8.5 ml for each sample. If characterization of the EV pellet was required, the TFF-concentrated sample was ultracentrifuged at 100,000 &#x000d7; g for 1 h at 4 &#x000b0;C, and the supernatant was discarded.

Experiments were performed using qNano (Izon Science Ltd., Christchurch, New Zealand). Nanopores (NP200, Izon Science Ltd.) and calibration particles (CPC100, Izon Science Ltd.) were used to quantify the EVs. All reagents used for the qNano measurements were filtered through a 0.22-&#x003bc;m polyethersulfone membrane syringe filter (Sartorius, G&#x000f6;ttingen, Germany) immediately before use. For the structural characterization of EVs that were enveloped by lipid membranes, 3% Triton X-100 was added to EVs derived from MSCs, and the EVs were lysed for 30 min.

We opted for 3 distinct levels of culture matrix mechanical properties, to reflect 3 distinct in&#x000a0;situ tissues in our body: soft tissues (soft, less than 10 kPa), muscle (medium, 10 to 15 kPa), and unmineralized bone matrix tissues (hard, 20 to 40 kPa) (Fig. <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A) [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The culture matrices exhibited different interconnected pore structures and sizes according to the UV exposure time (Fig. <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B). These structural differences in the porous networks led to significantly different mechanical properties in the 3 groups of culture matrices, as measured by atomic force microscopy, i.e., the soft group (9 kPa), the medium group (14 kPa), and the hard group (21 kPa) (Fig. <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>C and D). MSCs encapsulated in the GelMA hydrogels were cultured for 5 d in a CO<sub>2</sub> incubator under dynamic conditions with 3D orbital shaking at 20 rpm, during which the cells grew and exhibited different cell morphologies depending on the mechanical properties of the culture matrices (Fig. <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>E and F). As the matrix stiffness decreased, the encapsulated MSCs spread and branched out into the hydrogel. Conversely, MSCs cultured in the stiffer matrices tended to display a rounded shape without spreading branches and were likely physically confined within the hydrogel. The differences in cell morphology were consistent with the varying patterns of actin filament polymerization, with traces of cell locomotion (Fig. <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>G). Cells in all groups were highly viable during our 3D culture procedures as barely any dead cells were observed (Fig. <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>H).</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Fig. 2.</label><caption><p>Evaluation of our established bioprocess for modulating cell behavior through mechanical property adjustments using the GelMA hydrogel.

The heat map data of the gene expression profiles of the soft, medium, and hard groups were presented and analyzed after normalization with the 2D control group (Fig. <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A and B). The differential cellular morphologies resulting from varying culture matrix stiffness levels led to distinct gene expression profiles in the MSCs. In particular, the gene expression profile of the soft group appeared to be distinct from those of the other groups, while the medium and hard groups displayed relatively similar gene expression patterns (Fig. <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>C to E). Overall, 3D-cultured MSCs exhibited enhanced gene expression associated with angiogenesis, chondrogenesis, immunomodulation, and stemness while expressing levels of MSC-specific markers comparable to those of the 2D control group. The expression of genes related to the immunomodulatory and angiogenic capacities of MSCs, such as epidermal growth factor (EGF), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), VEGF-A, colony-stimulating factor 2 (CSF-2), and transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF&#x003b2;1), was promoted in the medium and hard groups compared to that in the 2D control group [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. We conducted GO analysis focusing on molecular function pathways by selecting factors that were more abundantly secreted in each hydrogel group compared to the 2D control group (Fig. <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>F to H). Specific GO terms were examined based on their fold enrichment, false discovery rate, and the number of genes. The soft group demonstrated superior levels of growth factor activity-related components compared to the 2D control group, attributed to the overexpression of growth factors such as EGF and HGF (Fig. <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>F). Notably, the gene expression patterns of the medium and hard groups tended to be associated with pathways related to &#x0201c;bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) receptor binding&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;transmembrane receptor protein serine/threonine kinase (RSK) binding&#x0201d; (Fig. <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>G and H). These pathways contribute to signaling pathways related to the phosphoinositide 3-kinase&#x02013;protein kinase B (PI3K&#x02013;Akt) pathway, as well as TGF&#x003b2; and BMP signaling, playing a crucial role in osteogenesis, chondrogenesis, angiogenesis, and immunomodulation [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Additionally, these groups exhibit higher levels of components that regulate &#x0201c;cytokine activity&#x0201d;, which plays a significant role in the paracrine effects of MSCs, and factors contributing to &#x0201c;receptor ligand activity&#x0201d;. These results suggest that modulating the mechanical microenvironment of MSCs influences multiple pathways related to angiogenesis and immunomodulatory capacity while maintaining the stemness of stem cells. Therefore, we anticipated that this promotion of the therapeutic capacities of MSCs resulting from differences in their mechanical microenvironment could also modulate their EVs&#x02019; therapeutic capacities.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Fig. 3.</label><caption><p>Gene expression profiles of encapsulated MSCs.

All EV groups contained TGF&#x003b2;1, periostin (POSTN), and FN1, which are related to the up-regulation of VEGF, and thrombospondin-1 (THBS1), known to inhibit the pro-angiogenic actions of FGF-2, and expressed MSC-EV markers such as HSP90AB1 and vimentin (VIM) [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Notably, THBS2, known as a potent inhibitor of angiogenesis mediated by the THBS2 receptor CD36, was expressed at significantly high levels in the ctrl EVs (Fig. <xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>E). The ctrl EVs also showed up-regulation of peroxidasin, which aids in angiogenesis (Fig. <xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>F) [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>To further investigate the pathways in which the EV proteins are involved, we performed KEGG enrichment analysis. The KEGG results reveal various pathways of all proteins, including those related to cell biogenesis; however, these results do not sufficiently explain the differences in therapeutic efficacy among the group&#x02019;s EVs. In order to better understand the significant differences in therapeutic efficacy, we removed the overlapping pathways between the ctrl EV and hydrogel group KEGG datasets. We then presented the top 10 pathways related to angiogenesis and immunomodulation, based on the number of proteins and the rich factor (Fig. <xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>G to I). All 3D-cultured groups showed greater contributions in 6 pathways, including &#x0201c;complement and coagulation cascades&#x0201d;, than the ctrl EVs (marked as black in the figure). Notably, the secretion of pentose phosphate, which can activate the secretion of miR-93, known to reduce oxidative stress and promote angiogenesis, was the highest in the medium EVs [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Additionally, the medium and hard EVs showed significant enrichment in &#x0201c;fructose and mannose metabolism&#x0201d; compared to the ctrl EVs. Mannose induces regulatory T cells and suppresses effector T cells, thereby enhancing immunomodulation [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Fructose metabolism activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling and mitochondrial respiration, promoting angiogenesis, a characteristic frequently observed in cancer cells and tumor growth [<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Accordingly, the medium and hard EVs showed significant contributions to the PI3K&#x02013;Akt and AMPK pathways compared to the soft group (red). The &#x0201c;estrogen signaling pathway&#x0201d;, which is known to regulate the nuclear factor kappa B and interferon pathways, and the &#x0201c;leukocyte transendothelial migration&#x0201d; pathway were identified in the soft and medium EVs (pink). Additionally, the &#x0201c;phagosome&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;antigen processing and presentation&#x0201d; pathways were identified in the soft and hard EVs (blue). In summary, the 3D-cultured groups tended to contribute more to angiogenesis and immunomodulation than the ctrl EVs, with the medium and hard EVs showing greater potential than the soft EVs.</p></sec><sec id="sec27"><title>MicroRNA expressions according to different culture matrix properties</title><p>We also investigated the contents of miRs in the EVs using qRT-PCR (Fig. <xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>). The expression levels of miR-21, miR-210, and miR-296, known to facilitate T helper 2 cell and M2 polarization and angiogenesis, and miR-223, miR-150, and miR-142, which are involved in immunomodulation, were high in all groups without significant differences (Fig. <xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>A to F) [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. These miRs, apart from miR-296, were sufficiently expressed in all EV groups with the highest miR-21 expression, and in particular, miR-142 was significantly overexpressed in medium EVs (Fig. <xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>G). The evaluated expression of the individual miRs suggests the potential to suppress pro-inflammatory-related factors, such as protein inhibitor of activated STAT3 and protein tyrosine phosphatase nonreceptor type 1 (PTPN1), thus activating anti-inflammatory and pro-angiogenic factors such as IL-10, STAT3, and IL-4 (Fig. <xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>H) [<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Notably, significantly increased expression of miR-142 in the medium EV group could result in the inhibition of the suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1), inducing the expression of STAT6, and thereby promoting immunomodulation [<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F9"><label>Fig. 9.</label><caption><p>Comparison of the microRNA (miRNA) contents in the EVs from each group.

Each cell type requires a different favorable microenvironment, where cells interact with the ECM and communicate through integrins and Piezo1, a type of transmembrane protein, which significantly influences cellular behaviors [<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Therefore, the manipulation of the various physical and biochemical properties of hydrogels has been widely reported [<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. GelMA is considered a potentially attractive hydrogel material to represent ECM microenvironments for culturing adhesive cells [<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The mechanical properties of the GelMA hydrogel can be readily controlled by adjusting the conditions of hydrogel cross-linking, such as the concentration of the GelMA hydrogel solution and the UV light intensity and exposure time [<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In this study, MSCs were exposed to controlled 3D-physical interactions with their surrounding culture matrices using GelMA hydrogel. The UV light exposure time was serially adjusted to obtain well-distinguished mechanical properties among the culture groups, namely, the soft (~9 kPa), medium (~14 kPa), and hard groups (~21 kPa). FIB Quanta 3D images revealed correspondingly increasing pore sizes in the culture matrices alongside decreasing mechanical properties, presenting successfully differentiated MSC phenotypes and cytoskeleton polymerization. MSCs can be influenced by the surrounding microenvironment, leading to changes in cell behavior that affect characteristics such as cell proliferation and differentiation capacity and lead to variations in secreted factors [<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Particularly, in 3D microenvironments with relatively high matrix stiffness, the expression of factors involved in angiogenesis, such as EGF, HGF, and VEGF, increased, and the expression of MSC markers was higher than that in the 2D control. According to previous research, modulating the stiffness of the ECM not only increases the expression of VEGF but also enhances the internalization of VEGF receptor 2, suggesting the potential for greater angiogenesis and immunomodulation efficacy [<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Furthermore, many factors involved in the BMP pathway, which is known to enhance the Smad pathway, were identified, thereby promoting the expression of key factors in angiogenesis and immunomodulation, such as VEGF, PDGF, and TGF [<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The transmembrane proteins, such as Piezo1, might be regulated in the medium and hard groups due to the relatively high mechanical stiffness of the microenvironments, which can stimulate the RSK-related pathway. Activation of the RSK-related pathway, contributing to TGF&#x003b2; superfamily receptor activation, suggests that culturing MSCs in microenvironments with medium and hard levels of stiffness leads to increased expression of multiple factors related to angiogenesis and immunomodulation and, consequently, their EVs are expected to carry higher amounts of these therapeutic factors [<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. EVs derived from MSCs have shown therapeutic efficacy in anti-inflammation and pro-angiogenesis, similar to their parent cells. Our EVs, which are expected to carry therapeutic factors related to angiogenesis and immunomodulation, inhibited the proliferation of LPS-induced blood cells and exhibited anti-inflammatory efficacy by inhibiting M1 polarization and promoting M2 polarization. In particular, the medium and hard EVs demonstrated not only immunomodulatory capabilities but also pro-angiogenic efficacy comparable to that of VEGF, as evidenced by their ability to promote tube formation and migration. The results highlight the potential of modulating the therapeutic efficacy by controlling the mechanical microenvironment surrounding MSCs, underscoring the regulatory effects on the therapeutic efficacy of MSC-EVs as well. According to the MSC qPCR array results, the medium and hard groups expressed diverse genes related to anti-inflammatory and pro-angiogenesis processes, suggesting that the secreted EVs exhibit efficacy through complex mechanisms involving these factors [<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. As expected, pro-angiogenic cytokines, including bFGF, GRO, PDGF-BB, TIMP-1, VEGF, and VEGF-D, showed higher expression in the medium and hard groups, encompassing the secretion of various cytokines across all groups. The results indicate that MSCs cultured in relatively stiffer microenvironments showed up-regulated gene expression associated with angiogenesis and immunomodulation and confirm the expression of various pro-angiogenic cytokines in MSC-EVs. This cytokine profile regulates angiogenesis, and while direct differences in anti-inflammatory cytokines were not observed, it suggests immunomodulatory functions through complex cytokine interactions.</p><p>To further investigate the changes in EV cargo, the LC&#x02013;MS analysis was conducted along with bioinformatic analysis. As different microenvironment conditions can alter the gene expression levels in MSCs and subsequent cytokine secretion in EVs, variations in matrix properties also lead to differences in the protein cargo of EVs. The 3D hydrogel culture induced changes in VEGF and other factors in MSCs and their EVs, aligning with the observation that proteins such as CLEC11A and TGF&#x003b2;1I1&#x02014;known for their crucial roles in vascular regeneration through VEGF&#x02014;were expressed only in hard EVs. Conversely, THBS2, which inhibits the VEGF pathway, was notably present in the control group, correlating with lower VEGF expression in the MSCs compared to other groups. All of these expression differences occur without variation in HSP90AB1, an EV marker, and VIM, an MSC-EV marker. In the angiogenic and immunomodulatory efficacy tests, the medium and hard groups exhibited higher efficacies despite subtle differences in the secretion profiles of key factors related to angiogenesis and immunomodulation among the groups. The therapeutic efficacy of angiogenesis and immunomodulation is regulated by complicated correlations among various factors [<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Correspondingly, the medium and hard EVs showed up-regulated PI3K&#x02013;Akt and AMPK pathways, as well as up-regulated &#x0201c;pentose phosphate pathway&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;fructose and mannose metabolism&#x0201d; compared to the soft EVs. When transmembrane proteins such as Piezo1 on MSCs are exposed to high mechanical properties, they contribute to signaling pathways that stimulate the PI3K&#x02013;Akt and AMPK pathways [<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. In line with this, EVs secreted by the stimulated MSCs (in the medium and hard groups) were found to naturally contain proteins related to the PI3K&#x02013;Akt and AMPK pathways. The enhanced PI3K&#x02013;Akt and AMPK pathways also involve the hypoxia-inducible factor-1 signaling pathway, ultimately supporting VEGF expression [<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Additionally, fructose metabolism activates AMPK signaling, so the 2 pathways uniquely observed under medium and hard culture conditions can collectively explain the superior therapeutic efficacy compared to that under soft group conditions. These results suggest that the mechanical properties of the medium and hard conditions (probably above the medium group&#x02019;s properties in our conditions) might stimulate Piezo1, leading to the up-regulation of related genes and, consequently, an increased presence of PI3K&#x02013;Akt and AMPK pathway-associated proteins in EVs. We believe that the development of cell regulation through mechanosensing threshold, which can control specific pathways, will enable more precise and detailed modulation of EV-derived therapeutic factors. MiRs are also known as key therapeutic factors in EVs, regulating protein expression directly or indirectly through posttranscriptional regulation. MiR-142, known to facilitate the up-regulation of the pro-angiogenic transcription factor STAT6, was up-regulated in EVs from the medium group, consistent with the observed increase in angiogenesis efficacy. Known for its role in suppressing THBS secretion, the up-regulated expression of miR-142 in the medium EVs demonstrates the down-regulation of THBS compared to that in the ctrl EVs [<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].</p><p>The main clinical issues with MSC-derived EV therapies can be recognized as a series of important challenges: compliance with current legal requirements regarding the design of large-scale manufacturing processes applicable for &#x0201c;good manufacturing practice&#x0201d;, the improvement of therapeutic efficacy in line with quality control and safety, and the maintenance of the na&#x000ef;ve characteristics of the parent MSCs [<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Previously, conventional 2D culture methods were found to deteriorate MSC functionalities associated with replication, colony-forming ability, and differentiation potential, while the expression of genes related to stemness were significantly down-regulated over culture time [<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. In this study, we present a novel approach for advancing the clinical applications of EV therapies by modulating the cellular microenvironment without any genetic modification or additional biochemicals, maintaining high levels of gene expression associated with specific MSC markers. The mechanical properties used in this study ranged from 5 to 30 kPa to regulate cellular behavior. However, in&#x000a0;situ tissues exhibit a much broader and more diverse range of stiffness [<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Since the properties of GelMA hydrogels can be further adjusted by modifying the degree of methacrylation, future investigations could explore ways to fine-tune the surrounding mechanical microenvironment. This, in turn, may provide greater control over cellular behavior and EV characteristics, expanding the potential applications of this approach. Furthermore, the previously mentioned PI3K&#x02013;Akt pathway, influenced by mechanosensing, also contributes to the secretion of factors such as osteocalcin and runt-related transcription factor 2, which, in turn, leads to the activation of pathways related to chondrogenesis and osteogenesis [<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. </p><p>While our study primarily focused on evaluating the effects related to angiogenesis and immunomodulation, a more detailed and broader range of hydrogel control could be explored in future studies. Under such conditions, we expect that the secreted EVs will carry factors associated with these additional pathways. Our comprehensive proteomic and miR analysis results indicate that various therapeutic factors in EVs associated with angiogenic and immunomodulatory efficacy, including those with significant differences and those with only minor variances, are regulated by modulating the mechanical microenvironment surrounding MSCs.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p><bold>Funding:</bold> This work was supported by a National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korean government (MSIT) (RS-2024-00455873) and Incheon National University (International Cooperative) Research Grant in 2020.</p><p><bold>Author contributions:</bold> W.Y.K.: Writing&#x02014;original draft, data curation, formal analysis, investigation, methodology, validation, and visualization.
