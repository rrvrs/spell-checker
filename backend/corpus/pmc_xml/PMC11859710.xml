Introduction</title><p>The work presented in the article concerns the diagnostics of consumption of individual parts of an industrial robot controlled by a CNC (Computerized Numerical Control). In current industrial revolution era, there is a visible trend to invest in advanced systems for continuous diagnostics using this type of equipment. Special measuring systems are used in combination with analytical software. Advanced algorithms are used to process measurement data to predict possible failures. This allows for planning maintenance and interventions in advance, instead of reacting to problems that already occur. Thanks to the early detection of potential problems, the maintenance department can plan maintenance and repairs in an organized and efficient manner, minimizing downtime. This planning can be integrated with other management systems, allowing for resource management. Based on the analysis, the system generates alarms for the maintenance department. Alarms can inform us about the need to carry out inspection, maintenance, or repair. In the long term, the collected data and conclusions from the predictive diagnostics system can be used to optimize production processes and improve machine design. These systems also enable a better understanding of the causes of failures and contribute to the continuous improvement of operational processes. The article presents implementations of solutions based on the PLC (Programmable Logic Controller) and the analysis of data from the robot. In addition, the prepared interface allows for data collection using IIoT (Industrial Internet of Thing) technology for superior IT (Information Technology) systems.</p><p>The following part of the chapter presents examples from the literature concerning the topic of the article. The second chapter presents the general structure of the system as well as the most important elements used in the implementation of the work. The IIoT technology used to provide diagnostic data is described. Then, the implementations of the most important diagnostic functions implemented in the PLC calculated on the basis of process data from the robot are described. The third chapter presents the implemented visualization screens with sample data collected from the actual implementation of the robot in the station. The last chapter summarizes the most important results obtained during the work.</p><sec id="sec1dot1-sensors-25-01154"><title>1.1. Related Work</title><p>The aim of Ref. [<xref rid="B1-sensors-25-01154" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] is to present a practical implementation of a network architecture capable of collecting data from industrial robots, in order to later implement &#x0201c;One-Class Novelty Detection&#x0201d; models&#x02014;identification of data that significantly differ from patterns observed during machine learning. The architecture uses only well-known automation components, such as a PLC.

The paper describes the components of six-axis robots that are susceptible to failure in the automotive industry, such as power supplies, servos, or gears, and it also presents data sources that are a source for detecting faults of robot components. The most commonly used parameters for fault detection are motor currents and vibration analysis.</p><p>Ref. [<xref rid="B4-sensors-25-01154" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] presents the application of an LSTM recurrent neural network for predictive diagnostics of industrial robots.

The significant help this solution provides to the maintenance department in effective maintenance planning is described.</p><p>Ref. [<xref rid="B5-sensors-25-01154" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] developed a predictive diagnostic model for industrial robots based on an artificial neural network, using MTTF values and system failure history. Data were acquired using an ERP system, and the results showed the effectiveness of predicting failures by the MLP structure, minimizing costs related to unplanned downtime. Reliability analysis and spare part forecasts based on the Poisson distribution allowed for the creation of an optimal spare part list, ensuring production efficiency is at 85%.</p><p>In Ref. [<xref rid="B6-sensors-25-01154" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], an approach based on the analysis of robot currents is proposed to detect accuracy errors of individual robot joints for predictive diagnostics. The methodology is based on the analysis of the time series of currents to predict deviations in robot accuracy. The results confirmed a strong correlation between teh selected three-phase current properties and robot accuracy. The developed predictive model showed high efficiency and good fit.</p><p>In Ref. [<xref rid="B7-sensors-25-01154" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], a predictive maintenance method for semiconductor wafer transport robots was developed using the K-means clustering algorithm to analyze data from acceleration sensors attached to the robot arm. The data were subjected to normalization and denoising processes, and the data analysis enabled the prediction of the appropriate maintenance moment. Simulations showed that the method allows for real-time prediction, minimizing the risk of sudden failures.</p><p>The aim of Ref. [<xref rid="B8-sensors-25-01154" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] was to propose a robotic cell reliability optimization method based on the digital twin (DT). A machine learning model was used to detect and classify faults of critical components and predict their remaining service life (RUL). Reliability analysis using RBD and FTA methods showed that parallel connections of critical components minimize the risk of failure of the entire system.</p><p>Ref. [<xref rid="B9-sensors-25-01154" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] concerns the implementation of predictive diagnostics for industrial robots, only using data from existing sensors, without the need to install new ones. Torque characteristics were used to predict robot anomalies. Different algorithms were tested and the results showed that the hybrid approach (Exponentron + GPR) is the best. It was also shown that low data quality significantly worsens the results, so it is necessary to have high-quality data and a good sampling rate.</p><p>Ref. [<xref rid="B10-sensors-25-01154" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] concerns predictive fault detection in robots using motor current signal analysis (MCSA), aimed at monitoring and assessing the condition of the robot drive system. The applied method allows for fault detection in the drive system. The novelty is in mastering the classical limitations of signal analysis in the frequency domain, extending the range beyond the steady state. Signals outside the steady states showed rich information content.</p><p>Ref. [<xref rid="B11-sensors-25-01154" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] presents reliability engineering methods that can be used to predict the failure probability of mobile robots. A new modification of the mean time to failure concept is proposed, taking into account the influence of operating conditions on the failure rate.

Dedicated HMI (Human Machine Interface) screens have been designed on the CNC, which allow for insight into current data from the industrial robot. Maintenance services can use these data to plan the replacement of a specific assembly or perform service activities related to lubrication in advance.

Materials and Methods</title><p>The article presents the most interesting fragments of programs implemented in the PLC calculating consumption. The implementation was made in the ST (Structured Text) language. From the point of view of PLC programming, this is a dedicated solution for performing calculations.</p><p>The structure of the system is shown in <xref rid="sensors-25-01154-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>. The main CNC system M80V Mitsubishi Electric performs the task of controlling the lathe in the first channel. The second channel is dedicated to controlling the Mitsubishi Electric RV2F industrial robot. The CR800D robot controller is connected to the CNC system via Ethernet, thanks to which it is possible to send all the necessary process data (CC-Link IE Field Basic) from the robot as well as its control (Direct Robot Control). For the convenient setting of the robot&#x02019;s operating parameters and for performing its diagnostics, dedicated screens displayed directly on the CNC have been prepared. NC Designer 2 software version 2.1.9 was used to implement the visualization. Access to the CNC screens is possible using VNC (Virtual Network Computing). To obtain IIoT functionality, a dedicated PC was used, which has an MQTT broker providing data from the field of industrial robot diagnostics. The broker is supplied with data using the SLMP, which retrieves data directly from the CNC&#x02019;s PLC. As an alternative to a PC, it is possible to use a microcontroller with analogous functions, which has extended the scope of the access to diagnostic data of the CNC. In addition to the implementation of diagnostic functions, the robot&#x02019;s learning and trajectory playback functions have also been implemented. The operator&#x02019;s safety is ensured by a dedicated safety system for which software for redundant PLCs has been developed. It is also possible to use an optional vision system for the inspection of the manufactured part.</p><sec id="sec2dot1-sensors-25-01154"><title>2.1. IIoT Interface</title><p>MQTT is a communication protocol designed for resource-constrained devices in Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) solutions. It was designed for use with small data sizes and high-latency flows. It has low requirements, and it is reliable and efficient. Thanks to this, it has become a basic element in IIoT solutions. It can be used in IIoT devices that run on batteries, sending data to collecting and processing servers. This solution is ideal for devices that require low power consumption and minimal data transfer makes it suitable for IIoT applications. The principle of operation of the MQTT protocol is based on the principle of publishing and subscribing messages. The device publishing data sends them to a specific topic on the MQTT broker, which acts as a center for managing the flow of messages. Other devices can subscribe to specific topics and receive any data sent to them. An important aspect of MQTT is its implementation efficiency&#x02014;the small size of the communication frame base and its high compression allow for fast and reliable communication between devices.</p><p>The dataflow of data used in the presented solution is shown in <xref rid="sensors-25-01154-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>. Sending important information about current process values from the robot controller to the PLC was done using CC-Link IEF Basic communication. Furthermore, some data were sent using the DRC (Direct Robot Control) protocol used, in general, to control the connected robot. All of the data were displayed on dedicated screens, and some of them were taken to calculating diagnostic&#x000a0;coefficients.</p><p>The SLMP (Seamless Message Protocol) is a communication protocol used by Mitsubishi Electric. It was developed to facilitate communication between industrial automation devices. The CC-Link IEF Basic protocol used to exchange data between the PLC and the robot controller is based on the SLMP. It is characterized by fast and reliable communication. It works in client-server mode, the client (PC or microcontroller) sends a request to the server, and the server (PLC) processes the request and sends a response. The main functionality of the SLMP connection used in this application was reading data, i.e., reading specific areas of the PLC memory. For the CNC, it is necesssary to configure parameter #1489 &#x02013; SLMP_ON to 1, activating the SLMP server on the PLC.</p><p>Robot data that were sent to the PLC or data that were calculated in the PLC were sent to the PC or microcontroller, which acted as a protocol converter. The communication was done with the PLC via the SLMP, reading the necessary data, and then preparing them using the MQTT communication protocol. In this way, the data were prepared for master devices using IIoT technology. The solution does not include security mechanisms against cyberattacks. The communication protocols and Ethernet connections were used in their standard versions and access protection was left to external network devices and the network administrator.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-sensors-25-01154"><title>2.2.

The function for an argument above 50% returns values greater than 100 ms, while for an argument below 50%, it returns values less than 100 ms. This means that operation at speeds above 50% is penalized, while at speeds below 50% is rewarded, extending the grease replacement interval.

Abnormality Detection</title><p>This section has two screens that display the results for detecting gear malfunctions. A reference measurement is required for operation&#x02014;the longer the better. If one has not been taken, the message &#x0201c;No Reference Measurement&#x0201d; will appear on a red background at the bottom of the screen shown in <xref rid="sensors-25-01154-f009" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref>. This can be done by starting the robot in automatic mode and pressing the &#x0201c;Start Reference Measurement&#x0201d; button, which will change the caption to &#x0201c;During Reference Measurement&#x0201d; during the reference run. When it is completed, the reference result values from the measurement and the suggested detection levels will appear. After a reference run, the abnormality detection function is immediately activated. The robot&#x02019;s operation is analyzed, and the results are analyzed at certain time intervals. If the results exceed the abnormality detection level, a warning is reported, which is made cleared with the physical Reset button. Abnormalities are divided into those that have been detected for most of the examined time, &#x0201c;Long-term&#x0201d;, and temporary, &#x0201c;Short-term&#x0201d;, disturbances in the gear system. Detection levels can be modified by the user. The results are stored and displayed from the last three detection periods. If any of them exceeds the detection level, its background turns yellow. Results from the current sample are displayed, for example, one minute after the start of the period. The values of the long-term results can increase as well as decrease during the ongoing analysis. Short-term results, on the other hand, do not decrease during the test sample. The result is calculated based on the average and maximum value of currents and the rate and magnitude of current changes. The results vary depending on the work performed by the robot. So, the threshold should be set for the current working conditions of the robot.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot6-sensors-25-01154"><title>3.6.

Conclusions</title><p>An original implementation of an industrial robot control system was presented. The solution was based on the DRC mechanism and multi-channel synchronization in the CNC. Dedicated programs were developed in the PLC for diagnostics based on numerical data from the industrial robot. In combination with the HMI screens, they allow for quick and efficient diagnostics of the robot during the production of parts on a lathe operated by the aforementioned industrial robot. Detecting potential failures before they occur allows for planning maintenance without disrupting the production process. This prevents expensive failures and unplanned downtime, which translate into savings for the end customer. Regular maintenance based on the actual condition of the robot extends its life and work efficiency. The collected data are analyzed in the PLC. The results are presented on the HMI screen of the CNC and also sent to the computer, where they can be made available to superior systems thanks to IIoT technology. The solution was tested on a real industrial station, where the robot picked up parts from the magazine, fed them to the lathe, where the machining was then carried out in accordance with the specified technology.</p><p>The presented solutions were prepared for Mitsubishi Electric robots controlled by DRC via a CNC. It is possible to extend the scope of application of the solution for FANUC robots also controlled by DRC via a Mitsubishi CNC. In the case of other robot manufacturers, it is possible to use the same mechanisms while ensuring data delivery using alternative data protocols supported by the considered industrial robots. The extension of functionality can also be implemented within the mechanisms of data collection on the PC side and their further analysis in order to detect additional anomalies in the work of the station.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclaimer/Publisher&#x02019;s Note:</bold> The statements, opinions and data contained in all publications are solely those of the individual author(s) and contributor(s) and not of MDPI and/or the editor(s).
