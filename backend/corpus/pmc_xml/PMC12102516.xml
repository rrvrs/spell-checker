Understanding vaccine acceptance is crucial due to high levels of vaccine hesitancy and relatively low vaccination coverage. The aim of this study is to assess the general population&#x02019;s knowledge and attitude toward COVID-19 vaccination.</p><p>Methods: An explanatory mixed-method approach was used among the general population attending outpatient services at a tertiary care hospital. A total of 369 eligible individuals encountered during the data collection period were included. Their knowledge and attitude regarding COVID-19 vaccination were assessed using a self-structured questionnaire. Additionally, in-depth interviews were conducted to explore reasons for vaccine hesitancy.&#x000a0;Statistical analyses included mean with standard deviation (SD) or median with interquartile range (IQR), and correlation coefficients.</p><p>Results: Among the 369 participants, 226 (61.2%) demonstrated moderate knowledge, while 241 (65.3%) exhibited a favorable attitude toward the COVID-19 vaccine. A positive correlation between knowledge and attitude was observed (r = 0.114, p = 0.029). Participants perceived the vaccine as a means to prevent infection, build immunity, and ensure safety. Hesitancy stemmed from concerns about side effects, age, health issues, fear of needles, lack of awareness, and media influence.</p><p>Conclusion: The primary factor driving vaccine hesitancy was fear of adverse effects following vaccination. Misinformation and fear are significant barriers to achieving global vaccination goals, requiring targeted interventions to enhance awareness and acceptance.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>acceptance</kwd><kwd>attitude</kwd><kwd>covid-19</kwd><kwd>knowledge</kwd><kwd>vaccination</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>Third party service was utilized from Proofreading Pal with the payment of $90.90.</funding-statement></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) proclaimed a pandemic due to the appearance in 2019 of the coronavirus (COVID-19), which was caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. It began in Wuhan, China, at the end of 2019 and quickly spread globally, infecting millions of people in more than 220 countries [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The epidemic has severely strained economies, societies, and health-care systems. According to the WHO, there were 529,698,736 confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide as of June 1, 2022, and 6,292,503 fatalities [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. On January 27, 2020, the first COVID-19 case was reported in India. As of June 2, 2021, India had reported 43,160,832 confirmed cases and 524,636 deaths overall [<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>One of the most important public health interventions for preventing infectious diseases is vaccination [<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Having eradicated polio in 2014 and stopped the spread of diseases that can be prevented by vaccination for more than 10 years, India has made significant strides in routine immunization programs [<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. To combat the pandemic, however, vaccines had to be developed to combat the rapid spread of COVID-19 [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Vaccination is thought to be necessary to completely stop the spread of the disease, especially in highly populated places, even though social isolation and quarantine measures have decreased transmission [<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Finding safe and efficient vaccines became a top concern as the pandemic spread [<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. A number of vaccine manufacturers had finished phase three studies by the end of 2020, giving them hope that things would return to normal [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>-<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Nine of the 65 vaccines under development as of January 26, 2021, including Oxford-AstraZeneca, BBIBP-CorV, and Sputnik V, had been approved internationally [<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. It was the greatest immunization campaign in the world, with over 68.1 million people vaccinated across 56 nations [<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Nonetheless, vaccine reluctance has become a major barrier to vaccination efforts [<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. One of the top 10 global health hazards for 2019, according to the WHO, was vaccination reluctance [<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. There are significant differences in vaccine acceptance between nations. In more developed countries, 15-25% of the population has expressed hesitancy, with even higher rates in developing countries [<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>-<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>According to epidemiologists, the virus might spread to other countries [<xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Consequently, it is essential to develop immunity via either vaccination or spontaneous infection [<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna&#x02019;s vaccines have proven to be highly effective, preventing more than 90% and 94.5% of COVID-19 cases, respectively [<xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. With the launch of Covaxin and Covishield, vaccination efforts have begun in India [<xref rid="REF14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Despite the fact that India has rapidly distributed over four million vaccination doses worldwide, questions still surround the effectiveness, safety, and feasibility of such a massive program [<xref rid="REF15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="REF16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>Researchers have found that vaccine hesitation has several causes, such as misconceptions about vaccinations, possible negative health effects, and worries about the efficacy and safety of vaccines. Inadequate public knowledge of diseases that can be prevented by vaccination and a lack of faith in the medical establishment are further obstacles. Public health initiatives are seriously at risk from misinformation that causes vaccine reluctance [<xref rid="REF17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Vaccine hesitancy affects the community as a whole and poses a threat to herd immunity. Vaccine uptake is influenced by a number of factors, including socioeconomic position, education, vaccination cost, past vaccination history, perceived severity of the illness, and faith in medical professionals [<xref rid="REF18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>-<xref rid="REF20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Vaccination rates during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic ranged widely, from 17% to 67%, underscoring the significance of comprehending and addressing the barriers to vaccine adoption [<xref rid="REF21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>-<xref rid="REF25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>This study&#x02019;s novelty lies in the fact that the COVID-19 vaccine is a relatively new intervention, likely eliciting a varied response from the public. While some people may embrace vaccination, others may resist, with rumours and false information exacerbating this resistance. In India, where a massive immunization campaign is presently in progress, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the public&#x02019;s knowledge and attitude about acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine. Given the size and diversity of India&#x02019;s population, which makes vaccine administration difficult, this is essential.</p><p>Additionally, understanding the reasons behind some healthcare professionals&#x02019; own resistance to the vaccine is crucial. Therefore, it is important to ascertain the relationship between knowledge and attitude toward acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine, establish this relationship and specific demographic variables, and investigate participants&#x02019; reluctance to accept the vaccine.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Developing successful measures to increase vaccination uptake requires a thorough understanding of the information, attitudes, and challenges associated with COVID-19 vaccine acceptance, which has been provided via an explanatory mixed-methods methodology. A thorough investigation of the research issue using both quantitative and qualitative data was made possible by this design. The research design is depicted in Figure <xref rid="FIG1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.</p><fig position="anchor" fig-type="figure" id="FIG1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Research design</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="cureus-0017-00000082867-i01" position="float"/></fig><p>The data collection period was from 2021 to 2022. The study was conducted at a tertiary care teaching and research institute located in South India. Data collection took place at the screening outpatient department (OPD).</p><p>The inclusion criteria were people above 18 years of age attending the screening OPD during data collection who could understand either English or Tamil. The exclusion criteria were pregnant and lactating women, individuals with active symptoms of COVID-19, and people with hearing and speech impairments.</p><p>The study sample size was 369 participants. This calculation was based on an anticipated 40% prevalence (as per the statistician's suggestion,&#x000a0;40% was considered for prevalence was anticipated) of COVID-19 vaccine&#x000a0;knowledge among people aged 18-60 years, with 5% absolute precision and a 5% allowable margin of error. Convenience sampling was used to recruit the participants.</p><p>After obtaining their informed consent, data were collected using an interview technique in their native tongue. Sociodemographic information, including age, marital status, gender, educational attainment, residence, occupation, religion, information source, COVID-19 exposure, comorbidity, and number of COVID-19 vaccine doses received, was gathered quantitatively using a self-structured questionnaire. Eight questions with three alternative answers made up the COVID-19 vaccination knowledge questionnaire, which assessed participants&#x02019; understanding of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. One point was given for each correct response. The scores fell into three categories: inadequate knowledge (1-3, &#x0003c; 50%), moderate knowledge (4-6, 50-75%), and adequate knowledge (7-8, 76-100%). Using perceptions across five points to gauge opinions on the adoption of the COVID-19 vaccination, the Likert scale had 14 items with the following responses: strongly disagree (1), disagree (2), neutral (3), agree (4), and highly agree (5). Unfavorable attitude scores ranged from 14-35 (&#x02264; 50%), neutral attitude scores ranged from 36-53 (50-75%), and favorable attitude scores ranged from 54-70 (76-100%). The researcher created the questionnaire based on expert recommendations and an assessment of pertinent literature. Experts in the field then verified it.</p><p>Qualitative data gathered by an in-depth interview guide with open-ended questions was used to explore participants&#x02019; opinions about COVID-19 vaccination and reasons for vaccine hesitancy. Interviews were conducted until data saturation was achieved. Approval from the Nursing Research Monitoring Committee (No. JIP/CON/NRMC/M.Sc./2020/MSN/7, dated 20.05.2021) and the Institute Ethical Committee (No. JIP/CON/IEC/M.Sc./2020/MSN/7, dated 20.10.2021) was obtained before data collection.</p><p>Statistical analysis</p><p>Quantitative data</p><p>Quantitative data were analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics version 26 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). Descriptive statistics such as frequencies, means, percentages, and standard deviations were used to summarize sociodemographic characteristics, knowledge, and attitude scores. The relationship between knowledge and attitude scores was evaluated using either Spearman&#x02019;s rank correlation coefficient or Pearson&#x02019;s product-moment correlation coefficient, depending on the distribution of the data.</p><p>Qualitative data</p><p>Verbatim transcriptions of recorded interviews were made. To evaluate the transcripts, a deductive coding approach was used, and codes, categories, themes, and subthemes were found. Two researchers coded the transcripts separately to guarantee rigor, and they debated any differences until they came to an agreement. The identified themes and sub-themes were represented using a conceptual framework.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The study included 369 participants, with a median age of 28 years (IQR: 22-37 years); among them, 260 (70.5%) were between 18 and 35 years of age. Of these, 260 participants (70.5%) were aged 18-35 years, 322 (87.3%) were female, and 263 (71.3%) were married. Regarding educational background, 138 participants (37.4%) were graduates, while 179 (48.5%) were homemakers. Additionally, 202 participants (54.7%) lived in rural areas, 346 (93.8%) identified as Hindu, and 206 respondents (55.8%) reported television as their most common source of health information.&#x000a0;</p><p>In terms of medical history, 309 participants (83.7%) had no comorbidities, 329 (89.2%) had not contracted COVID-19, 322 (87.3%) had received the COVID-19 vaccine, and 241 (65.3%) had completed two doses.

Age, the source of health information, COVID-19 vaccination status, and the number of doses received were also significantly correlated with opinions. The majority of participants correctly identified the vaccine&#x02019;s efficacy and purpose, with 334(90.5%) identifying the necessity of two doses and 289(78.3%) acknowledging its role in stopping the spread of COVID-19. Additionally, 237(64.2%) of respondents thought the vaccine worked against both ancient and novel coronavirus strains. Nonetheless, several information gaps were identified, including a lack of clarity regarding the immunization schedule following COVID-19 infection.</p><table-wrap position="float"

A mixed methods approach was used in the study, which allowed for a thorough comprehension of the topic. In-depth interviews and self-structured questionnaires were used to gather data.</p><p>The first objective is to assess the knowledge and attitude on acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccination among the general population. Of the knowledge of the population, 115 (31.2%) had an adequate understanding of the COVID-19 vaccination acceptability, whereas the majority, 226 (61.2%), had moderate knowledge.&#x000a0;Findings from&#x000a0;research from an online survey conducted across six continents reported that the majority of participants exhibited moderate knowledge regarding COVID-19 vaccines, which aligns with the present study&#x02019;s findings. [<xref rid="REF17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In contrast, studies from England and France observed higher levels of understanding, likely due to differences in public health communication and accessibility of vaccine information [<xref rid="REF18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="REF19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Regarding attitudes, 241 (65.3%) of participants in the present study had a positive view of COVID-19 vaccination, which is lower than the rates reported in Italy and Belgium [<xref rid="REF20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="REF21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], but higher than those documented in Egypt and England [<xref rid="REF22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="REF26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. These discrepancies most likely stem from variances in cultural settings, sociodemographic traits, and the timing of the research with respect to vaccination rollouts.</p><p>The second objective is to determine the relationship between attitude and knowledge regarding COVID-19 vaccination acceptance. Knowledge and attitudes about the acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine were found to be statistically significantly positively correlated (r = 0.114, p = 0.029). The p-value of &#x0003c;0.05 was considered statistically significant. This result bolsters the idea that a more positive attitude toward the vaccine&#x02019;s acceptability is linked to greater information about it. This finding is consistent with another study showing a positive relationship between attitude and knowledge (r = 0.452) [<xref rid="REF17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>The third objective is to find out the association between knowledge and attitude on acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine with selected demographic variables. A number of sociodemographic factors, including age, marital status, education, occupation, place of residence, and health information source, were found to be significantly correlated with knowledge. These results align with those of another study conducted in India that found comparable correlations [<xref rid="REF26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. This implies that different demographic groups might have differing levels of knowledge and access to information on COVID-19 vaccines. Age, source of health information, COVID-19 vaccination status, and number of doses of the COVID-19 vaccine received were found to significantly correlate with attitudes toward the vaccine. These results suggest that views toward vaccination are shaped by age, information sources, and individual experiences.</p><p>The fourth objective is to investigate people&#x02019;s reluctance to adopt the COVID-19 vaccine. Rich insights into the causes of vaccine hesitancy were revealed by qualitative data gathered from in-depth interviews. The important theme that surfaced is the fear of side effects, which is a common concern, with 196 (53.1%) participants expressing concerns about possible negative consequences, especially death. Quotes such as "They believe that upper arm pain following vaccination is the reason they were afraid" and "Most of them are afraid because of side effects" illustrate this fear. After taking it, you may have pain, fever, and other health problems. This result aligns with a study conducted in the US that revealed comparable issues [<xref rid="REF23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>Secondly, misinformation and ignorance were clear misconceptions regarding the vaccine&#x02019;s effectiveness and possible long-term consequences. Quotations such as &#x0201c;I think after two doses of vaccination, people getting COVID positive, so taking and not taking the vaccine are the same&#x0201d; exemplify this point. This emphasizes the necessity of knowledge from reliable sources that are understandable, accurate, and easily accessible. The last one is the lack of trust in the government and the healthcare system. Two obstacles were mistrust of the government and worries about the rapidity of vaccine development.</p><p>Overall, this study emphasizes the intricate interactions between variables that affect the uptake of the COVID-19 vaccination. It offers useful information to direct public health initiatives meant to raise immunization rates.</p><p>Study limitations</p><p>The study was conducted at a single tertiary care teaching and research institute in South India, which may limit the generalizability of the findings to other populations and regions.</p><p>Recommendations</p><p>Focused public health initiatives ought to address side effects, worries, and dispel myths regarding the effectiveness and safety of vaccines. It is essential to work against false information and foster confidence in authorities and healthcare professionals. The unique concerns of various demographic groups require culturally sensitive and customized communication tactics, and ongoing research is crucial to track vaccine hesitancy and modify interventions as necessary.</p><p>Public health programs can work to increase vaccination coverage and ultimately shield people and communities from the persistent threat of COVID-19 by comprehending the factors that influence vaccine uptake and addressing issues that contribute to hesitation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Despite the fact that most participants had favourable views and moderate to adequate information regarding the COVID-19 vaccine, vaccine reluctance remained because of false beliefs and concerns about side effects. Improving vaccination uptake and reducing public hesitation need to be addressed through focused awareness efforts and truthful media coverage.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank all the study participants for their kind support throughout the study.
