Although various treatments are available, none have proven fully effective. Exosomes produced by adipose-derived stem cells play crucial roles in enhancing cell regeneration, promoting angiogenesis, regulating inflammation and remodeling the extracellular matrix. Hyaluronic acid, a major extracellular matrix component, is synthesized by hyaluronic acid synthase, with hyaluronic acid synthase 1 being particularly critical for skin repair. This study aimed to investigate whether exosomes derived from adipose-derived stem cells can protect against radiation-induced acute skin damage and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms involving hyaluronic acid synthase 1.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">Thirty-six male adult SD rats were randomly divided into a negative control group, an irradiation group (90&#x000a0;Gy), and a radiation&#x02009;+&#x02009;exosomes group (90&#x000a0;Gy&#x02009;+&#x02009;100 ug exosomes). Three groups of fibroblasts were assigned: one for control, one for radiation (6&#x000a0;Gy), and one for radiation plus exosomes (6&#x000a0;Gy&#x02009;+&#x02009;4 ug exosomes). The effect of ADSC-exos transplantation was evaluated using skin damage score, histopathological analysis, electron microscopy, immunohistochemical staining, immunofluorescence staining, and immunoblotting analysis. Furthermore, small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of hyaluronic acid synthase 1 was performed to explore its regulatory role in the TGF-&#x003b2;/Smad2/3 signaling pathway.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">After irradiation, the ADSC-exos intervention significantly increased the levels of stromal cell-derived factor-1, matrix metalloproteinases, transforming growth factor, basic fibroblast growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor, interleukin 10, interleukin 12, and reduced the expression of the pro-inflammatory factor interleukin 6. Notably, exosomes treatment markedly upregulated hyaluronic acid synthase 1 expression, and small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of hyaluronic acid synthase 1 resulted in reduced phosphorylation of TGF-&#x003b2;/Smad2/3 signaling components, indicating that hyaluronic acid synthase 1 is a critical mediator of this pathway.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par4">Exosomes derived from adipose-derived stem cells alleviate acute radiation-induced dermatitis by enhancing hyaluronic acid synthase 1 expression and activating the TGF-&#x003b2;/Smad2/3 pathway, thereby promoting skin regeneration and repair. These findings suggest that exosomes derived from adipose-derived stem cells may serve as a promising cell-free therapeutic strategy for the prevention and treatment of acute radiation-induced dermatitis.</p></sec><sec><title>Graphical abstract</title><p id="Par5">

Skin, like bone marrow, is particularly sensitive to ionizing radiation, with up to 95% of patients developing moderate to severe reactions. Currently, topical medications used to treat radiation-induced skin damage include glucocorticoids, sucralfate, and silver ion dressings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], though a standardized treatment protocol has yet to be established. Acute radiation-induced dermatitis(ARD) usually appears a few days after treatment, with redness and skin peeling. Chronic radiation-induced dermatitis(CRD) is characterized by skin fibrosis and thickness after 90&#x000a0;days of irradiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. CRD models are often accompanied by severe skin fibrosis, and common drug treatments are less effective. Surgical treatment is often required in clinical practice. Thus, the primary emphasis of this investigation is acute radiation skin injury.</p><p id="Par7">Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are effective treatments for tissue engineering, autoimmune diseases, and graft-versus-host disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Previous research have demonstrated that bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells can prevent radiation-induced liver damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], increase wound healing for radiation-induced skin damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], and improve the longevity of irradiated animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells have been demonstrated to promote the healing of irradiation-induced skin ulcers by increasing keratin synthesis and epithelial cell proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The secretome of human fetal mesenchymal stem cells accelerates the rate of wound healing in rats with radiation-induced skin damage by promoting angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Several studies have shown that stem cell-based interventions can effectively alleviate and repair radiation-related damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Among MSCs, Adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) are increasingly favored due to their abundance, ease of isolation, and strong regenerative capabilities. They play a key role in skin and soft tissue regeneration and have been shown to promote angiogenesis, modulate inflammation, enhance extracellular matrix remodeling, and exhibit potent antioxidant activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. However, during the past several years, an increasing amount of research has shown that paracrine pathways, particularly those involving exosomes, are the primary means by which mesenchymal stem cells aid healing. Exosomes are microscopic vesicles with a diameter of 40&#x02013;100&#x000a0;nm that are surrounded by a bio-lipid membrane. They function as extracellular messengers by transporting their contents, such as microRNAs (miRNAs), messenger RNAs (mRNAs), cell adhesion molecules, cytokines, and proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. As opposed to ADSCs, exosome-based acellular treatment offers numerous benefits, including the capacity to cross the blood&#x02013;brain barrier, low immunogenicity, low tumorigenicity, low cytotoxicity, easy storage, high stability, low degradation, and potential intravenous administration. ADSCs are less impacted by age and skeletal circumstances than bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Thus, we decided to use ADSCs as the exosome source in this investigation.</p><p id="Par8">One of the most prevalent and abundant glycosaminoglycans in the extracellular matrix is hyaluronic acid (HA). It participates in biological processes such as cell growth and migration serving as a core component of the ECM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. It is crucial for processes like embryonic development, wound healing, inflammation, and the growth of malignancies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Moreover, HA has shown remarkable results in the treatment of radioactive skin damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The hyaluronan synthase family, including HAS1, HAS2, and HAS3, synthesizes HA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Studies have shown that the loss of hyaluronan synthase can affect the shape, quality and mechanical properties of bone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Other studies have shown that the selective deletion of HAS1 and HAS3 can increase inflammation in the dermis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Among them, HAS1 is especially expressed in fibroblasts and plays a vital role in skin function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. In recent years, scholars have published relevant literature in NATURE and SCIENCE magazines, finding that mice overexpressing the HAS2 gene exhibit a reduced incidence of both spontaneous and induced cancers, an extended life expectancy, and improved overall health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Removing the trimethylated H3K27 (H3K27me3) mark on the HAS2 site can initiate HA production, exert pro-regenerative effects and accelerate the inflammatory repair of muscle stem cells and muscle repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Therefore, this study will explore the effect of ADSC-exos in preventing acute radiation-induced skin damage while also investigating its mechanism of action with HAS.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Extraction and characterization of ADSCs</title><p id="Par9">The work has been reported according to the ARRIVE guidelines 2.0. Adipose tissue was obtained from donors who underwent elective liposuction at the First Hospital of Harbin Medical University. The collected tissues were washed extensively with PBS containing 1% penicillin&#x02013;streptomycin to remove blood and debris. Then, the tissues were enzymatically digested with 0.1% type I collagenase (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) at 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C with gentle agitation for 45&#x000a0;min. The enzymatic activity was neutralized by adding an equal volume of DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. The resulting cell suspension was filtered through a 100-&#x003bc;m mesh to remove undigested debris and then centrifuged at 300&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;g rpm for 5&#x000a0;min to precipitate the stromal vascular fraction. The cell pellet was resuspended in DMEM containing 10% FBS, 1% penicillin&#x02013;streptomycin, and incubated in T75 flasks humidified with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> at 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C. The medium was replaced every 2&#x02013;3&#x000a0;days. The medium was changed every 2&#x02013;3&#x000a0;days, and when the cells reached 80&#x02013;90% confluence, the adherent cells were detached with 0.25% trypsin and then passaged for expansion.</p><p id="Par10">ADSCs are known for their tri-lineage differentiation potential (osteogenic, adipogenic, and chondrogenic). In this study, we focused on osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation, which are more directly related to the regenerative functions of ADSCs in the context of radiation-induced skin injury. Standard differentiation protocols were used for osteogenic (Alizarin Red S staining) and adipogenic (Oil Red O staining) differentiation. Flow cytometry was used to analyze the immunophenotype of ADSCs, including the expression of CD29, CD34, CD44, CD45, CD14, and CD105.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Preparation of ADSC-exos</title><p id="Par11">The fourth-generation ADSCs were cultured for an additional 24&#x02013;48&#x000a0;h at a density of 80&#x02013;90% in a medium containing 10% exosome-depleted FBS and no extracellular vesicles (Gibco, USA). The supernatant of collected ADSCs was centrifuged, filtered, and transferred to an exosome high-permeability filter tube. The tube was mounted on a T32S5 rotor and moved to an ultracentrifuge, spinning at 100,000&#x000a0;rpm for 70&#x000a0;min. The supernatant was collected, and the precipitate was resuspended in PBS before being ultracentrifuged at 100,000&#x000a0;rpm for 70&#x000a0;min at 4&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C.The supernatant was removed, leaving just the ADSC-exos precipitate. The protein concentration was determined using a BCA protein assay kit. The exosomes were mixed with 100&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l of PBS to achieve a concentration of approximately 0.5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/&#x003bc;l. An electron microscope was used to examine the size and morphological makeup of exosomes. Nanoparticle tracking (Nano Sight NS300) was used to measure the size of isolated exosomes. The levels of CD63, CD9 and TSG101 proteins in both ADSCs and ADSC-exos were evaluated using western blot. ADSC-exos were co-cultured with HSF for 24&#x000a0;h after being labeled with the PKH67 fluorescent cell linker kit (Sigma-Aldrich, MIDI67-1KT). The nuclei were stained with DAPI (Solarbio, C0065), and images were obtained under an Olympus IX81 fluorescence microscope to confirm that ADSC-exos were internalized by fibroblasts. The collected ADSC-exos were either used right away for additional research or frozen at &#x02212;&#x02009;80&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Construction of radioactive animal model</title><p id="Par12">We purchased thirty-six 220&#x02013;250&#x000a0;g of Sprague&#x02013;Dawley (SD) rats from Harbin Medical University in Harbin, Heilongjiang Province, China. Harbin Medical University provided training in animal experimentation for all researchers who operated with animals. The Animal Experiment Center Ethics Committee of the hospital approved all animal experimentation methods, including the radiation of SD rats at the Radiation Center of Harbin Medical University Cancer Hospital. Initially, the rats were put to sleep with an injection of 5% sodium pentobarbital (0.1&#x000a0;mL/100&#x000a0;g), and the inner thigh's rectus femoris muscle was marked for radiation. The irradiation area was approximately 2&#x000a0;cm&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;2&#x000a0;cm, and the radiation dose was 90&#x000a0;Gy. The radiation dose of skin area was selected based on previous studies demonstrating that this dose effectively induces acute radiation dermatitis in SD rats, leading to ulceration, dermal thickening, inflammation, hair follicle loss, and sebaceous gland loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. This model has been widely used for studying radiation-induced skin injury and evaluating potential therapeutic interventions.</p><p id="Par13">36 male SD rats were randomly divided into a negative control (NC) group (normal rats), a Radiation (RT) group, and a RT&#x02009;+&#x02009;ADSC-exos group (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;12 in each group).

To determine the optimal irradiation dose and ADSC-exos concentration for human skin fibroblast (HSF) cells, we conducted a preliminary dose&#x02013;response study using the MTT assay. HSF cells were first exposed to different radiation doses (4&#x000a0;Gy, 6&#x000a0;Gy, and 8&#x000a0;Gy) using a linear accelerator (VARIAN IX, USA). Cell viability was assessed 24&#x000a0;h post-irradiation. The results indicated that at 6&#x000a0;Gy, HSF cells exhibited a significant but not excessive reduction in viability, allowing for the assessment of potential protective effects of ADSC-exos. Higher doses (8&#x000a0;Gy) resulted in excessive cell death, while lower doses (4&#x000a0;Gy) did not induce significant damage. Based on these findings, 6&#x000a0;Gy was selected as the optimal irradiation dose for in vitro experiments. Similarly, to determine the optimal concentration of ADSC-exos, irradiated HSF cells were treated with different concentrations of ADSC-exos (5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g, 10&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g, and 15&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g). Cell viability was assessed using the MTT assay 24&#x000a0;h post-treatment. The results indicated that 10&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g ADSC-exos provided the most significant protective effect without causing excessive proliferation or cytotoxicity.

Simultaneously, RNA was extracted from HSF cells in each group four weeks post-irradiation, reverse transcribed, and subsequently subjected to PCR to assess the expression of genes including bFGF, MMP3, MMP9, SDF-1, TGF-&#x003b2;, IL-10, IL-12, VEGF, and PDGF, yielding results that were largely congruent with those obtained from WB (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig">12</xref>C).<fig id="Fig12"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;12</label><caption><p>Western Blot results and PCR results of HSF cells. <bold>A</bold> Western-blot analysis of protein levels of bFGF, MMP3, SDF-1, MMP3, MMP9, TGF-&#x003b2;, IL-10, IL-12, VEGF, PDGF levels in HSF cells (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;3). <bold>B</bold> Statistical analysis of the quantitative protein expression results for each indicator.

To determine which synthase is most affected by ADSC-exos, we used WB, PCR, and immunohistochemical staining to detect the expression of HAS1, HAS2, and HAS3. Among them, the immunohistochemical experiments on rat tissues found that the expression of HAS1 and HAS3 decreased after irradiation and increased after the addition of exosomes, but the change in HAS1 expression was more pronounced, while the results for HAS3 were not statistically significant (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig13" ref-type="fig">13</xref>). The ADSC-exos group exhibited the most substantially upregulated marker, HAS1, as evidenced by the Western blot experiments on rat tissue and HSF cells (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig14" ref-type="fig">14</xref>). Further, the Western blot findings were consistent with the PCR results (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig15" ref-type="fig">15</xref>A and B) from in vivo and in vitro experiments. The results presented above suggest that HAS1 is the primary mechanism by which exosomes exert their effects. We selected the classic TGF-&#x003b2;/SMAD2/3 pathway for verification in order to illustrate that ADSC-exos specifically target HAS1. To further explore the role of HAS1 in the regulatory network of ADSC-exos, we performed siRNA-mediated HAS1 knockdown in HSF cells. Western blot analysis showed that siRNA-induced inhibition of HAS1 led to a significant reduction in TGF-&#x003b2; expression and Smad2/3 phosphorylation levels (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig15" ref-type="fig">15</xref>C and D). These results indicate that HAS1 is not merely a downstream effector but plays an active role in maintaining the activation of the TGF-&#x003b2;/Smad2/3 pathway. This suggests a possible positive feedback loop, where HAS1 expression further enhances TGF-&#x003b2;/Smad2/3 signaling, thereby promoting extracellular matrix remodeling and wound healing.<fig id="Fig13"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;13</label><caption><p>Immunohistochemical detection of HSA expression in tissues from each group of rats. <bold>A</bold> Representative images of skin tissue immunohistochemically stained for HAS1, HAS2 and HAS3 antibodies (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;3). <bold>B</bold> In a rat model of radiation-induced dermatitis, HAS1 expression was reduced in the RT group and increased in the ADSC-exos group.

CRD often comes with severe skin fibrosis, for which drug treatment is often ineffective. Moreover, prolonged ulcers can increase the risk of skin malignancies. Therefore, we believe that preventing and alleviating radiation skin damage holds significant clinical value. Both BMSCs and ADSCs are regarded as superior stem cell sources for regenerative medicine and tissue engineering [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. However, BMSCs have the disadvantages of low stem cell yield and limited available tissue. ADSCs are a better stem cell source due to their advantages of greater tissue availability, higher stem cell concentration, and reduced morbidity at the donor site. Multiple research studies have examined the utilization of ADSCs for the remediation of radiation-induced dermal injury. Sultan et al. shown that fat grafting can alleviate both acute and chronic radiation dermatitis in a murine model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Human-derived mesenchymal stem cells promote healing in the early stages of radiation-induced skin condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Huang et al. discovered that ADSCs expedite the healing of radiation-induced ulcers by enhancing angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. ADSCs reduce tissue protease factor F levels and prevent cell death, which helps to radiation dermatitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Adipose mesenchymal stem cell-conditioned media enhances the healing of radiation-induced skin lesions in rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par38">ADSCs' ability to regenerate damaged tissue is mostly attributed to their secretome's autocrine and paracrine actions, with ADSC-exos playing an essential part. Exosomes derived from human ADSCs have been demonstrated to stimulate skin fibroblast migration and proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. By triggering the SIRT1 pathway, ADSC-exos reduce radiation-induced brain damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. One of the key mechanisms through which ADSCs exert their therapeutic effects is the secretion of growth factors and cytokines, which contribute significantly to wound healing and tissue regeneration. Growth factors such as TGF-&#x003b2;, bFGF, VEGF, and PDGF play critical roles in promoting angiogenesis, extracellular matrix remodeling, and fibroblast proliferation. Additionally, ADSCs secrete anti-inflammatory cytokines like IL-10 and IL-12, which help modulate the immune response and reduce inflammation, thereby promoting an optimal wound-healing environment. These factors collectively enhance tissue repair and improve the regeneration of damaged skin following radiation exposure.</p><p id="Par39">But limited studies have investigated on the direct treatment of radiation dermatitis with ADSC-exos and the related mechanisms of action. In this study, we used ADSC-exos for the first time to treat a rat model of radiation and a radiation cell model. ADSC-exos effectively reduce the severity of ARD in rats by promoting extracellular matrix repair, angiogenesis, hair follicle and sebaceous gland regeneration, inflammation inhibition, and reducing radiation damage to HSF cells. It also improves the ability of HSF cells to grow and migrate.All of these findings point to the fact that ADSC-exos plays a significant role in ARD mitigation. Our study demonstrated that ADSC-exos significantly upregulate the secretion of bFGF, SDF-1, and MMP3 in irradiated HSF cells, which play essential roles in wound healing through fibroblast proliferation, angiogenesis, and extracellular matrix remodeling. Furthermore, immunohistochemical analysis in rat tissue confirmed that the expression patterns of these factors were consistent with the immunofluorescence results, indicating that ADSC-exos regulate these regenerative factors at both cellular and tissue levels. The sustained expression of MMP3 and MMP9 at 4&#x000a0;weeks suggests that ECM remodeling is still active, supporting angiogenesis and final tissue organization. Additionally, IL-12 remains elevated, likely reflecting its role in immune regulation and infection prevention, ensuring complete resolution of inflammation. These findings indicate that while ADSC-exos promotes faster healing, tissue remodeling continues beyond the observed period.</p><p id="Par40">ECM accumulation and circulation are common features of tissue damage, healing, and remodeling in several human disorders. HA is a major component of ECM and plays a critical role in regulating tissue injury, facilitating repair, and modulating disease outcomes. HA's function depends on its molecular size, geographical position, and interactions with binding partners. Cell-surface HA shields tissues from environmental damage while promoting regeneration and repair. The interaction of HA and its related proteins contributes to the development of a wide range of human illnesses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Although the primary structure of HA is simple, it regulates a wide range of biological responses in a complex and nuanced manner. Extracellular HA plays a pivotal role in regulating cell&#x02013;cell and cell&#x02013;matrix interactions, controlling migration, proliferation, apoptosis, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and stem cell function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>].</p><p id="Par41">In mammals, three multi-spanning transmembrane enzymes (HAS1, HAS2, and HAS3) synthesize it. HAS3 activity is necessary for the production of small molecular weight HA, which can impact the inflammatory response during ventilator-induced lung damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. After destroying the HAS2 gene in stromal fibroblasts, some scholars found that there was a significant impairment in macrophage recruitment, which indicates the contribution of interstitial-derived HA in the mobilization of macrophages in tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Mouse epidermal keratinocytes exhibit significant expression of HAS3 mRNA throughout the basal cell layer and extending to the granular cell layer. The results demonstrate that HAS3 gene expression is essential for regulating hyaluronic acid production in the epidermis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Some scholars have found that HAS1 expression is absent in mucosal fibroblasts, but is detected in dermal fibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Both HAS1 and HAS2 mRNA are detected in the dermis and epidermis of murine skin. When cultured with TGF-&#x003b2; stimulation, the mRNA of HAS1 and HAS2 in fibroblasts is upregulated, though their expression patterns differ, indicating that the HAS1 and HAS2 genes are independently regulated, and the synthesized hyaluronic acid also has different functions in the epidermis and dermis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Research suggests that HAS1 may have a role in inflammation by interacting with cytokines and other variables [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. To demonstrate the effect of ADSC-exos on the hyaluronan synthase family HAS1, HAS2, and HAS3, we performed immunohistochemistry, WB, PCR, and other experiments, and ultimately found that it exerted the most pronounced effect on HAS1. Our findings indicate that ADSC-exos significantly upregulates HAS1, which is associated with the activation of TGF-&#x003b2;/Smad2/3 signaling. Interestingly, when HAS1 was silenced (si-HAS1 group), the activation of TGF-&#x003b2; and phosphorylation of Smad2/3 were significantly reduced, suggesting that HAS1 is necessary for ADSC-exos-mediated TGF-&#x003b2;/Smad2/3 signaling. Furthermore, our results suggest that in the context of ADSC-exos treatment, HAS1 acts upstream of TGF-&#x003b2;/Smad2/3, possibly initiating a positive feedback loop that enhances tissue regeneration. Further studies are required to elucidate whether TGF-&#x003b2; activation is solely dependent on HAS1 or if additional pathways are involved.</p><p id="Par42">However, there are some limitations in this study. For instance, this study utilized exosomes derived from human adipose-derived stem cell lines. Individual factors of patients, such as advanced age, obesity, and disease, may negatively impact the regenerative potential of ADSCs in terms of growth and differentiation. Here, we demonstrated that ADSC-exos have a protective effect on ARD by promoting angiogenesis and mitigating inflammation. Furthermore, ADSCs can upregulate HAS1 expression to regulate ECM homeostasis and protect the skin. However, the specific growth factors or microRNAs secreted by ADSC-exos that directly target HAS1 have yet to be elucidated. Therefore, in the future, we aim to further investigate the specific mechanism of action of HAS1 on radiation dermatitis and its role in other related diseases.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par43">This study shows that ADSC-exos can prevent and alleviate the occurrence of ARD by promoting related vascular factors, growth factors, inhibiting inflammation, and regulating extracellular matrix remodeling, and that ADSC-exos can protect against radiation-induced skin damage by upregulating HAS1 through the TGF-&#x003b2;/SMAD2/3 pathway. In conclusion, ADSC-exos is a promising cell-free therapeutic technique for avoiding ARD. This study offers a fresh and complementary perspective for basic research on ARD treatment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>
