Despite this, traditional drug selection, predominantly relies on tumor markers and clinical staging, has underutilized these drugs due to ignoring patient genomic diversity. Patient-derived organoids (PDOs) and corresponding patient-derived organoid xenograft (PDOX) models offer a way to better understand and address this.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">In this study, we established PDOs and PDOX models from PDAC clinical samples. These models were analyzed using immunohistochemistry, H&#x00026;E staining, and genomic profiling. Drug screening with 111 FDA-approved drugs was performed on PDOs, and drug responses in PDOs and PDOX models were compared to assess consistency with clinical treatment outcomes. Gene analysis was conducted to explore the molecular mechanisms underlying variations in drug responses. Additionally, by analyzing the sequencing results from various drug-sensitive groups, the identified differential gene-drug metabolism gene UGT1A10 were modulated in PDOs to evaluate its impact on drug efficacy. A co-culture system of PDOs with immune cells was developed to study the efficacy of immunotherapies.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">PDOs and matched PDOX models retain the morphological, biological, and genomic characteristics of the primary tumor. Exome sequencing and RNA sequencing confirmed both the consistency and heterogeneity among the PDOs. High-throughput drug screening revealed significant variability in drug sensitivity across different organoids, yet PDOs and PDOX derived from the same patient exhibited a high degree of concordance in response to clinical chemotherapy agents. The gene expression analysis of PDOs with significant differences in drug sensitivity revealed UGT1A10 as a crucial regulator. The knockdown of UGT1A10 notably increased drug sensitivity. Furthermore, immune cells demonstrated specific cytotoxicity towards the organoids, underscoring the potential of the co-culture system for application in tumor immunotherapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par4">Our results highlight the necessity for personalized treatment strategies that consider genomic diversity beyond tumor markers, thus validating the utility of PDOs and PDOX models in advancing PDAC research and personalized medicine.</p></sec><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s13046-025-03332-8.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Patient-derived organoids (PDOs)</kwd><kwd>Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC)</kwd><kwd>Genomic diversity</kwd><kwd>Personalized treatment</kwd><kwd>Immunotherapy</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></funding-source><award-id>32070532 and 32270566</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Laboratory Animal Foundation Program</institution></funding-source><award-id>SYDW_KY 2021-14</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Shaanxi Province Innovation Capability Support Plan</institution></funding-source><award-id>2022PT-38</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Italian National Cancer Institute &#x02018;Regina Elena&#x02019; 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par14">Pancreatic cancer is one of the most aggressive malignancies, with 85% of patients diagnosed at an advanced stage. Surgery remains the primary treatment option, yet the median 5-year survival rate after surgery is modest (10%), with a recurrence rate ranging from 70 to 80% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the most common form, accounting for most 90% of all pancreatic cancer cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The current first-line postoperative chemotherapy regimens, such as the combination of gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel, marginally extend median survival by only 2 to 4 months, underscoring an urgent need for novel therapeutic strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par15">The advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS) has revolutionized the landscape of PDAC treatment by identifying genomic tumor drivers and potential targeted therapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. By integrating bioinformatics, NGS has been used to identify key mutations and pathways in PDAC, facilitating the development of targeted treatments. These treatments target specific molecular markers to inhibit tumor growth and spread, disrupt cellular signaling, and hinder angiogenesis. However, the complexity of these drugs and the insufficiency of tumor marker expression to capture patient diversity have impeded the clinical use of biomarkers for predicting chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. There is an urgent need for a preclinical model that can rapidly and accurately screen drugs based on individual genetic profiles to develop personalized, precision medicine.</p><p id="Par16">Patient-derived organoids (PDOs) are three-dimensional (3D) tumor models that well preserve the genetic, morphological, and cellular diversity of the original tissue, offering a significant preclinical tool for cancer personalized research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. This 3D culture conditions also facilitate the study of complex interactions between immune and tumor cells, making the assessment of immunotherapies feasible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].

The histological and molecular features of the original tumor tissue have been characterized using morphological analysis and sequencing. The antitumour effects of 111 commonly used PDAC drugs and immunotherapies were assessed. By integrating NGS analysis, high-throughput drug screening, PDOX experiments, and patient clinical outcome data, personalized drug strategies were comprehensively evaluated. We specifically targeted the differential gene - drug metabolism-related gene UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 10 (UGT1A10) in PDOs to explore its potential as a prognostic biomarker for PDAC. Additionally, a PDO-peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) or engineered chimeric antigen receptor macrophages (CAR-Ms) co-culture model has been established to test the efficacy of immunotherapies. Our ultimate goal was to develop an ideal preclinical model that captures patient heterogeneity in vitro, contributing to the advancement of personalized treatment for patients with PDAC.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Clinical samples</title><p id="Par18">Clinical tumor specimens and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were collected from patients with PDAC at the Xijing Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University (FMMU), Xi&#x02019;an, China (Sup Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>).

Our findings revealed that mutations were predominantly situated in intronic regions, in contrast to exonic coding regions. This pattern implies that PDAC development and progression are characterized by significant genomic instability, resulting in the accumulation of mutations. Only a minority of these mutations are located in functionally critical exons and are instrumental in driving tumorigenesis. The majority of mutations are likely to be &#x0201c;passenger&#x0201d; in nature, meaning they do not directly contribute to the initiation or progression of the tumor.

Further analysis indicates that these gene products are critically involved in several fundamental biological processes, including cell cycle regulation, RNA polymerase-mediated transcription, and cell division (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>H). These findings underscore the active participation of these gene products in processes vital for cell proliferation and functional regulation, potentially offering insights into the pathogenesis and progression of pancreatic cancer.</p><p id="Par52">The KEGG-enriched pathways predominantly involved cell cycle-related pathways, such as the PI3K-AKT, MAPK, Rap1, RAS, and calcium pathways (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>I). These pathways are well-established for their roles in mediating cell growth, proliferation, survival, and apoptosis, all of which are central to the regulation of the cell cycle and are frequently dysregulated in cancer, including pancreatic cancer. However, when analyzing the differential gene expression profiles of the five PDOs, the clustering heatmap revealed significant differences in gene expression patterns across the samples (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>J). Despite showing some similarity in overall mutational features and enrichment of cell cycle-related pathways, the distinct gene expression patterns suggest a certain degree of heterogeneity in the molecular mechanisms driving the progression and behavior of each PDO.

The KEGG-enriched pathways were mainly related to cell cycle and cell differentiation pathways (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>G). The substantial differences in gene expression may offer a molecular explanation for the observed disparities in drug sensitivity between PDO_3 and PDO_4, potentially owing to unique genetic and pathway alterations.

</p><p id="Par63">To further verify the impact of this gene on drug sensitivity, we downregulate the expression of the UGT1A10 gene in PDO_3 using lentiviral transduction for testing. PCR and Western Blot results confirmed successful knockdown of UGT1A10, named sh-PDO_3 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>D-E). Subsequently, the clinically common drugs gemcitabine, cisplatin, paclitaxel, irinotecan, and 5-FU were used for drug sensitivity testing of PDO_3 and si-UGT1A10. The results demonstrated that better tumor-killing effects was observed in the si-UGT1A10 group for gemcitabine, irinotecan, cisplatin, and paclitaxel, but worse drug sensitivity was detected for 5-FU. Overall, the expression of UGT1A10 affected the drug sensitivity of PDO_3 to commonly used clinical drugs (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>F). We further established the gemcitabine-resistant PDAC cell line, AsPC-1_GE, through continuous exposure to gemcitabine (Sup Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>A). Western blot analysis revealed that AsPC-1_GE has elevated UGT1A10 expression levels compared to the parental AsPC-1 line (Sup Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>B). In our analysis of the GEO dataset GSE140077 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi</ext-link>), we compared the bulk RNA-seq data between three human PDAC cell (CFPAC-1) samples and their corresponding three gemcitabine-resistant counterparts. The volcano plot displays the outcomes of this analysis, with statistical significance indicated by Padj&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05 and fold change (LogFC) thresholds of &#x0003e;&#x02009;1 or &#x0003c; -1.

The encircled point highlights the upregulated differential gene UGT1A10 (Sup Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>). In addition, we have obtained a series of important findings closely related to the role of UGT1A10 in pancreatic cancer. In the TNM staging system, &#x0201c;T&#x0201d; represents the size of the primary tumor and the extent of local invasion. The larger the value, the larger the tumor or the more extensive invasion range; &#x0201c;N&#x0201d; represents the involvement of regional lymph nodes, with higher values indicating more severe lymph node metastasis; In this staging system, &#x0201c;M&#x0201d; represents distant metastasis, where &#x0201c;M1&#x0201d; indicates the presence of distant metastasis, and &#x0201c;Mx&#x0201d; indicates that the status of distant metastasis cannot be evaluated. Based on this system, we conducted our relevant research. First, the expression level of UGT1A10 was found to exhibit a positive correlation trend with the pathological grade of the corresponding clinical pancreatic cancer (Sup Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref>A). When we ranked the clinical information corresponding to PDO according to the severity of the disease from high to low as pT3N1Mx (PDO_3), pT2NxM1 (PDO_1), pT2N0M1 (PDO_2) and pT2N1Mx (PDO_4), we further found that this ranking of disease severity also exhibited a positive correlation trend with the expression of UGT1A10 (Sup Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref>B).</p><p id="Par64">In the process of in - depth exploration of the function of UGT1A10, after knocking down UGT1A10 in the organoid PDO_3, qPCR detection revealed that the related drug - resistant genes showed a significant downward trend (Sup Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref>C). The KEGG enrichment bar chart intuitively shows that UGT1A10 can participate in the regulation of the drug - resistance mechanism through the PI3K - AKT pathway (Sup Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref>D). Compared with the parental AsPC-1 cell line, the gemcitabine - resistant cell line AsPC-1_GE exhibits increased expression of UGT1A10, p-AKT and AKT. In contrast, compared with the negative control group (NC group), the organoids with UGT1A10 knockdown show decreased expression of p-AKT and AKT (Sup Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref>E). The above - mentioned series of results comprehensively and deeply demonstrate the crucial role of UGT1A10 in the pathological grade and drug - resistance mechanism of pancreatic cancer.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Evaluating the immunotherapy efficacy of pembrolizumab and CAR-Ms through PDO</title><p id="Par65">Considering that PDO_3 is less sensitive to chemotherapy and targeted drugs, we constructed a co-culture model of organoids with PBMCs from autologous to test the effect of the PD-1 inhibitor pembrolizumab [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. First, we detected the expression of PD-L1 in PDO_1, PDO_3, and PDO_4. Before conducting further experiments, we analyzed the HLA typing results of PDO_1, PDO_3 and PDO_4 to confirm their origin. This analysis provided crucial information for the construction of the co-culture model and the subsequent interpretation of the experimental results (Sup Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8</xref>). For the co-culture experiment, we chose the organoid culture medium as the optimal medium. Although T-cell culture medium is beneficial for the growth, activation, and functional performance of T-cells, our experiment focuses on the cytotoxicity of immune cells against tumor cells. The organoid culture medium can maintain the structural and functional integrity of organoids, mimic the in-vivo environment to promote interactions between cells, enhance the effectiveness of the experiment, reduce irrelevant interference, improve data reliability, and also reduce non-specific killing, helping to more accurately evaluate immune - mediated cytotoxicity. To verify the rationality of this choice, we carried out additional experiments and provided supplementary data. T-cells were cultured in T-cell culture medium and organoid culture medium for 72&#x000a0;h, respectively. Subsequently, cell viability assays and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (q-PCR) assays were performed to evaluate the viability and functional status of the T-cells. The experimental results showed that there were no significant differences in the viability and functional indices of T-cells under the two culture medium conditions. This finding indicates that the use of organoid culture medium does not affect the viability and functions of T-cells within a 72-hour culture period (Sup Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9</xref>). The results showed that the expression of PD-L1 both in the original tumor and PDO_1/3 was positive, while PDO_4 was negative (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>A). Subsequently, we used the PDO and PBMC co-culture model to evaluate the effect of pembrolizumab (an ICIs). The results showed that in PDO_1 and PDO_3 with positive PD-L1 expression, the organoids lost their original 3D structure, turned black, and there was a significant decrease in both the diameter and spheroid formation rate (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>B, Sup Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">11</xref>A). These findings suggest that pembrolizumab may trigger the destruction and demise of PD-L1-positive organoids by stimulating PBMC-mediated immune responses. We then collected the supernatant from the co-culture system and quantified the levels of IL-2, granzyme B, and interferon-&#x003b3;. The results showed that the release of cytokines in the pembrolizumab group was markedly higher than that the control group (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>C). However, in PDO_4, the cytokine levels did not differ significantly from those in the control group (Sup Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">11</xref>B). These results indicate that under 3D co-culture conditions, immune cells were effectively activated, demonstrating that this system successfully mimics the effects of ICIs in vitro. Furthermore, PD-L1-positive organoids displayed significant tumor-killing effects following pembrolizumab treatment, further validating the reliability of this co-culture system in assessing the efficacy of ICIs.</p><p id="Par66">

</p><p id="Par67">Adoptive cell therapy is a crucial part of immunotherapy, but its effectiveness against solid tumors is limited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. To address this, we developed a co-culture model utilizing PDO and CAR-macrophages (CAR-Ms) to more accurately replicate the tumor microenvironment and assess therapeutic outcomes. Initially, we engineered CAR-Ms by combining a humanized single-chain variable fragment with Fc&#x003b3;RIIa and silencing SIRP&#x003b1; using shRNA. CAR-shSIRP&#x003b1;-M cells showed an M1-like phenotype and strong cytotoxicity against HER2-positive tumor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Therefore, we identified high levels of HER2 expression in PDO_1 and PDO_4, which are suitable models for evaluating HER2-targeted therapies (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>D). Finally, in a co-culture system comprising PDOs and CAR-Ms, we observed that CAR-Ms had a significant tumoricidal effect on PDOs with elevated HER2 expression, diminished sphere-forming ability, and triggered tumor cell apoptosis (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>E-F). This suggests that CAR-Ms can inhibit tumor cell proliferation and growth, thereby validating their cytotoxic potential in HER2-positive tumors.</p><p id="Par68">Moreover, immunofluorescence technology was applied to analyze co-culture systems. CAR-Ms were observed in close proximity to PDOs (PDO_1 and PDO_4), infiltrating the tumor microenvironment and engaging directly with tumor cells, which underscores their capacity to specifically target HER2-positive cancer cells (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>G). Additionally, we noted enhanced secretion of TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-6, indicative of a robust immune response (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>H, Sup Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>B). CAR-Ms enhance antitumor effectiveness by modulating the inflammatory response within the tumor microenvironment. These results suggests that the co-culture model of PDO and CAR-Ms more accurately simulates the tumor microenvironment and serves as a valuable tool for evaluating the efficacy of immunotherapies.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par69">The main characteristics of PDAC are poor prognosis and high mortality rate. In recent years, progress in sequencing technology, as well as the development of chemotherapeutic drugs, targeted drugs, and immunotherapeutic drugs, has made the treatment options for PDAC more diverse. However, it is difficult to summarize the genomic diversity and individual differences among patients based solely on their clinical status and staging, and there is an urgent need for an ideal preclinical model that can interpret patient heterogeneity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. The emergence of PDO models has provided a new method for solving this problem.</p><p id="Par70">In this study, we established PDO and corresponding PDOX models derived from PDAC, integrating patient sequencing and clinical data to assess the efficacy of PDO models as preclinical tools and to explore their potential applications. Few preclinical models accurately reflect the clinical and molecular heterogeneity of patients, which limits the further development of treatment strategies. While the use of PDOs can address this issue, further research is needed to determine whether PDOs can retain the corresponding molecular characteristics of the patients over time and maintain similar drug responses in vitro. To maintain genetic stability, we selected PDOs within 5&#x02013;10 passages for sequencing and subsequent experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. It is not only possible to obtain a sufficient number of tumor cells to support the need for high-throughput drug screening, but also to retain the main tumor-driving genes and drug targets of the original tumor tissue using whole exome sequencing. This 3D culture in vitro only led to mutations in approximately 3% of the genes, which is a significant advancement compared to traditional primary cell culture. In terms of time, throughput, and preservation of the mutational characteristics and genes of the original tumor tissue, PDOs essentially meet the requirements of a preclinical model.</p><p id="Par71">To further validate the effectiveness of PDOs for high-throughput drug screening, we established corresponding PDOX models using xenograft PDOs in NCG mice. Four PDOX models were successfully obtained from five organoids that could be stably passaged. Both PDO_1 and matched PDOX displayed the highest sensitivity to gemcitabine, while their sensitivity to other drugs was markedly lower. Furthermore, the combination of gemcitabine and cisplatin yielded a greater tumor cell inhibition rate than either drug alone did. The drug sensitivity outcomes from PDO_1 were further validated in patient 1. The regimen combining of gemcitabine and cisplatin showed better tumor growth reduction in both PDO_1 and its matching PDOX model, also effectively suppressing tumor growth in the patient. These findings suggested that PDOs and matched PDOX models can function as viable preclinical models, parallel to clinical settings, in guiding the selection of therapeutic drugs for patients. The combination of in vivo and in vitro experimental results greatly enhances the credibility of PDOs in drug screening.</p><p id="Par72">Our analysis, which includes sequencing, drug screening, PDOX in vivo experiments, and clinical patient data, reveals significant variability in the tumor-killing efficacy of different drugs and substantial differences among individual patients. This indicates that while the expression of tumor markers can predict the prognosis of treatment to an extent, the heterogeneity among patients significantly affects the accuracy of treatment prognosis predictions. By analyzing the sequencing results from various drug-sensitive groups and conducting expression and prognostic analyses of selected genes within TCGA, we identified UGT1A10 and CA9. These genes are highly expressed in patients with drug insensitivity, show significant differences in expression between tumor and normal tissues, and are associated with poorer patient survival rates.</p><p id="Par73">The potency of anti-cancer drugs is not only due to their direct cytotoxicity to tumor cells, but also due to their capacity to facilitate drug transport and delivery to precise molecular targets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] UGT1A10, a member of the UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzyme family, plays a crucial role in drug metabolism. This enzyme is integral to drug inactivation and excretion, potentially underpinning drug resistance in patient. UGT1A10&#x02019;s primary function is to transfer glucuronic acid to various endogenous and exogenous compounds, thereby enhancing their water solubility and promoting their elimination from the body. This process could significantly influence the ultimate efficacy of drug therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Our findings suggest that variations in UGT1A10 expression may be correlated with differences in drug sensitivity among PDOs. Preliminary analysis of UGT1A10 expression levels in TCGA database revealed higher expression in pancreatic cancer patients, which was associated with a poorer prognosis. In our study, knockdown of the UGT1A10 gene in PDO_3 induce better tumor-killing effects for gemcitabine, paclitaxel, cisplatin, irinotecan, indicating that the expression of UGT1A10 affected drug sensitivity. Furthermore, validation experiments demonstrate that high levels of UGT1A10 expression are detected in the gemcitabine-resistant PDAC cell line, suggesting that UGT1A10 may be a potential target for drug resistance. All these results indicate that genetic diversity should be considered in personalized cancer treatment research before concentrating on tumor markers expression, to advance personalized treatment strategies based on individual patient differences.</p><p id="Par74">The emergence and development of immunotherapy has provided new ideas for the treatment of PDAC, especially for pancreatic patients that do not respond well to chemotherapy. Although PDOs capture patient heterogeneity to a certain extent, they lack a tumor microenvironment (TME) and are difficult to use for evaluating immunotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Establishing a co-culture model of PDOs and PBMCs may offer a promising avenue for assessment of immunotherapies. While the expression of UGT1A10 influences the drug sensitivity of PDO_3 to commonly used clinical medications, the presence of PD-L1 in both the original tumor and PDO_3 was consistently positive. This indicates the potential for selecting PDO_3 as a candidate for ICIs immunotherapy. In the assessment of the effect of the immunotherapy drug pembrolizumab, we found that PDO_3 in the co-culture model exhibited enhanced tumor-killing effects and elevated cytokine release.</p><p id="Par75">Macrophages exhibit a strong capacity for tumor infiltration and constitute the predominant immune cell population in solid tumors. The potential of macrophage-mediated phagocytosis as a cancer treatment is promising [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. To validate the targeted killing capability of CAR-modified macrophages, we co-cultured CAR-Ms exhibiting an M1-like phenotype and potent cytotoxicity against HER2-positive tumor cells with PDO expressing high levels of HER2. These CAR-Ms were found to suppress tumor cell proliferation and growth. CAR-Ms significantly enhance their antitumor potency by modulating the inflammatory response within the TME. This co-culture model provides a more precise simulation of the TME. These experimental outcomes confirmed that immune cells can survive and perform effectively within the PDO co-culture system, underscoring the potential of this model for assessing the efficacy of immunotherapies. Future studies could enhance this model by integrating additional immune cell types and elements of the tumor microenvironment, thus creating a more holistic representation of the intricate in vivo tumor ecosystem. Such improvements would facilitate more nuanced evaluations of patient-specific tumor-immune dynamics, laying the groundwork for the development of personalized immunotherapies for patient refractory to chemotherapy. By refining this model, we provide more precise instruments for the advancement of precision medicine, ultimately enhancing treatment outcomes for cancer patients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par76">PDAC treatment requires personalized strategies that consider genomic diversity beyond traditional tumor markers. In this regard, we have successfully established PDOs and their corresponding PDOX models. PDOs maintain the mutation landscape of the original tissue, with differential genes causing individual variation among PDOs. To some extent, PDO and matched PDOX can serve as parallel preclinical models to predict clinical responses. The two PDOs exhibited significantly different drug sensitivities owing to the number of differential genes, particularly the variation in UGT1A10 expression. Further use of a co-culture system of PDO and immune cells can assess the efficacy of immunotherapy in vitro. Thus, combining the molecular characteristics and therapeutic analysis of PDOs can predict clinical responses and guide personalized PDAC treatment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec27" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.</p><p>
