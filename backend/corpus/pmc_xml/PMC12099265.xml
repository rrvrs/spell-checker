The 2021 Australian Census of Population and Housing data showed that nearly a third (29.1%) of the Australian population was born overseas and of these nearly two-thirds have migrated from low- and middle-income countries (Australian Bureau of Statistics, <xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>). People leave their country of origins for many reasons. Some voluntarily seek improvement in their own or their family&#x02019;s circumstances but others are forced to leave due to internal and external conflict, environmental disasters, and risk of persecution (McAuliffe and Triandafyllidou, <xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>). In Australia, many women migrants from low- and middle-income countries either enter through the Humanitarian Program for refugees and asylum seekers including the Women at Risk programme or the family and partner visa programme (De Maio <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, <xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Although migration has many benefits and offers new opportunities, it is also accompanied by losses and unique challenges.</p><p>

</p><p>Migration to a new country of residence requires becoming familiar with and navigating new systems including healthcare systems. Australia has a two-tiered healthcare system. Medicare is the universal public health insurance scheme which provides free or low-cost subsidised healthcare. In addition, individuals may choose to purchase private health insurance which provides the choice of accessing healthcare outside the public system, but however requires contribution towards the cost of the healthcare.</p><p>Primary healthcare in Australia is funded under Medicare and includes health promotion, prevention, early intervention, treatment of acute conditions, and management of chronic conditions and is delivered in diverse settings such as general practices, community health centres, allied health practices, and more recently via communication technologies such as telehealth and video consultations. Primary healthcare is provided by a range of healthcare professionals such as General practitioners (GPs), nurses and midwives, allied health professionals, pharmacists, dentists, and Aboriginal health practitioners.</p><p>Health beliefs and behaviours, and expectations of healthcare are shaped by culture. Because of this, migrants&#x02019; access to and experiences of healthcare in the destination country are likely to differ from their country of origin which may result in dissatisfaction and disengagement with care (Machado <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, <xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>). Additionally, limited health information in community languages, (Robertshaw <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, <xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>, Suphanchaimat <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, <xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) inability to communicate proficiently in the destination country&#x02019;s language and inability to access and navigate the healthcare system (Ahmed <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, <xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>) are commonly cited barriers to migrants receiving optimal healthcare.</p><p>Health literacy refers to how individuals access and understand information related to health and healthcare, and how they use and act on this information in their daily lives. It is determined by the individual&#x02019;s skills and capacities as well as the demands and complexity of the healthcare environment. Vulnerable populations such as migrants who speak a language other than that of the host country are more likely to have low health literacy skills which has been shown to result in lower participation in health promotion programmes, preventive healthcare, and higher rates of emergency care and hospitalization (Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care, <xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>).</p><p>Stanzel and colleagues (2019, 2020) (Stanzel <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, <xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>, Stanzel <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, <xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>b) explored menopause-related health literacy and experiences of menopause-related care among women who had migrated from low- and middle-income countries to Melbourne, Australia. They found that migrant women view menopause and associated health changes as a normal life stage and therefore do not see the need to seek healthcare for menopause-related symptoms. Instead, they employ self-care strategies and remedies used in their country of origin to manage any menopause-related symptoms and seek health information mostly from families and friends. In addition, women reported rarely initiating conversations about menopausal health with healthcare providers, because, in some cultures, women&#x02019;s health, including menopause, is considered an intimate topic not openly spoken about.</p><p>It is widely documented that the risks of chronic non-communicable diseases increase in midlife, which in women occurs around the time of menopause (Harlow <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, <xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Health behaviours such as regular exercise (Anderson and Durstine, <xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>) and a balanced diet reduce these risks (Cena and Calder, <xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Hence, the menopausal transition offers the opportunity to assess and review health and health behaviours to optimize health in older age.</p><p>However, in a survey of primary healthcare professionals conducted in 2019, Stanzel et al found that despite most believing that migrant women are interested in health information related to menopause and midlife only about a third routinely offered this to migrant women (Stanzel <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, <xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>a). The aim of this study was to gauge primary healthcare providers&#x02019; perceptions of barriers and enablers for providing menopause-related care to women who have migrated from low- and middle-income countries.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Method</title><sec sec-type="other" id="s2-1"><title>Study design</title><p>A cross-sectional study using an anonymous online survey with 17 questions with fixed response options assessed PHCPs beliefs about providing menopause-related care to mirgrant women from low-and middle income countries. Two questions had open-ended response options: (1) &#x02018;Have you identified any additional barriers for discussing menopause-related health with immigrant women?&#x02019; and (2) &#x02018;Have you any other suggestions for how comprehensive menopause-related health consultations to immigrant women can be facilitated?&#x02019;</p></sec><sec sec-type="other" id="s2-2"><title>Respondents and recruitment procedure</title><p>To be eligible to participate in the study respondents had to be a primary healthcare practitioner (PHCP) either a medical practitioner or a nurse working in primary healthcare with experience in providing care to peri- and postmenopausal migrant women from low- or middle-income countries.</p><p>Representatives of 15 national- and state-based healthcare professional organizations across Australia, five primary health organizations, and 31 primary health networks were telephoned to promote the survey and distribute it to their members through newsletters and social media.</p><p>Those organizations who agreed to distribute the survey were sent a brief introduction and description of the survey, which included a link to the survey and a QR code which could be scanned to access the survey.</p><p>Information about the purpose of the study, eligibility criteria, and what participation involved could be accessed via a link. Having read this information, those who were eligible and willing to take part provided implied consent to participate by proceeding to the survey link. The survey was hosted by Qualtrics (Provo, UT, USA) and opened from October 2018 to April 2019. In recognition and appreciation of respondents&#x02019; time, those who completed the survey could enter a draw for the chance to receive one of three gift cards each valued at A$100.</p></sec><sec sec-type="other" id="s2-3"><title>Data source</title><p>A study-specific survey with four sections was developed. The questions were informed by findings of their systematic review (Stanzel <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, <xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>) and prior research about the health literacy and healthcare needs of migrant women and primary healthcare clinical experience (Stanzel <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, <xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>, Stanzel <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, <xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>b).</p><p>The first section included questions about PHCPs&#x02019; perceptions of migrant women&#x02019;s management of and attitudes towards menopause and menopause-related health literacy; the second asked about PHCPs&#x02019; practice relating to the care of migrant women in midlife; and the third investigated PHCPs&#x02019; opinions about the barriers and facilitators in engaging with and providing menopause-related healthcare to migrant women, drawing from a pre-specified list. The list of barriers had the following items: lack of confidence working with interpreters; lack of confidence providing care to women from diverse cultural and linguistic backgrounds; lack of culturally and linguistically appropriate resources in community languages; and limited appointment time. These were the items listed as facilitators: onsite nurses with qualifications in women&#x02019;s health; referral options to women&#x02019;s health services; a one-stop website which provides health information fact sheets including links to health information websites in community languages; and a Medicare billing number that reflects the time it takes to provide menopause-related care to women from culturally and linguistically background.</p><p>In addition, two open-ended questions invited respondents to use their own words to describe what they believed to be barriers or facilitators for providing optimal care. The final section ascertained respondents&#x02019; personal and professional characteristics.</p><p>The survey was pilot tested by ten PHCPs and researchers and amended based on feedback received.</p><p>The results of the quantitative data were published in 2020 (Stanzel <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, <xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>a). It reported that most respondents believed that limited appointment time, lack of culturally and linguistically appropriate menopause information, and lack of confidence about providing menopause care were cited as barriers to proving menopause care. To address these, a one-stop website with health information in community languages, a specific Medicare billing number that acknowledges the length of time it takes to provide menopause-related care to migrant women and referral options to practitioners with qualifications and expertise in women&#x02019;s health were suggested.</p></sec><sec sec-type="other" id="s2-4"><title>Data management and analysis</title><p>Responses to the free-text questions were collated in a Word document and analysed using thematic analysis, as described by Braun and Clarke (<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). This method involves familiarization with data through transcription and repeated readings; assignment of initial codes based on aspects related to the research topic; arrangement of codes into preliminary themes based on broader patterns; refinement of preliminary themes into final themes; and finally production of the report.</p><p>A manual, inductive coding process was used to generate codes, which were then grouped into preliminary themes. These were then refined further into final themes, which were arranged to form a cohesive narrative. Codes and themes were discussed within the research team at each stage until consensus was reached. Once the thematic structure was finalized, representative quotations were selected to reflect the thematic interpretation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="other" id="s2-5"><title>Ethics</title><p>The study was approved by the Monash University Human Research Ethics Committee (MUHREC 15095).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><p>Of the 245 respondents who clicked on the survey link, 106 discontinued after reading the participant information which described that only PHPC were eligible if they provided menopause-related care to women who had migrated from low- and middle-income countries.

Of these, 30 were general practitioners (GPs) and 46 registered nurses (RNs). More than half of GPs spoke a language other than English, most had completed their training and obtained their qualification in Australia and had practised for more than 10 years.

</p><p>The Global Expenditure on Health Report published by the World Health Organization (<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>) found that although primary healthcare spending accounts for about half of government health spending in low- and middle-income countries most primary healthcare spending went to outpatient curative care and medical goods. Only a small proportion is allocated to preventive care (World Health Organization, <xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>). Conversely, in Australia early detection and prevention of diseases is a prominent feature of primary healthcare (Department of Health and Aged Care, <xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">2023</xref>). Respondents observed a dissonance between migrant women and PHCPs&#x02019; expectations of healthcare delivery.

</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>This study identified barriers and enablers of health promotion and preventive care for migrant women in midlife from the perspective of primary healthcare providers. The finding that PHCPs attributed barriers to the migration experience, the healthcare environment, and the culture in women&#x02019;s country of origin indicates that a multipronged approach is needed to improve healthcare and the future health of women from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds.</p><p>The migration experience varies greatly among migrants depending on the reason for migrating and the circumstances under which migration took place. PHCPs identified priorities related to settlement and family reasons why migrant women are less likely than other women to engage in preventive healthcare. For financial reasons, migrant women may need to enter the paid workforce for the first time. In addition, they are likely to continue to be responsible for unpaid work related to their traditional gender roles including providing care to family members and domestic duties (Rezazadeh and Hoover, <xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Anderson (<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">1987</xref>) (Anderson, <xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">1987</xref>) refers to the &#x02018;double burden&#x02019; where migrant women feel overwhelmed by the additional workload and the absence of extended family and community support often resulting in lack of self-care. This may be one of the reasons why migrant women report less participation in preventive healthcare than their native-born counterparts. (United Nations Development Programme, <xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>)</p><p>In Australia, primary healthcare is largely provided by GPs. The current primary healthcare funding model favours short consultations which according to study respondents is insufficient for the time that is required to discuss health-promoting strategies with migrant women. They suggested that a model of care in which allied health practitioners offer health promotion consultations to women might be one way in which health promotion in primary care setting could be improved. Another model of care to address workforce shortages is the process of &#x02018;task-shifting&#x02019; which has been introduced in healthcare (Joshi <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, <xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Task-shifting refers to the process of transferring responsibility of a task usually performed by one professional to another with different educational and training background or to people trained to specifically perform the task within a limited scope of practice. (Joshi <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, <xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>, van Schalkwyk <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, <xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). This process has been shown to provide benefits but also challenges to the health system. In a review of systematic reviews by Leong et al (<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>) (Leong <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, <xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>), the authors concluded that task-shifting from doctors to nurses improved access to care including health promotion and health education.</p><p>In addition, the review found that task-shifting to nurses led to better outcomes in the management of non-communicable chronic conditions, higher return rates for follow-up appointments, and is viewed favourably by patients living with chronic diseases. However, for interventions that were considered as more &#x02018;medical&#x02019; or &#x02018;complex&#x02019;, patients preferred to be treated by a doctor. Task-shifting from doctors to nurses for minor illnesses was reported to be cost-effective, and it allowed doctors to attend more complex cases which most likely would result in staff cost saving and consequently benefit the healthcare system. Although task-shifting is generally considered cost-effective, the lack of clarity on the financial roles and responsibilities of the national and regional health authorities acted as a barrier.</p><p>Limited training and lack of confidence in providing culturally competent menopause-related care were reported by some respondents. To address this, they recommended referral options to specialist women&#x02019;s health practitioners. Rather than transferring care to a specialist service, the Interprofessional Collaboration (IPC) model of care may provide an alternative approach to care. IPC involves integrated cooperation and collaboration among various health professionals. It is becoming more common in primary healthcare due to the increasingly complex needs of patients. Although a systematic review about the effectiveness of IPC in primary care has shown mixed results, the authors concluded that IPC in primary healthcare can be effective, but further investigation is needed (Carron <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, <xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>). The barriers and facilitators of IPC were examined in a review by Rawlinson and colleagues (2021) (Rawlinson <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, <xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>). The authors noted that funding, lack of political will, insufficient legal support for role expansion and limited human resources to implement and oversee this model of care were the most frequently cited barriers.</p><p>Facilitators for IPC in this review were effective and clear communication among healthcare professionals, teamwork with like-minded colleagues, and a supportive organization that fosters interprofessional collaboration and development.</p><p>Respondents noted that migrants were reluctant to accept Western medicine and were more likely to turn to community members for health-related information. Training migrant women to deliver health information to other women in their communities is a culturally and linguistically appropriate health promotional strategy which has shown success in other areas (Ponce-Gonzalez <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, <xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>). Respondents suggested that this could be an enabling strategy for also delivering health-promoting messages to migrant women in midlife.</p><p>Culture shapes perceptions of healthcare. In low- and middle-income countries, primary healthcare spending largely focuses on curative care and medical goods and less on preventive care. Hence, the concepts of health promotion and prevention of non-communicable conditions may be unfamiliar to migrants from such countries. Study respondents observed that women only sought care for acute illness or when symptoms were severe. Mengesha et al (<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>) (Mengesha <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, <xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>) who investigated healthcare practitioners&#x02019; perceptions of providing sexual and reproductive care to migrant women made similar findings. They reported that women mainly accessed care for illness and were unfamiliar with health promotion and health screening. Yet, midlife is an ideal time to assess and promote positive health behaviours, including attending health screening, to optimize health in older age. Unfamiliarity with preventive healthcare may mean that migrant women miss out on opportunities to maintain and improve their health.</p></sec><sec sec-type="other" id="s5"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>The study has several strengths. The survey was distributed widely and made accessible to all Australian PHCPs who are members of relevant professional associations and networks. As a result, the experiences and perspectives of PHCP from across Australia, working in diverse settings, with a range of different characteristics were captured. A high proportion of respondents volunteered their comments which varied in depth and lengths from brief one-sentence comments to more detailed descriptions about the barriers and facilitators of menopause-related healthcare. In addition, Krippendorff (<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>) (Krippendorff, <xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>) proposes that one of the best ways to judge the quality of the findings is by evaluating whether novel insights into the studied experience have be provided and if so whether this will increase the understanding of the phenomena and inform practice. Our study provides unique understanding of how menopause-related care could be improved if the barriers as identified by PHCP could be addressed.</p><p>Nevertheless, we recognize the following limitation. Qualitative research is concerned with investigating social phenomena and the meaning people attribute to their experiences. There are a number of strategies to assure quality in qualitative research (Hammarberg <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, <xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). To validate the meaning of responses, investigators might paraphrase the reply or ask explicatory question. However, written responses do not allow investigators to ask follow-up questions to ensure the meaning of responses is fully understood. In order to support the credibility of this study, the data analysis was completed by two investigators independently. Findings were reviewed and discussed until agreement was reached.</p></sec><sec sec-type="other" id="s6"><title>Implications for policy, practice and research</title><p>Understanding the barriers and facilitators to providing menopause-related care to migrant women can inform strategies to improve migrant women&#x02019;s access to culturally sensitive care that meets their needs.</p><p>The Australian National Preventive Health Strategy 2021-2023 recognized that people from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds experience a higher burden of disease than their native-born counterpart. This is not due to personal choices but rather to circumstances including social disadvantage. Preventive healthcare needs to be flexible and allow for sufficient time to cater for the additional needs of people with social and economic disadvantages including those from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds. A review of the current primary care funding model is needed to address the shortcomings of the existing model.</p><p>Community groups, education, employment, and support services for migrants provide important opportunities to connect with migrant communities. Exploring ways to collaborate with these local groups and services to implement or offer health promotion programmes in women&#x02019;s native languages may improve access to valuable health information and resources.</p><p>Migrants who enter Australia on a humanitarian visa have access to settlement workers who support newly arrived migrants to learn and become familiar with Australian systems, including the healthcare system. Yet, for migrants who enter on a family or partner visa this service is not available and they rely on their partner or family member to help them navigate systems. Further research is needed to explore the information and support needs of women who enter Australia on a partner visa to inform strategies to meet these needs.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank the healthcare providers who participated in this research project for their generous contribution.
