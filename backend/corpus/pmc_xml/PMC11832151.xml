This research aimed to investigate prospectively the associations between exposure to FSRs at age 24&#x02009;months, obesogenic behaviours (excessive screen time and short sleep duration) at age 45&#x02009;months, and obesity at age 54&#x02009;months. Additionally, a model proposing the mediating role of obesogenic behaviours in the association between FSRs and childhood obesity was tested. Data were obtained from 5733 children and their mothers participating in the &#x02018;Growing Up in New Zealand&#x02019; study. Logistic regressions examined the association between three FSRs (rules on quality, quantity and timing of screen time, and different numbers of FSRs), obesogenic behaviours, and childhood obesity. Structural equation modelling (SEM) was applied to assess the potential mediating roles of obesogenic behaviours in the association between FSRs and zBMI. Neither exposure to individual nor all three FSRs was significantly associated with lower odds of obesity. However, protective effects of FSRs were observed concerning obesogenic behaviours. Exposure to individual or all three FSRs correlated with reduced odds of not meeting screen time and sleep duration recommendations. SEM analysis indicated no direct association between FSRs and zBMI; nevertheless, a significant indirect association was identified through the mediation of obesogenic behaviours. These findings suggest the potential benefits of promoting the adoption of FSRs as a promising population-based strategy to enhance child health behaviours and mitigate the risk of childhood obesity.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source>

Additionally, early exposure to excessive screen media is associated with adverse health and behavioural outcomes, including shortened attention spans, emotional problems, language difficulties, disrupted sleep patterns, and increased risk of obesity [<xref rid="ckae169-B3" ref-type="bibr">3&#x02013;6</xref>].</p><p>The link between excessive screen time and childhood obesity risk has particularly gained attraction given the alarming rise in obesity rates worldwide. Parents play a pivotal role in shaping children&#x02019;s screen usage habits by establishing social environments, notably through the introduction and implementation of household screen use rules [<xref rid="ckae169-B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="ckae169-B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>Some studies support the protective effects of family screen use rules (FSRs) on screen viewing behaviour. FSRs are defined as the guidelines established by parents to manage their children&#x02019;s use of digital devices, typically covering aspects such as quantity, quality, and timing of screen use [<xref rid="ckae169-B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="ckae169-B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Research shows that children in households with TV viewing rules have significantly reduced TV viewing time compared to those without such rules [<xref rid="ckae169-B10" ref-type="bibr">10&#x02013;12</xref>]. However, most studies are cross-sectional and either lack measures of the child&#x02019;s weight status or present inconclusive findings regarding the link between FSRs and childhood obesity [<xref rid="ckae169-B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="ckae169-B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Longitudinal studies are crucial for understanding how exposure to FSRs in early childhood could influence obesity risk in middle childhood [<xref rid="ckae169-B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="ckae169-B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], guiding the development of effective strategies to manage children&#x02019;s screen time and combat childhood obesity.</p><p>Moreover, investigating indirect associations rather than direct ones may provide deeper insights into the impact of FSRs during early childhood on later weight status. Although this relationship has not yet been directly studied, we hypothesize that FSRs in early childhood may reduce the risk of obesity in middle childhood by influencing obesogenic behaviours, specifically by reducing excessive screen time and improving sleep duration (see proposed model in <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>). Existing research linking FSRs to reduced screen time [<xref rid="ckae169-B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="ckae169-B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and its negative association with obesity [<xref rid="ckae169-B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="ckae169-B14" ref-type="bibr">14&#x02013;16</xref>] supports our hypothesis. Although the effect of FSRs on sleep behaviours largely remains unexplored, evidence linking excessive screen time to reduced sleep duration [<xref rid="ckae169-B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="ckae169-B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], and its association with childhood obesity [<xref rid="ckae169-B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="ckae169-B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="ckae169-B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] provides additional support for our proposed model.</p><p>This study has three main objectives: (i) to investigate prospectively the direct association between FSRs at early childhood (24&#x02009;months) and childhood obesity outcomes at middle childhood (54&#x02009;months); (ii) to examine associations between FSRs at early childhood and obesogenic behaviours (i.e. excessive screen time and short sleep duration) at age 45&#x02009;months; (iii) to explore the pathways through which FSRs at early childhood may reduce the risk of childhood obesity through mediating roles of screen and sleep behaviours.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec sec-type="subjects"><title>Participants</title><p>Data were obtained from the Growing Up in New Zealand (GUiNZ) study, the largest contemporary longitudinal cohort study of children and their families in New Zealand (NZ). The study recruited 6822 pregnant women with due dates between April 2009 and March 2010 from the Auckland, Counties Manukau, and Waikato District health board regions. The study&#x02019;s design and recruitment procedures have been described in detail elsewhere [<xref rid="ckae169-B20" ref-type="bibr">20&#x02013;22</xref>]. The cohort&#x02019;s characteristics at birth generally aligned with those of the national birth cohort in NZ from 2007 to 2010 [<xref rid="ckae169-B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Ethical approval was obtained from the NZ Ministry of Health Northern Y Regional Ethics Committee (NTY/08106/055) and all participating women provided written informed consent. This study utilizes data collected across five waves between 2009 and 2014, following the same children throughout this period. To avoid dependent observations, only one child per family was included, resulting in a final sample size of 5733 children and their mothers.</p></sec><sec><title>Measures</title><sec><title>Obesity and zBMI</title><p>Weight and height measurements were taken when the children reached 54&#x02009;months, following a standardized protocol that included removing shoes, hats, jackets, or jumpers, and taking duplicate measurements. These values were standardized by age and gender according to the World Health Organization (WHO)&#x02019;s 2006 Growth Curves. Obesity was defined as a body mass index (BMI) over 30&#x02009;kg/m<sup>2</sup> [<xref rid="ckae169-B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and a binary variable (obese vs. non-obese) was used in binary logistic regression analyses. Additionally, a continuous variable (zBMI) was used in structural equation modelling (SEM). All other information for these preschool-aged children was obtained from maternal responses to closed-ended questions during computer-assisted personal interviews administered by trained interviewers.</p></sec><sec><title>FSRs</title><p>At the 24-month age time point, mothers were asked about FSRs restricting their child&#x02019;s screen-based behaviours. Three questions considered rules on quality (&#x02018;What TV programs your child can watch?&#x02019;), rules on quantity (&#x02018;How many hours of TV, videos, and DVDs can your child watch?&#x02019;), and rules on timing (&#x02018;When your child can watch TV?&#x02019;). Responses were recorded as &#x02018;Yes&#x02019; or &#x02018;No&#x02019;. If a rule was present, mothers were further asked about the frequency of enforcement. Responses were collapsed into two categories: &#x02018;having the rule&#x02019; if enforced most or all the time, and &#x02018;lack of rule&#x02019; for other responses (&#x02018;half the time&#x02019; or &#x02018;never&#x02019;). A variable indicating the number of FSRs a child was exposed to (ranging from 0 to 3) was then created for analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Child&#x02019; screen time</title><p>At 45&#x02009;months, screen time was assessed through a parent-proxy report. Mothers reported on their child&#x02019;s average time spent at home watching TV programming (including free-to-air, online, and pay-TV, or DVDs either on TV or other media) and using electronic media (such as a computer or laptop, including children&#x02019;s computer systems such as LeapFrog<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, iPads, tablets, smartphones, and any electronic gaming devices) on a usual weekday. Total daily screen time was calculated by combining TV viewing and electronic media use. A continuous variable was used in SEM analysis. Following guidelines from the NZ Ministry of Health and the WHO for screen viewing among children aged 2&#x02013;5&#x02009;years [<xref rid="ckae169-B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="ckae169-B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], excessive screen time was defined as 1 hour or more per day. A binary variable (excessive screen time: Yes/No) was used in binary logistic regression analyses.</p></sec><sec><title>Child&#x02019;s night sleep duration</title><p>At the age of 45&#x02009;months, mothers reported children&#x02019;s average nightly sleep duration. A continuous variable was used in SEM analysis. Following guidelines from the NZ Ministry of Health and US National Sleep Foundation for preschoolers aged 3&#x02013;4&#x02009;years [<xref rid="ckae169-B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="ckae169-B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="ckae169-B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], short sleep duration was defined as sleeping &#x0003c;10&#x02009;hours per night on average. A binary variable (short sleep duration: Yes/No) was used in binary logistic regression analyses.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Covariates</title><p>Covariates included in multivariable analyses were child&#x02019;s gender, age, and self-prioritized ethnicity reported at age 54&#x02009;months (NZ European/NZers, M&#x00101;ori, Pacific, Asian, MELAA [Middle Eastern, Latin American or African]), maternal prenatal education level (no secondary school, secondary school, diploma/trade, bachelor qualification, and higher qualification), food security, and neighbourhood deprivation level. The selection of these covariates was informed by literature highlighting the association between sociodemographic factors and childhood obesity [<xref rid="ckae169-B28" ref-type="bibr">28&#x02013;30</xref>].</p><p>The food security index was previously developed using data from GUiNZ [<xref rid="ckae169-B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The index scores, ranging from 0 to 49, compromise indicators of poor-quality weaning diets and measures of food poverty, such as the inability to afford food and reliance on food banks. For multivariable logistic regression analyses, the food security score was categorized into two groups: food insecure (below the mean score of 26) and food secure (&#x02265;26) [<xref rid="ckae169-B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><p>NZ neighbourhood deprivation is reported in the 10-point deprivation index (1 is least deprived). NZDep2006 index at age 2-year interview was used to assess neighbourhood area deprivation [<xref rid="ckae169-B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In this study, scores were categorized into three groups: low deprivation (1&#x02013;3), medium deprivation (4&#x02013;7), and high deprivation areas (8&#x02013;10).</p></sec><sec><title>Data analysis</title><p>Descriptive statistics on the prevalence of obesity, obesogenic behaviours (excessive screen time and short sleep duration), and exposure to each and all three FSRs for the whole sample and by sociodemographic factors are presented in <xref rid="ckae169-T1" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;1</xref>.

The results from the first stage, complemented by correlation analyses and existing literature regarding the association between FSRs, screen time, sleep duration, and child weight informed the inclusion/exclusion of variables in the subsequent analyses. In this modelling, the FSRs variable was examined as both a direct and an indirect predictor of childhood zBMI.</p><p>The three screen-based rules were reduced to one latent variable representing FSRs, without applying any differential weightings. Observed continuous variables were used to represent screen time, sleep duration, and child zBMI. The continuous food security variable was incorporated into the model as a covariate (not shown in <xref rid="ckae169-F1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>). For simplicity, other covariates were excluded from this model as their adjustment did not alter the model fit indices.

By 45&#x02009;months, children averaged nearly 3 hours of daily screen time, well above the recommended 1-hour limit. However, no significant association was found between FSRs at 24&#x02009;months and obesity at 54&#x02009;months, after adjusting for sociodemographic factors. SEM findings also revealed no direct link between FSRs and zBMI.</p><p>This aligns with previous research [<xref rid="ckae169-B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="ckae169-B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] indicating that FSRs regulating screen viewing time did not directly reduce obesity risk. However, findings contrast with those reported by Johnson et al., which linked the absence of FSRs to increased zBMI [<xref rid="ckae169-B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>The study&#x02019;s second objective investigated whether FSRs influenced a child&#x02019;s obesogenic behaviours. Findings showed that children exposed to individual FSRs or all three FSRs at 24&#x02009;months had lower odds of not meeting screen time and sleep guidelines at 45&#x02009;months, reinforcing existing evidence linking TV rules to reduced TV viewing [<xref rid="ckae169-B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="ckae169-B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>The protective effects of FSRs for sleep duration could be due to a negative association between screen time and sleep duration found in previous research [<xref rid="ckae169-B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], suggesting that children who spend less time on screen devices are more likely to get adequate sleep. It is also plausible that families with enforced rules around screen time may also implement other rules regulating sleep behaviours, leading to improved sleep outcomes for children.</p><p>Exposure to fewer than three rules did not significantly mitigate excessive screen time and short sleep duration at 45&#x02009;months, suggesting multiple rules must be enforced to achieve a mitigating influence on obesogenic behaviour. These findings underscore the importance of consistent messaging across various aspects of FSRs.</p><p>Next, we examined whether FSRs influence zBMI indirectly through the mediating role of screen time and sleep duration using a SEM approach. While no direct path was found between FSRs and zBMI, a significant indirect association emerged through screen and sleep behaviours.</p><p>Notably, FSRs were negatively associated with screen time, positively associated with sleep duration, and both behaviours influenced zBMI. These findings align with prior research suggesting that FSRs play a protective role against excessive screen time [<xref rid="ckae169-B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="ckae169-B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], itself a factor associated with lower zBMI [<xref rid="ckae169-B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="ckae169-B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Additionally, our longitudinal analysis revealed that increased exposure to FSRs at 24&#x02009;months corresponded with extended sleep duration by age 45&#x02009;months, ultimately contributing to lower zBMI by age 54&#x02009;months.</p><p>The shift from significant unadjusted associations to non-significant results after adjustment for socioeconomic factors suggests that these factors play a crucial role in the link between FSRs and childhood obesity. This indicates that the impact of FSRs on obesity may be heavily influenced by underlying sociodemographic variables, which may be stronger determinants of obesity than FSRs alone. To be effective, FSRs should be part of broader strategies that address these socioeconomic factors, especially in financially disadvantaged families who may need additional support to implement and maintain FSRs.</p><p>Align with ecological model, these findings emphasize the multiple levels of influence on a child&#x02019;s outcome, recognizing that childhood obesity is influenced by a complex interplay of various factors such as family environment and socioeconomic status as found in previous research [<xref rid="ckae169-B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The results hold significant implications for the design of family-based initiatives to prevent and address childhood obesity and suggest that interventions focused on regulating screen time across various household domains could effectively reduce children&#x02019;s screen time and improve sleep duration, ultimately contributing to a lower risk of developing childhood obesity. Active involvement of parents in such initiatives is crucial, as they play a pivotal role in regulating these behaviours in young children. Furthermore, the enduring effects of implementing FSRs at age two on child health behaviours and BMI in middle childhood highlight the importance of early intervention.</p><p>Study strengths include its utilization of a robust longitudinal design and a nationally representative sample, enhancing the reliability and generalizability of findings. Furthermore, examining three specific FSRs and their longitudinal impacts on childhood obesity&#x02014;both directly and indirectly&#x02014;provides a nuanced understanding of the complex relationship between FSRs and children&#x02019;s health outcomes. The study&#x02019;s incorporation of rule enforcement in distinguishing families with and without rules also strengthens its validity, allowing for more precise estimates of the effectiveness of such rules [<xref rid="ckae169-B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and potential impact on behaviour change. Further, the use of multiple specific rules adds depth compared to previous studies focusing on single rules or broader categories without delineating their specific nature [<xref rid="ckae169-B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="ckae169-B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Understanding each rule&#x02019;s characteristics helps tailor interventions more effectively to target specific areas of concern. Additionally, the study broadens the scope beyond television viewing to include other screen devices, crucial for addressing sedentary behaviours comprehensively [<xref rid="ckae169-B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="ckae169-B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>The study has limitations. Firstly, its observational design and correlational analyses prevent establishing a definitive causal link between FSR adoption and reduced obesity risk. Although the longitudinal approach and dose-response associations suggest a potential causal relationship, intervention studies are needed to confirm FSR effectiveness in improving health behaviours in combating obesity. Additionally, key confounding factors like children&#x02019;s physical activity levels, programme content, advertising exposure, co-viewing with parents, and dietary patterns were not accounted for due to data unavailability, potentially influencing the results as suggested in previous research [<xref rid="ckae169-B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Future studies should incorporate these variables, along with other relevant factors like daycare attendance, to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the relationship between FSRs and childhood obesity. Moreover, investigating how FSRs impact overweight could provide further insights into their broader effects on weight outcomes. Lastly, data on FSRs relied on maternal reports, susceptible to recall or interpretation biases.</p><p>In conclusion, this research has shed light on the relationship of FSRs with child obesity, exploring both direct and indirect pathways. Our findings underscore the importance of promoting the adoption of FSRs as a promising population-based approach to improve child health behaviours, thereby reducing the risk of childhood obesity. Healthcare providers, educators, and other professionals working with families to address childhood obesity are encouraged to advocate for the implementation of family rules as a valuable strategy in their interactions with parents.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="sup1" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>ckae169_Supplementary_Data</label><media xlink:href="ckae169_supplementary_data.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="ack1"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>First and foremost, we extend our heartfelt gratitude to the children and families who generously participated in the <italic toggle="yes">Growing Up in New Zealand</italic> (GUiNZ) study.
