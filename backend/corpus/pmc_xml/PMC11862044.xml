It could play a role in many areas of the patient&#x02019;s life.</p></sec><sec id="sec8141"><title>Objectives</title><p>The aim of the present study was to find the prevalence of self-esteem and investigate the associations between self-esteem and treatment adherence in patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders.</p></sec><sec id="sec8142"><title>Methods</title><p>
This study involved outpatients with&#x000a0;schizophrenia spectrum disorders ,according to (DSM-V) diagnostic criteria, attending the Department of Psychiatry A, Razi hospital between august and September 30, 2023. The level of self-esteem was measured with Rosenberg&#x02019;s Self-Esteem Rating scale (SERS) and treatment adherence with the Medical Adherence Rating Scale (MARS).Socio-demographic characteristics were also collected.</p></sec><sec id="sec8143"><title>Results</title><p>
Thirty stabilized outpatients with schizophrenia (n=18), schizoaffective disorder (n=11), brief psychotic disorder (n=1) were included in the study. The mean (SD) age of the respondents was 43.2years; the mean number of Hospital admissions was 4.7.Almost two thirds of this population (63.33% ) had low self-esteem and 36.67 % had high self-esteem. The level of self-esteem did not differ between diagnostic categories. Self-esteem also positively correlated with higher education and negatively with an increased number of hospitalizations. However, no significant association was found between socio-demographic variables and self-esteem. Adherence was further negatively correlated with age and age of onset of disorders. Patients suffering from schizophrenia had the lowest adherence to treatment.The results of the present preliminary study suggest a positive correlation between the SERS total scores and the MARS scores. It was found that higher levels of self- esteem are related with higher levels of treatment adherence and lower levels of self- esteem are associated with discontinuation of medications without a psychiatrist&#x02019;s recommendation. This connection was present in all diagnostic groups.</p></sec><sec id="sec8144"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study shows positive relationship between self-esteem and treatment adherence. Further studies are needed to investigate whether self-esteem is a factor positively influencing adherence to treatment and show if self-esteem training programs like standard psychoeducation and cognitive behavioral therapy could be beneficial to improve treatment adherence among psychiatric patients.</p></sec><sec id="sec8145"><title>Disclosure of Interest</title><p>None Declared</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="1"/></counts></article-meta></front></article>
