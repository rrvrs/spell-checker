We evaluate the molecular and clinical effects of genetic ancestry in African and South Asian women compared to European using a combined cohort of 7136 breast cancer patients. We find that non-European patients present significantly earlier and die at a younger age. The African group has an increased prevalence of higher grade and hormone receptor negative disease. The South Asian group shows tendency towards lower stage at diagnosis and tumour mutational burden. We observe differences and similarities in the somatic mutational landscape, and differences in germline mutation rates relevant to genetic testing and breast cancer predisposition. Potential therapeutic candidates are identified, with a higher propensity for homologous recombination deficiency serving as a therapy response indicator. We harness breast cancer multimodal data to improve understanding of ancestry-associated differences and highlight opportunities to advance health equity.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="web-summary"><p id="Par2">Breast cancer diagnosis and outcomes are affected by racial disparities.

There is a trend towards more HR deficiency in the AFR population and less HR deficiency in the SAS population compared to the EUR population baseline. Splitting the cohort into HR-deficient and HR-proficient tumours shows that overall survival for HR-deficient tumours is significantly lower than HR-proficient tumours, although following stratification by gAncestry only the EUR remained significant. This is attributable to two factors: the small numbers of HR-deficient patients with survival data within the non-EUR populations, leading to large confidence intervals; and that other clinical features may be colliding with HR deficiency and influencing outcome. For instance, our analysis may exhibit bias as patients in non-EUR gAncestry populations tended to present with higher tumour grade (potentially due to increased ER- and/or enrichment of <italic>BRCA1</italic>/<italic>2</italic> mutations), which is associated with decreased overall survival. With larger cohorts, allowing for more stratification on tumour grade and HRD status, we would be able to determine how much of the effect on survival was due to HR deficiency, and how much was due to presentation at higher grades in non-EUR participants.</p><p id="Par62">HR deficiency classifications inferred from whole genome sequencing attempt to classify <italic>BRCA1</italic>/<italic>2</italic> deficiency and identify those patients that exhibit mutational landscapes similar to those with <italic>BRCA1/2</italic> defects i.e., BRCAness.

Identification of these genomic alterations provides opportunities by highlighting potential therapeutic vulnerabilities and could be exploited for patient benefit.

The under-representation of the SAS ancestry group in international cancer-associated studies does, however, mean that the variants we report are difficult to validate in publicly available datasets. The scarcity of the stratification of Asian ethnicities in cancer research means that any study of genomic variation using these merged population data would likely be underpowered to identify alterations unique to the South Asian population. In fact, data from large-scale US-led initiatives are likely biased towards East Asian ethnicities (and ancestries) due to them recapitulating their sampling populations.</p><p id="Par71">Our genomic findings are limited by the relatively small sizes of the AFR and SAS groups (120&#x02013;140 patients) within our Genomics England analytic cohort of 2781 patients. However, this is still larger than most studies which aim to determine gAncestry-related genomic differences within the BC landscape. Nevertheless, this could be improved through the inclusion of more somatic tissue sequencing from our other British-based cohorts, but the overall ratio (of EUR to AFR or SAS patients) would continue to exhibit bias towards the EUR gAncestry, unless the non-EUR groups within the UK (or worldwide) were specifically targeted for collection. However, our study was still powerful enough to find significant differences between EUR and the other two groups.
