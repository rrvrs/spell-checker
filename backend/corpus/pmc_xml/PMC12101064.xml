In 2020, NHL alone accounted for over half a million new diagnoses and a quarter of a million deaths worldwide. While generally, more common in developed countries, certain regions, such as North Africa, experienced disproportionately high mortality rates. Moreover, NHL cases are rising significantly in countries like Australia and New Zealand. A particularly concerning trend is the substantial rise in both incidence and mortality among elderly populations over the past few decades. Due to changing demographics, projections indicate that total lymphoma cases, largely driven by NHL, will likely reach nearly 800,000 by 2040 (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) is a malignancy of B cells, distinguished by the presence of Reed&#x02013;Sternberg cells within an inflammatory microenvironment. It represents approximately 10% of all lymphoma cases and has a global incidence of about 2&#x02013;3 per 100,000 people annually. HL follows a bimodal age distribution, with incidence peaks in young adults (ages 15&#x02013;35) and again in individuals over 55, with a slightly higher prevalence in males than females (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT), specifically when using fluorine-18-labeled fluorodeoxyglucose ([<sup>18</sup>F]FDG) as radiotracer, is a crucial imaging modality for visualizing metabolic activity, particularly in rapidly dividing cancer cells. This imaging technique is valuable for identifying residual or recurrent disease, where [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG PET/CT can detect areas of hypermetabolism indicative of residual tumor cells after primary treatment or disease recurrence, often with higher sensitivity than conventional imaging techniques (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Furthermore, [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG imaging allows for the quantification of metabolic changes induced by therapy, providing an early indicator of treatment effectiveness and enabling timely adjustments to the therapeutic strategy. Finally, information obtained through [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG PET/CT contributes to better prognostic stratification of patients and supports the clinical decision-making process, guiding the choice of personalized therapies and the most appropriate follow-up (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).</p><p>The introduction of fibroblast activation protein inhibitor (FAPI) as a PET radiotracer represented a significant advancement in cancer imaging. FAPI demonstrates superior tumor uptake and contrast compared to the conventional [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG in various malignancies, including, but not limited to, gastric, colorectal, and breast cancers (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). This enhanced detection rate is attributed to FAPI's selective targeting of fibroblast activation protein (FAP), which is overexpressed in cancer-associated fibroblasts within the tumor microenvironment, and is considered a marker for pro-tumorigenic stroma (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). A recent systematic review confirmed the higher sensitivity and specificity of FAPI PET/CT in detecting and staging several cancer types. However, the potential utility of FAPI in lymphoma imaging remains relatively unexplored (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). While preliminary studies suggest promising results, further research is warranted to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy and clinical implications of FAPI PET/CT in lymphoma, particularly in characterizing lymphoma subtypes (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>).</p><p>The aim of this study is to provide a systematic review of the literature on the studies using FAPI PET/CT in patients with lymphoma.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><p>This systematic review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 guidelines (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). A detailed protocol was estabilished beforehand, outlining the research question, search strategy, criteria for including studies, quality assessment methods, data extraction process, and planned statistical analyses. The protocol of the systematic review was not registered in any public register.</p><sec id="s2a"><label>2.1</label><title>Literature search</title><p>Two researchers searched the PubMed/MEDLINE and Cochrane CENTRAL databases for studies using [<sup>18</sup>F]FAPI PET/CT in lymphoma patients.

X7.5. Due to the limited data available in literature and specific scope of the present review topic, even case reports were included in the study selection, although they are not typically examined in systematic reviews. A researcher screened titles and abstracts to remove duplicates, irrelevant articles, reviews and meta-analyses. Full texts of the remaining articles were retrieved and assessed for eligibility based on the execution of a FAPI PET/CT in patients with lymphoma. Original studies were included if they involved a (1) cohort or subset of lymphoma patients undergoing FAPI PET/CT, and (2) the patients had no history of other concomitant or previous malignancies. If a full text was unavailable, the corresponding author was contacted. Finally, the reference lists of the included articles were checked for additional relevant studies.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><label>2.3</label><title>Data extraction</title><p>Two researchers independently extracted data from all included studies in duplicate.

After importing the articles in the reference manager, one article was removed because it was a duplicate, leading to 248 entries. Reviewing titles and abstracts, 233/248 entries were excluded because they did not meet the inclusion criteria of the systematic review (15 meta-analyses, 13 reviews and 205 articles not within the scope of the review). The full text of the remaining 16 entries was sought for retrieval to check the inclusion criteria. Among the 16 articles, 1 full text (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) could not be downloaded and was not provided by the corresponding author despite formal email request. One out of 15 full texts (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) was not within the field of interest of the systematic review, since reported a case of thymic squamous cell carcinoma mimicking lymphoma on [<sup>68</sup>Ga]FAPI PET/CT.

In the study by Jin et al. [<sup>68</sup>Ga]FAPI PET/CT scans were performed on 73 lymphoma patients (11 with Hodgkin lymphoma and 62 with non-Hodgkin lymphoma). FAP levels were measured both in the scans and in tissue samples from 22 patients. Elevated FAP uptake was notably higher in Hodgkin lymphoma lesions, which correlated with intense FAP immunostaining (score, 31). In non-Hodgkin lymphoma, a positive association was observed between clinical classification and [<sup>68</sup>Ga]FAPI uptake. Aggressive NHL lesions, with moderate to strong FAP immunostaining (scores between 21 and 31), showed higher levels of [<sup>68</sup>Ga]FAPI uptake. In contrast, indolent NHL lesions had weaker FAP staining and displayed mild to moderate FAPI uptake. No significant correlation was found between the sum of the product of diameters and the corresponding SUVmax (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.424). Tumor-to-liver ratios were 6.26&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;4.17 in indolent NHL cases and over 9 in other lymphoma subtypes (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). In conclusion, [<sup>68</sup>Ga]FAPI PET/CT can effectively detect FAP in lymphoma lesions, potentially serving as an additional tool to characterize lymphomas.</p><p>In a small subgroup of mixed lymphoma patients (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;10), [<sup>68</sup>Ga]FAPI PET was found to be less effective than [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG PET. Specifically, when looking at individual patients, [<sup>68</sup>Ga]FAPI PET was less accurate, less able to correctly identify those with lymphoma, and less reliable in ruling out lymphoma compared to [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG PET. Similarly, when examining specific areas of the body, [<sup>68</sup>Ga]FAPI PET again showed lower accuracy, reduced ability to detect lymphoma, and decreased reliability in excluding lymphoma compared to [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG PET. Essentially, [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG PET performed better in all measured categories (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>).</p><p>Another pivotal study compared [<sup>68</sup>Ga]FAPI and [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG PET/CT in lymphoma, examining FAP and glycolytic marker uptake. 186 patients underwent both scans, with immunohistochemistry assessing FAP, hexokinase 2, and GLUT1. Statistical analyses included t-tests, Wilcoxon, and Spearman correlation. [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG PET had higher staging accuracy (98.4%) than [<sup>68</sup>Ga]FAPI PET (86.0%), detecting more nodal (4,624 vs. 2,196) and extranodal (1,304 vs. 845) lesions. 52 lesions were [<sup>68</sup>Ga]FAPI positive and [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG negative; 2,939 were vice versa. No significant SUVmax or target-to-liver ratio differences were found between tracers in some lymphoma subtypes. GLUT1 and hexokinase 2 were overexpressed in lymphoma cells and the microenvironment, while FAP was stromal. FAP correlated with [<sup>68</sup>Ga]FAPI SUVmax (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.622, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.001), GLUT1 with [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG SUVmax (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.835, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001) (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3c2"><label>3.3.2</label><title>Case reports: MALT</title><p>In the case reported by Wang et al., an elderly woman with cough and sputum had a chest CT revealing a solid lesion in the left upper lobe. After 2 weeks of antibiotics and no change on a repeat CT, she underwent both [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG and [<sup>68</sup>Ga]DOTA-FAPI-04 PET/CT scans. The [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG PET/CT showed a 1.6&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;1.4&#x02005;cm lesion with mild uptake (SUVmax 3.71), while the [<sup>68</sup>Ga]FAPI PET/CT demonstrated higher uptake (SUVmax 8.10), indicating FAP expression. No lymph node or other metastases were seen. Surgical resection and subsequent histopathology confirmed the lesion as pulmonary marginal zone lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT lymphoma) (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). In keeping with this cases, Pang and colleagues demonstrated the utility of <sup>68</sup>Ga-FAPI. In their case, a 76-year-old male was diagnosed with a rare primary hepatic extranodal marginal zone lymphoma of MALT, confirmed through pathological examination. [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG PET/CT was performed as part of the initial diagnostic workup. Subsequent [<sup>68</sup>Ga]FAPIPET/CT revealed a significantly higher tumor-to-background ratio in the hepatic lesion compared to the [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG scan. This enhanced uptake was attributed to minimal [<sup>68</sup>Ga]FAPIuptake in the surrounding normal liver tissue (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Similarly, a man was diagnosed with a MALToma with secondary liver involvement. The liver lesion did not show FDG PET/CT uptake, but only abnormal FAPI accumulation, suggesting the usefulness of FAPI PET/CT in detecting hepatic mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). These cases suggest that Ga-FAPI PET/CT may be an alternative imaging method to characterize low-grade lymphomas.</p></sec><sec id="s3c3"><label>3.3.2</label><title>Case reports: follicular lymphoma</title><p>Other authors demonstrated the utility of FAP in follicular lymphoma. In a case report, a 67-year-old man was found to have both follicular lymphoma and stomach cancer. Initial PET scans using [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG showed high activity in his lymph nodes and a thickened area in his stomach. However, when scanned with [<sup>68</sup>Ga]FAPI-04, the stomach lesion showed strong uptake while the lymph nodes showed only slight uptake. After treatment, his lymph nodes were completely clear, but the stomach lesion showed even more tracer uptake than before. Although doctors initially thought the lymphoma might have changed to a more aggressive type, the scans accurately identified and differentiated the two distinct cancers (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3c4"><label>3.3.3</label><title>Case reports: T-cell lymphoma</title><p>A group of authors describe an 82-year-old man, previously treated for colon cancer, who was found to have enlarged lymph nodes and a lung tumor. A first FDG-PET/CT scan showed very high uptake in both the lymph nodes and the lung mass, suggesting the colon cancer had spread. However, the pattern of lymph node enlargement made doctors suspect another condition like lymphoma or inflammation. Then, a FAPI-PET/CT scan revealed very low uptake in the lymph nodes suggesting that the lymph nodes were not related to the lung mass. A biopsy of a neck lymph node confirmed the patient had angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma. Additionally, the FAPI-PET scan revealed a highly active area in the prostate, which, combined with a high PSA level, pointed to prostate cancer (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Another group of authors reported a 22-year-old man presented with increasing limb weakness and numbness. Brain and neck MRIs showed enhancing lesions in multiple brain regions, suggestive of metastases. An FDG PET/MRI revealed numerous FDG-avid areas in his skeletal muscles and brain. The muscle tumors displayed intense FDG uptake, with a SUVmax of 21.3, and mild to moderate FAPI uptake, with a SUVmax of 4.9, indicating FDG's better ability to visualize muscle tumors. FDG PET highlighted intense uptake in muscles like the trapezius, obliquus capitis inferior, and pectoralis major. A FAPI PET scan, performed two days later, showed FAPI-avid areas with lower uptake, ranging from a SUVmax of 0.9 to 4.9. Notably, FAPI PET was superior for visualizing brain lesions due to its low background activity. A biopsy confirmed peripheral T-cell lymphoma, and chemotherapy led to a complete response (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). These cases demonstrate that FAPI-PET scans may be useful in differentiating solid tumors from hematologic malignancies by revealing differences in the extent of peritumoral fibrosis. Furthermore, they illustrate the complementary roles of FDG and FAPI PET in T-cell lymphoma, highlighting FDG's efficacy in muscle tumor detection and FAPI's advantage in brain lesion delineation.</p></sec><sec id="s3c5"><label>3.3.4</label><title>Case reports: DLBCL</title><p>Wang et al. reported a 55-year-old woman with fatigue, weight loss, and upper abdominal pain and normal tumor marker blood tests. A CT scan showed a thickened stomach wall and enlarged lymph nodes, suggesting stomach cancer. She then had an FDG PET/CT scan, which showed moderate FDG uptake in the stomach wall, with a SUVmax of 2.9, and mild FDG uptake in the lymph nodes, with a SUVmax of 2.0. She also had a FAPI PET/CT scan, which showed mild uptake in the stomach lesion, with a SUVmax of 5.0, and less uptake in the lymph nodes, with a SUVmax of 1.4. An endoscopy revealed a stomach ulcer, and a biopsy confirmed stage II1 diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, a primary gastric lymphoma, rather than stomach cancer (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). In another case by Lu et al. (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) with swollen lymph nodes in his neck, armpits, and groin underwent biopsies, which confirmed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). A subsequent FDG PET/CT scan showed high tracer uptake in the enlarged lymph nodes and significantly enlarged kidneys, suggesting lymphoma involvement in the kidneys (SUVmax: 18.98). However, a FAPI PET/CT scan performed three days later revealed a stark contrast: the lymph nodes and kidneys, which had shown high FDG uptake, showed minimal FAPI uptake. The kidneys did show diffuse FAPI uptake (SUVmax: 9.42), but this was interpreted as normal physiological activity, not disease. These findings highlight the notable differences between FDG and FAPI PET/CT in assessing DLBCL. Another case showed high [<sup>68</sup>Ga]FAPI uptake in primary thyroid DLBC possibly due to increased fibrosis from both the lymphoma and the patient's pre-existing thyroiditis. In this case, a 60-year-old woman, previously diagnosed with Hashimoto's thyroiditis presented with worsening neck swelling, breathing difficulties and a large, painless neck mass. Ultrasound showed diffuse thyroid enlargement and abnormal thyroid antibody levels were noted (TSH: 9.36&#x02005;mIU/ml). Suspicion of a malignant thyroid tumor led to a [<sup>68</sup>Ga]FAPI PET/CT scan. The scan showed abnormal radiotracer uptake (SUVmax of 8.6) in the enlarged thyroid and a retrosternal goiter. A biopsy was performed, confirming diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). In another case, a CT scan revealed a 2.5&#x02005;cm mass in the anterior mediastinum of a 32-year-old woman, experiencing five months of breathing difficulties and occasional chest pain. A [<sup>68</sup>Ga]FAPI-04 PET/CT scan showed significant FAPI uptake in the mediastinal mass (SUVmax 9.7), and also in the pericardial fluid. Furthermore, increased FAPI uptake was noted in a paraesophageal lymph node (SUVmax 13.0), suggesting an invasive thymoma with lymph node metastasis. However, a CT-guided biopsy identified DLBCL (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). In further case, a 67-year-old woman experiencing left-sided weakness, facial paralysis, and walking difficulties had a brain MRI showing a 2.7&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;2.4&#x02005;cm mass in her right frontal lobe. This mass, which displayed central necrosis, swelling, and increased enhancement, raised suspicion for lymphoma, glioma, or metastatic cancer. To further investigate, she underwent both FDG and FAPI PET/CT scans. The FDG scan showed high metabolic activity in the mass (SUVmax 9.6), while the FAPI scan showed only mild and uneven tracer uptake (SUVmax 3.1). With no other abnormalities found, the mass was surgically removed and identified as primary central nervous system diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. The lower FAPI uptake was likely due to the presence of fibrosis within the lymphoma (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>).</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><label>4</label><title>Discussion</title><p>The role of [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG PET/CT in lymphoma has been widely established (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). The role of [<sup>18</sup>F]FAPI PET/CT in the diagnostic and staging evaluation of lymphoma, remains relatively understudied compared to its application in other malignancies. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) can either help or hinder tumor growth, depending on their specific characteristics. Recent research, such as the prospective study by Jin et al., has suggested that DLBCL exhibits moderate to strong fibroblast activation protein (FAP) expression, with all 34 patients in their cohort demonstrating positive lesions on FAPI PET. However, selected case reports present a compelling counterexample, highlighting the potential for complete absence of FAPI uptake in aggressive DLBCL. This observation suggests that [<sup>18</sup>F]FAPI PET/CT may not be a consistently reliable tool for staging DLBCL, where [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG PET/CT remains the gold standard. Given the established association between the stroma-1 gene signature and improved survival outcomes in DLBCL, Lu et al. (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) postulate that the observed low FAPI uptake in their case may reflect a distinct subgroup of patients with poorer prognosis. The lack of FAPI uptake could potentially indicate a less reactive stromal environment, which may correlate with a more aggressive tumor phenotype. Therefore, the authors propose that [<sup>18</sup>F]FAPI PET/CT, while potentially limited in staging DLBCL, may serve as a &#x0201c;reverse prognostic indicator.&#x0201d; Specifically, low or absent FAPI uptake could identify patients at higher risk of adverse outcomes, allowing for tailored therapeutic strategies and closer monitoring.</p><p>Beyond its potential utility in characterizing lymphoma subtypes, FAPI imaging could be particularly useful in specific anatomical locations, such as the brain, liver, and oropharynx, where it may enhance lymphoma diagnostic workup. Indeed, especially in non-FDG-avid subtypes, such as primary hepatic extranodal marginal zone MALToma, [<sup>68</sup>Ga]FAPI PET/CT has proved useful in the assessment of liver involvement (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>).</p><p>Potential pitfall, particularly in mediastinal masses, may include thymoma or thymic carcinomas. It is important to bear in mind that FAPI may present high uptake in such tumors (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Notably, FAPI SUVmax appears to be consistently higher in thymic carcinomas compared to thymomas (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>).</p><p>While CD19 CAR-T cell therapy has greatly improved treatment for blood cancers, its use in solid tumors is challenging. This is because many cancer targets are also found in healthy tissues, potentially causing side effects. Additionally, tumor cells vary in their target expressions, and the tumor's surroundings can hide these targets, reducing CAR-T cell effectiveness. Therefore, a different approach targets non-cancerous cells that influence the tumor's environment. Cancer-associated fibroblasts are a promising target, leading to the development of FAP-targeted CAR-T cells. FAPI PET could be used to measure FAP levels and guide this therapy. For example, studies in mice with lung cancer showed that FAPI PET can track the response to FAP CAR-T cell therapy. It is anticipated that FAPI PET's use in relapsed or refractory lymphomas will be explored further (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>).</p><p>In addressing the limitations of our review, it is essential to highlight that the available evidence remains preliminary. The data consists of only three small cohort studies and a dozen case reports, affecting the generalizability of our findings. Collectively, the evidence indicates that FAPI PET/CT may serve as a complement to [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG PET/CT, particularly in cases with low FDG avidity or challenging anatomical sites. However, its sensitivity is lower in lymphomas with minimal stromal FAP expression. Notably, variability imaging protocols and study designs highlights the pressing need for standardized acquisition and reporting.</p><p>Further research is warranted to validate the potential of FAPI PET/CT as a diagnostic tool and prognostic biomarker in lymphoma, especially in DLBCL. Large-scale prospective studies are needed to investigate the correlation between FAPI uptake, stromal characteristics, and clinical outcomes in lymphoma patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><label>5</label><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, while FAPI PET/CT exhibits lower diagnostic sensitivity than [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG PET/CT in lymphomas characterized by low FAP expression, it retains potential as a complementary imaging modality. [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG PET/CT remains the gold standard of lymphoma imaging, but FAPI PET/CT may provide supplementary information regarding the molecular characteristics of lymphomas. While its overall role in routine staging appears less significant than that of [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG PET/CT, its prognostic and therapeutic implications warrant further research.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s6"><title>Data availability statement</title><p>The original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/<xref rid="s11" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Material</xref>, further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding author.</p></sec><sec sec-type="author-contributions" id="s7"><title>Author contributions</title><p>NQ: Writing &#x02013; original draft.
