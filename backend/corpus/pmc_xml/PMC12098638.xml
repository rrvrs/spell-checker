Currently, approximately 103 million people with diabetes worldwide are affected by DR (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). A 2020 study on the causes of blindness and visual impairment revealed that DR is the fifth most common cause of preventable blindness and moderate to severe visual impairment (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Currently, DR is commonly treated clinically with intravitreal injections of steroids and anti-vascular endothelial growth factor. However, these treatments can have unstable therapeutic effects and considerable side effects (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Consequently, it is important to find safe and effective new drugs.</p><p>Since traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs) are composed of a variety of herbs with extensive active ingredients and drug targets, they have shown outstanding clinical efficacy in the treatment of DR (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). The triplet medicine composed of <italic>Astragalus-Fructus ligustris-Cornus officinalis</italic>, known as HuangQi (HQ)-NvZhenZi (NZZ)-ShanZhuYv (SZY), has been extensively applied in the clinic to treat DR and serves as the core medicinal component in numerous traditional Chinese medicine prescriptions, as it can effectively ameliorate the clinical symptoms of DR (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). According to TCM theory, vision is closely related to the liver, as well as the contents of Qi and blood in humans. HQ supplements Qi whereas NZZ and SZY supplement the blood in liver, which then sends blood upwards to the eyes to supplement Qi and the blood and improve eyesight. Previous laboratory studies have shown that the astragaloside IV contained in HQ inhibits the expression of miR-138-5p, thereby increasing the activities of Sirt1/Nrf2 and the antioxidant capacity of cells to improve ferroptosis and reduce cell death, ultimately inhibiting the progression of DR (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Luteolin, an effective component of NZZ, can reduce the expression of NLRP1, NOX4, TXNIP, and NLRP3, thereby increasing inflammation and oxidative stress and inhibiting the retinal cell apoptosis in DR rats (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). The quercetin and saponins extracted from SZY can lower blood glucose and blood lipid levels by protecting islet function, thus improving insulin resistance and regulating glucose and lipid metabolism (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Moreover, SZY extract can improve diabetes-related complications (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). However, the specific effects, targets and mechanisms of the combined use of these three drugs have not been systematically studied.</p><p>Fortunately, the development of artificial intelligence (AI) technology has brought new opportunities for research in this field. Owing to its excellent data processing capabilities, AI can reveal the deep connections between the chemical components of TCMs, diseases, and targets, providing a new approach to understand the complex interactions between the components of TCMs and elucidating the mechanisms of diseases. For example, Li et al. combined machine learning (ML) and deep learning models to predict antioxidant activity in gentian (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Gu et al. developed a heterogeneous graph neural network model to predict the compatibility strength and probability among the herbs within the relevant prescriptions of colorectal adenoma (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Zhang et al. applied the deep learning graph embedding algorithm framework Node2vec, in combination with Danshen and Chuanxiong, to successfully predict new targets for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). These studies indicate that the application of AI technology in TCM research cannot only promote an understanding of the mechanisms of action of TCMs but also provide new perspectives for explaining the interactions between TCMs and diseases.</p><p>In this study, an integrated framework (BNM) encompassing bioinformatics, network pharmacology, and molecular fingerprint ML to assess the potential of the using the triplet medicine HQ, NZZ, and SZY for the treatment of DR was successfully developed and validated. We extracted the active components of these herbs from TCM databases and the literature and performed functional enrichment analysis, constructed a diagnostic model, and carried out immunological analysis and molecular docking by screening core targets and components. Furthermore, we developed a ML model using 990 compounds from the LOPAC-1280 and Prestwick Chemical Library and validated it with the core components of the triplet medicine. We also applied the Breaking of Retrosynthetically Interesting Chemical Substructures (BRICS) and Retrosynthetic Combinatorial Analysis Procedure (RECAP) algorithms for fragment analysis of the core components to evaluate the potential of this model to generate lead components. Finally, these findings were corroborated through animal experiments (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). In summary, in our research, we evaluated the efficacy of combined DR treatment with the triplet medicine from multiple perspectives, utilized a molecular fingerprint ML model to identify effective TCM components, and provided a novel perspective for drug research and repurposing.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>FIGURE 1</label><caption><p>Workflow of this study.

Generally, oral bioavailability (OB) is one of the most crucial absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) pharmacokinetic parameters, whereas drug likeness (DL) indicates the similarity between the physical properties of the component in question and those of known drugs (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). In this study, the criteria for identifying effective components were set to OB &#x02265; 30% and DL &#x02265; 0.18. The relevant targets of the bioactive components were subsequently identified using the SwissTargetPrediction database and standardized using the UniProt database. DR-related genes were obtained from the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) and the GeneCards and Disease Gene Network (DisGeNET) databases. The genes associated with diseases and drugs were intersected using the UpSetR package in R software to identify the intersecting genes. Three DR&#x02013;TCM-related genes were subsequently added to the gene set after review of the literature. A protein&#x02013;protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed on the basis of the gene sets. The PPI network developed using the STRING platform, an interactive gene database, gave a high confidence interaction score (0.7), indicating a targeted network. All of the database searches were limited the species to <italic>Homo sapiens</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="S2.SS2"><title>2.2 Core network cluster mining and functional analysis</title><p>To further explore the core network, we employed Cytoscape software (version 3.82) to visualize the target network. Network analysis tools were employed to calculate the key network metrics, including the network diameter, the clustering coefficient, and multiedge node pairs. The MCODE plugin, which employs molecular complex detection, was used for core network mining on the target network. The core network group was obtained with the following parameters: degree cut-off = 2, node score cut-off = 0.2, K-core = 2, and max depth = 100.</p><p>The clusterProfiler package in R was employed for gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses of both the target and core networks, and the results were filtered at the level of <italic>p</italic>-value &#x02264; 0.05. GO analysis encompasses three domains: biological process (BP), molecular function (MF), and cellular component (CC). The GO results were filtered to exclude the terms significantly unrelated to DR. KEGG analysis revealed the top 40 target networks and the top 30 core networks, as the latter results were weakly correlated with DR. The results were plotted using the R packages ComplexHeatmap, ggplot2, and circlize.</p></sec><sec id="S2.SS3"><title>2.3 Identification of differentially expressed genes (DEGs)</title><p>Mining of the core network group and functional analysis revealed that 12 core targets were strongly correlated with DR. To further investigate and confirm the biological functions of the core targets in DR, we randomly selected PPARG for subsequent analysis. The Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database includes high-throughput gene expression data, DNA microarray data, and hybridization array data (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). The GSE146615 microarray dataset, including 42 control samples and 52 samples from individuals with DR, was downloaded from the GEO database. Differential expression analysis was performed using the limma package in R. The limma package is renowned for its capabilities in terms of data normalization and precise gene expression data interpretation, and has therefore become the preferred choice for high-throughput and microarray differential analysis (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). The screening criteria were |log (FC)| &#x0003e; 1 and <italic>p</italic>-value &#x0003c; 0.001. The ggplot2 package was employed to generate a volcano plot, which was used to visualize the top 30 DEGs. A focused analysis of PPARG was subsequently conducted to explore its expression in the normal and DR groups, and the data were plotted with the ggpubr package.</p></sec><sec id="S2.SS4"><title>2.4 Diagnostic prediction model establishment and immune analysis</title><p>To evaluate the diagnostic and predictive utility of PPARG for DR, a predictive model was developed using microarray datasets. Analysis was conducted using the pROC package in R software. Binary classification models are commonly evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). The position of the ROC curve in relation to the upper left quadrant is indicative of the classification performance of the method in question. The bootstrap algorithm was employed for statistical analysis. Bootstrap, proposed by Efron, is a simulation-based sampling statistical inference algorithm that does not require assumption of a specific theoretical distribution (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). The area under the curve (AUC) can then be used to assess the predictive accuracy of PPARG. A larger AUC indicates greater accuracy of using PPARG for DR diagnosis. The abscissa False Positive Rate (FPR) and ordinate True Positive Rate (TPR) of the ROC curve can be calculated via the following formula.</p><disp-formula id="S2.E1">

To this end, the CIBERSORT algorithm was employed to assess the correlation between PPARG and 22 immune cell types within the dataset. The CIBERSORT algorithm is a canonical computational method for analyzing immune outcomes. It employs the principles of linear SVM regression to deconvolve the expression profiles of immune cell subtypes and calculate their abundance (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). The statistical threshold was set to <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05, and the results were visualized using the ggpubr package in R.</p></sec><sec id="S2.SS5"><title>2.5 Binding free energy calculations</title><p>To evaluate the functional effects of the active components present in HQ, NZZ, and SZY on PPARG, we employed AutoDock software (version 1.5.6) to compute the binding free energies between PPARG and these components. The structure of PPARG was retrieved from the RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB) database, and the water molecules present were subsequently removed. The structures of the active components of these three medicinal preparations were sourced from the PubChem database. After processing, a Lamarckian genetic algorithm was used to predict the molecular conformations of the protein receptor and small molecules, and the binding energies of the active ingredients were computed separately. These binding energies indicate the affinity of the small molecule for the protein. The binding energies were also calculated via the following formula:</p><disp-formula id="S2.Ex1">

We collected 394 negative compounds from LOPAC-1280, and defined the 9 components of HQ, NZZ, and SZY as positive compounds. Significantly more negative compounds than positive compounds were included to ensure that the model would be able to identify positive compounds with greater accuracy. Although the majority of the compounds were deemed negative, it is possible that a small proportion of these molecules may have been mislabelled, as there may be undiscovered compounds that could be used to treat DR.</p><p>These 403 compounds were converted to SMILES format, and the RDKit package in Python was employed to compute a range of physical and chemical descriptors from 200 unique aspects, including Hybrid Estate-VSA descriptors, topochemical descriptors, and the QED and Lipinski parameters. RDKit is a computational chemistry toolkit that can process molecules, analyze different chemical input formats, filter out unwanted compounds, standardize molecules, and calculate various molecular characteristics (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>).

Both RF and SVM utilized scikit-learn 1.3.0. The Gini index was used to assess the feature importance of the 200 physicochemical descriptors in the dataset. Feature importance helps to indicate the significance of the physicochemical descriptors, which are believed to be closely linked to classification.

Fragment-based drug discovery (FBDD) is a common lead discovery approach that differs from high-throughput screening (HTS) in that early FBDD results may have more applicable physicochemical properties. Upon segmentation by both algorithms, we found that the BRICS algorithm, which is based on bond synthesis, separated &#x003b2;-sitosterol, telocinobufagin, eriodictyol, tetrahydroalstonine, and betulinic acid into two fragments each; stigmasterol, calycosin, and hederagenin into three fragments each; and lucidusculine into four fragments. However, the RECAP algorithm, which differs in that it is based on retrosynthesis, split stigmasterol, calycosin, tetrahydroalstonine, betulinic acid, and hederagenin into 2 fragments each; lucidusculine into 3 fragments; and was unable to fragment &#x003b2;-sitosterol, telocinobufagin or eriodictyol.

HQ, NZZ, and SZY are commonly used Chinese herbs for treating DR. Together, these herbs nourish liver blood to brighten the eyes and have shown significant therapeutic effects in the clinical treatment of DR. The complexity of the diverse components and vast data have led to significant limitations in elucidating the material basis of Chinese herbal components and their specific mechanisms of action in disease treatment. AI technology, with its powerful data processing and pattern recognition capabilities, has shown great potential in analyzing the complex chemical component TCM datasets. In this study, we applied AI technology to explore the therapeutic mechanisms of the herbal trio HQ&#x02013;NZZ&#x02013;SZY in detail, aiming to provide more substantial scientific evidence for clinical application.</p><p>In this study, the core components of HQ, NZZ, and SZY were mined on the basis of OB &#x02265; 30% and DL &#x02265; 0.18. A comprehensive analysis of their predicted target genes was also conducted. The targets of the TCM were merged with genes related to DR from the CTD, GeneCards, and DisGeNET databases to construct a core target network, which led to the identification of 12 core genes, including PPARG (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). The differential expression of PPARG in DR and its significant diagnostic and predictive capabilities were validated on public databases (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3A&#x02013;C</xref>). Animal experiments confirmed that the level of PPARG in the retinal tissue of DR model mice was significantly lower than that in the mice in the blank control group (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Figures 8B,C</xref>). The liver is an important site for glucose and lipid metabolism and can store glucose by synthesizing glycogen and regenerate glucose via gluconeogenesis under fasting conditions. Therefore, the expression of PPARG in the livers of DR model mice was evaluated and it was revealed that, compared with that in the blank control group, the expression of PPARG in the livers of DR model mice also tended to decrease (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Figures 8F,G</xref>). Some other core genes also play important roles in the development and progression of DR. Studies have shown that increased MAPK14 levels inhibit IGFBP-3 expression, and intravitreal injection of IGFBP-3 can reduce TNF-&#x003b1; levels in the retinal tissue of diabetic rats, thereby potentially mitigating retinal damage caused by inflammatory responses. Elevated proinflammatory factors increase ICAM1 expression, which contributes significantly to microcirculation disorders in diabetic patients, leading to leukocyte adhesion and aggregation in retinal vessel walls, which disrupts the blood-retina barrier and damages retinal nerve cells (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>).</p><p>To study the potential therapeutic effects of the TCM herbal trio HQ, NZZ and SZY on DR, the interactions of their main components with PPARG were explored via molecular docking. It was revealed that the nine components betulinic acid, hederagenin, calycosin, &#x003b2;-sitosterol, eriodictyol, lucidusculine, telocinobufagin, stigmasterol, and tetrahydroalstonine strongly bind to PPARG (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4A&#x02013;J</xref>). This implies that this herbal trio may play an important role in the treatment of DR by regulating the expression levels of PPARG. To further explore the therapeutic effects of these nine components on DR, three ML models integrating molecular fingerprint techniques, SVM, RF, and XGBoost, were constructed for their systematic evaluation. Among the evaluated models, the XGBoost model achieved the highest mean AUC and showed better performance in terms of precision, recall, and F1 score, along with improved confusion matrix metrics (TP, TN, FP, and FN), compared with the other two models (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5A&#x02013;H</xref>). Therefore, further data mining was performed using the XGBoost model.

Furthermore, in the retinal tissue, blood vessel dilation was alleviated, there were fewer new blood vessels, the cell layers were distinguishable, there were significantly more cells in each layer, the arrangement was more orderly, vacuolar changes were diminished, and there was less shedding of RGCs, collecting approaching normal retinal morphology (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7F</xref>).

PEPCK, G6Pase, SREBP-1c and Fas are important indicators reflecting the status of glycolipid metabolism in the liver: PEPCK and G6Pase are the rate-limiting enzymes in glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis in the liver (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). SREBP-1c regulates the conversion of glucose to lipids in the liver. Inhibiting SREBP-1c expression can effectively reduce fat production and lipid accumulation (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>, <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>). Fas is a key enzyme in the conversion of glucose to fatty acids (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). Fas inhibitors can effectively increase insulin sensitivity and play an important role in maintaining glucose homeostasis in the body (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>). Therefore, in this study, the levels of the abovementioned glucose and lipid metabolism-related indicators in the liver were evaluated. Compared with those in group C, the expression levels of PEPCK, G6Pase, SREBP-1c, and Fas were increased in the livers in group M (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). Furthermore, compared with those in group M, the expression levels of PEPCK, G6Pase, SREBP-1c, and Fas in the livers in groups D, S, and P decreased to varying degrees (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Figures 8F,G</xref>). A cohort study shows that improved glucose and lipid metabolism and controlling blood sugar and lipid levels in T2DM can reduce microvascular complications like DR (<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>). These findings indicate that the TCM herbal trio and stigmasterol can regulate glucose and lipid metabolism possibly through promoting the activity of PPARG, thereby playing a therapeutic role in DR.</p><p>On the other hand, PPARG is an important immunomodulator that is closely associated with the expression levels of inflammatory mediators and the inflammasome activation (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>). Analysis of the interactions between PPARG and the immunological microenvironment revealed significant correlations between PPARG and 13 different types of immune cells. Specifically, PPARG is negatively correlated with plasma cells, gamma delta T cells, M1 macrophages, and naive B cells, which may suggest that these cells are more active in environments with low PPARG expression or are related to the suppressive effects of PPARG. Conversely, PPARG is positively correlated with nine types of immune cells, including M2 macrophages, which may indicate that these cells play a positive role in microenvironments where PPARG expression is active (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). Persistent hyperglycaemia can lead to chronic inflammation within the body, and as the inflammatory response intensifies, inflammatory cells infiltrate and damage retinal tissues, exacerbating retinal vascular permeability, vascular dilation, and retinal thickening (<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>). The upregulation of PPARG cannot only redirect sugar metabolism but also alleviate the inflammatory response within the body, thereby reducing the damage caused by hyperglycaemia (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Studies have shown that stigmasterol reduces the expression levels of serum IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-6, TNF-&#x003b1;, and other inflammatory mediators, which may be due to its ability to activate PPARG. This activation can improve the balance between Treg and Th cells and reduce systemic inflammation (<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>). Moreover, in the serum of the DR model mice, it was found that compared with those in group C, the levels of the proinflammatory factors TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-1&#x003b2;, and IL-6 were significantly increased (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) and the level of the anti-inflammatory factor IL-10 was decreased (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) in group M (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Additionally, compared with group M, the levels of TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-1&#x003b2; and IL-6 were reduced (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) while IL-10 was increased (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) in the groups D, S, and P (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A</xref>). These findings indicate that the TCM herbal trio and stigmasterol can reduce the levels of proinflammatory factors and increase the levels of anti-inflammatory factors in the body, thereby improving inflammation in DR.</p><p>In this study, in-depth GO and KEGG enrichment analyses of the 12 core targets of the TCM herbal trio were conducted. The analyses revealed that three signaling pathways, including the VEGF signaling pathway, were significantly enriched (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>). VEGF is an important factor that regulates angiogenesis. In DR, VEGF can bind to its receptor (VEGFR2), which promotes the formation of new blood vessels at the fundus and increases vascular permeability. Compared with normal blood vessels, these pathological new blood vessels lack stable endothelial cells and peripheral supporting cells, making them structurally immature and prone to rupture, which can cause damage to and bleeding in the retina and lead to manifestations such as cystoid macular oedema and optic disc oedema, which are characteristic of DR (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>). Studies have shown that increased VEGF expression can activate PPARG phosphorylation, inducing lipid synthesis that promotes T-cell activation, thereby maintaining the activated state of T cells and promoting the occurrence of inflammatory responses (<xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>). Therefore, changes in the expression of the factors in VEGF pathway may initiate the induction of fundus lesions in DR. Consequently, the expression of VEGF and VEGFR2 in retinal and liver tissues was detected. Compared with those in group C, the expression levels of VEGF and VEGFR2 in the retina and liver in group M were increased (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), but compared with those in group M, the expression levels of VEGF and VEGFR2 in the retina and liver in groups D, S, and P decreased (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Figures 8B&#x02013;E</xref>), indicating that the VEGF/VEGFR2 pathway may be the mechanism by which the TCM herbal trio and stigmasterol exert their therapeutic effects on vascular lesions in the fundus of DR patients.</p><p>In summary, in this study, a multimodule framework (BNM) that integrates bioinformatics, network pharmacology, and ML based on molecular fingerprints was developed to thoroughly investigate the potential mechanisms of action of the TCM formula consisting of HQ, NZZ, and SZY on DR, and the mechanisms were validated with animal experiments. This study elucidates the specific molecular mechanisms by which these TCM components treat DR from both theoretical computational and biological experimental perspectives, offering a new perspective for medical research. <italic>In vivo</italic> experiments have demonstrated that the combined HQ-NZZ-SZY formula, along with their key component stigmasterol, can modulate the expression of PPARG. This modulation helps regulate glucose and lipid metabolism while reducing systemic inflammation, thereby inhibiting retinal neovascularization and attenuating the progression of DR. Given that insulin resistance constitutes a critical pathophysiological mechanism in diabetes, based on the aforementioned experimental findings, we tentatively propose that stigmasterol may serve as a potential PPARG modulator for diabetic patients exhibiting significant insulin resistance. This could not only delay DR progression but also ameliorate hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia induced by insulin resistance. However, this study still has some limitations. First, although the molecular mechanism of DR regulation by stigmasterol in this study was investigated by the multimodal BNM framework and verified by animal experiments, the computational results may be biased due to the limited generalization ability of machine learning algorithms and the complexity and diversity of biological systems, and further experiments with human samples are still needed to verify our findings. Secondly, the FBDD-based drug research design in this study is still at a preliminary theoretical stage, necessitating further investigations. Finally, this study shows that upregulation of PPARG inhibits the VEGF/VEGFR2 pathway, thereby attenuating key pathological features of DR. Future in-depth studies are planned to elucidate the precise underlying molecular mechanisms. Therefore, future work will focus on collecting more clinical trial data and animal experimental models for more in-depth research.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="S5"><title>Data availability statement</title><p>Publicly available datasets were analyzed in this study.
