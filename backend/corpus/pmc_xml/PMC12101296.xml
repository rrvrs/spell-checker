Introduction</title><p>The <italic toggle="yes">Bombyx mori</italic> L., commonly known as the silkworm, is a domesticated insect belonging to the Bombycidae family within the Lepidoptera order, characterized by its complete metamorphosis life cycle [<xref rid="B1-medicines-12-00011" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. This insect is central to sericulture, an agricultural practice dedicated to silkworm breeding, reproduction, pathology, and the production of cocoons [<xref rid="B2-medicines-12-00011" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>The bioactive compounds of <italic toggle="yes">Bombyx mori</italic> L., including sericin, fibroin, serrapeptase, seroin, and protease inhibitors, offer a broad spectrum of therapeutic effects, highlighting their potential in various medical and health-related applications [<xref rid="B3-medicines-12-00011" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Serrapeptase, with its anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and fibrinolytic actions, has been utilized for over 40 years, especially in Japan and Europe, to reduce inflammation and pain [<xref rid="B4-medicines-12-00011" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Sericins and fibroins contribute significantly to wound healing, skin hydration, and anti-aging, thanks to their ability to bind moisture, stimulate cellular proliferation, and accelerate the regeneration of tissue [<xref rid="B5-medicines-12-00011" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-medicines-12-00011" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. These proteins also show antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial properties, protecting against UV radiation and promoting collagen synthesis [<xref rid="B7-medicines-12-00011" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-medicines-12-00011" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-medicines-12-00011" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-medicines-12-00011" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Seroin and protease inhibitors add to this protective spectrum by offering antimicrobial and antifungal benefits, safeguarding the silkworm, and potentially providing benefits to human health [<xref rid="B11-medicines-12-00011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-medicines-12-00011" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Collectively, these compounds from <italic toggle="yes">Bombyx mori</italic> demonstrate a multifaceted approach to health, offering benefits ranging from skin care and wound healing to dietary supplements, showcasing their versatility and potential as natural, beneficial ingredients in medical, cosmetic, and nutritional fields [<xref rid="B13-medicines-12-00011" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>The concept of employing silk as a material in wound healing applications is not novel. Silk fibroin scaffolds have garnered significant attention in the literature [<xref rid="B14-medicines-12-00011" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] as bioactive functionalized biomaterials can be derived from specially modified silkworms [<xref rid="B15-medicines-12-00011" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. There have also been research efforts focused on healing with sericin and serrapeptase [<xref rid="B16-medicines-12-00011" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The outcomes of these studies have highlighted <italic toggle="yes">Bombyx mori</italic>&#x02019;s products as a source of significant bioactive components for skin healing that merit further study.</p><p>The use of <italic toggle="yes">Bombyx mori</italic> L. derivatives in burn wound healing is of growing interest due to their unique bioactive components and regenerative potential. Silk fibroin (SF), a primary structural protein of silk, has demonstrated significant therapeutic effects in skin repair and regeneration. Composed predominantly of fibroin (75&#x02013;83%) and sericin (17&#x02013;25%), silk also contains secondary metabolites such as flavonoids (quercetin, kaempferol), alkaloids, coumarin derivatives, and phenolic acids, which contribute to its anti-inflammatory and wound-healing properties. These bioactive constituents make <italic toggle="yes">Bombyx mori</italic>-derived materials highly biocompatible and effective in facilitating tissue repair [<xref rid="B13-medicines-12-00011" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Clinical and preclinical studies have consistently shown the benefits of silk-based dressings for burn wound healing [<xref rid="B13-medicines-12-00011" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. A human study revealed that pure silk dressings accelerated re-epithelialization in superficial burns covering more than 10% of the body surface area while reducing dressing change frequency and improving patient satisfaction with scarring outcomes [<xref rid="B17-medicines-12-00011" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Similarly, experimental studies in animal models demonstrated that injectable hydrogels containing silk fibroin significantly increased wound closure, collagen deposition, and angiogenesis, all crucial factors in tissue regeneration [<xref rid="B18-medicines-12-00011" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Furthermore, the use of silk fibroin in hypertrophic scar treatment resulted in thinner, less pigmented scars with well-aligned collagen fibers, indicating its role in preventing excessive fibrotic responses [<xref rid="B19-medicines-12-00011" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>The molecular mechanisms underlying silk fibroin&#x02019;s regenerative properties are becoming increasingly understood. Recent studies demonstrated that silk fibroin hydrogel enhances cell proliferation, migration, and adhesion through the regulation of TLN1 expression, promoting accelerated wound healing [<xref rid="B20-medicines-12-00011" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Additionally, therapeutic dressings composed of silk fibroin have been shown to contain &#x003b1;-helices and &#x003b2;-sheets, both of which play critical roles in wound healing [<xref rid="B17-medicines-12-00011" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. While &#x003b1;-helices improve cell proliferation and migration, &#x003b2;-sheet SF facilitates granulation tissue formation and re-epithelialization by enhancing extracellular matrix (ECM) protein expression (fibronectin, type III collagen), increasing matrix metalloproteinase-12 activity, and upregulating integrin &#x003b2;1 expression. This crosstalk between ECM proteins and cell adhesion molecules in fibroblasts highlights the ability of &#x003b2;-sheet SF to promote dermal tissue regeneration [<xref rid="B17-medicines-12-00011" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>While extensive research has been conducted on the wound-healing properties of silkworm-derived materials, such as silk fibroin and cocoons [<xref rid="B13-medicines-12-00011" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], there remains a significant gap in the literature regarding the therapeutic potential of extracts obtained directly from the organism itself. Previous studies have primarily focused on silk-based dressings and hydrogels, yet the bioactivity of <italic toggle="yes">Bombyx mori</italic> body and gland extracts in wound healing remains largely unexplored. This study aimed to address this gap by conducting a comparative investigation of different extracts derived from the body and glands of <italic toggle="yes">Bombyx mori</italic>, alongside cocoon-derived components, to evaluate their effects on the healing of second-degree burns. By elucidating the wound-healing potential of these extracts, this research seeks to expand the current understanding of <italic toggle="yes">Bombyx mori</italic> bioactivity and explore novel avenues for its application in regenerative medicine.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-medicines-12-00011"><title>2. Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2dot1-medicines-12-00011"><title>2.1. Animals</title><p>In this study, 80 female SKH-hr2 mice were used. These animals were divided into 9 groups of 5 each and 5 groups of 7 each and housed separately. The SKH-hr2 mouse model was selected due to its well-documented suitability for burn healing studies. Its hairless phenotype eliminates variability in wound exposure and heat transfer, ensuring consistent burn induction and reproducible results. Additionally, the absence of fur allows for direct and uninterrupted monitoring of wound healing progression, facilitating accurate assessment of re-epithelialization, tissue remodeling, and inflammatory responses. Importantly, while murine skin differs from human skin in some structural aspects, the SKH-hr2 model shares key physiological characteristics with human epidermis, including a comparable wound healing process, making it a relevant translational model for burn injury research. Previous studies have demonstrated its efficacy in evaluating treatments that influence inflammation, collagen deposition, and angiogenesis, which are crucial factors in burn recovery [<xref rid="B21-medicines-12-00011" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>The mice were sourced from the breeding facilities of the School of Pharmacy&#x02019;s Small Animal Laboratory, certified under the European License Code: EL 25 BIO 06.

The eschar removal process was undertaken on the thirteenth day, resulting in a significant diminution of burn size across all groups, particularly in those administered with the 60% body extract and the cocoon dressing. By the culmination of the study, all mice within the groups receiving 20% and 60% body extracts demonstrated healing, with those treated with cocoon dressings and gland extracts at 40% and 60% concentrations showing similarly positive outcomes. Notably, the groups treated with cocoon dressings and the 60% body extract exhibited the most benign image throughout the duration of the study, characterized by a reduced eschar formation and minimal fluid exudation from the burn areas (<xref rid="medicines-12-00011-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>In the subsequent phase of the investigation, the appearance of eschar was notable from the outset, particularly within the group receiving the cocoon dressing, and more so in the mice subjected to the combined approach of cocoon dressing and 60% body extract, with significant intensity noted as early as the third day. For the remaining groups, the maximum amount of eschar was reached on the ninth day. Concurrently, necrotic tissue was excised from all groups on this day, facilitating a pronounced decrease in the burn sizes across the board, with the trio of intervention groups experiencing the most substantial reductions.

Sebum</title><p>In the first experiment of the study (<xref rid="medicines-12-00011-f013" ref-type="fig">Figure 13</xref>), analysis revealed no statistically significant differences across any of the groups in terms of sebum measurements. However, it was observed that sebum levels tended to decrease on the last day compared to the first day across all groups, with the exceptions being the 40% body extract and the 60% gland extract groups, which showed an upward trend, and the 60% body extract group, where levels remained consistent. This indicates that, while overall sebum production may decrease over time with the application of various treatments, specific formulations like the 40% body extract and the 60% gland extract can potentially stimulate sebum production or maintain it at initial levels.</p><p>Furthermore, there were no statistically significant differences between the groups, except for a notable distinction between the 40% body extract and the 40% gland extract groups, indicating an initial significant variance in sebum levels between these two treatments. As the experiment progressed, statistically significant differences were observed among several groups, highlighting the distinct impact of certain treatments on sebum production. Notably, significant differences were found between the 20% gland extract and the cocoon, the 60% gland extract and the 20% body extract, the 60% gland extract and the 20% gland extract, the 60% gland extract and the control group, and the 60% gland extract and the cocoon. These results suggest that treatments can have varied effects on sebum levels, with the 60% gland extract showing a particularly significant impact compared to other treatments, affecting sebum production in a notable manner.</p><p>In the second experiment, as illustrated in <xref rid="medicines-12-00011-f014" ref-type="fig">Figure 14</xref>, it was concluded that all groups exhibited reduced sebum levels by the last day of the study.

Discussion</title><p>The present study aimed to examine the action of three different silk moth products (silkworm body, glands, and cocoon) at different doses. One of the primary objectives of this research was to highlight the body and glands of the silk moth as potential sources of bioactive ingredients for burn healing. For this purpose, a burn model in experimental animals (SKH-hr2 female mice) was utilized. The study was conducted in two phases, where the products with the best outcome initially, (cocoon and 60% body extract) were further tested on more subjects, both individually and in combination.</p><p>As per primary outcomes [<xref rid="B24-medicines-12-00011" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], based on initial results, complete healing was observed on the final day for groups treated with body extracts at concentrations of 20% and 60%, followed closely by groups treated with cocoon and gland extracts at 60%, each with three healed mice. In the subsequent phase of the study, on Day 19, the healing rates of the three treatments were at comparable levels. By Day 21, a significant increase in the number of healed muscles was observed in the group treated with cocoon extracts, as well as a substantial improvement in the healing rate of the group receiving a combination therapy. Ultimately, the cocoon extract group exhibited the highest healing rate, with the other two treatments being equally effective. The control groups&#x02019; healing rates remained at lower levels.</p><p>In all experimental groups, there was a noticeable enlargement of the burn surface area on Day 3 compared to initial measurements, a phenomenon potentially attributable to the well-documented process of burn wound conversion [<xref rid="B25-medicines-12-00011" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Subsequently, formation of eschar was observed, with a reduced quantity noted in groups treated with cocoon extracts and 60% silkworm body extract. By the conclusion of the experiment, healing was evident in all mice within the groups administered 20% and 60% silkworm body extracts, followed closely by those receiving cocoon and silk gland extracts at 40% and 60% concentrations. This suggests that specific compounds present in the silkworm body, along with those identified in the cocoon and silk glands, may play a significant role in enhancing the rate of healing in the treated groups. Indeed, it is well-known that sericin and fibroin have proven healing properties [<xref rid="B26-medicines-12-00011" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27-medicines-12-00011" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>Multiple comparisons between groups on daily measurements were undertaken regarding the burn surface area uncovered two distinct trends during the initial and latter halves of the experiment. In the first period (Days 1&#x02013;9), the 40% body extract and 20% gland extract groups exhibited the most effective healing. Nevertheless, the formation of eschar during these initial days occurred at variable rates and quantities, thereby compromising the reliability of comparisons between the therapeutic groups.</p><p>According to the histopathological results, initially animals treated with cocoon demonstrated the best histopathological profile, with the observed damage graded at 5 units. The inflammation and edema were mild, and the depth of the damage was superficial. Such healing action also has previously been attributed to the anti-inflammatory and wound healing properties of sericin and fibroin [<xref rid="B26-medicines-12-00011" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27-medicines-12-00011" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The next best performing groups were those treated with body extracts at concentrations of 40% and 60%, which were scored at 8 units. In these groups, the inflammation and edema were of moderate severity, while the damage extended throughout the thickness of the dermis. The satisfactory results may have been aided by the well-known anti-inflammatory action of serrapeptase [<xref rid="B28-medicines-12-00011" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The group treated with body extract at a 20% concentration was scored slightly higher, revealing that an increase in dosage might yield better results in healing burns. Notably, the gland extract groups, especially at the lower dosages, received particularly high histopathological scores, exceeding those of the control groups. This reveals an internal damage greater than evidenced, albeit slightly less for the 60% gland extract; this phenomenon may possibly be attributed to seroin activity [<xref rid="B29-medicines-12-00011" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], which is produced in the glands.</p><p>In the second experiment, the combination group (cocoon and 60% body extract) exhibited the best histopathological picture, with the observed damage graded at 7 units. The inflammation, edema, and depth of the damage were of moderate severity. It seems that the two silk products may act slightly better in synergy, according to the histopathological findings. The immediate next best groups were those treated with 60% body extract and cocoon, each scored at 8 units. In these groups, the inflammation and edema were of moderate severity, and the damage extended through the entire thickness of the dermis.</p><p>Regarding the quality of healing observed through the secondary outcomes of this study, the following observations can be made. Within the first experiment, the transepidermal water loss (TEWL) appears increased for all groups on the final day of the experiment, a predictable outcome as burns disrupts the normal functioning of the epidermal barrier due to the destruction of the keratin layer [<xref rid="B30-medicines-12-00011" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], which, as expected, did not return to normal values [<xref rid="B31-medicines-12-00011" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. However, the only group that did not show a statistically significant difference between the first and the last day of the experiment in terms of TEWL was the one treated with cocoon. This suggests that the TEWL values for this treatment group tend to return to normal levels. Additionally, hydration results indicate a reduction for almost all experimental groups on the last day of the experiment compared to the initial measurement. This reduction could be attributed both to the destruction of the epidermis, thus decreasing the skin&#x02019;s ability to retain water and hydrate, and to the presence of edema or inflammation [<xref rid="B32-medicines-12-00011" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. This reduction was statistically significant only for the control group, while in the other groups, where the reduction is not statistically significant, hydration tends to return to initial levels. For the groups treated with 60% body extract and 40% gland extract, a statistically significant increase in hydration was observed. In the case of the 60% gland extract group, as confirmed by histopathological data, the increased hydration is due to increased inflammation and edema. Conversely, for the 60% body extract group, in line with histopathological data, there is no evidence of significant inflammation in the area, and the increased hydration compared to the control group can be linked to the optimal functioning of post-traumatic tissue. Similar results were obtained from the second experiment, where, again, the group treated with the cocoon as a topical dressing experienced a non-statistically significant increase in transepidermal water loss (TEWL), while the other groups showed statistically significant TEWL. Meanwhile, the body extract did not exhibit the statistically significant reduction in hydration observed in the other interventions.</p><p>It is well established that burn injuries lead to thickening of the skin due to scar formation [<xref rid="B33-medicines-12-00011" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Thus, on the final day of the experiment, increased thickness values were observed across all groups, which were statistically significant compared to the first day of the experiment. Comparing between treatments, statistically significant results on the last day, which include the significantly reduced thickness for the groups treated with 40% and 60% body extract in comparison to the excipients group, as well as the significant difference between the 20% gland extract and 40% body extract groups. This indicates that, in terms of skin thickness, the 40% and 60% body extract groups demonstrated a smaller increase in this parameter. This outcome is consistent with the histopathological results, which showed that the hyperkeratosis observed in these treatments was milder compared to the other groups. This may be attributed to the anti-inflammatory action of serrapeptase present in the body extract (in higher concentrations in the higher dose extracts), resulting in diminished scar tissue formation during healing process. Additionally, during the second experiment, the statistically significant differences observed on the final day between the control groups (untreated and excipients) and the 60% body extract group are noteworthy, as the treatment may have limited the thickening of the new epidermis. However, in the case of the combination therapy, the thickness did not significantly differ from that of the control groups on the last day, which may imply that the cocoon in combination with the extract did not act with the same intensity in limiting the increase in skin thickness compared to the individual treatment (60% body extract).</p><p>The results of our study on the effectiveness of the silkworm cocoon and 60% body extract in wound healing may be attributed to the synergistic actions of bioactive compounds present in these extracts. Key components of the cocoon, such as sericin and fibroin, are known to possess wound-healing and anti-inflammatory properties, which could participate in tissue regeneration and reduce inflammation at the site of injury. Additionally, the serrapeptase enzyme found in silkworm body extracts might further enhance healing by promoting the breakdown of fibrin and decreasing inflammatory responses. It is worth noting that the observed effectiveness could also be due to the combined impact of these components working together to accelerate the healing process.</p><p>Although these findings are promising, additional research is needed to fully elucidate the mechanisms underlying the observed effects, particularly given the limitations of this study. First, we relied on hematoxylin and eosin staining to assess inflammation and re-epithelialization, which, while useful for structural evaluation, does not provide detailed insights. The inclusion of immunohistochemical markers would enhance the understanding of the healing process. Additionally, the limited number of experimental animals, although ethically justified, limits our findings. Moreover, this study did not include chemical analysis of the silkworm extracts, as it represents an initial screening within a broader systematic investigation conducted in our laboratory [<xref rid="B24-medicines-12-00011" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Finally, the absence of a mechanistic approach, particularly regarding molecular pathways involved in burn healing, remains a limitation. Future studies addressing these aspects shall provide a more comprehensive understanding of the therapeutic potential of <italic toggle="yes">Bombyx mori</italic> L. derivatives.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec5-medicines-12-00011"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>The cocoon and the silkworm body extract presented the best overall picture, demonstrating considerable effectiveness. The concentration of the silkworm body extracts appears to be proportional to the efficacy of the body extract. Gland&#x02019;s extracts did not exhibit any noteworthy action. The combination of the gel with 60% body extract and cocoon showed slightly improved action compared to individual treatments.</p><p>This suggests that both the cocoon and the silkworm body extract hold significant therapeutic potential in the context of burn healing, with their effectiveness possibly being dose dependent. The lack of significant activity from gland extracts indicates that not all components of the <italic toggle="yes">Bombyx mori</italic> contribute equally to wound healing, highlighting the importance of targeting specific silk moth derivatives for therapeutic use. Furthermore, the marginally enhanced efficacy of the combined treatments suggests that a synergistic effect may exist between the cocoon and body extract, offering a promising avenue for further research into optimal formulation strategies for burn treatment.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclaimer/Publisher&#x02019;s Note:</bold> The statements, opinions and data contained in all publications are solely those of the individual author(s) and contributor(s) and not of MDPI and/or the editor(s).
