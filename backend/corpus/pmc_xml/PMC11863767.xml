Additionally, amyloid-beta (A&#x003b2;) was shown to upregulate <italic>Ch25h</italic> expression and elevate 25HC levels in microglia, exacerbating these functional impairments. Mechanistically, 25HC was found to enhance cholesterol esterification, disrupt cell membrane dynamics, and further reduce microglial mobility and phagocytosis. Treatment with Avasimibe, a cholesterol esterification inhibitor, restored membrane dynamics and microglial function, leading to attenuated AD pathology in a 5XFAD mouse model.

The hallmark pathological features of AD include extracellular accumulation of amyloid-beta (A&#x003b2;) plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles composed of hyperphosphorylated tau protein. Despite extensive research, the precise mechanisms underlying AD pathogenesis remain incompletely understood, and effective therapeutic interventions are still lacking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Microglia, the resident immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS), play a crucial role in maintaining brain homeostasis by monitoring the neuronal environment, clearing debris through phagocytosis, and orchestrating inflammatory responses. In the context of AD, microglia are involved in recognizing and clearing A&#x003b2; aggregates; however, their functions become dysregulated as the disease progresses. Dysfunctional microglia exhibit impaired surveillance and phagocytic capacities, leading to inadequate clearance of A&#x003b2; and exacerbation of neuroinflammation, which collectively contribute to neuronal damage and cognitive decline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Understanding the factors that modulate microglial function is therefore essential for elucidating AD pathology and developing targeted therapies.</p><p id="Par3">Cholesterol metabolism has emerged as a significant factor influencing microglial function and AD progression. Cholesterol and its derivatives are integral components of cell membranes and play vital roles in cellular signaling, membrane fluidity, and lipid raft formation. Alterations in cholesterol homeostasis have been implicated in various neurodegenerative diseases, including AD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Oxysterols, oxygenated derivatives of cholesterol, serve as important regulators of cholesterol metabolism and have been shown to influence immune responses and inflammation within the CNS. Among the oxysterols, 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC) has garnered attention for its diverse biological functions. Synthesized by cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (CH25H), encoded by the <italic>Ch25h</italic> gene, 25HC is involved in regulating lipid metabolism, immune responses, and inflammatory processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Previous studies have indicated that 25HC can modulate immune cell function by affecting cholesterol esterification and membrane dynamics, thereby influencing cell signaling and activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Elevated levels of 25HC have been reported in various pathological conditions, including inflammatory diseases and cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. However, the specific role of 25HC in microglial function and its contribution to AD pathology remain poorly understood. Recent transcriptomic analyses have identified <italic>Ch25h</italic> as a differentially expressed gene (DEG) associated with disease-associated microglia (DAM) phenotypes in AD models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. This suggests a potential link between 25HC production and microglial dysfunction in the diseased brain. Furthermore, evidence indicates that A&#x003b2; may influence cholesterol metabolism pathways, including oxysterol synthesis, thereby potentially modulating microglial activity and contributing to disease progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Despite these insights, the mechanistic relationship between A&#x003b2;-induced 25HC production, microglial impairment, and AD pathology has yet to be fully elucidated.</p><p id="Par4">In this study, we investigated the impact of 25HC on microglial function and its subsequent effects on AD pathology. We examined how 25HC influences microglial surveillance, phagocytic capacity, and cytokine production both <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Additionally, we explored the role of A&#x003b2; in modulating <italic>Ch25h</italic> expression and 25HC production in microglia. We further delved into the mechanisms by which 25HC alters microglial function, focusing on its effects on cholesterol esterification and cell membrane dynamics. Lastly, we evaluated the therapeutic potential of Avasimibe, a cholesterol esterification inhibitor, in restoring microglial function and attenuating AD pathology in a 5XFAD mouse model. Our findings shed light on the critical role of 25HC in microglial dysfunction and suggest new avenues for therapeutic intervention targeting cholesterol metabolism in AD.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Animals</title><p id="Par5">The 5XFAD (Jax stock #006554, The Jackson Laboratory) littermate and transgenic(TG) were used.

First, we explored how A&#x003b2; and 25HC influence the expression of cholesterol esterase in microglia. <italic>Ex vivo</italic> microglia isolated from WT and TG mice of the 5XFAD model, the mRNA levels of cholesterol esterases <italic>Acat1</italic>,<italic> Acat2</italic>, and <italic>Soat1</italic> were significantly elevated in TG microglia (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A-C). <italic>In vitro</italic>, treatment of PMG with A&#x003b2; and 25HC significantly increased <italic>Acat2</italic> expression (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>D, E). Similarly, <italic>Soat1</italic> expression was significantly elevated following direct treatment with 25HC, although no significant changes were observed for <italic>Acat1</italic> (Extended Data Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A, B). Considering that the products can change the level of expression of the mRNA of the enzymes, we tried to verify the actual change in the CE. A cellular CE assay revealed that CE levels in PMG treated with A&#x003b2; and 25HC were significantly higher than those in the control group (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>F, Extended Data Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>C). This increase in CE was accompanied by a parallel rise in total cholesterol levels (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>F, G, Extended Data Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>D, E). To determine whether increased CE impacts cell membrane dynamics, we measured membrane fluidity using FRAP experiments. Cell membranes of PMG were fluorescently labeled with DiI dye, which stains lipids. The results showed that the A&#x003b2; and 25HC-treated groups exhibited a significantly reduced mobile fraction, with weaker fluorescence recovery compared to the vehicle-treated group (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>H-J, Extended Data Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>F, G). However, there were no significant differences in the recovery time constant (&#x003c4;), which reflects the time required to reach saturation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>K, Extended Data Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>H). These findings suggest that A&#x003b2; and 25HC promote increased CE production in microglia. This alteration in cellular lipid composition leads to impaired cell membrane dynamics, potentially contributing to the reduced mobility and functionality of microglia.</p><p id="Par129">

Avasimibe, a cholesterol esterification inhibitor, was used to reduce CE production. First, the cholesterol quantification experiment confirmed that treatment with Avasimibe reduced CE, which was increased by 25HC (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A, B). Further FRAP analysis shows that when Avasimibe reduced CE, the actual inhibition of cell membrane dynamics was also restored (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>C&#x02013;F, Extended Data Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>F&#x02013;H).</p><p id="Par40">Since Avasimibe is known to have high BBB permeability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], it was administered to the mice by oral gavage using the previously proposed effective dosing method (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>A) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].

To test this, 3.5-month-old 5XFAD TG mice, representing an early stage of pathology, were treated with Veh, 25HC, or 25HC combined with Avasimibe every other day for four weeks. Microglial function and pathological changes were then assessed (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>A). Cognitive and memory functions were evaluated using the novel object recognition (NOR) discrimination index and the Y-maze test. The 25HC-treated group performed significantly worse than the control group in both tests. However, mice treated with 25HC and Avasimibe exhibited improved cognitive function compared to the 25HC-only group (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>B&#x02013;C, Extended Data Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Long-term drug administration did not impair basic locomotor activity, as indicated by the total number of Y-maze entries and total distance traveled in the open field test. Instead, abnormal movements were observed in the 25HC-treated group, suggesting that 25HC may increase anxiety and induce abnormal behavior in mice (Extended Data Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>A&#x02013;C, E). Importantly, there were no significant differences in weight changes or metabolic abnormalities among the groups after four weeks of treatment, indicating no adverse side effects from long-term administration (Extended Data Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>D). Microglial phagocytic capacity, assessed <italic>ex vivo</italic>, was significantly reduced in the 25HC-treated group but was restored with Avasimibe co-treatment (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>J). To evaluate changes in amyloid pathology, RIPA-soluble and insoluble A&#x003b2;<sub>1&#x02212;42</sub> levels in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus were quantified by ELISA. The 25HC-treated group showed significantly elevated levels of RIPA-insoluble A&#x003b2;<sub>1&#x02212;42</sub> compared to controls, while co-treatment with Avasimibe reduced these levels (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>D, E, Extended Data Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>E, F). Immunohistochemistry further revealed that the density of A&#x003b2; plaques, stained with the 4G8 antibody and CongoRed, was significantly higher in the 25HC-treated group but reduced with Avasimibe treatment, consistent with ELISA results (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>F&#x02013;I, Extended Data Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>A&#x02013;D, G&#x02013;I). IBA1 staining showed reduced microglial density in the Avasimibe-treated group, likely reflecting either reduced microgliosis or a decline in microglial numbers due to decreased amyloid pathology (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>I, Extended Data Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>A, D). Similarly, IBA1 protein levels in brain lysates showed a downward trend in the Avasimibe-treated group, aligning with imaging results, though the changes were not statistically significant (Extended Data Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>A, B). The amount of TMEM119 protein, a marker for homeostatic microglia, was assessed in prefrontal cortex lysates. While there was no significant difference among groups, the 25HC-treated group exhibited the greatest reduction, suggesting fewer functional microglia in brains with accelerated plaque pathology (Extended Data Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>A, C). Consistent with this, astrogliosis was reduced in the Avasimibe-treated group. However, contrary to expectations based on the dramatic behavioral differences, NeuN staining and the expression of synaptic markers such as PSD95 and synaptophysin in prefrontal lysates showed no statistical differences between treatment groups (Extended Data Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>A, D&#x02013;K). <italic>In vivo</italic> two-photon imaging was used to assess whether Avasimibe directly improved microglial function in aged TG mice with advanced amyloid pathology and impaired microglial activity.

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec31"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par43">The findings of this study provide significant insights into the role of 25HC in modulating microglial function and its implications for AD pathology. Our data reveal that 25HC, a metabolite produced by the cholesterol hydroxylase encoded by the <italic>Ch25h</italic> gene, exerts profound effects on microglial surveillance, phagocytic activity, and cytokine production. Specifically, 25HC impairs the microglial response to brain injury, reduces their phagocytic capacity, and promotes a pro-inflammatory state factors that are all critical in the progression of AD. This study highlights that A&#x003b2; increases the expression of <italic>Ch25h</italic> in microglia, leading to elevated 25HC production, which in turn directly inhibits microglial movement and phagocytic capacity. One of the most striking observations is the significant reduction in microglial responsiveness to focal brain damage following 25HC administration, as demonstrated by <italic>in vivo</italic> two-photon microscopy. This diminished responsiveness correlates with a decrease in phagocytic capacity, observed both ex vivo and <italic>in vitro</italic>. These findings suggest that 25HC may contribute directly to microglial dysfunction in AD, where impaired phagocytosis of A&#x003b2; and other pathological debris is a hallmark. Moreover, the study highlights the role of A&#x003b2; in upregulating <italic>Ch25h</italic> expression and 25HC production in microglia, creating a feedback loop that could accelerate AD progression. Elevated CE levels and the resulting membrane rigidity likely impair microglial mobility and phagocytosis of A&#x003b2;, further contributing to the accumulation of amyloid plaques in the brain.</p><p id="Par44">Mechanistically, our investigation reveals that 25HC stimulates cholesterol esterification, leading to disruptions in cell membrane dynamics. This finding aligns with previous reports that 25HC influences cholesterol metabolism in immune cells, particularly macrophages, by promoting cholesterol esterification and altering membrane composition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In 25HC-treated microglia, the observed increase in CE levels and the corresponding decrease in membrane fluidity provide a crucial mechanistic link between altered cholesterol metabolism and microglial dysfunction. The interplay between 25HC and the APOE protein isoforms also merits further investigation, as it has been reported that 25HC increases inflammatory cytokine production more in the presence of the APOE4 isoform than APOE3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. When A&#x003b2; was treated in ApoE4 human-derived iMG, lipid droplet accumulation was increased, accompanied by elevated CH25H expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Furthermore, 25HC accumulation in the lysosome has been reported to induce metabolic reprogramming leading to enhanced immunosuppressive function in a study of immunosuppressive macrophages found in pan-tumours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Given the correlation between the metabolic maladaptation of microglia observed in chronic AD brains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], it would be also meaningful to further validate that 25HC-induced tolerogenic microglia in AD pathogenesis.</p><p id="Par45">Importantly, this study demonstrated that inhibiting cholesterol esterification with Avasimibe, a known CE inhibitor, can reverse the functional deficits in microglia induced by 25HC. Avasimibe treatment restored microglial membrane dynamics, phagocytic capacity, and responsiveness to injury, both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. This restoration was accompanied by a reduction in amyloid pathology and an improvement in cognitive function in 5XFAD mice, a well-established model of AD. Notably, Avasimibe is known to alleviate A&#x003b2; pathology by inhibiting the toxic A&#x003b2; production pathway, suggesting that its beneficial effects may be due to both the restoration of microglial function and the reduction in A&#x003b2; production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>].</p><p id="Par46">However, there are limitations associated with mouse models. The actual pathogenesis of AD is complex and involves not only A&#x003b2; but also various factors such as pathological tau and ApoE. Additionally, species-specific differences between mouse microglia and human microglia may limit the applicability of the findings to fully represent AD pathogenesis. Nonetheless, DAM-related gene profiles have been similarly observed in both 5XFAD mice and the brains of human AD patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Furthermore, APOE genotype-driven microglial gene expression profiles have shown comparable characteristics in APOE-FAD mice and iPSC-derived microglia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] While the current study did not directly utilize human brain samples to address interspecies differences, we aimed to bridge this gap by confirming the role of 25HC in iPSC-derived microglia alongside our findings.</p><p id="Par47">The potential interaction between microglia and surrounding cells, particularly astrocytes, in response to 25HC is also an important aspect of this study. 25HC released from microglia may accumulate lipid droplets in astrocytes, alter cholesterol reuptake, and affect ApoE release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Given that lipid droplet-accumulating cells have an inflammatory phenotype and reduced capacity for normal lipid metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>], this 25HC-mediated crosstalk between microglia and astrocytes likely has a synergistic adverse effect on AD pathology.</p><p id="Par48">The broader implications of these findings suggest that 25HC could influence AD pathology through mechanisms beyond the brain. Since oxysterols, including 25HC, have good BBB permeability, increased systemic 25HC levels due to peripheral infections might also affect microglial function in the brain. Elevated <italic>Ch25h</italic> expression and 25HC production have been identified as defense mechanisms in macrophages during various viral infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], raising the possibility that systemic infections could exacerbate AD pathology through increased 25HC. Further research is warranted to explore how peripheral immune responses and 25HC interact with microglia and other brain cells, which could reveal new therapeutic targets for AD.</p><p id="Par49">In summary, this study identifies 25HC as a critical modulator of microglial function in AD, linking cholesterol metabolism to microglial dysfunction and disease progression. The efficacy of Avasimibe in reversing these effects underscores the potential of targeting cholesterol metabolism as a therapeutic strategy. Future studies should further investigate the direct regulation of 25HC through KO experiments, the role of other oxysterols, the interaction between 25HC and peripheral immune cells, and the potential for combination therapies that address multiple aspects of microglial dysfunction in AD.</p></sec><sec id="Sec32" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.</p><p>
