It is not only an important aspect of the compassionate care we provide for our patients in the emergency department (ED) but it is also considered a core measure and tied to reimbursement [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].&#x000a0;Not surprisingly there is a rising interest in the role of ultrasound as a tool for the delivery of analgesia by emergency medicine (EM) providers [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].&#x000a0;With point-of-care ultrasound strongly supported by an American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) clinical policy, the notion of ultrasound-guided regional anesthesia by the EM provider is a logical next step [<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>-<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Ultrasound-guided regional anesthesia is already a very well-established modality of pain control in the anesthesia community where it has been proven to be safe, effective, and efficient with relatively few contraindications or complications [<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>-<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Recently this modality has also been explored in the acute traumatic setting in the treatment of upper and lower extremity injuries including hip and shoulder injuries, in addition to rib fractures [<xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>-<xref rid="REF16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>At this time, opioids remain the most common means of acute pain control and will no doubt remain a valuable adjunct in the treatment of acute injuries. Regional anesthesia has the ability to decrease the use of these medications, with many resultant benefits to both patients and providers, including improved pain control and decreased adverse effects such as delirium, sedation, hemodynamic effects, constipation, and nausea [<xref rid="REF17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="REF18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].&#x000a0;Taken further, this can also potentially be extrapolated to decreased length of hospital stay and decreased risk of opioid dependence and would be of particular interest in special populations such as pediatrics and geriatrics [<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="REF17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>-<xref rid="REF23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>Historically, regional nerve blocks have been performed using landmark-based techniques with or without the concomitant use of nerve stimulators.&#x000a0;In current literature, there is strong support for the use of ultrasound guidance alone or in combination with the use of nerve stimulators [<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>-<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. These techniques have been reported in EM literature for lower extremity applications within various healthcare systems around the world [<xref rid="REF22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>-<xref rid="REF26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. It has further been proposed that ultrasound-guided anesthesia could potentially be of utility in disaster and resource-poor settings [<xref rid="REF27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>Proficiency in regional anesthesia techniques for the femoral and popliteal nerves enables emergency room physicians to effectively manage pain, perform necessary procedures, and improve patient outcomes in a variety of emergency situations involving lower extremity injuries and trauma. At the core of ultrasound-guided peripheral nerve blocks is knowledge of the underlying neuroanatomy and the ability to reliably sonographically identify the appropriate structure.&#x000a0;Therefore, the primary objective of this study is to determine how many supervised peripheral nerve examinations are necessary for an EM physician to become proficient and confident in accurately locating and identifying the correct neuroanatomy of the lower extremity, specifically the femoral and popliteal (posterior tibial and peroneal) nerves. The number of such studies that would confer proficiency in correctly identifying the nerves of the lower extremity has yet to be established, though there has been some research aimed at teaching the overall fundamentals of the ultrasound-guided femoral nerve block [<xref rid="REF28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>-<xref rid="REF30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Therefore, this study focuses on providing more objective evidence regarding the number of supervised peripheral nerve examinations that are necessary to proficiently accomplish the crucial step of sonographically identifying the appropriate neuroanatomy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>This study was constructed as a prospective, interrupted, time-series design without a control group and was formally approved by the&#x000a0;Institutional Review Board prior to its implementation. The participants in the study were current residents enrolled in the ED&#x000a0;residency program at the University of South Florida Morsani College of Medicine&#x000a0;in Tampa, Florida. The study took place over the course of a year. The resident participation in this study was voluntary and informed consent was obtained prior to the start of the study. Due to the descriptive nature of this study, formal sample size calculations were not performed. The residency program enrolls 10 residents per year and is a three-year program.</p><p>Residents were given an introductory femoral and popliteal nerve block didactic lecture (approximately one hour in length) followed by two supervised hands-on ultrasound examinations for how to identify each nerve. Next, an initial objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) was performed to evaluate their ultrasound skills and ability to identify the femoral and popliteal nerves.&#x000a0;Over the next seven months, the residents were periodically re-evaluated via OSCE.&#x000a0;Participants did not undertake an additional review of ultrasound images from textbooks or online resources between the initial didactic session, supervised examinations, and subsequent assessments. Prior to performing each OSCE session, participants completed a self-assessment tool (Table <xref rid="TAB1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) regarding their confidence in correctly locating and identifying peripheral nerve anatomy with the use of ultrasound. Next, their ability to correctly locate and identify the peripheral nerves using ultrasound was confirmed by an emergency physician sonologist experienced in the visualization of peripheral nerves of the lower extremity.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="TAB1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Peripheral Nerve Study Self-Assessment Survey</title><p>For each exam above, please indicate your level of confidence in peripheral nerve identification, specific to the area being assessed, using ultrasound.</p><p>1- I always have difficulty</p><p>2 - I often have difficulty</p><p>3 - I sometimes have difficulty</p><p>4 - I rarely have difficulty</p><p>5 - I never have difficulty</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr style="background-color:#ccc"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Exam # Date</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">01</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">02</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">03</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">04</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">05</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">06</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">07</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">08</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">09</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">10</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">11</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">12</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">13</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">14</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">15</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">16</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">17</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">18</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">19</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">20</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Exam Type</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td></tr><tr style="background-color:#ccc"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Popliteal Nerves</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Femoral Nerve</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>The residents&#x02019; performance was recorded using a data collection tool (Table <xref rid="TAB2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).

The self-reported confidence ratings of each individual resident were marked prior to the completion of each OSCE examination for each nerve separately.&#x000a0;The value range of the confidence scale was set from 1 (not at all confident) to 5 (very confident).&#x000a0;The median level of confidence and range for popliteal and femoral nerves were 3.5 (1-5) and 3 (1-5), respectively.&#x000a0;This data was recorded and analyzed (Table <xref rid="TAB3" ref-type="table">3</xref>) with negative binomial regression for the outcome proficiency being performed to identify significantly associated variables.&#x000a0;Negative coefficients indicate an increase in proficiency.&#x000a0;Negative binomial regression identified a significant association between confidence and proficiency (P=0.009) and between years in practice and proficiency (P=0.010).</p><table-wrap position="float" id="TAB3"><label>Table 3</label><caption><title>Incidence Rate Ratios Based on Negative Binomial Regression Coefficients for Gender, Years in Practice, Confidence, and Nerve Type for 31 Residents</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr style="background-color:#ccc"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0; &#x000a0;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Incidence Rate Ratio (95% Confidence Interval)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">P-value</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Gender (vs. Female)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.94 (0.64-5.86)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.24</td></tr><tr style="background-color:#ccc"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Years in Practice (vs. 1 and 2)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.65 (0.19-2.23)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.49</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Years in Practice (vs. 3)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.07 (0.08-0.66)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.020</td></tr><tr style="background-color:#ccc"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Confidence</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.34 (0.80-2.22)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.27</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Nerve (vs. Popliteal)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.47 (0.18-1.18)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.11</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Proficiency in the identification of the peripheral nerves within the leg, specifically the femoral and popliteal nerves, was found to be attainable within a reasonably small number of proctored OSCEs following one hour of formalized training and two assisted ultrasound examinations. No further education was necessary to locate and successfully identify the femoral and popliteal nerves for 10 consecutive examinations for the majority of residents involved in this study. The maximum number of attempts at identifying the popliteal and femoral nerves 10 consecutive times by any participant was 21. The maximum number of assisted OSCE attempts to reach proficiency, per our definition of 100% accuracy in 10 consecutive examinations, for the popliteal and femoral nerves was 11, meaning that it took 11 examinations before the resident then went on to identify the popliteal nerve successfully in the next 10 examinations. This was the same for the femoral nerve. Eleven residents were unable to consecutively identify 10 popliteal nerves correctly from their first attempt, whereas only seven residents were unable to consecutively identify the femoral nerve 10 times from their first attempt. The study also found that the more years of training a resident had the more proficient they were in identifying the femoral and popliteal nerves correctly and consecutively.</p><p>As point-of-care ultrasound has become a standard in EM training, the various uses of this technology as well as the situations in which it may be utilized has expanded. This is especially true in regard to its use in procedures where ultrasound not only can increase the efficiency of the task at hand&#x000a0;but also decrease complications. Not surprisingly, previous studies regarding formalized education and proficiency in using bedside ultrasonography in the realm of regional anesthesia were most often found within the anesthesia literature [<xref rid="REF29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p>However, EM has more recently begun to do its part in contributing to this data. That being said, there has yet to be a formalized study that specifically concentrates on defining proficiency in the identification of the anatomy involved in these procedures. This is what our study set out to accomplish.</p><p>Currently, the ACEP&#x000a0;does not set a recommended standard of competency specific to regional anesthesia. As this procedure becomes more of an expected skillset in EM, it will become increasingly important to define the level at which a physician is deemed competent and capable of safely performing regional anesthesia. We believe that before a reasonable number of completed procedures to demonstrate competency is devised, formal education and evaluation of all aspects of these procedures, including simply locating the anatomical structures involved, is important.&#x000a0;Hands-on experience with real patients with direct supervision is also essential, as it not only facilitates skill acquisition but also builds confidence and competence in performing these procedures.</p><p>A small sample size is one limitation identified in this study. This resulted in only descriptive analysis of the data being possible due to&#x000a0;limited power in the number of participants that we had available to pull from. Being that the data was collected within a single academic year we were limited to 31 residents to participate in the study. That being said, the size of the EM residency at the University of South Florida Morsani College of Medicine&#x000a0;is similar to many other residency programs across the country. It should be noted that at the time of the study, an additional resident was present secondary to an interruption in training time for medical leave. A second limitation is&#x000a0;the potential for differences in technical skills due to varying levels of training.&#x000a0;We acknowledge that residents at different PGY levels may have differing baseline technical skills due to the cumulative experience and training acquired over the course of their residency.&#x000a0;Future studies could stratify participants by PGY level or include a pre-intervention skill assessment to better account for baseline differences. This would help further delineate the specific impact of supervised ultrasound training on skill acquisition.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Minimal supervised training is required before EM physicians can reliably identify the femoral and popliteal nerves by ultrasound. There is an association between years in practice and proficiency suggesting that this is reached more readily in individuals who already have basic ultrasound experience. Therefore, peripheral nerve identification and the task of providing regional anesthesia might be considered a more advanced application that is taught after an initial introductory ultrasound course and the development of basic ultrasound skills. It has been our experience that by using a structured training curriculum of didactic lectures and supervised hands-on practice, residents can become proficient and confident at identifying the femoral and popliteal nerves with the use of ultrasound after only a small amount of formalized instruction.</p><p>Regional anesthesia is a skill set within the realm of EM. The correct identification of neuronal structures by ultrasound is just the first step in teaching regional anesthesia. Before becoming proficient at performing regional nerve blocks, additional education and supervision are required, specifically in the areas of equipment selection, needle insertion techniques, the injection of regional anesthetic solutions and their pharmacokinetics, and patient safety.&#x000a0;Supervised practice on real patients is essential for physicians to develop proficiency in ultrasound-guided regional anesthesia. Identifying nerves in real time may present&#x000a0;greater challenges compared to an OSCE setting, as it requires navigating anatomical variations and mastering the technical complexities of needle guidance. A future study will aim to expand upon this study and serve to assess the physician&#x02019;s ability (number of procedures completed to define competency) to adequately perform lower extremity regional anesthesia following this additional education.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors extend their sincere gratitude to Dr. Branko Miladinovic for his invaluable assistance with the analytical methods employed in this manuscript.</p></ack><fn-group content-type="conflict"><title>Disclosures</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Human subjects:</bold> Consent for treatment and open access publication was obtained or waived by all participants in this study.
