So far most human studies have focused on bacteria while studies on host-associated fungi in health and disease have only recently started to accumulate. To enable cost-effective parallel analysis of bacterial and fungal communities in human and environmental samples, we developed a method where 16S rRNA gene and ITS1 amplicons were pooled together for a single Illumina MiSeq or HiSeq run and analysed after primer-based segregation. Taxonomic assignments were performed with Blast in combination with an iterative text-extraction-based filtration approach, which uses extensive literature records from public databases to select the most probable hits that were further validated by shotgun metagenomic sequencing.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par2">Using 50 vaginal samples, we show that the combined run provides comparable results on bacterial composition and diversity to conventional 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. The text-extraction-based taxonomic assignment-guided tool provided ecosystem-specific bacterial annotations that were confirmed by shotgun metagenomic sequencing (VIRGO, MetaPhlAn, Kraken2). Fungi were identified in 39/50 samples with ITS sequencing while in the metagenome data fungi largely remained undetected due to their low abundance and database issues. Co-abundance analysis of bacteria and fungi did not show strong between-kingdom correlations within the vaginal ecosystem of healthy women.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par3">Combined amplicon sequencing for bacteria and fungi provides a simple and cost-effective method for simultaneous analysis of microbiota and mycobiota within the same samples. Conventional metagenomic sequencing does not provide sufficient fungal genome coverage for their reliable detection in vaginal samples. Text extraction-based annotation tool facilitates ecosystem-specific characterization and interpretation of microbial communities by coupling sequence homology to microbe metadata readily available through public databases.</p><p id="Par500">

The fungal component of the microbiota, also called mycobiota, has a long history of research in mycorrhizal fungi and other environmental samples but has only recently gained interest as part of human commensal microbiota. Based on recent molecular studies, there are an estimated 10<sup>12</sup>&#x02013;10<sup>13</sup> fungi compared to 10<sup>13</sup>&#x02013;10<sup>14</sup> bacteria in the human microbiota, across the gastrointestinal tract, oral cavity, vaginal mucosa, and skin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The most abundant fungi colonizing humans belong to phyla Ascomycota and Basidiomycota. The common fungal genera found in the human mouth, gut, skin, lungs, and vagina in healthy individuals as well as in selected diseases have been extensively reviewed elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Fungi can interact with the host as well as the rest of the microbiota in both mutualistic and antagonistic ways, highlighting their relevance for human health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par5">For the vaginal ecosystem, the bacterial composition is well described. For most healthy women, it typically consists of one or two <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> species, namely <italic>L. crispatus, L. iners, L. gasseri,</italic> or <italic>L. jensenii,</italic> while the presence of <italic>Gardnerella vaginalis</italic> and an assortment of other, typically anaerobic species is indicative of dysbiosis and prevail, e.g. in bacterial vaginosis (BV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Different lactobacilli have distinct but only partially characterized roles in the vaginal ecosystem, with <italic>L. crispatus</italic> being the most protective for health and <italic>L. iners</italic> the least [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> species detected in the human vagina are genomically and functionally distinct [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and their abundance and prevalence are associated with various female health outcomes and characterise the well-established vaginal community state types (CSTs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Hence, species-level identification is a mandatory attempt to study the bacterial microbiota of this ecosystem.</p><p id="Par6">The fungal component of the vaginal ecosystem is poorly characterized, as after the pioneering research of Drell et al. in 2013 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] where they characterized the vaginal mycobiota of 251 and microbiota of 494 women, progress has been slow. Only a handful of original papers have been published on the vaginal mycobiota, yet it has been associated with various diseases, most obviously yeast infections, but also with vulvodynia, bacterial dysbiosis, and cervical dysplasia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Despite the clear relevance of fungi and interest in cross-kingdom studies, there are limited tools available for such analyses. While metagenomics, i.e. whole genome shotgun sequencing (WGS) in principle allows sequencing of entire microbial communities, in practice the low relative abundance of fungi (e.g. in the vagina in the range of 0.17&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.04%, if detected at all [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and in the gut 0.01% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]), is a hindrance for a cost-effective analysis. For over 20 years, the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of fungi has been used for their molecular analysis. Currently, there is a rapidly growing number of studies that have processed and sequenced both 16S rRNA gene and ITS amplicons separately for parallel characterization of fungal and bacterial communities in the same samples. In biomedical research, these include studies addressing the impact of sample storage and DNA extraction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], descriptive compositional analyses of human samples in cross-sectional [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and longitudinal settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], and their correlation to (disease) phenotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. To our knowledge, there were no other similar studies present at the time of our initial submission in 2021 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-321778/v1">https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-321778/v1</ext-link>.), however, during the review process of our resubmission in 2023, another study was published that utilised a similar methodology to simultaneously obtain both bacterial and fungal profiles from oral samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">Investigating the microbiota of a taxonomically homogenous community, such as the vaginal microbiota consisting of one or few species of functionally distinct <italic>Lactobacillus</italic>, makes it necessary to seek species-level taxonomic annotations. At present, most amplicon sequencing workflows employ sequence homology as the primary criterion for taxonomic classification and make use of curated databases to improve performance and accuracy such as SILVA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], RDP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], GreenGenes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] and UNITE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. However, distinguishing closely related taxa at the species level can be impossible or unreliable with limited amplicon sizes especially when using sequence homology alone. While curated databases are an excellent resource, they tend to be incomplete or prone to mis-annotations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Alternatively, the BLAST alignment tool is extensively used alongside the NCBI nucleotide (nt) and/or the curated 16S rRNA gene/ITS databases for taxonomic annotations. The resulting annotation hits are coupled with extensive sequence alignment metrics such as &#x02018;bitscore,&#x02019; &#x02018;percentage identity,&#x02019; and &#x02018;query coverage,&#x02019; which may be identical between multiple hits representing several distinct taxa. In most cases, extensive post-alignment curation is necessary to select the best hits based on known ecological and biological information.</p><p id="Par8">To address the need for affordable and robust methods to also study the fungi of the human microbiota alongside bacteria, we developed a parallel amplicon sequencing technique that combines the bacterial 16S rRNA gene and the fungal ITS1 region in a single Illumina sequencing run. Here, we study the feasibility and performance of this method by applying it to vaginal samples from 50 healthy women and characterizing their bacterial and fungal profiles, with shotgun metagenomics as a reference. In addition, we developed a custom text mining-based filtration approach to facilitate species-level annotations from amplicon sequencing data.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Sample collection and processing</title><p id="Par9">We sampled 50 non-pregnant Caucasian women aged 25&#x02013;45 years attending population-based cervical cancer screening as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. The exclusion criteria were vaginal intercourse 48 h prior to sampling, pregnancy, previous hysterectomy, and the inability to tell the time of the last menstrual period. Detailed subject characteristics have been previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. All samples were collected with a sterile flocked swab (FLOQSwabs, Copan spa, Italy) from the right fornix of the vagina during a speculum exam.

This sequencing run was done using paired-end mode (PE250 kit) and Illumina HiSeq as detailed previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. For the parallel sequencing approach, the 16S rRNA gene and ITS amplicons were generated separately from the previously extracted frozen DNA and pooled for barcoding.</p><p id="Par11">For bacteria, we used the same 16S rRNA gene primers for V3&#x02013;V4 region as before, specifically 341F 5&#x02032;-CCTACGGGNGGCWGCAG-3&#x02032; and 785Rev 5&#x02032;-GACTACHVGGGTATCTAATCC-3&#x02032; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].

However, during the review and revision process, another article was published with a similar approach for buccal samples collected from four intubated ICU patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Song et al. used different target regions for bacterial and fungal DNA and performed the annotations without splitting the data into fungal and bacterial reads. Previously, Kittelman et al. reported a pyrosequencing approach that combined analysis of phylogenetic marker genes for bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotic micro-organisms in ruminal samples, and Coller et al. combined 16S rRNA gene and fungal ITS1 amplicons to an Illumina MiSeq run to study soil samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. In addition, many studies have generated 16S rRNA gene and fungal ITS amplicons in the same samples, but the analyses were done separately [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. Kits for single library constructions for bacteria and fungi are also commercially available (at least from Swift, Qiagen and Perkin Elmer), but the costs per sample are substantially higher and hence our method provides a cost-effective option for laboratories that process high sample volumes and possess the basic expertise for library preparation for multiplex sequencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. Our protocol where the pooling of bacterial and fungal amplicons takes place already before indexing (after the locus-specific PCRs), saves time and costs as all downstream steps occur in a single well. The use of the same barcodes for bacterial and fungal amplicons further simplifies the design and improves the efficiency especially when there are a limited number of barcodes available. Overall, the method provides combined profiling for both bacteria and fungi with little added cost compared to ordinary 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The 16S rRNA gene and ITS reads can be separated easily with publicly available bioinformatic tools like cutadapt that were used here and were the only additional step in pre-processing. Comparisons to conventional 16S rRNA gene amplicon and metagenomic sequencing demonstrated that the newly developed method produced highly comparable results for bacterial compositions and there was a high degree of reproducibility between the results despite some methodological differences (HiSeq vs MiSeq, PE250 vs. PE300 chemistry) as possible source of variation. It should be noted that for successful simultaneous analysis of bacterial and fungal communities from the same sample, also efficient cell disruption is required to retrieve representative DNA for further analysis. We used a bead-beating method for DNA extraction that has been previously shown to perform well in disrupting the rigid cell walls of fungi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. It should be noted that when setting up the system, it is advisable to test whether the chosen sample type and/or PCR mastermix will allow for a lower number of PCR cycles without compromising the PCR yields. For sample types that have fungal species with ITS1 regions substantially longer than the sequencing read length it is advisable to use the forward reads only or consider long-read sequencing.</p><sec id="Sec16"><title>Text-mining-based annotation and prioritization of hits</title><p id="Par37">At present, most amplicon sequencing workflows employ sequence homology as the primary criterion for taxonomic classification that especially with partial 16S rRNA gene sequences may fail in reliable species-level identification.

A further challenge in metagenome-based taxonomic annotations is large, non-dedicated databases, such as the pre-compiled PlusPF database from Kraken2, where fungal reads may be sequestered by other (micro) eukaryotes, which highlights the need for alternative methods to reliably identify fungal communities in host-associated ecosystems. The yield for fungal reads within the vaginal metagenomes was 0.08 to&#x02009;&#x02212;&#x02009;0.17% in our study and 0.17&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.04% in the VIRGO study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Eukaryotic genomes are also significantly larger and much more complex compared to prokaryotes, which further hinders metagenome analysis, especially with a restricted set of reference databases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. Even with amplicon data that provide a more targeted approach for fungal profiling, the analysis of fungi is much more challenging than that of bacteria, e.g. due to the natural length polymorphism of ITS1 region that may complicate both the actual sequencing and subsequent bioinformatic analyses. Apart from <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> being detected in two samples and <italic>C. albicans</italic> in one sample with deep sequencing, there were no consistent and/or biologically plausible positive hits in the WGS data while 29 unique fungal species were detected across the 50 samples by ITS1 amplicon sequencing. When considering the possibility of contamination or other artefacts of the ITS1 amplicon data, it should be noted that we used the same DNA extracts for both metagenomic and amplicon sequencing, and our negative, non-template PCR control yielded only 10 ITS1 reads after preprocessing compared to a mean of 5700 reads for vaginal samples. Moreover, the ITS1 primers have been used for two decades and represent the gold standard for the analysis of fungi. Their performance has been previously validated with mock communities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. Moreover, 3/29 fungal species (<italic>C. cladosporioides, A. alternata, E. nigrum</italic>) that we detected with ITS1 sequencing, have previously been cultured from the cervicovaginal samples of healthy giant pandas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. Representativeness of all the prevalent (&#x02265;&#x02009;10%) fungal genera detected in this study with the ITS1 amplicon data, i.e. <italic>Candida, Cladosporium, Malassezia, Alternaria and Epicoccum</italic> were also detected in the single previous study so far using ITS1 amplicons to investigate the mycobiota in human vaginal samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], as well as in the perianal and genital area of infants using ITS2 amplicons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. Other fungal studies on human vaginal samples so far have used ITS2 amplicons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] or ITS (from ITS1 to ITS2) and each reported various non-<italic>Candida</italic> species despite various cell lysis and bioinformatic protocols. Together these results strongly support the view that the human reproductive tract mycobiota consists of various fungi, not just <italic>C. albicans.</italic> However, the fungal NGS results should be validated with independent methods.</p><p id="Par42">In metagenome analysis, there were no clear benefits of deeper sequencing since we observed very similar fungal profiles, which confirmed our previous findings. Our results and conclusions on the higher accuracy and much better cost-effectiveness of fungal profiles obtained with ITS1 amplicon data compared to the WGS data are in line with previous papers on 1772 stool samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>] as well as with a comprehensive study on bioaerosol fungi analysed through ITS1, ITS2, metagenome and culturing approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. Together these results show that even in this era of relatively low-cost shotgun metagenomic sequencing, amplicon sequencing still has the edge when studying complex low-abundance communities. On the other hand, large public WGS datasets can be used for the mining of bacteria of interest including pathogens to produce prevalence estimates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>], but for clinical studies, and especially pathogen-focused ones, separate validated and inexpensive testing protocols can be recommended instead or in addition to WGS detection.</p><p id="Par43">With the lack of studies focusing on fungi, deposited fungal sequences with valid human isolation sources are also scarce. In our samples only <italic>C. Albicans</italic>, a well-characterized pathogenic yeast responsible for vulvovaginal candidiasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], was identified from vaginal samples. The remaining annotations were traced back to either the gut (<italic>Aspergillus spp.</italic>), skin (<italic>Malassezia spp.</italic> And <italic>Cladosporium spp.</italic>), or other clinical isolates (<italic>S. Cerevisiae</italic>, <italic>Schizophyllum spp.</italic>). Of these annotations, <italic>Cladosporium spp.</italic> was questionable due to the uncertainty surrounding their isolation sources. On one hand, the metadata for <italic>Cladosporium spp.</italic> annotation hits indicate that they were isolated from clinical human samples and certain species have been associated with human and animal infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]. On the other hand, they are also widely recognized as household fungi and are shown to be a consistent environmental contaminant in fungal studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>].due to the scarcity of information on the vaginal fungal communities and their potential associations to clinical and other host factors, we conducted the same permanova analysis for fungal profiles as previously done for the bacterial microbiota of the same samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. We found no host-related variables to be strongly associated with the fungal abundance profiles while probiotic use and education were the strongest factors explaining bacterial variation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Because of the small sample size of a healthy cohort, further studies with larger clinical and/or phenotypic variation are needed to study the potential interactions between the two kingdoms in the vaginal microbiota. To understand their ecology, information on ribosomal copy number variation and/or absolute abundances should be incorporated to estimate the abundance of each taxon more reliably.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par44">The main outcomes of this work are (1) development and validation of a novel cost-effective method for simultaneous amplicon sequencing for bacteria and fungi; (2) development of a novel annotation approach for microbial amplicon sequencing data where the conventional homology-based search is combined with text mining for knowledge-based selection of ecosystem-specific hits; (3) novel insights into the human vaginal ecosystem through the description of the mycobiota.</p><p id="Par45">Our sequencing method should also be directly applicable to environmental sciences, agriculture, biotechnology, food technology, and any other field of science where studying bacterial and fungal populations is of particular interest. Due to the customizable nature of the text mining-based filtration approach, it can be adapted to a multitude of ecosystems under investigation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>
