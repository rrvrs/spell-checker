Although SAA is rare entity, it is the third most common visceral artery aneurysm, accounting 40&#x02013;60&#x000a0;% following aneurysm of abdominal aorta and iliac artery [<xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. SAA affect between 1 1000 to 1 in 2500 [<xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Histologically it is of two types: True SAA and Pseudo-SAA. Modifiable risk factors such as atherosclerosis, portal hypertension, trauma and chronic pancreatitis conditions contribute to SAA [<xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Small SAAs (&#x02264;2&#x000a0;cm) are asymptomatic and found incidentally during radiological interventions for other issues, whereas giant SAAs (&#x02265;5&#x000a0;cm) often present with vague symptoms leading ultimately to complications [<xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. SAAs can be diagnosed radiologically and treated by open surgery, laparoscopic surgery, endovascular therapy, or a hybrid approach depending upon aneurysm's type, size, location and symptoms [<xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="s0010"><label>2</label><title>Case report</title><p id="p0025">A 58-year-old, previously healthy male referred to our center, with three and half month history of back tarry stool and abdominal pain. Initially, patient experienced 2 to 3 episodes of black tarry stool per day over the course of three days, for which he was evaluated at local clinic with endoscopy and colonoscopy. After evaluating reports, she was diagnosed as erosive gastritis and was managed with antacids and proton pump inhibitors (PPI) (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). The patient remained asymptomatic for 2&#x000a0;months after which he experienced vague epigastric discomfort. Pain was intermittent type, relieved on its own, severe in intensity without radiation to other sites. The pain has no any relations with food intake and it was not relieved by medications. Other common causes of upper GI bleeding, such as peptic ulcer disease, esophageal varices, gastritis, Mallory-Weiss tear, or malignancies, are less likely as the patient lacks a history of chronic medication use, liver disease, coagulopathies, trauma, or other relevant risk factors. Prior to this patient has no history of trauma and drug intake other than antacids and PPI. Apart for this, he also gives history of light-headness and syncopal attack.<fig id="f0005"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Upper-gastrointestinal endoscopy, showing normal fundus, normal D1 and D2 mucosa and multiple erosions in body/antrum (shown by white arrow).</p></caption><alt-text id="al0005">Fig. 1</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="gr1" id="lk0005"/></fig><fig id="f0010"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Ileo-colonoscopy showing normal colonic mucosa.</p></caption><alt-text id="al0010">Fig. 2</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="gr2" id="lk0010"/></fig></p><p id="p0030">During his emergency visit, he was asked to do blood investigations and ultrasonography of abdomen. Blood reports revealed normal Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), Alanine transferase (ALT) and PT/INR but hemoglobin was 7&#x000a0;g% for which he was given 6 pints of blood. On USG, approximately 4&#x000a0;&#x02217;&#x000a0;4&#x000a0;cm size mass was present on pancreas, raising concern for further investigation. Then, he was asked to perform computed tomography (CT) of abdomen, which revealed 3.5&#x000a0;&#x02217;&#x000a0;4&#x000a0;cm size hematoma and extravasation of contrast into the adjacent bowel loop suggestive of enteric fistula (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). To identify the source of bleeding, a CT angiography was done, which uncovered 1.88&#x000a0;&#x02217;&#x000a0;1.45&#x000a0;cm size splenic aneurysm (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, <xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). Furthermore, CT revealed isolated dissection of the celiac artery with extension of the dissection flap into splenic artery ostium, which suggest probable communication of the splenic artery from the false lumen with presence of large partially thrombosed aneurysm from its proximal segment.<fig id="f0015"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Contrast computed tomography showing outpouching of approximate 1.88&#x000a0;cm&#x000a0;&#x02217;&#x000a0;1.45&#x000a0;cm and hypo-dense area of 3.5&#x000a0;cm&#x000a0;&#x02217;&#x000a0;4&#x000a0;cm around outpouching.</p></caption><alt-text id="al0015">Fig. 3</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="gr3" id="lk0015"/></fig><fig id="f0020"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>CT-angiography and 3D-reconstruction showing splenic artery aneurysm.</p></caption><alt-text id="al0020">Fig. 4</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="gr4" id="lk0020"/></fig></p><p id="p0035">For this, he underwent splenic artery embolization and hepatic artery stenting, followed by close monitoring in medical ICU for five days. The ICU stay was uneventful and showed remarkable improvement. Upon discharge, he was advised to follow up in three months. However, just in 12&#x000a0;days of discharge, he once again experienced melena, hematemesis and severe epigastric pain. This necessitated a repeat embolization of splenic artery (<xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). However, his symptoms didn't improve and he was planned for splenectomy. After being thoroughly informed about life after splenectomy, the patient received vaccination. With the consent of patient and splenectomy with ligation of splenic artery was done.<fig id="f0025"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>Image showing splenic artery embolization.</p></caption><alt-text id="al0025">Fig. 5</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="gr5" id="lk0025"/></fig></p><p id="p0040">His postoperative recovery was smooth and without complications. He was discharged on 7th postoperative day. He is on regular follow up appointments and remains completely asymptomatic.</p></sec><sec id="s0015"><label>3</label><title>Discussion</title><p id="p0045">Splenic artery aneurysm is the 3rd most common subtype of visceral artery aneurysm which is characterized by focal dilation of splenic artery by &#x0003e;50&#x000a0;% than normal vessel diameter [<xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. This rare entity was first elaborated in 1770 by Beaussier in autopsies. Histopathologically, it is divided into 2 types: True SAA and Pseudo-SAA. True-SAA involves all fours layers of arterial wall while pseudo-SAA involves just one or two layers [<xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The incidence of SAA ranges from 0.09&#x000a0;% in autopsies to 0.78&#x000a0;% on arteriography which increases significantly to 10&#x000a0;% in elderly population [<xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p id="p0050">SAA is a rare entity with relatively unknown etio-pathogenesis. Atherosclerosis, portal hypertension, abdominal trauma, chronic pancreatitis, liver transplantation, pregnancy, fibromuscular dysplasia or connective tissue disorder like Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and Marfan syndrome are considered as modifiable risk factors of SAA [<xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Peptic ulcer disease is the rarest cause of splenic artery aneurysm [<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Elderly age and female gender are considered as non-modifiable risk factor of SAA. Pancreatitis and direct splenic artery trauma are considered as main causes of pseudo-SAA [<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p id="p0055">True-SAAs are remains asymptomatic unless they rupture or reach to a giant (&#x02265;5&#x000a0;cm) size whereas pseudo-SAA are often symptomatic because of their large size. Risk of rupture of true-SAAs is very low (2&#x02013;3&#x000a0;%) whereas it is seriously high for pseudo-SAAs (37&#x02013;47&#x000a0;%) leading to mortality in 90&#x000a0;% cases [<xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Only 5&#x000a0;% of patients becomes symptomatic and among them only 10&#x000a0;% present with upper gastrointestinal bleeding (hematochezia, hematemesis). Patient might experience vague abdominal symptoms like abdominal pain in epigastric or left upper quadrant region, sensation of fullness, nausea, vomiting or unexplained weight loss [<xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, in severe cases, patient might present with hemodynamic instability and life threatening shock because of massive intraperitoneal bleeding after rupture of aneurysm. In our case, despite SAA not having ruptured, patient presented with bleeding manifestations. It was due to pressure exerted by aneurysm on coeliac artery leading to dissection and subsequently gastrointestinal bleeding.</p><p id="p0060">The rarity and their nonspecific symptoms poses significant challenges in diagnosing SAAs. Though SAAs are hard to diagnose, Angiography followed by computed tomography (CT) and USG are widely performed for diagnosis [<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Ultrasonography is the first choice diagnostic tool in pregnancy [<xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) is considered as gold standard for diagnosis and management as it allows trans-catheter embolization. Early diagnosis can prevent rupture of aneurysm and subsequent life-threatening hemodynamic instability and mortality. In our case, aneurysm was diagnosed after CT angiography.</p><p id="p0065">There is always constant threat of spontaneous rupture of aneurysm, especially of pseudo-SAA. Therefore, timely treatment is crucial for both symptomatic as wells as asymptomatic SAAs. There are no well established guidelines for treatment. Mode of treatment completely depends upon severity of symptoms, age, sex, morphology, location of aneurysm and complications. Endovascular technique such as trans-catheter embolization, percutaneous injection, and endovascular stent graft are the first-line preferred treatment for SAA due to their lower morbidity [<xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The rationale for embolization before splenectomy is to achieve hemodynamic stability, minimize surgical risks, and facilitate safer surgery by reducing blood flow to the spleen, ultimately improving patient outcomes. However, open abdominal surgery remains the gold standard treatment, usually reserved for failure of endovascular interventions and complications. Surgical procedure includes splenic artery ligation, aneurysmectomy and splenectomy [<xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Our patient was managed with splenectomy after two unsuccessful splenic embolization intervention.</p></sec><sec id="s0020"><label>4</label><title>Conclusion</title><p id="p0070">The rarity and atypical presentation like upper GI bleeding of SAA creates diagnosis difficulty leading to high mortality. Early diagnosis with imaging techniques and timely appropriate treatment with embolization or splenectomy are crucial for better prognosis and preventing severe complications.</p></sec><sec id="s0025"><title>Author contribution</title><p id="p0075">Dr. Bishal Budha: Writing, Original draft preparation, Editing, Study Concept.</p><p id="p0080">Dr. Narayan Neupane: Editing, Study Concept.</p><p id="p0085">Dr. Bishweshwar Joshi: Writing and original draft preparation.</p><p id="p0090">Dr. Dhiraj Poudel: Manuscript reviewer.</p><p id="p0095">Dr. Rajan Budha: Manuscript reviewer.</p><p id="p0100">All authors have read and agreed to the final version of the manuscript.</p></sec><sec id="s0030"><title>Consent</title><p id="p0105">Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and accompanying images.
