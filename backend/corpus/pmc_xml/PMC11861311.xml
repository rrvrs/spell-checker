The significance of NFIX in the development of various cancers has been demonstrated by an increasing number of studies in recent years. However, the role of NFIX in breast cancer has received less attention. This study investigates its expression in breast cancer and its function in inhibiting cell cycle progression. NFIX is downregulated in breast cancer compared to normal breast tissue, which impacts prognosis. In vitro and in vivo Experiments have shown that the overexpression of NIFX leads to a delay in the G2/M phase, which inhibits breast cancer cell proliferation. It thus plays a role as a tumor suppressor in breast cancer development. In terms of mechanism, upregulating NFIX causes CDK1 to be more susceptible to ubiquitination-mediated degradation. NFIX also competitively represses CDK1 transcription via YBX1. Moreover, NFIX expression in breast cancer is associated with methylation of its promoter region. Our study demonstrated that NFIX plays a critical role in CDK1-regulated cell cycle transitions and determined that NFIX inhibits cell proliferation in breast cancer.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Cell growth</kwd><kwd>Breast cancer</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China (National Science Foundation of China)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>82172827</award-id><award-id>82172835</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yu</surname><given-names>Yue</given-names></name><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Xin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Cell Death Differentiation Association (ADMC) 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Breast cancer has become one of the major cancers affecting women&#x02019;s health worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Although treatment modalities such as surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, targeted therapy, and endocrine therapy have dramatically improved the prognosis of breast cancer, many patients, particularly those with advanced stages of the disease, still face a poor prognosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. We still do not fully understand the molecular pathogenesis of breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Therefore, an in-depth study of the molecular mechanism underlying abnormal gene expression in breast cancer progression, as well as the discovery of biomarkers and efficient therapeutic targets related to this progression, holds great scientific and clinical value for improving the survival expectancy of breast cancer patients and achieving precise treatment of the disease.</p><p id="Par3">The Nuclear Factor I (NFI) gene family was initially identified based on a purified protein from human HeLa cells that plays a role in the in vitro replication of adenovirus DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The human NFI family comprises four related factors: NFIA, NFIB, NFIC, and NFIX [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Over the last few decades, members of the NFI family have been shown to regulate cell proliferation and differentiation in multiple organs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In addition, other research indicates that the NFI gene is closely associated with the development of various types of cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Song et al. found that NFIA shows higher expression levels in astrocytoma and is strongly associated with disease prognosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Dooley et al. demonstrated that NFIB is distinctly expressed in human small-cell lung cancer, regulating the apoptosis and proliferation of cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Conversely, NFIX expression is diminished in non-small cell lung carcinoma, serving as an independent prognostic indicator of poor outcomes, although no significant differences have been observed in other lung cancer subtypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Currently, research on the role of NFIX in breast cancer remains limited, and its molecular mechanisms are not yet fully elucidated.</p><p id="Par4">The cell cycle encompasses the period from the conclusion of one cell division to the termination of the subsequent division, and it is traditionally segmented into interphase and metaphase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Abnormal cell division, caused by cell cycle disorders, is a hallmark of cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) were initially identified in the 20th century through an investigation involving yeast cells and embryonic extracts, leading to the elucidation of their mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. CDKs are highly conserved Ser/Thr protein kinases that are crucial for the regulation of the cell cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. CDK1 is an important member of CDKs involved in controlling events such as DNA replication, mRNA transcription and translation, DNA repair, and cellular morphogenesis, and is closely associated with breast cancer development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Notably, CDK1 is involved in the G2 to M phase transition and mitotic initiation of the cell cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. CDK1 forms a complex with its regulator, Cyclin B1. Upon activation of this complex, CDK1 regulates multiple substrate proteins through phosphorylation, thereby directing cells into mitosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Therefore, Identifying genes that can regulate CDK1 is essential for elucidating the cell cycle regulatory network.</p><p id="Par5">In this study, we examined the role of NFIX in breast cancer progression and the underlying molecular mechanisms. NFIX exhibits decreased expression in breast cancer cells, and it impedes breast cancer progression by targeting CDK1 and triggering a G2/M cell cycle arrest. These results offer a molecular foundation for future research into novel therapeutic targets and prognostic markers.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>NFIX is downregulated in breast cancer and is related to survival</title><p id="Par6">The expression levels of the NFI family in different cancers were analyzed using the TCGA database. NFI family showed abnormal expression in many cancers. Among all NFI members, the expression of NFIX was noticeably lower in breast cancer (Fig. <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). To understand the role of NFIX in breast cancer and its potential as a therapeutic target, we first examined the RNA sequencing data of breast cancer (BC) from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We found that NFIX was significantly downregulated in breast cancer samples compared with adjacent normal samples (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1A</xref>). We then analyzed NFIX expression in 20 paired breast cancer tissues using RT-qPCR and immunohistochemistry experiments and found lower levels of NFIX expression in BC tissues compared with normal tissues, confirming the results in the database (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1B, C</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>High NFIX expression predicts favorable outcomes in patients with breast cancer.</title><p><bold>A</bold> The NFIX expression levels in invasive breast carcinoma and normal tissues. <bold>B</bold> Expression of NFIX mRNA in 20 paired breast cancer tissues. <bold>C</bold> The protein expression levels of NFIX in breast cancer tissues and paired normal tissues according to IHC. <bold>D</bold> Kaplan&#x02013;Meier analysis of disease-free survival in patients with different NFIX expression levels in 46 cases randomly selected from breast cancer paraffin specimens in our hospital. <bold>E</bold>, <bold>F</bold> Kaplan&#x02013;Meier analysis of the disease-free survival and overall survival in patients with different NFIX mRNA expression levels in TCGA database patients with breast cancer, as determined using KM plotter.

These patients contain complete clinicopathological information. The expression of NFIX was detected by IHC staining, and the relationship between the expression of NIFX and the prognosis of patients was analyzed. Based on the expression levels, we categorized the patients into two expression groups: high (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;19) and low (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;27) NFIX expression. According to Kaplan&#x02013;Meier (KM) curve analysis, patients in the high-expression NFIX group outlived those in the low-expression group in terms of disease-free survival (DFS) (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.032, Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1D</xref>). The data from breast cancer patients were then analyzed using a KM plotter (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://kmplot.com/analysis">http://kmplot.com/analysis</ext-link>). The results indicated that patients with high NFIX expression had better DFS and overall survival (OS) compared with those in the low expression group (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1E, F</xref>). These findings suggest that NFIX is expressed at lower levels in breast cancer and high expression is associated with better DFS and OS.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>NFIX expression in breast cancer is regulated by methylation of its promoter region</title><p id="Par8">Previous studies have reported a close correlation between NFIX gene expression and DNA methylation of its promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. To examine the potential relationship between DNA methylation and NFIX expression in breast cancer, we utilized cBioPortal (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cbioportal.org/">http://www.cbioportal.org/</ext-link>) to study the correlation between NFIX and the methylation status of its promoter. The findings indicated that NFIX expression and methylation regulation had the strongest association (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2A</xref>). The Meth Primer online tool (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.urogene.org/methprimer/">http://www.urogene.org/methprimer/</ext-link>) revealed that the NFIX promoter region (&#x02212;1355/&#x02212;1050) contains a long-range CpG island, which may be regulated by methylation (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>). BSP sequencing was employed to determine the methylation status of the NFIX promoter in two paired cases of breast cancer tissues and breast cancer cell lines (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2C, D</xref>). The results suggest that the expression of NFIX in breast cancer may correlate with the degree of methylation of the NFIX promoter.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><title>DNA methylation of NFIX in breast cancer cells.</title><p><bold>A</bold> The correlation between NFIX expression and DNA methylation. <bold>B</bold> The CpG islands in the promoter region of NFIX predicted by the Meth primer website. <bold>C</bold> The methylation status of NFIX detected by BSP sequencing in breast cancer cell lines. <bold>D</bold> The methylation status of NFIX detected by BSP sequencing in paired breast cancer tissues. <bold>E</bold> The NFIX expression levels detected by qRT-PCR and western blot analysis after treatment of MCF 10A cells, MCF7 cells, and MDA-MB-231 cells with AZA in a dose escalation gradient.

The levels of NFIX expression were verified by quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) and immunoblotting analysis. We found higher methylation in the proximal promoter region of NFIX in MCF7 cell lines, which exhibit lower NFIX expression. In contrast, we observed, we observed lower methylation in the proximal promoter region of NFIX in the MCF10A cell line, which has higher NFIX expression. In MDA-MB-231 cells, low concentrations of AZA have no effect on the expression of NFIX, while high concentrations of AZA can also cause significant changes in NFIX expression (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2E</xref>). To summarize, the methylation level of NFIX in breast cancer increases, leading to its downregulation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Overexpression of NFIX inhibits breast cancer cell proliferation</title><p id="Par10">To investigate the role of NFIX in breast cancer proliferation, we examined its expression of NFIX in normal breast cell lines and breast cancer cell lines. The RT-qPCR results indicated that NFIX was expressed at low levels in breast cancer, with the lowest expression observed in the MCF7 cell line compared to the other cell lines (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3A</xref>). Therefore, we infected MCF7 cells with an NFIX overexpression vector or an empty lentiviral plasmid to construct stable NFIX overexpression cell lines (MCF7-NFIX) and control cells (MCF7-Vector). Western blotting confirmed that NFIX was effectively overexpressed (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>). Proliferation assays revealed that overexpression of NFIX could inhibit the cell viability in vitro, with consistent results obtained from the MTT assay (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3C</xref>), colony formation assay (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3D</xref>), and EdU assay (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3E</xref>). Moreover, the flow cytometry results showed that NFIX overexpression reduced the cell proliferation rate (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3F</xref>). Next, we further validated the role of NFIX in breast cancer proliferation through in vivo animal experiments. The MCF7-NFIX cells and MCF7 Vector cells were implanted into the fat pad of NSG mice, and tumor growth was recorded at regular intervals. Overexpression of NFIX in MCF7 cells significantly inhibited tumor growth in vivo (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3G, H</xref>). IHC staining revealed that the expression of Ki-67 and c-Myc was down-regulated in tumors from MCF7-NFIX mice compared to MCF7-Vector mice (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3I</xref>). To better validate this result, we transfected MDA-MB-231 and CAL51 cells with vectors expressing NFIX small hairpin RNA or negative control RNA to obtain stable NFIX-downregulated cell lines (231-shNFIX, CAL51-shNFIX) and control cells (231-shControl, CAL51-shControl). The results showed that the downregulation of NFIX promoted the growth of breast cancer cells (Fig. <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S2</xref>).

To further investigate the functions of NFIX in the breast cancer cell cycle, we performed a cell synchronization experiment using MCF7-NFIX and MCF7-Vector cells to analyze the cell cycle transitions. We used the thymidine nocodazole cell cycle synchronization method to synchronize breast cancer cells in the G1/S phase. Cell cycle analysis was conducted at 0, 4, 8, 12, and 16&#x02009;h following cell cycle release. The proportion of cells in the G2/M phase was considerably higher in the MCF7-NFIX group than in the NFIX-Vector group (57.80 vs. 31.45%, Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4A</xref>). Immunofluorescence staining showed an increase in the number of metaphase cells and a decrease in the number of telophase cells among the MCF7-NFIX cells compared to MCF7-Vector cells at 12&#x02009;h following cell cycle release (Figs. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4B</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S3</xref>). Additionally, Cyclin D1 expression was higher than that of the control group at 4&#x02009;h of release, according to western blots, while Cyclin B1 expression in the NFIX overexpression group was significantly lower than that of the control group at 6&#x02013;8&#x02009;h of release (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4C</xref>).

The tissue sections were placed in an oven with a constant temperature of 60&#x02009;&#x000b0;C overnight and dewaxed, followed by antigen retrieval and blocking of endogenous peroxidases. The corresponding antibodies were dripped onto each tissue section and incubated overnight at 4&#x02009;&#x000b0;C. After washing with PBS, DAB chromogenic kit and hematoxylin were used for staining, ethanol, and xylene solution were used for dehydration, and neutral gum was used for sealing. The expression levels of NFIX, CDK1, Ki-67, and c-Myc were evaluated based on the product of the staining intensity score and positive cell percentage score. Intensity score: 0 points for no positive expression, 1 point for positive expression, 2 points for moderate positive expression, and 3 points for strong positive expression. Percentage score: No positive tissue expression was 0 point, 1&#x02013;25% of tissue was 1 point, 26&#x02013;50% of tissue was 2 points, 51&#x02013;75% of tissue was 3 points, and more than 75% of tissue was 4 points.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Xenograft</title><p id="Par37">After acclimatizing female IL2 receptor ineffective (NSG) mice for 4&#x02013;6 weeks, the weight baseline of the mice was measured.
