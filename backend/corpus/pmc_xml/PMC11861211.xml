Considering that when surveys began in 1947, the remaining life expectancy was 50.06&#x000a0;years for men and 53.96&#x000a0;years for women, the lifespan of Japanese people has extended by more than 30&#x000a0;years over the past 77&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. This extension in lifespan has propelled Japan to become the country with the highest life expectancy in the world. At the same time, it has also highlighted the issue of elderly care needs. According to the Long-Term Care Insurance Business Situation Report (2024, provisional version) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], the number of individuals certified as requiring care (including those needing support) has significantly increased from 2.56 million in 2000 to 6.94 million at the end of 2022.</p><p id="Par7">Regarding the reasons for becoming disabled and requiring care or support, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare reported in its most recent National Livelihood Survey [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] that joint disorders rank fifth among the causes. However, when focusing specifically on the reasons for requiring support, joint disorders consistently ranked first [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. This suggests that osteoarthritis (OA) the most common joint disorder, is frequently observed in the early stages of care dependency. Therefore, early detection and preventive measures against these conditions can significantly improve the quality of life for older adults. However, early detection of OA requires biomarkers that can accurately predict the condition, and there have been very few reports on such biomarkers.</p><p id="Par8">In our search for novel biomarkers related to OA, we focused on urinary 4-pyridoxic acid (4PA). Vitamin B6 exists in three forms (pyridoxal, pyridoxine, and pyridoxamine), each with its active form, and is eventually excreted in the urine as 4PA. The active form, pyridoxal-5&#x002b9;-phosphate, is involved in over 100 catalytic reactions and regulates various physiological processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Previous studies have shown a correlation between vitamin B6 and inflammatory markers in the body [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], and its relationship with OA via homocysteine metabolism has also been investigated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. However, to date, no studies have directly elucidated the relationship between urinary 4PA and OA. In the present study, we hypothesizes that urinary 4PA levels correlate with the severity of osteoarthritis, reflecting its potential as a non-invasive biomarker. This study was planned to investigate 4PA&#x02019;s effectiveness given the increasing need for reliable biomarkers in osteoarthritis management and prognosis.</p><p id="Par9">We initiated a population-based prospective cohort study entitled the Research on Osteoarthritis/Osteoporosis against Disability (ROAD) in 2005 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and completed 17&#x000a0;years of follow-up by the end of 2023. Using the information of the participants in the ROAD study 3rd survey conducted between 2012&#x02013;2013, we examined the value of 4PA as a urinary biomarker in association with the presence of radiographic knee osteoarthritis (KOA) or lumbar spondylosis (LS) in older Japanese individuals residing in a rural community.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par10">This study, conducted with a cross-sectional design, utilized data from the third survey (2012&#x02013;2013) of the population-based longitudinal ROAD cohort, which was followed from 2005 to 2023, in order to elucidate the utility of 4-Pyridoxic Acid in OA.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Participants of the ROAD Study</title><p id="Par11">The ROAD study, initiated in 2005, is a nationwide longitudinal cohort study that includes diverse regions across Japan, such as Itabashi in Tokyo, Hidakagawa in Wakayama&#x02019;s mountainous regions, and the coastal area of Taiji in Wakayama.

higher in participants with advanced KOA (KL grade 4) than in those with lower grade KOA. This association was robust and persisted even after adjusting for potential confounders such as age, sex, BMI, and lifestyle factors. These findings suggest that 4PA could serve as a valuable biomarker for assessing the severity of OA, particularly in advanced stages.</p><p id="Par34">As the final metabolite of vitamin B6, 4PA is excreted from the body via the kidneys in urine. In the body, the active form of vitamin B6 is involved in more than 100 reactions of great variety, and its role is significant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The relationship between vitamin B6 and inflammation has been reported in several studies; for example, Morris et al. reported the relationship between vitamin B6 intake and serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, a marker of inflammation, in 2,686 participants of the 2003&#x02013;2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey in the USA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Analysis showed a relationship between higher total vitamin B6 intake and lower serum CRP concentrations, and results from other studies suggest that inflammation may impair vitamin B6 metabolism. Similarly, the Framingham Offspring Study confirmed an association between vitamin B6 status and total inflammation scores based on 13 inflammation markers and reported an inverse correlation between active vitamin B6 and inflammation scores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Furthermore, the WENBIT study showed that systemic inflammation promotes the degradation of active vitamin B6 to 4PA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. These reports suggest that vitamin B6 plays an important role in inflammation and is an important factor in OA.</p><p id="Par35">Exercise has also been suggested to improve joint function and reduce pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], and guidelines on the type and frequency of exercise have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. To investigate the effects of exercise on chondrocytes in this context, Carbonare et al. found that osteogenic genes were upregulated in progenitor cells treated with serum collected before and after exercise, improving bone differentiation and regulating various aspects such as immune responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Interestingly, in the second report of the study, Deiana et al. similarly analysed human serum before and after exercise and found that the expression of genes related to chondrogenic differentiation was increased after exercise and that metabolites related to vitamin B6 were highly regulated. Further in vitro studies to assess the effects of vitamin B6 on chondrocytes from these results also showed that vitamin B6 increased chondrogenesis genes, counteracted the effects of the inflammatory cytokine IL-1&#x003b2;, suppressed oxidative stress, and reduced apoptosis. The results of this study were consistent with those of the National Institutes of Health. To our knowledge, this is the first report showing that exercise protects cartilage by activating vitamin B6 metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. This result is noteworthy, as the majority of vitamin B6 in the body is bound to glycogen phosphorylase and stored in muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. In a more recent report, Fangra corroborated these reports using a mouse model of OA and investigated the administration of vitamin B6 to the model mice, which improved OA severity, maintained cartilage thickness, suppressed inflammatory cytokine expression and apoptosis, and improved extracellular matrix metabolism. These vitamin B6 results are common in both in vivo and in vitro experiments and are consistent with previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. In addition to these reports, urinary metabolic analysis of rat OA models has also confirmed an increase in 4PA compared to that in controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] and other reports have shown that vitamin B6 metabolism is regulated during injury in mouse articular cartilage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p id="Par36">Our findings underscore the potential clinical applications of measuring urinary 4PA levels. As a non-invasive biomarker, 4PA can help stratify patients according to the severity of their condition, facilitating tailored therapeutic interventions. Moreover, monitoring changes in the 4PA levels over time could serve as a tool for evaluating the effectiveness of treatment strategies, thus optimising patient management.</p><p id="Par37">However, the cross-sectional nature of this study limits our ability to draw causal inferences between the 4PA levels and OA progression. Longitudinal studies are necessary to confirm whether elevated 4PA levels can predict the progression of OA. Importantly, our ROAD study conducts longitudinal follow-ups, which will enable us to explore the impact on the incidence and worsening of the condition in a longitudinal framework. Additionally, although we adjusted for several known confounders, other unmeasured variables may have influenced the observed relationships. The geographical and demographic limitations of the study population restrict the generalisability of our findings to other populations and regions. Future research should include a more diverse cohort and consider a wider range of metabolic and inflammatory markers to validate and enhance the clinical utility of 4PA.</p><p id="Par38">Future research should focus on validating these findings in larger and more diverse populations and exploring the mechanisms linking vitamin B6 metabolism with OA progression. Upon validation, urinary 4PA could be developed as a useful biomarker for assessing and monitoring the severity of OA in clinical practice.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par39">Our study highlights the potential of urinary 4PA levels as biomarkers for OA severity, particularly in the knee and lumbar spine. These findings pave the way for further research into the predictive power of 4PA in OA, with the ultimate goal of improving the diagnostic accuracy and therapeutic outcomes for patients with this debilitating condition.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher's Note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors wish to thank Dr. Naoki Hirabayashi of the Kawakami Clinic in Hidakagawa Town; Mrs. Tomoko Takijiri, Mrs. Rie Takiguchi, Mrs. Kyoko Maeda, Mrs. Michiko Mori, Mrs. Sanae Tamaki, Mrs Hisami Sakai, Masako Ihara, and other members of the town office in Hidakagawa Town; and Mrs. Tamako Tsutsumi, Mrs. Kanami Maeda, Mrs. Miki Shimosaki, and other members of the town office in Taiji Town for their assistance in locating and scheduling participants for examinations.
