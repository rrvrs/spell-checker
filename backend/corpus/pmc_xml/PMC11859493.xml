Introduction</title><p>Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the world, after cardiovascular disease [<xref rid="B1-pharmaceutics-17-00139" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. According to the Global Cancer Statistics 2020, of all cancers, colorectal cancer is the third most common and the second deadliest worldwide [<xref rid="B2-pharmaceutics-17-00139" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Traditional methods for the treatment of colorectal cancer include surgical resection and chemotherapy. Gene therapy has recently emerged as a new method and has become a topic of research interest in the field of antitumor therapy [<xref rid="B3-pharmaceutics-17-00139" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-pharmaceutics-17-00139" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. siRNA-based gene therapy is one of the means of colorectal cancer therapy, and it plays a role in silencing anti-apoptosis or introducing related genes that promote apoptosis [<xref rid="B5-pharmaceutics-17-00139" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-pharmaceutics-17-00139" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Although siRNA therapy in colorectal cancer has attracted much attention, its therapeutic effect still needs to be further improved.</p><p>Tumor immunotherapy is an antitumor approach based on activation of the immune response. Unlike treatment methods such as surgery and chemotherapy, the target of immunotherapy is not a tumor tissue but an immune system, indicating its potential for enhanced antitumor effect [<xref rid="B7-pharmaceutics-17-00139" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Gene therapy is the treatment of diseases based on replacing defective genes or adding new genes. Attributed to gene delivery, gene editing, and other functions, gene therapy could achieve therapeutic effects by delivering therapeutic nucleic acids [<xref rid="B8-pharmaceutics-17-00139" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The nanoskeleton-based non-viral gene vector, given its modifiability and physicochemical properties, can also play an immune-stimulating role. Therefore, based on non-viral gene therapy techniques, it would be helpful to develop new strategies for tumor immune gene therapy.</p><p>siRNA-based therapies are expected to play a key role in tumor treatment. One of the important aspects of siRNA preparation is the carrier, which protects the integrity of exogenous genetic material to achieve effective delivery [<xref rid="B9-pharmaceutics-17-00139" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-pharmaceutics-17-00139" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. An ideal in vivo delivery system can be an effective approach to ensure the treatment effect. Therefore, current research on tumor siRNA gene therapy has focused on further improving delivery efficiency, including developing new vectors, modifying the vector, and improving the targeting of the vector [<xref rid="B11-pharmaceutics-17-00139" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-pharmaceutics-17-00139" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-pharmaceutics-17-00139" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-pharmaceutics-17-00139" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-pharmaceutics-17-00139" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. However, little research has been conducted to explore the therapeutic effects of the vector itself. As a matter of fact, nanoparticles themselves have high therapeutic potential because of their charged properties and skeleton modifiability. In immunogene therapy research, people are also looking for suitable immunostimulants and strategies.</p><p>Intestinal probiotics are a subset of gut microorganisms, and they exert a beneficial influence on immunotherapy for cancer [<xref rid="B16-pharmaceutics-17-00139" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-pharmaceutics-17-00139" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-pharmaceutics-17-00139" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-pharmaceutics-17-00139" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. <italic toggle="yes">Lactobacillus reuteri</italic> is an intestinal probiotic, which plays a positive role by promoting the proliferation of intestinal epithelial cells and producing lactic acid [<xref rid="B20-pharmaceutics-17-00139" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-pharmaceutics-17-00139" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The peptidoglycan, extracellular polysaccharides, and other components of <italic toggle="yes">Lactobacillus reuteri</italic> are immunogenic [<xref rid="B22-pharmaceutics-17-00139" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-pharmaceutics-17-00139" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Recently, it has been shown that bacteria can stimulate the production of anticancer cytokines and induce oxidative stress [<xref rid="B24-pharmaceutics-17-00139" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. However, owing to the safety concerns of lipopolysaccharides and other ingredients of <italic toggle="yes">Lactobacillus reuteri</italic>, direct use of the bacteria for in vivo therapy is limited. It is not yet clear which component is responsible for the therapeutic effect, and the underlying therapeutic mechanism remains unclear. Considering that the bacterial lysate is a mixture of multiple components with different solubilities, suitable methods that can be introduced into existing nonviral vector skeletons must be developed.</p><p>Previously, we modified the amphiphilic polymer methoxypoly(ethylene glycol)poly(&#x003b5;-caprolactone) (mPEG-PCL)with cationic lipid N-[1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy) propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammonium methyl-sulfate (cationic lipid DOTAP, Avanti). DMP (DOTAP-mPEG-PCL) was prepared by DOTAP self-assembly with mPEG-PCL [<xref rid="B25-pharmaceutics-17-00139" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-pharmaceutics-17-00139" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In many nucleic acid-related gene therapy studies, DMP has been successfully applied [<xref rid="B27-pharmaceutics-17-00139" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28-pharmaceutics-17-00139" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In this study, we encapsulated <italic toggle="yes">Lactobacillus reuteri</italic> lysates into the DMP skeleton to prepare a lysate-based gene-delivery vector DMPLAC. By loading siRNA targeting CD47, we speculated that the DMPLAC/siCD47 complex could disrupt immune suppression and enhance immune response. The gene delivery and immunostimulatory abilities of the DMPLAC vector were further studied, and the anticancer ability of the DMPLAC/CD47 complex in several mouse tumor models, such as subcutaneous and abdominal tumor models, was evaluated.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-pharmaceutics-17-00139"><title>2. Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2dot1-pharmaceutics-17-00139"><title>2.1. Cell Lines and Animals</title><p>CT26 and HEK293T cells were purchased from ATCC. Dulbecco&#x02019;s modified Eagle&#x02019;s Medium (DMEM) containing 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) was utilized (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA). BALB/c mice were obtained from Beijing HFK Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (Beijing, China). All mice were maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions. All mouse experiments were conducted under the guidance of the Animal Ethics Committee of the General Bureau of Health Research of Sichuan University, in accordance with the guidelines for experimental animals of Sichuan University and standard operating procedures (SOPs).</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-pharmaceutics-17-00139"><title>2.2. Preparation and Characterization of Nanoparticles</title><p>The lysate of <italic toggle="yes">Lactobacillus reuteri</italic> was prepared as follows. We used a high-pressured viscolizer to break the wall of bacterial (1000 MPa, 60 min) [<xref rid="B29-pharmaceutics-17-00139" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], and then we filtered the suspension through a 0.22 &#x003bc;m filter membrane (Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany) to obtain the final lysate.</p><p>To prepare the DMPLAC, first, we took methylene chloride (Sigma-Aldrich, San Diego, CA, USA) and dissolved mPEG2K-PCL2K and DOTAP (1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium propane) (90:10, <italic toggle="yes">w</italic>/<italic toggle="yes">w</italic>) (Xi&#x02019;an ruixi Biological Technology, Xi&#x02019;an, China) in it. To remove the dichloromethane, the mixture was poured into a rotary evaporator and evaporated for 45 min (130 RPM). Then, the solvent evaporated and formed a lipid film. The lytic solution of <italic toggle="yes">Lactobacillus reuteri</italic> was added to the beaker, and it self-assembled into micelles at 45 &#x000b0;C. DMP and DMPLAC&#x02019;s size distribution and &#x003b6; potential were analyzed using a ZetaSizer Nano ZS instrument (Malvern Instruments, Ltd., Malvern, UK). Morphological analysis of the prepared particles was conducted using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). A gel delay assay was used to evaluate the siRNA-binding ability of DMPLAC nanoparticles.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3-pharmaceutics-17-00139"><title>2.3. Gram Faerbung Staining</title><p>First, the sample was fixed on a slide. The samples were dyed for 5 min with crystal violet and Gran&#x02019;s iodine solution (Thermo Fisher, America).

Stimulation of BMDC</title><p>To prepare bone marrow-derived DCs (BMDCs), total bone marrow cells were collected from the femurs and tibias of Balb/c mice, and all cells were suspended in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS. After the red blood cells ruptured, the remaining ones were cleaned with a full culture solution. Bone marrow cells were re-suspended in a complete culture medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (20 ng GM-CSF/mL). After 6 days, BMDCs were seeded in a six-well plate, and LPS (0.1 mg/mL), DMP, LAC (30 &#x003bc;g), or DMPLAC (30 &#x003bc;g LAC) was added. The cells were then cultured for another 48 h. To study the expression of markers of DC cell maturation (CD11c, CD80, CD86), cells were collected and flow cytometry (ACEA NovoCyte<sup>TM</sup>, San Diego, CA, USA) was used. All data were statistically analyzed using Prism 7 software (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA) and one-way ANOVA.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot5-pharmaceutics-17-00139"><title>2.5. Flow Cytometric Analysis of Activated T Cells In Vitro</title><p>In order to study the reactions of T cells and antigen-presenting cells (APCs) under the action of DMPLAC, we co-cultured DMPLAC with T cells or DC cells. First, we obtained mouse bone marrow cells, which were induced to differentiate into BMDCs under the action of GM-CSF (Abcam, Cambridge, UK). After six days, BMDCs were collected using a cell scraper and reseeded into a six-well plate at a 1:1 ratio (1.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>7</sup> cells per well). For T cells, cells from the lymph nodes were extracted and co-cultured with BMDCs (2.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> cells/well). At the same time, LPS (Sigma-Aldrich, America) (0.1 mg/mL), DMP, LAC (30 &#x003bc;g), or DMPLAC (30 &#x003bc;g LAC) was added. The cells were left in the incubator for another 48 h. Then flow cytometry was used to detect T cell activation and cytotoxicity (CD3, CD4, CD69). All data were statistically analyzed by one-way ANOVA.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot6-pharmaceutics-17-00139"><title>2.6. Immunostimulation of DMPLAC In Vivo</title><p>Next, the in vivo immune stimulation ability of DMPLAC system was studied. Briefly, BALB/c mice were intramuscularly injected with DMP, LAC, and DMPLAC. After the mice were kept for 48 h, they were killed, and lymphocytes from their lymph nodes and spleens were isolated. Lymphocytes were stained with CD80, CD86, CD11C, CD3, CD4, CD8, CD49b, and CD69 antibodies and analyzed using flow cytometry.</p><p>After the intraperitoneal model was established for TME, DMP, LAC, and DMPLAC were intraperitoneally injected for three days in a row.

After incubation in the incubator for 24 h, graded concentrations of DMPLAC, DMP, or PEI25K (a gold standard transfection agent) were added to the cells. At different timepoints (24 h, 36 h, and 48 h), we added MTT and incubated the plate under 37 &#x000b0;C for 4 h. Then DMSO was used to dissolve the reaction product, and absorbance was measured using an enzyme-labeled apparatus to calculate cell viability.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot9-pharmaceutics-17-00139"><title>2.9. Hemolysis Assay</title><p>We collected blood from the eye sockets of mice and centrifuged it for 5 min. We removed the supernatant and added a phosphate buffer to the precipitate. The whole process was repeated 3&#x02013;4 times until the supernatant ran clear. Then RBCs were diluted to 4% with phosphate buffer solution. The experiment was divided into a negative control group, a positive control group, a DMPLAC group, and a PEI25K group. Then, 500 &#x003bc;L of the 4% RBCs suspension was added to each group, and an equal volume of liquid was added (phosphate buffer solution was added to the negative control group, and Triton X-100 with a mass fraction of 0.5% was added to the positive control group.

Preparation and Characterization of the DMPLAC/siRNA Complex</title><p>DMPLAC was prepared by embedding the lysate of <italic toggle="yes">Lactobacillus reuteri</italic> in a DMP nanoparticle framework (<xref rid="pharmaceutics-17-00139-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A). First, we cultured the bacteria for 16 h and collected them to obtain <italic toggle="yes">Lactobacillus reuteri</italic> lysates through a series of high-pressure wall-breaking, ultrasonic, and membrane filtration procedures. The bacteria and lysates were stained using the Gram staining method. Before lysis, <italic toggle="yes">Lactobacillus reuteri</italic> was stained purple because it is a gram-positive bacterium with a thick cell wall. The lysate stained red, indicating that the bacteria were effectively lysed (<xref rid="pharmaceutics-17-00139-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>B). In this study, DMP was prepared by self-assembly using DOTAP and mPEG-PCL polymers, and DMPLAC nanoparticles were prepared by wrapping the bacterial lysate in DMP. TEM analysis revealed that both DMP and DMPLAC were circular, and the diameter of DMPLAC increased (<xref rid="pharmaceutics-17-00139-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>C). The Malvern particle size analyzer was used to determine the particle size and zeta potential of the nanoparticles. As shown in <xref rid="pharmaceutics-17-00139-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>D,E, the size of DMPLAC increased, and the potential decreased. Next, we investigated the ability of DMPLAC to bind to siRNAs. As shown in <xref rid="pharmaceutics-17-00139-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>F, siRNA migration was completely inhibited when the siRNA/DMPLAC ratio was 1:60. Therefore, the ratio of 1:60 was chosen for this study. As shown in <xref rid="pharmaceutics-17-00139-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>G, naked siRNA was rapidly destroyed by RNase, according to the RNase-protection studies. However, the DMPLAC/siRNA complex did not degrade significantly, and bands were still visible after 4 h of treatment, indicating that DMPLAC protected the siRNA from degradation. Therefore, based on the above findings, we successfully prepared DMPLAC nanoparticles capable of delivering siRNAs. In addition, in 293T and 3T3 cells, the IC<sub>50</sub> value of PEI25K was lower than 75 &#x003bc;g/mL, whereas the IC<sub>50</sub> values of DMPLAC and DMP were both higher than 800 &#x003bc;g/mL, indicating the safety of the DMPLAC particles (<xref rid="pharmaceutics-17-00139-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>H). These results show that the DMPLAC nanoparticles can be used for injection. For the hemolysis assay, Triton-X100, which causes significant hemolysis, was used as a positive control. As shown in <xref rid="pharmaceutics-17-00139-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>I,J, DMPLAC solutions at concentrations of 300, 200, 100, 50, and 10 &#x003bc;g/mL did not cause obvious hemolysis; that is, after incubation with each DMPLAC solution, the hemolysis rate of RBCs was lower than 4%.

In Vitro Transfection and Cellular Uptake Mechanism of the DMPLAC/siRNA Complex</title><p>To examine the siRNA delivery ability of DMPLAC, we performed transfection experiments on CT26 cells. Under fluorescence microscopy, we found that the delivery efficiency of the DMPLAC/CY3-siRNA complex was higher than that of PEI25K or DMP (<xref rid="pharmaceutics-17-00139-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>A).

The gating strategies of the study regarding the transfection efficiency are shown in <xref rid="app1-pharmaceutics-17-00139" ref-type="app">Figure S4</xref>. These results suggest that DMPLAC can be a novel nucleic acid delivery vector.</p><p>According to previous literature, whether the nanoparticle can successfully fulfill its delivery functions depends on whether it can help nucleic acids escape from lysosomes. Therefore, we explored the lysosomal escape ability of the DMPLAC/siRNA. As shown in <xref rid="pharmaceutics-17-00139-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>F, we found that, in both CT26 and 4T1, the red lysosome and FAM-siRNA had no evident colocalization, indicating that the DMPLAC/siRNA complex effectively prevented interaction with intracellular acidic lysosomes.</p><p>Owing to the excellent transfection efficiency of DMPLAC, we further investigated the cellular uptake mechanism of DMPLAC nanoparticles. Clathrin-mediated, caveolin-mediated, lipid raft&#x02013;mediated, and macroendocytosis are the four basic processes involved in nanocarrier phagocytosis. After pretreatment of the cells with several inhibitors of internalization mechanisms (filipin III and genistein for caveolin-mediated endocytosis, amiloride for micropinocytosis, chlorpromazine for clathrin-mediated endocytosis, methyl-&#x003b2;-cyclodextrin for lipid raft&#x02013;mediated endocytosis), as shown in <xref rid="pharmaceutics-17-00139-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>D, the red fluorescence in the methyl-&#x003b2;-cyclodextrin, chlorpromazine, and amiloride groups was weaker than that in the untreated group. In addition, the flow cytometry results (<xref rid="pharmaceutics-17-00139-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>E) demonstrated that methyl-&#x003b2;-cyclodextrin and chlorpromazine had great effects on cell uptake efficiency. Therefore, our findings suggested that endocytosis mediated by lipid rafts and clathrin played main roles in internalization.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot3-pharmaceutics-17-00139"><title>3.3. Immune Stimulation Ability of DMPLAC</title><p>Next, we investigated whether DMPLAC nanoparticles could effectively stimulate the immune response. First, we investigated whether DMPLAC could combine with DC in vitro. We isolated BMDCs from mice, labeled them with DMPLAC nanoparticles and rhodamine, and treated them with DMPLAC&#x02013;rhodamine for 24 h. As shown in <xref rid="pharmaceutics-17-00139-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>A, we found that DMPLAC (red signal) colocalized with the cytomembrane (green signal), indicating that DMPLAC can effectively bind to DCs. The experimental design is shown in <xref rid="pharmaceutics-17-00139-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>B. Flow cytometry was performed for further analysis, the gating strategies are shown in <xref rid="app1-pharmaceutics-17-00139" ref-type="app">Figure S1</xref>. As shown in <xref rid="pharmaceutics-17-00139-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>C, the DC maturation rate of the DMP group was 19.57%, whereas those of the LAC and DMPLAC groups reached 67.2% and 66.51%, respectively, indicating that <italic toggle="yes">Lactobacillus reuteri</italic> lysate as an antigen could effectively enhance the immunostimulatory ability of DMP nanoparticles. Next, we evaluated T-cell stimulation according to <xref rid="pharmaceutics-17-00139-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>D. Compared with the control and DMP groups, participation of the bacterial lysate significantly upregulated the expression of the activation-associated surface marker molecule CD69 (<xref rid="pharmaceutics-17-00139-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>D). The increase in the CD4+ ratio also indicated that DMPLAC enhanced T cell function after antigen presentation.</p><p>To further verify the immunostimulatory effect, we intramuscularly injected nanoparticles. The lymphocytes were then further analyzed by flow cytometry, and the gating strategies are shown in <xref rid="app1-pharmaceutics-17-00139" ref-type="app">Figure S2</xref>. As shown in <xref rid="pharmaceutics-17-00139-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>, lymphocytes expressing CD11C, CD80, and CD86 in the DMPLAC group exhibited pronounced gains, demonstrating the ability of DMPLAC to induce DC maturation. The results showed that DMPLAC stimulated the activation of T cells, promoting the expression of CD4 and CD69. In addition, we evaluated changes in NK cells. The experimental data detected an increase in NK cells, suggesting that DMPLAC is an effective inducer of NK cell mobilization. Similar effects were observed in the spleen. According to the results for CD11C, DMPLAC showed the highest efficiency in stimulating the immune response, enabling proliferation of antigen-presenting cells. The increase in CD69, CD4+, and CD8+ T cells indicated the strengthening of immune function and cytotoxicity of T cells. Additionally, the NK cells of DMPLAC exhibited a greater increase.</p><p>To further verify the role of DMPLAC in systemic immune stimulation, we treated the mice from the abdominal cavity metastatic model with DMP, LAC, and DMPLAC. The tumor tissues were then dissociated, and immune cell infiltration was detected. The gating strategies of the flow experiment regarding immunostimulation are shown in <xref rid="app1-pharmaceutics-17-00139" ref-type="app">Figure S3</xref>. As shown in <xref rid="pharmaceutics-17-00139-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>, the proportion of mature DC in DMPLAC group was high, reaching 60.9%, suggesting that LAC could efficiently improve DCs&#x02019; maturation and the ability to present antigens. We also found that T cells were relatively activated in the DMP, LAC, and DMPLAC groups, as evidenced by upregulated expression of the early activation marker CD69 [<xref rid="B30-pharmaceutics-17-00139" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Moreover, compared with the control group, the CD8+/CD4+ ratios in the DMP, LAC, and DMPLAC groups showed an increasing trend. Compared with the normal saline (NS) group, the percentage of CD8+ T cells in the DMP and LAC groups increased, and the percentage of CD8+ T cells in the DMPLAC group reached 48.5%, indicating that the injection of DMPLAC had the greatest potential to induce cytotoxic T cells.</p><p>Based on the experimental results presented above, we noted that DMP nanoparticles can act as gene vectors and adjuvants and can be enhanced using a bacterial lysate. In summary, DMPLAC effectively induced the activation and polarization of DCs and M&#x003c6; and triggered subsequent T cell responses.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot4-pharmaceutics-17-00139"><title>3.4. Knockdown of CD47 In Vitro</title><p>Previous studies have reported that a key mechanism of immune escape from tumors is the overexpression of the immunosuppressive signaling molecule CD47. Therefore, we conducted in vitro experiments to verify the gene knockdown ability of the DMPLAC/siCD47 complex. First, we measured the level of CD47 mRNA in CT26 cells using QPCR. As shown in <xref rid="pharmaceutics-17-00139-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>A, the amount of CD47 mRNA was significantly reduced in the DMPLAC/siCD47 group compared with that in the other groups (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). As shown by Western blotting (<xref rid="pharmaceutics-17-00139-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>B), the protein level of CD47 in the DMPLAC/siCD47 group was notably reduced, indicating that DMPLAC successfully and efficiently delivered CD47 siRNA into tumor cells and enabled it to exert its function. We then analyzed changes in CD47 expression using flow cytometry. The gating strategies of the study of expression of CD47 on CT26 are shown in <xref rid="app1-pharmaceutics-17-00139" ref-type="app">Figure S5</xref>.

The protein expression levels were further analyzed.

The DMPLAC/siCD47 Complex Effectively Suppresses Colon Cancer</title><p>To confirm the therapeutic effect of DMPLAC/siCD47 complex, we established a subcutaneous tumor model. We established a subcutaneous tumor model to confirm the therapeutic effect of the DMPLAC/siCD47 complex (<xref rid="pharmaceutics-17-00139-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>E). The weights and tumor volumes of the mice were monitored during treatment. As shown in <xref rid="pharmaceutics-17-00139-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>F, the tumor volumes in the mice from the DMPLAC and DMPLAC/siNC groups were lower than those in the mice from NS and DMPLAC/siCD47 groups, and increased most slowly.

Immunohistochemical (IHC) and TUNEL experiments were used to analyze the therapeutic mechanism of the DMPLAC/siCD47 complex. As shown in <xref rid="pharmaceutics-17-00139-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>K, DMPLAC/siCD47 efficiently reduced the expression of CD47 in the tumor tissues. DMPLAC nanoparticles and CD47-gene silencing both effectively reduced tumor vessels, as shown by CD31 staining. In addition, an activated immune response was demonstrated using TNF-&#x003b1; and IFN-&#x003b3; staining. TUNEL staining showed that DMPLAC promoted necrosis of the tumor tissue, and CD47 knockdown further enhanced this effect. In addition, H&#x00026;E staining (Figure 8A) revealed no significant pathological changes in major organs treated with the DMPLAC/siCD47 complex. Additionally, as shown in <xref rid="pharmaceutics-17-00139-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>J, the body weight showed no obvious change, indicating the safety of DMPLAC/siCD47.</p><p>In the abdominal model, we investigated the therapeutic potential of intraperitoneal injection of DMPLAC/siCD47 complex (<xref rid="pharmaceutics-17-00139-f007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>A).

Additionally, as shown in <xref rid="pharmaceutics-17-00139-f007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>E, the weight of the tumors and the number of tumor nodes showed a decreasing trend, revealing the synergistic effect of DMPLAC and CD47-gene silencing in inhibiting tumor development. To understand how DMPLAC/siCD47 works, tumor tissues were collected for the evaluation of DC, T cell, and macrophage activation (<xref rid="pharmaceutics-17-00139-f007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>F). The gating strategies of the study regarding the TME of mice using an abdominal metastasis model are shown in <xref rid="app1-pharmaceutics-17-00139" ref-type="app">Figure S6</xref>. Compared with normal saline (NS), the expression of co-stimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86 was significantly upregulated in the mice immunized with the complex containing DMPLAC, underscoring the importance of DMPLAC for successful antigen presentation and DC maturation, and this kind of maturation was enhanced by the participation of siCD47. The groups treated with DMPLAC, DMPLAC/siNC, and DMPLAC/siCD47 also showed higher levels of CD69+ T cells, which is representative of activation. Moreover, the CD47-mediated immune pathways were investigated. The promotion of MHC II + macrophages, representing M1-type macrophages, demonstrated that CD47-gene silencing was able induced proinflammatory effects during tumor cleaning. Subsequently, we studied the interior of the tumor tissue using IHC and TUNEL assays (<xref rid="pharmaceutics-17-00139-f007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>G).

Discussion</title><p>In this study, a multifunctional nanoparticle, DMPLAC/siCD47, was developed for colorectal cancer treatment by activating the immune response and disrupting immunosuppression. Our experimental results revealed that DMPLAC is an efficient immunostimulant that can deliver siRNAs into cells. Thus, the DMPLAC vector provides a novel strategy for activation of the immune response and an ideal vector for CD47 silencing. This synergistic treatment showed obvious antitumor efficacy in subcutaneous tumors and abdominal metastasis models. In summary, this study demonstrates the feasibility of combining TME regulation and immune checkpoint inhibitors (<xref rid="pharmaceutics-17-00139-sch001" ref-type="fig">Scheme 1</xref>).</p><p>Immune stimulants can regulate the immune response to clear tumor cells. In order to improve the efficacy of gene therapy, immunotherapy is considered to be added to gene therapy. Finding a suitable method for combining gene therapy and immunotherapy has gradually become a hot research topic. In order to achieve this purpose, Dharmapuri et al. used electroporation, introducing DNA for CEA- and HER2-positive colon cancer, and used TLR7 agonists to induce IFN&#x003b1; to enhance the overall efficacy [<xref rid="B31-pharmaceutics-17-00139" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In the treatment of melanoma, Finocchiaro et al. selected IL-12 and GM-CSF cytokines in order to enhance the immunotherapy effect of suicide gene preparation [<xref rid="B32-pharmaceutics-17-00139" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Switaj et al. selected CpG ODN 1826 to introduce Th1 immune response, IFN-&#x003b3; secretion, and B-lymphocyte activation, assisting the proliferation of interleukin-12 in mouse tumor gene therapy [<xref rid="B33-pharmaceutics-17-00139" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Ryuta Saito used IFN-&#x003b2; gene therapy against malignant gliomas while using DCs stimulated by tumor cell lysates to significantly extend the survival time in mice [<xref rid="B34-pharmaceutics-17-00139" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. These studies have successfully introduced the immune response into gene therapy, improving the antitumor effects. However, the most commonly used approach induces immunostimulation by simply combining immune adjuvant ingredients, making preparation and application inevitably complicated. Therefore, a simple and effective stimulation method is needed. In this study, we focused on the vector itself, modifying the delivery vector DMP with <italic toggle="yes">Lactobacillus reuteri</italic> lysate, thereby endowing it with immunostimulatory functions. According to our cell experiments, DMPLAC markedly increased the expression of DC co-stimulatory molecules, M1 polarization of macrophages, T cell activation, and cytotoxicity after APC presentation. Based on our in vivo experiments, DMPLAC increased immune cell infiltration in tumor tissues, T-cell activation by 30.24%, and the proportion of cytotoxic CD8+ T-cell proportion by 2.93 times. In summary, DMPLAC can shift the TME toward an immunoactivated state, improve antigen presentation, activate T cells, and increase their cytotoxicity. In animal studies, DMPLAC achieved a tumor suppression rate of 29.26% in subcutaneous tumor models. In the abdominal metastasis model, the tumor suppression rate reached 37.57%. The successful preparation of DMPLAC could have been due to the potential of DMP, which provided a core&#x02013;shell structure that allowed the lysate to be wrapped in. When assembling the nanoparticles, the bacterial lysate was successfully packaged into a cavity to obtain DMPLAC. For the bacterial lysate, the DMP skeleton can enhance the tumor penetration capacity and protect the bioactivity of the lysate, preventing its rapid removal by phagocytes. Studies have shown that <italic toggle="yes">Lactobacillus reuteri</italic> has antitumor bioactivity itself [<xref rid="B35-pharmaceutics-17-00139" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], which it exerts by activating various immune cells through peptidoglycan, LPS, lipoteichoic acid, or other components [<xref rid="B36-pharmaceutics-17-00139" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. After the cell wall of <italic toggle="yes">Lactobacillus reuteri</italic> is broken with high-pressure wall-breaking technology to improve safety, fragments can also expose more heterologous antigens and be more easily taken up, making the most of its immunostimulatory properties. Therefore, the <italic toggle="yes">Lactobacillus reuteri</italic> lysate and DMP gene vector used in this study can be described as mutually beneficial.</p><p>Immunosuppression reduces the immunogenicity of cancer cells and attenuates immune response sensitivity to help cancer cells resist attack, thereby favoring tumor metastasis and limiting therapeutic benefits. Thus, overcoming the drawbacks of immunosuppression remains a major challenge in immunotherapy to achieve maximum benefits. Using vaccines prepared with antigen ovalbumin and adjuvant CpG, Hu et al. delivered the Spam1 gene expressing hyaluronic acid, degrading the tumor extracellular matrix and sequentially promoting infiltration of immune cells to improve antitumor efficiency [<xref rid="B37-pharmaceutics-17-00139" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Chen et al. developed a nanoparticle of acid-activatable DOX prodrug and siRNA of PD-L1 to induce apoptosis of tumor cells and reverse immunosuppression [<xref rid="B38-pharmaceutics-17-00139" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Wang et al. designed a polymeric nanoparticle loading siANRIL to promote apoptosis and prevent proliferation of tumors, and they improved the effect on hepatoma carcinoma by applying TIGIT/PVR inhibitor <sup>D</sup>TBP-3 peptides [<xref rid="B39-pharmaceutics-17-00139" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Although these studies all successfully broke immunosuppression to a certain degree, few of them noted that the cooperation of breaking immunosuppression and regulating TME can improve the therapeutic benefit to a new level. The immune checkpoint CD47 was selected as the target spot. By making cancer cells more easily recognized and cleared, siCD47 cooperates with the activation effect of DMPLAC. In vitro experiments proved that DMPLAC could deliver siCD47 efficiently, knocking out the CD47 gene in CT26 cells by 45% and reducing the CD47 protein on the surface by 34.13%. In the peritoneal metastasis model, the number of immune cells in the tumor microenvironment of the DMPLAC/siCD47 group was significantly increased. The activation of T cells and M1 macrophages increased by 31.65% and 16.97%, respectively, based on the DMPLAC regulation. In the animal experiments, the addition of siCD47 further inhibited tumor progression by 42.87% on basis of DMPLAC in the intraperitoneal metastasis model and by 15.61% in the subcutaneous tumor model. This combination of immune activation and immunosuppression breaking improved the overall therapeutic effect; therefore, we speculate that the superior antitumor effect of co-loaded nanocomplexes may be caused by the cooperation of regulating TME and reversing immunosuppression. In the DMPLAC/siD47 complex, bacterial lysate&#x02013;modified DMPLAC acts as an immunostimulant, whereas siCD47 blocks the SIRP-&#x003b1;/CD47 pathway to improve the immunogenicity of tumor cells, making it easier for them to be cleared by immune cells activated by DMPLAC. The effects on immune cells and tumor cells can coordinate with each other.</p><p>In the final analysis, all these benefits were attributed to the unique structure of DMP, which is an efficient carrier that can load stimulatory molecules and deliver genetic material. On the one hand, it is self-assembled by the cationic liposome DOTAP and amphiphilic block copolymer mPEG-mPCL, which forms a cavity structure and allows the bacterial lysate to enter. However, the positive charge is completely unaffected by the internal cargo, loading nucleic acid by electrostatic adsorption, thereby providing carrier support for the DMPLAC/siCD47 complex to achieve dual function. In fact, some progress has been made in studies of cationic nanomaterials in recent years [<xref rid="B40-pharmaceutics-17-00139" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. However, current research focusing on gene delivery is usually limited to improving delivery capacity, and it is difficult to find suitable vectors to achieve co-delivery of genes and immune stimulants. The multifunctional cationic carrier DMP prepared has successfully achieved efficient simultaneous delivery of bacterial lysate and siCD47, and has shown satisfactory results in various experiments, both in vitro and in vivo.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec5-pharmaceutics-17-00139"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>Herein, we prepared a novel siRNA delivery vector, DMPLAC, based on intestinal probiotic lysates that can simultaneously activate the immune response at the same time. Loaded with siRNA targeting CD47, the DMPLAC/siCD47 complex can achieve dual immune modulation. A variety of in vitro and in vivo immunostimulation experiments, a mouse abdominal tumor model, and a subcutaneous tumor model also verified the satisfactory therapeutic effect of the complex. The experimental results suggest that this is a potential strategy for cancer immunotherapy.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclaimer/Publisher&#x02019;s Note:</bold> The statements, opinions and data contained in all publications are solely those of the individual author(s) and contributor(s) and not of MDPI and/or the editor(s).
