Paternal chromosomes are eliminated during male meiosis I and both maternal X sister chromatids are retained in&#x000a0;male meiosis II. Embryos start with three copies of the X chromosome, but 1&#x02013;2 copies are eliminated from somatic cells as part of sex determination, and one is eliminated in the germline to restore diploidy. In addition, there is gene amplification in larval polytene chromosomes, and the X polytene chromosome folds back on itself mediated by extremely long-range interactions between three loci. These developmentally normal events present opportunities to study chromosome behaviors that are unusual in other systems. Moreover, little is known about the centromeric and telomeric sequences of lower Dipterans in general, and there are recent claims of horizontally-transferred genes in fungus gnats. Overall, there is a pressing need to learn more about the fungus gnat chromosome sequences.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par2">We produced the first chromosome-scale models of the X and autosomal chromosomes where each somatic chromosome is represented by a single scaffold. Extensive analysis supports the chromosome identity and structural accuracy of the scaffolds, demonstrating they are co-linear with historical polytene maps, consistent with evolutionary expectations, and have accurate centromere positions, chromosome lengths, and copy numbers. The positions of alleged horizontally-transferred genes in the nuclear chromosomes were broadly confirmed by genomic analyses of the chromosome scaffolds using Hi-C and single-molecule long-read datasets. The chromosomal context of repeats shows family-specific biases, such as retrotransposons correlated with the centromeres. Moreover, scaffold termini were enriched with arrays of retrotransposon-related sequence as well as nucleosome-length (~ 175 bp) satellite repeats. Finally, the Hi-C data captured Mb-scale physical interactions on the X chromosome that are seen in polytene spreads, and we characterize these interesting &#x0201c;fold-back regions&#x0201d; at the sequence level for the first time.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par3">The chromosome scaffolds were shown to be of exceptional quality, including loci harboring horizontally-transferred genes. Repeat analyses demonstrate family-specific biases and telomere repeat candidates. Hi-C analyses revealed the sequences of ultra-long-range interactions on the X chromosome.

Most notable is its chromosome cycle (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> A-B). Rather than having either a diploid or haploid set of the same chromosomes (X, II, III, IV, and L) in every cell, the chromosome constitution varies based on whether it is somatic or germline, male or female, and early embryo or late embryo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. With respect to somatic or germline, there are chromosomes referred to as the L chromosomes that are only found in the germline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Regarding male or female, half of all females, but no males, contain a variant of the X chromosome called the X&#x02019; (X prime) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Concerning embryo stage, embryos start out with three copies of the X chromosome, two of which are paternally derived, and with a variable number of the germline-limited L chromosomes, but later embryos have only 1&#x02013;2 X chromosomes and no L chromosomes in somatic cells. The L chromosomes are eliminated from all somatic nuclei not set aside for the germline in the 5&#x02009;th- 6&#x02009;th nuclear division [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The difference in X chromosome copy number arises because embryos from XX mothers are destined to be male and eliminate two paternal X chromosomes from somatic nuclei in the 7&#x02009;th- 9&#x02009;th nuclear division whereas embryos produced by X&#x02019;X mothers are fated to be female and eliminate only one paternal X [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Accordingly, sex is determined by the chromosome constitution of the mother in this species, which lacks a Y chromosome. Later in development, both the male and female germline restore diploidy for the X by eliminating one paternal copy, and also eliminate one or more L chromosomes to prevent their accumulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Thereafter, the meiotic events in oogenesis appear to proceed normally whereas those in spermatogenesis do not. In meiosis I of spermatogenesis, all paternal somatic chromosomes are eliminated in a bud of cytoplasm while the L chromosomes appear to escape this imprinting effect and are retained with the maternal set of somatic chromosomes at the single pole of a naturally occurring monopolar spindle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In meiosis II, both maternally-derived sister chromatids of the X chromosome undergo developmentally programmed nondisjunction and are retained at one pole of a bipolar spindle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Rather than four products, these unusual events lead to one product of male meiosis: a sperm that contains only maternally derived somatic chromosomes (X, II, III, and IV), that is diploid for X, haploid for the autosomes (II, III, and IV), and variable for L chromosomes. In addition to the unusual chromosome cycle, <italic>Bradysia coprophila</italic> larval salivary glands have highly polytene chromosomes with over 8000 copies in each nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], and developmentally-programmed gene amplification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Finally, there is mounting evidence that this genome may be a great model for studying horizontal gene transfer (HGT) in insects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Overall, fungus gnats present many opportunities to study chromosome biology across development and evolution.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>The fungus gnat chromosome cycle and chromosome-scale scaffolding flowchart. <bold>A</bold> The chromosome behaviors across the somatic cell lineage of males and females starting from the initial zygotic genome. In early embryogenesis, L chromosomes are eliminated first from all nuclei destined for the somatic cell lineage. Then either one or two paternal X chromosomes (Xp) are eliminated. Male-producing females produce offspring that eliminate two Xp and become males. Female-producing females contain a variant of the X chromosome, X&#x02019; (X prime), and produce offspring that eliminate one Xp and become male-producing and female-producing females depending on whether they inherit the maternal X or X&#x02019;. The two types of females can be distinguished by whether they have wavy or straight wings. L* represents the presence of two L chromosomes, L1 and L2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The subscripts &#x0201c;M&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;P&#x0201d; indicate maternal and paternal origin, respectively. The reference genome, Bcop_v1, was made from male embryos, and represents the male somatic genome (highlighted in yellow) box. <bold>B</bold> The chromosome dynamics across the germline lineage for males and females. Male meiosis is non-Mendelian, and results in a single product through paternal genome elimination and maternal X-non-disjunction. Female meiosis is Mendelian. Purple chromosomes represent that their origin can be from any parent at random. <bold>C</bold> A flowchart and summary of updating the reference genome, Bcop_v1, with Hi-C. Bcop_v1 is a long read assembly, incorporating both PacBio and Nanopore data, that was scaffolded with optical maps from BioNano Genomics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Bcop_v2 is the result of correcting and scaffolding Bcop_v1 with Hi-C data. The numbers in parentheses denotes how many contigs and scaffolds are in the given component of the assembly</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12864_2025_11573_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p id="Par32">Previously, we published a highly contiguous assembly of the somatic chromosomes (X, II, III, and IV) named Bcop_v1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. We targeted the somatic genome in males (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A) as it presented the lowest complexity version of the genome, lacking both the L and X&#x02019; chromosomes, which have since been the focus of other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Specifically, we sequenced genomic DNA from male embryos using long-read (PacBio RS II SMRT and Oxford Nanopore Technologies MinION) and short-read (Illumina) technologies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. As part of that process, we assembled the sequencing data ~&#x02009;100 different ways, and used many evaluations to determine the best assembly and polishing pipelines for our datasets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Two assemblies with the best evaluation scores were scaffolded with optical maps from BioNano Genomics, then subject to further evaluations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The chosen BioNano-scaffolded assembly, Bcop_v1 (NCBI GenBank GCA_014529535.1, WGS VSDI01), had a contig NG50 of ~&#x02009;2.4 Mb and scaffold NG50 of ~&#x02009;8.2 Mb (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Since, in <italic>Bradysia coprophila</italic>, late male embryos have a single copy of the X, but are diploid for the autosomes, it was possible to classify each contig as either X-linked or autosomal using sequencing depth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Moreover, using the known chromosomal locations of a handful of sequences, we were able to anchor ~&#x02009;28&#x02013;33% of the autosomal sequences into chromosomes II, III, and IV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Overall, nearly 50% of the expected genome size was anchored into chromosomes based on read depth and known sequence locations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Nevertheless, chromosome assignments are not available for the majority of contigs in Bcop_v1. Additionally, Bcop_v1 lacks any information regarding the ordering and orientation of the contigs along chromosome sequences. To better facilitate studies into gene amplification and the unusual chromosome dynamics in <italic>Bradysia coprophila</italic> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A-B), our goal was to develop better models of the somatic chromosome sequences. We approached this by using chromosome conformation capture with deep sequencing (Hi-C) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] to scaffold the chromosomes as has been successfully done by others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>C). Specifically, Hi-C is powerful at putting chromosome sequences together from a collection of sub-chromosomal sequences because of three major attributes of in vivo chromosome interactions captured by Hi-C data: (i) the interactions arbitrarily yield Mb-scale and chromosome-scale information without the need for sequencing ultra-long DNA molecules, (ii) intra-chromosomal interactions are much more frequent than inter-chromosomal interactions, making it possible to use interaction frequencies to cluster contigs into &#x02018;chromosome groups&#x02019;, and (iii) interaction frequencies decay with distance, making it possible to use them to order and orient the contigs in a chromosome group in the order and orientations they most likely appear along a chromosome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].

In addition, we lifted over the annotations from the former genome assembly, allowing studies in progress by multiple groups to seamlessly transition to the updated genome assembly. Through several approaches, we demonstrate the chromosome identity and high structural accuracy of the chromosome-scale scaffolds, including through inspecting Hi-C interaction frequencies, correlation with polytene maps, how repeats are distributed, read depth, evolutionary expectations, and special features of the X chromosome. Moreover, using multiple genomic datasets, we demonstrate that recently-discovered &#x0201c;alien&#x0201d; genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] in the gene annotation sets are genuine parts of the chromosome-scale scaffolds, ruling out the possibility that they are associated with assembly errors from contaminating DNA sources.

In Bcop_v2, (i) the chromosome-sized scaffolds define regions of much higher interaction frequencies, even far off the diagonal, compared to interactions with other scaffolds, (ii) the lowest interaction frequencies correspond to inter-scaffold contacts, (iii) the strongest interaction frequencies were along the diagonal within the chromosome scaffolds and had no disruptions between neighboring contigs, and (iv) off-diagonal interaction frequencies rapidly decayed with distance (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B, Supplemental Fig. S2).

Specifically, chromosomes X, II, and III are acrocentric with centromeres very close to the beginning of these chromosomes at polytene zones X/1 A, II/1 C, and III/1 C. In agreement, the centromere mapped within the first few megabases of the corresponding 58&#x02013;71 Mb scaffolds (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>C-F). In contrast, chromosome IV is metacentric with a centrally-located centromere at polytene zone IV/9B, where zones span from IV/1 A to IV/20 C. As expected, the centromere mapped to a medial region, at positions spanning ~&#x02009;44.7&#x02013;45.0 Mb, of the 97.1 Mb chromosome IV scaffold (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>C-F). Importantly, centromeric positions were concordant in the order of all anchor sequence loci along the polytene maps (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>C-F). The positional information of the centromeres and other anchors enabled us to orient the chromosome scaffold sequences in the same direction as the locus numbers that have been assigned on polytene maps for all four chromosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>C-F).</p><p id="Par38">The chromosome-scale scaffold lengths are consistent with prior chromosome length expectations. In early studies of these chromosomes by H.V. Crouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], chromosome II was predicted to be shortest, chromosome IV was established as the longest, and chromosomes X and III were expected to be of equivalent lengths. Crouse&#x02019;s early expectations are confirmed by the chromosome-scale scaffolds (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>G), of which II is shortest (58.3 Mb), IV is the longest (97.1 Mb), and X and III are approximately the same length (70.5 and 71.0 Mb, respectively). Moreover, the chromosome lengths reflected by the scaffolds are concordant with the expected sizes of each chromosome using the number of polytene sections assigned by Crouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] and the expected genome size from DNA content measurements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The total length (226 Mb) of the autosomal scaffolds (II, III, IV) was also concordant with these predictions (214&#x02013;231 Mb) (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Note that these early chromosome length expectations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] were later revised such that X and II were both shortest and of equivalent length [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], but this under-estimate of the X was anticipated by Crouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] and is now refuted by the chromosome-scale scaffolds that support Crouse&#x02019;s earlier length expectations (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>G).</p><p id="Par39">The chromosome identity of the X chromosome scaffold and of the autosomal nature of the other scaffolds (II, III, and IV) are also confirmed by read depth analysis. Females are diploid for both the autosomes and the X chromosome. Males are diploid for the autosomes, but haploid for X. Thus, read depth for females along the X and autosomes should be equivalent whereas read depth along the X from males should be half that of autosomes. These read depth expectations are borne out by multiple genomic technologies (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>H), including paired-end Illumina reads for both types of adult female and adult males [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], long reads from Nanopore and PacBio for male embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]; and BioNano Genomic optical maps from male pupae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The diploid-level read depth in both males and females across the scaffolds for chromosomes II, III, and IV confirms that they are strictly composed of autosomal contig sequences (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>H). Similarly, the haploid-level read depth in all male samples, but diploid level in female samples, across the entirety of the X chromosome scaffold, confirms not only the chromosome identity of the scaffold as X, but that all the contigs within it are indeed X-linked (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>H).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Gene annotations for the chromosome-scale assembly (Bcop_v2)</title><p id="Par40">The gene annotation sets generated for the previous version of this genome (Bcop_v1) have already been demonstrated to score highly in &#x02018;completeness&#x02019; as determined by the number of Dipteran BUSCOs (97%) found within them. For this reason, we used a liftover procedure to precisely map their coordinates in the chromosome-scale assembly, Bcop_v2 (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>).

The lifted over gene models were also highly concordant with exon&#x02013;intron structures defined by RNA-seq coverage (Supplemental Fig. S3).

They did not give rise to disrupted or otherwise unexpected Hi-C or sequencing depth signals across a variety of genomic datasets from different technologies and samples (Supplemental Fig. S4). Finally, there exist Hi-C interactions, long reads, and optical maps that physically connect the &#x0201c;alien&#x0201d; genes to highly conserved Dipteran genes (data not shown), indicating they were in the same nucleus and on the same DNA molecule.

The five species had 4,297 SCOs. The chromosomal addresses of SCOs were compared between each species relative to <italic>B. coprophila</italic> in order to (i) map <italic>B. coprophila</italic> chromosomes to their most likely counterparts in each of the other species (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>) and (ii) visualize as dot plots (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>C). <italic>B. coprophila</italic> was plotted against itself to demonstrate the base case of what the absence of gene shuffling looks like (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>C). Visually, the amount of gene shuffling increased with evolutionary distance as expected. While there is gene shuffling even between <italic>B. coprophila</italic> and the closest related species tested (<italic>P. hygida</italic>), it is mostly intra-chromosomal and this pair demonstrates the highest amount of conservation of SCOs from given <italic>B. coprophila</italic> chromosomes to their single corresponding chromosomes in the other species (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>C; Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>, Supplemental Fig. S5). In contrast, compared to <italic>B. coprophila</italic>, the most distantly related species (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>) visually has the most gene shuffling across chromosomes, and the mosquito species have intermediate levels, as expected (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>C; Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>). These analyses also point to how the chromosomes of mosquitoes relate to those of the gnats (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>C; Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>, Supplemental Fig. S5). For example, in <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>, chromosome 1 corresponds to the X chromosomes of both fungus gnats with at least three major rearrangements (Supplemental Fig. S5), the left and right arms of <italic>Aedes</italic> chromosome 2 correspond to III and IV in <italic>B. coprophila, respectively</italic> (A and B in <italic>P. hygida</italic>), and the left and right arms of <italic>Aedes</italic> chromosome 3 correspond to chromosome II and the left end of chromosome IV (C and A in <italic>P. hygida</italic>). Overall, visual inspection of the pairwise SCO dot plots makes a strong case that the <italic>B. coprophila</italic> gene sets defined by the chromosome-scale scaffolds (Bcop_v2) follow evolutionary expectations.

Briefly, entropy can be thought of as a measure of &#x0201c;mixed-up-ness&#x0201d; that can quantify systems as they evolve from a non-random to a random state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Here, it is used to measure the amount of inter-chromosomal gene shuffling between pairs of species, and ultimately as a function of evolutionary distance from <italic>B. coprophila</italic>. A normalized entropy metric that ranges between 0 and 1, called Min&#x02013;Max Normalized Entropy (MMNE), was computed for each pairwise comparison of two species. MMNE shows the observed entropy relative to the minimum and maximum entropy estimates for that pairwise species comparison given the number of shared SCOs, chromosomes, and associated probabilities (see Methods; see example SCO probabilities in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref>). The initial non-random lowest entropy state (when MMNE is 0) is simply a comparison to self (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>D). Entropy is expected to increase (MMNE approaches 1) with more distantly related species that had larger periods of time for inter-chromosomal rearrangements to shuffle genes around, which is what is observed with increasing evolutionary distance from <italic>B. coprophila</italic> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>D). Furthermore, performing clustering on the matrix of all pairwise inter-species entropy scores reproduces the species groupings expected by the known evolutionary relationships (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>E), putting the fungus gnat family members (<italic>B. coprophila</italic> and <italic>P. hygida</italic>) together within the larger Nematoceran cluster that also included the pair of mosquitoes, all of which were on a separate branch from the single Brachyceran<italic>, D. melanogaster</italic>. The results of these comparative genomic evaluations further bolster the confidence we have in the Hi-C directed process that yielded Bcop_v2 chromosome-scale scaffolds.

To test this expectation, we analyzed the distribution of repeats across the <italic>B. coprophila</italic> chromosome-scale scaffolds. Centromeric positions are defined as described above and peri-centromeric positions are defined as the much broader repeat-rich regions flanking each side. The telomeric and sub-telomeric regions are defined here simply as the regions near and including the scaffold termini, which have been shown to correspond to sub-telomeres and telomeres in other Hi-C-based scaffolds of insect assemblies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. If present, telomeric repeats are expected only in the terminal-most 10&#x02013;50 kb whereas sub-telomeres are immediately-adjacent to telomeres and are much broader repeat-rich regions.</p><p id="Par47">First, the entire genome assembly was mapped against itself (or individual chromosome scaffolds against themselves) to create dot plots that naively show all pairwise regions that share high sequence similarity with each other (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A). The regions around and including centromeric positions and scaffold termini were very obvious in these plots, with highly repetitive natures locally within each chromosome scaffold and also with high similarity among the corresponding regions across all chromosome scaffolds. The first 10 Mb of the left terminus of chromosome X is composed of two adjacent repeat blocks. The first repeat block at the beginning of X corresponds to the left telomeric/sub-telomeric zone, rDNA, and centromeric repeats among other centromere-proximal repeats (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A). To the right of the centromere but still on the left side of the chromosome, the second repeat block contains two adjacent loci of interest that are discussed in a subsequent section (centromere-proximal X&#x02019; breakpoint and the first &#x0201c;fold-back repeat&#x0201d; locus), and is more similar to the repeat block in the final 5&#x02013;8 Mb of the right terminus of the scaffold (distal telomeric side) than it is to the left terminal block (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A). The chromosome III scaffold has a similar structure on its left terminus. It starts with a 10&#x02013;12 Mb, centromere-containing, high density repeat block followed on its right by a second smaller repeat block that is more closely related to the terminal ~&#x02009;5 Mb repeat block at the distal telomeric end on the right terminus of the scaffold than the centromeric end to the left terminus (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A). Unlike X and III, the scaffold for chromosome II has a single large (~ 8&#x000a0;Mb) repeat block at its centromeric end (left terminus) that has high similarity with the terminal ~&#x02009;8 Mb at its distal telomeric end on its right side (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A). The repeat densities of the chromosome II repeat blocks seem lighter than the other chromosomes in this method of analysis, but not necessarily so in other analyses (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A-B). The metacentric chromosome IV scaffold has a repeat block at both termini, each ~&#x02009;8 Mb, as well as a repeat block in the middle of ~&#x02009;10 Mb surrounding the approximated centromere position in the scaffold (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A). Finally, the sequences in the &#x0201c;associated assembly&#x0201d;, which are not placed in the chromosome-scale scaffolds, are enriched for matches within the centromere-proximal repeat blocks, but also contain matches to rDNA and rDNA-proximal repeats, and matches to terminal repeat blocks to a lesser extent (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A). Overall, the repeat structures of the scaffolds help confirm their centromere regions and follow expectations of repetitive structures associated with scaffold termini corresponding to telomeric and/or sub-telomeric regions.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Repeat regions, centromere locations, and terminal repeats across the <italic>B. coprophila</italic> chromosome-scale scaffolds. <bold>A</bold> Repeat densities in 100 kb bins across each chromosome, and locations of known locus markers.

Tandem repeats were also mapped independently. Both tandem repeats and the summation of all modeled repeat families are indeed enriched around defined centromere positions and scaffold termini (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab7" ref-type="table">7</xref>; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>B). When inspecting different transposon&#x000a0;clades, their densities near centromeres and scaffold termini had different biases. Retrotransposable element (Class I) orders,&#x000a0;LTR,&#x000a0;and LINE, and super-families therein (e.g. LINE/RTE) were generally more enriched around centromeric positions than near scaffold termini (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>B). Their densities are higher at the centromeric (left) ends of the acrocentric chromosomes (X, II, and III) compared to the right ends, and higher at the medial centromere position of IV compared to its termini (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>B). These retrotransposon orders and super-families have relatively little or no enrichment in terminal regions, which have similar densities compared to the rest of the chromosome lengths (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>B). LTR elements are particularly enriched near the centromere of chromosome III (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>B). Sequence labeled as LINE was most abundant in general (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab7" ref-type="table">7</xref>).

different bias, the majority&#x000a0;seeming to have higher relative densities at least in some telomeric and/or sub-telomeric regions than near centromeres (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>B). For example, see the non-centromeric ends (right termini) of the scaffolds for chromosomes X and II (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>B). A sub-family called DNA/hAT-Tag1 is a great example of a family whose highest densities are in terminal regions compared to other regions of the chromosome scaffolds, including centromeres (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>B). Nevertheless, although DNA elements may be more biased in the termini of X and II than their centromeres, DNA transposons are also found near all centromeric and peri-centromeric regions, illustrated well by the medial centromere of chromosome IV (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>B). Moreover, the bias of DNA transposons to these repeat-rich regions compared to gene-rich intervening regions is not as high as the retrotransposon bias is to peri-centromeric regions&#x000a0;for other transposon families (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>B). Finally, the &#x0201c;Rolling Circle&#x0201d; Helitron order is distributed such that its highest densities appear similar in both terminal and peri-centromeric regions, and the overall weight of Helitron elements is very concentrated in these regions compared to gene-rich areas of the chromosome arms (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>B).</p><p id="Par50">Repeats that could be recognized and classified as belonging to a particular repeat or transposon family tend to be enriched with proximity to centromeres and termini (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>B). This is also true for locations that match conserved classified repeats from across other arthropods (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>B). Thus, the regions associated with termini and around centromeres are enriched for repeats that are conserved enough to classify into families and/or be most similar to repeats from other species. However, the majority of repeat families in the repeat library trained de novo on the <italic>B. coprophila</italic> genome could not be classified according to known repeat families in the same automated fashion by the repeat modeling and annotation programs (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab7" ref-type="table">7</xref>), and are referred to as &#x02018;unclassified repeats&#x02019;. While the density of unclassified repeats is still moderately higher near centromeres and telomeres, the bias is much lower, and the unclassified repeats are much more spread out across the rest of the chromosome arms (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>B). It is possible some of these unclassified repeat families actually correspond to gene families or repeat families, newly arisen or otherwise, that are just not included as possible classification terms in the programs used. Unclassified repeats may also consist of highly degraded copies of known repeat families that were simply not recognized, which would indicate that repeat sequences are either better maintained near centromeres and near chromosome ends, or younger in those regions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Chromosome-scale scaffold termini highlight arrays of retrotransposon-related and satellite sequences as candidate telomeric repeats</title><p id="Par51">Although tandem repeats of short (5&#x02013;10 bp) sequences that are maintained by telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) are the norms for eukaryotic telomeres, the telomeres of Dipterans demonstrate notable exceptions to this with alternative systems such as telomere-specific retrotransposons (TSRTs) and Long Complex Terminal Tandem Repeats (LCTTRs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. The telomeres of lower Dipterans, of which the fungus gnat (<italic>B. coprophila</italic>) is a member, are least explored. The chromosome-scale scaffolds in Bcop_v2 allowed us to closely inspect the sequence at each terminus to hunt for candidate telomere repeat sequences, as has been done recently for other insects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. As expected for Dipterans, we found no evidence of the TERT gene in the <italic>Bradysia coprophila</italic> genome or proteome, and no evidence for short (5&#x02013;10 bp) tandem repeats at the scaffold termini, including the canonical insect pentamer (TTAGG) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Although tandem repeats in the 14&#x02013;22 bp range might make up the telomeres of a closely related species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], we did not find evidence of tandem repeats in this size range near the scaffold termini either. What we did find at the scaffold termini were (i) arrays of retrotransposon-related sequences (RTRS) with unit lengths of 1.7&#x02013;3.3 kb, (ii) arrays of LCTTRs (or satellites) with unit lengths of 161&#x02013;191 bp, and (iii) examples of medium-length tandem repeats in the 51&#x02013;56 bp range located further into the sub-telomeres. These are briefly described below.</p><p id="Par52">Retrotransposon-related sequences (RTRS) were enriched near the left termini of autosomal scaffolds (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>C-F &#x02013; Pink triangles) and both termini of the X scaffold (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>G-H &#x02013; Purple triangles). The left termini of scaffolds corresponding to chromosomes II, III, and IV are composed of arrays of RTRS with unit lengths of 1.7&#x02013;3.3 kb. Although the RTRS repeat units have different lengths, they share ~&#x02009;1.2 kb of sequence, and all three were classified in the repeat annotation as non-LTR LINE elements related to RTE-BovB, CRE, and/or CR1. This is reminiscent of <italic>Drosophila</italic>, which have non-LTR elements for telomeres. However, the RTRS arrays found at the very ends of the left termini of II and III point away from the centromere, which differs from <italic>Drosophila</italic>. On the left terminus of II, there are ~&#x02009;8 copies of a 1.7 kb RTRS spanning the first ~&#x02009;14 kb, and on III, there are ~&#x02009;3&#x02013;4 copies of a 3.3 kb RTRS spanning the first ~&#x02009;12 kb (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>D-E). Each unit in these arrays has a single location with BLAST hits to reverse transcriptase (RT) proteins. After the RTRS array on III, the repeat annotation shows a centromere-facing LINE (RTE-ORTE). The left terminus of IV has a single left-facing LINE-related sequence and corresponding BLAST hit to RT proteins ~&#x02009;10 kb into the scaffold. This is then followed by 13&#x02013;14 copies of a centromere-facing 2.5 kb RTRS unit, although this unit does not have the region corresponding to RT protein BLAST hits despite being related to the RTRS units on II and III that do (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>F). In contrast to the left termini of the autosomal scaffolds, the right termini do not have RTRS arrays, at least not so close to the termini (F&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">i</xref>g.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>I). The right terminus of II has 1&#x02013;2 partial hits to the RTRS units in the sub-telomeres. The right terminus of III has two related hits: the very final ~&#x02009;100 bp matches the RTRS units, and there is a centromere-facing RT protein hit to a region labeled as LINE/CR1 ~&#x02009;10 kb from the end. Finally, ~&#x02009;90&#x02013;115 kb from the right terminus of IV are two sub-telomeric arrays of 2 and 6 centromere-facing RTRS units highly similar to those at the left terminus of IV. Of note to Sciarid researchers, the 1.7&#x02013;3.3 kb RTRS units do not appear to be related to the very abundant non-LTR ScRTE sequence and its corresponding F4 probe studied by Escrib&#x000e1; et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. ScRTE was not found within 10 kb of any terminus, typically having a first instance 60&#x02013;440 kb away from termini, much farther inward than the RTRS arrays described above. The left and right termini of the scaffold corresponding to the X chromosome also had retrotransposon-related sequence, but different from that on the autosomes. Both sides of the X scaffold start with sequence classified as a centromere-facing LTR/Pao elements, and both are followed immediately by terminus-facing DNA transposons (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>G-H). LTR elements would be surprising candidates for telomere sequences compared to <italic>Drosophila</italic>, which depends on the mechanism associated with non-LTR elements for telomere maintenance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], and may indicate that the X telomeres are not well-represented on this scaffold.</p><p id="Par53">Long Complex Terminal Tandem Repeats (LCTTRs or satellite repeats) were also enriched near the right termini of autosomal scaffolds (F&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">i</xref>g.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>I; Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab8" ref-type="table">8</xref>). Specifically, the right termini of scaffolds corresponding to chromosomes II and III end with ~&#x02009;28 copies of a 175 bp satellite (F&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">i</xref>g.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>I &#x02013; Orange triangles; Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab8" ref-type="table">8</xref>) and ~&#x02009;28 copies of a 161 bp satellite (F&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">i</xref>g.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>I &#x02013; Red triangles; Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab8" ref-type="table">8</xref>), respectively. The most striking example is the right terminal ~&#x02009;40.3 kb of IV, which contains 229 copies of a 176 bp satellite (F&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">i</xref>g.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>I &#x02013; Blue triangles; Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab8" ref-type="table">8</xref>). Each satellite species is very close to the LCTTR unit length seen in midges of 176 bp. Although each right terminus ends with a different satellite, each terminus or sub-telomeric region also highlights one or more of the others and/or of two other prevalent satellites with unit lengths of 191 bp and 56 bp (F&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">i</xref>g.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>I &#x02013; Brown and light purple triangles, respectively; Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab8" ref-type="table">8</xref>). For example, the right terminus of II also has an array of the 191 bp (brown) satellite, the right-terminal sub-telomeric regions of all chromosome scaffolds have arrays of the 56 bp (purple) satellite, and arrays of the 161 bp (red) satellite are found in the right-side sub-telomeric regions of scaffolds for X, II, and IV. The scaffold for chromosome IV shows the richest examples of satellite arrays in its sub-telomeric regions, both the left and right termini of which have arrays of four or more of these satellite species. The left side of IV in particular is super-enriched for the 175 bp (orange) satellite that was seen at the right terminus of II. Interestingly, all RTRS units above have 1&#x02013;4 partial hits to the 176 bp (blue) satellite sequence that was found in a long array concluding the right terminus of IV.

In all cases, the observed distances and locations were exceptionally close to projections based on known polytene map distances and locations. Thus, it is extremely likely that the three distal loci that physically interact at high frequencies according to Hi-C data are indeed the three Fold-Back Regions, which have not been previously known at the sequence level. The Hi-C interactions in male pupae and female adults indicate that the physical interactions of the X chromosome seen in polytene chromosome spreads are not in vitro artifacts, nor are the interactions limited to polytenes in larval salivary glands, as they now have been observed in vivo across different tissues and life stages in both sexes (male pupae and female adults). Overall, the FBR and X&#x02019; breakpoint locations further confirm the identity and structural accuracy of the X chromosome scaffold.

However, the sequences were previously not known, and whether they are composed of repeats has not been well-established. Given the likelihood that the three loci on the X with long-range Hi-C interactions correspond to the three FBRs, their scaffold locations and sequences were extracted and analyzed (Supplemental Tables <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>-&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S5</xref>). FBR scaffold locations were discovered by calling long-range Hi-C interaction peaks, after first filtering out short interactions less than 5&#x000a0;Mb (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>F-G; see Methods). The length of each FBR was in the ~&#x02009;103 kb to ~&#x02009;1.1 Mb range with interaction frequency summits in the 34&#x02013;69 kb range, depending on how boundaries were defined (see Methods). To maximize the chance of detecting long stretches of similarity among these regions, we used the longest estimates. When directly comparing the extracted sequences of these three loci by BLAST, there were stretches of similarity found in all three (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>H). Although some matches reached the kb range, most stretches were short (&#x0003c; 200 bp), and most or all were associated with repeats found elsewhere in the genome. The FBRs did not have shared repeat families specific to these regions. Looking at the distribution of repeats across the X chromosome, it is plausible that the first locus, putative FBR1, is embedded in a highly repetitive region, but less likely for the two downstream loci (putative FBRs 2 and 3), which appear to be in relatively unique regions (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A, B, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>G). When comparing the entire X chromosome to itself using dot plots, if these regions had high similarity the length of up to three polytene bands, there would be off-diagonal &#x0201c;dots&#x0201d; on the dot plots corresponding to the locus pairs analogous to that seen in the Hi-C interaction frequency plots. However, such long stretches of similarity are not seen in those off-diagonal locations (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>B). Overall, the evidence suggests that although the three FBR loci interact, it is not necessarily due to vast stretches of sequence homology or repeats that would span 1&#x02013;3 polytene bands (tens to hundreds of kb). However, this does not exclude the possibility that one or a few of the shorter stretches shared between the regions are important aspects of their physical interactions. In contrast to FBRs 2 and 3 being in relatively repeat-poor regions of the X chromosome, the X&#x02019; inversion breakpoints are both buried in repetitive domains corresponding to peri-centromeric and sub-telomeric regions, which do share more similarity with each other (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A, B, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>G). The 5&#x02019; breakpoint and nearby putative FBR1 are embedded in a repeat block seen on the X scaffold dot plot near the centromeric (left) end of the chromosome that has high similarity with the right terminal repeat block (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A, B, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>G). The presence of the FBRs on both the X and X&#x02019; suggest the FBRs and their interactions preceded the inversion, and it is possible that the evolution of the long paracentric inversion on the X&#x02019; was mediated by the systematic fold-back interactions of FBR1 and FBR3 bringing these peri-centromeric and sub-telomeric repeat blocks close together.</p><p id="Par59">In addition to repeats, there are also genes within the boundaries of all three putative FBR loci (as well as for the X&#x02019; inversion breakpoints). Thus, it is also possible that the long-range fold-back interactions may be involved in regulation of a gene or genes in the fold-back regions, or that these regions each have representatives from a shared gene family. To maximize the sensitivity of finding a gene family with members in all three regions, we focused again on the broader region boundaries, not the narrowest estimates. Depending on the gene annotation set and FBR boundaries used, there are 85&#x02013;203 genes across all three FBRs with 35&#x02013;78 in FBR1, 29&#x02013;80 in FBR2, and 21&#x02013;45 in FBR3 (Supplemental Tables <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>-&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>). Regarding whether there are homologous genes in these regions, some of the stretches of nucleotide similarity shared by all three FBRs do overlap gene boundaries, but almost exclusively in introns, with very few exon hits and no coding sequence (CDS) overlaps. In agreement, there appears to be no homologous protein family represented in all three regions when analyzing protein sequence similarity with BLASTP. The regions of similarity at the nucleotide level within introns are largely from transposons and other repeats. Nevertheless, we cannot exclude the possibility that some stretches of similarity in the introns or near genes in general are regulatory elements shared by the FBRs. It is also possible that FBR-specific sequences, not found elsewhere in the genome, are important. There are millions of FBR-specific kmers of various sizes (15&#x02013;80 bp) not found elsewhere in the genome. These kmers correspond to on the order 0.5&#x02013;1 Mb of sequence from hundreds to thousands of sub-regions of the FBRs up to hundreds of bp in length, which also lack BLAST hits elsewhere in the genome. Approximately 70% of this sequence is within genes and a partially-overlapping ~&#x02009;16&#x02013;17% corresponds to highly diverged repeats, but ~&#x02009;23.5% is intergenic and not labeled as a repeat. Thus, there may be intergenic (and genic) FBR-specific nucleotide elements that are found in one or more of the FBRs, but not elsewhere in the genome.</p><p id="Par60">We explored the nature of the genes within the broadly defined FBR regions as well as those genes closest to the interaction frequency summits (Supplemental Tables <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>-&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S5</xref>). Each had a mixture of protein-coding and long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) genes. Although the FBRs were not enriched for lncRNA genes compared to other regions of similar size on the X scaffold, a lncRNA gene was one of the closest genes to the summit of FBR1. The genes across the three FBRs were not enriched for any particular GO terms. The other genes closest to the FBR1 summit were similar to a transcriptional activator (mushroom body large-type Kenyon cell-specific protein 1) and a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR; 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 1-like). The summit of FBR2 was close to three uncharacterized genes and a gene similar to &#x0201c;upstream activation factor subunit spp27&#x0201d; that may be a transcriptional activator of RNA Pol I; and the summit of FBR3 was close to a gene predicted to be involved in actin depolymerization (F-actin-monooxygenase Mical), a cysteine hydrolase (carboxymethylenebutenolidase), among other genes. Finally, the long paracentric inversion breakpoint interaction summits were near several genes, including a protein phosphatase PP2 A subunit and a histone-lysine N-methyltransferase, both of which may be interesting with respect to the mechanism of differential X chromosome elimination in embryogenesis.</p><p id="Par61">In addition to the FBRs, there are other, smaller Mb-range interaction dots in the Hi-C maps of the X chromosome, especially in the X&#x02019;X female Hi-C map (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>D-E, Supplemental Fig. S2, S6, S7). However, many of the smaller dots seen in X chromosome Hi-C maps from X&#x02019;X data are likely from structural differences, including a different transposition landscape, between the X and X&#x02019; chromosomes as recently studied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Indeed, many of the same &#x0201c;long-range interaction&#x0201d; dots appear even when treating genomic DNA sequencing data from X&#x02019;X female adults as if it were also Hi-C data (Supplemental Fig. S6 A). In support, those dots are missing from the X chromosome Hi-C map for males, which lack the X&#x02019; (Supplemental Fig. S6B). The size of the dots corresponding to structural differences between the X and X&#x02019; are tiny compared to interacting regions corresponding to the FBRs, suggesting that true Mb-range interactions on the X chromosome (or FBRs specifically) involve large regions whereas structural differences only affect small regions of the map. Therefore, it is interesting that the long paracentric inversion breakpoints also cover large regions comparable to the FBRs, suggesting those regions not only represent a known structural difference between X and X&#x02019;, but also that the regions around those breakpoints interact similar to FBRs. After removing long-range interaction dots in the X&#x02019;X data that correspond to structural differences, FBRs, and the long paracentric inversion breakpoints, there remained seven long-range interactions of interest spanning 8&#x02013;55 Mb (Supplemental Fig. S7 A, Supplemental Table S6), four of which were also in the male Hi-C map (Supplemental Fig. S7B). Finally, we also identified a 12 Mb long-range interaction on the left side of chromosome IV (Supplemental Fig. S2D, Supplemental Tables S6 and S14). The genes that were within the regions of highest interaction frequencies for the pairs of loci corresponding to each of the eight dots contain mixtures of protein-coding and lncRNA genes (Supplemental Tables S6-S14). Genes from the X dots include histone deactylases, transcription factors, transporters, acting and actin-binding proteins, insulin-related peptides, and a broad swath of other types of genes (Supplemental Tables S7-S13). One gene that jumped out to us was related to the sex determination protein &#x0201c;fruitless&#x0201d; (&#x0201c;fru&#x0201d;), which was in &#x0201c;X-dot- 4&#x0201d; (Supplemental Figure S7, Supplemental Table S9), a long-range interaction that was only present in the X&#x02019;X female Hi-C map, not in the male Hi-C map (Supplemental Figure S7).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par62"><italic>Bradysia coprophila</italic>, a dark-winged fungus gnat from the lower Diptera (Nematocera), has interesting chromosomal biology that includes developmentally-programmed examples of elimination, non-disjunction, polytenization, intrachromosomal amplification, and maternally-acting sex chromosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].

A crucial part of the toolbox for studying these phenomena is a genome sequence. The previous reference genome sequence for <italic>Bradysia coprophila</italic>, Bcop_v1, was a high quality, high contiguity assembly of the somatic genome (chromosomes X, II, III, IV) produced from PacBio RS II and Oxford Nanopore MinION long read data from male embryos, and subsequently scaffolded with optical maps of male pupal DNA molecules from BioNano Genomics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Bcop_v1 was produced through an extensive evaluation process comparing nearly 100 assemblies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Moreover, as <italic>Bradysia coprophila</italic> males have only one copy of the X chromosome, but two copies of autosomes, all contigs in Bcop_v1 were classified as X-linked or autosomal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Finally, two gene annotation sets were constructed for Bcop_v1: we produced one using Maker2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>] and NCBI produced one for RefSeq [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. However, Bcop_v1 was not chromosome-scale and mostly not anchored into chromosomes, limiting its usefulness in studying the evolution and behaviors of <italic>Bradysia coprophila</italic> chromosomes.</p><p id="Par63">Our goal in this project was to improve the reference genome assembly for <italic>Bradysia coprophila</italic> to better-facilitate studies of its interesting chromosome behaviors and evolution. To do so, we upgraded Bcop_v1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] to chromosome-scale scaffolds (Bcop_v2) using Hi-C technology. The updated assembly of the <italic>Bradysia coprophila</italic> somatic genome (Bcop_v2) represents each chromosome (X, II, III, IV) as its own scaffold for the first time, and is oriented in the same direction as polytene maps produced in the 1960 s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] to be consistent with historical research. The chromosomal identities of the scaffolds were established and supported several ways, including multiple anchor sequences, chromosome lengths, depth of coverage, centromere positions, and other idiosyncrasies of the X chromosome. The accuracy of the chromosomal structure of the scaffolds was also supported by multiple approaches, including the concordance of anchor sequence locations along the scaffolds with their locations along polytene maps, the relative positioning of centromeres and telomeres, the increasing enrichment of repeats with proximity to centromeric and telomeric regions, and other landmarks on the X chromosome (FBRs and X&#x02019; breakpoints). As studies are ongoing across multiple research groups with the gene annotation sets produced for Bcop_v1, we lifted over these gene annotation sets directly onto the chromosome-scale scaffolds so researchers can seamlessly transition ongoing studies from Bcop_v1 to Bcop_v2. The chromosomal specificity of the genes within each chromosome scaffold was further supported by comparative genomics, which showed that the chromosomes of more closely related species were far more similar in terms of gene sets than more distantly related species, both visually and using entropy statistics, the latter of which also reproduces expected phylogenetic species groupings. The totality of evidence overwhelmingly suggests that Bcop_v2 contains high quality scaffolds of the four somatic <italic>B. coprophila</italic> chromosomes (X, II, III, IV).</p><p id="Par64">The rich history of studying <italic>B. coprophila</italic> chromosomes with respect to polytene map zones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] has been a major benefit in producing and interpreting these chromosome-scale scaffolds. For example, previous in situ hybridization studies that identified the chromosomal addresses of cloned DNA sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] has allowed us to identify the chromosomal identity of each chromosome-scale scaffold, orient them according to the polytene maps, test their structural accuracy, map their centromeric regions, and even to study known features of the X corresponding Fold-Back Regions and breakpoints of a long paracentric inversion on a variant of the X chromosome called the X&#x02019; (X prime). The locations of polytene zones on the chromosome scaffolds will help integrate information from polytene chromosome studies into modern genomics analyses. In the future, a systematic set of FISH probes informed by the scaffolds in combination with using Hi-C to identify the boundaries of bands and interbands seen in polytenes, which have been associated with topologically associated domains (TADs) in <italic>Drosophila</italic> polytene chromosomes using Hi-C data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>], could further anchor the scaffolds into the polytene zone landscape of each chromosome.</p><p id="Par65">As Bcop_v2 is derived from scaffolding Bcop_v1, there were no significant changes to conclusions about the types and amounts of repeats reported previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. However, the repeats in Bcop_v1 are scattered across hundreds of unanchored contig sequences whereas the scaffolds of Bcop_v2 allow us to see where the repeats are located within the chromosomes. We found recognizable repeat families concentrated around peri-centromeric and sub-telomeric regions with different propensities. Retrotransposon orders in general, and especially those classified as LINE (non-LTR), were very enriched in pericentromeric regions, including the LINE/RTE -family as shown to be enriched around centromeres previously&#x000a0;for a specific ScRTE family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Despite a major bias towards centromeric regions, retrotransposon related sequences and reverse transcriptase BLAST hits are found throughout scaffold terminal regions as well, including within 10 kb of most termini. Retroelements have also been shown to be enriched in functional <italic>Drosophila</italic> centromeres [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>], and to make up and play an important role in maintaining <italic>Drosophila</italic> telomeres [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].

The telomeres of <italic>Drosophila</italic>, a &#x0201c;higher&#x0201d; Dipteran, are composed of telomere-specific retrotransposons (TSRTs) that point towards the centromere and are maintained by their reverse transcriptase genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. The telomeres of lower Dipterans are less well understood. <italic>Rhynchosciara americana</italic> appears to have 14&#x02013;22 bp long tandem repeats, which might be maintained by a TSRT related to <italic>Drosophila</italic> TSRTs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Non-biting midges (Chironomidae) have"Long Complex Terminal Tandem Repeats"(LCTTRs) with a unit length of 176 bp in one species and ~&#x02009;350 bp in another species, although the latter appears to have evolved from a simpler 175 bp repeat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The long repeats in midges might be maintained by homologous recombination or gene conversion, although long complementary RNAs have been observed, suggesting an RNA intermediate as with telomerase and TSRTs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. A mosquito has even longer repeat lengths of ~&#x02009;820 bp in its telomeres, and at least one higher Dipteran, <italic>Drosophila tristis</italic>, has LCTTRs of similar length to midges (181 bp) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In at least some midges, and in some insects more generally, telomeres can differ from each other, and some telomeric repeats may also be seen in centromeric regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>].</p><p id="Par67">We checked the scaffold termini for signatures of known telomeric systems. As with all Diptera, Telomerase Reverse Transcriptase (TERT) was not found in the <italic>B. coprophila</italic> genome sequence nor proteome, nor was the associated hexamer/pentamer (TTAGGG/TTAGG) or other variant found at scaffold ends. Non-LTR retrotransposons (HeT-A, TART, TAHRE) make up and maintain <italic>Drosophila</italic> telomeres [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], and TART copies were also found near the chromosome ends of a more closely related species, <italic>Rhynchosciara americana</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Although all these transposons are possibly too far diverged to find matches in the terminal regions of <italic>B. coprophila</italic> chromosome scaffolds (Bcop_v2), reverse transcriptase genes can certainly be found in the sub-telomeric regions, even within the first 10 kb. Moreover, the left termini of the <italic>B. coprophila</italic> autosomal scaffolds all seem to have arrays of retrotransposon-related sequences (RTRS) with units in the 1.7&#x02013;3.3 kb range and both termini of the X scaffold were associated with retrotransposons in the repeat annotation. <italic>Rhynchosciara</italic> was also shown to have a &#x0201c;special type of short tandem repeats&#x0201d; (stSTRs) of 14&#x02013;22 bp [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Given their close evolutionary relationship, <italic>B. coprophila</italic> might be expected to have the same system. However, we did not find short repeats at the <italic>B. coprophila</italic> chromosome scaffold termini, although tandem arrays of short repeats may be found further inward in the sub-telomeric regions. It is also possible that <italic>B. coprophila</italic> has Long Complex Terminal Tandem Repeats (LCTTRs) like those found in Chironomidae and Culicidae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Indeed, we found a set of satellite sequences with unit lengths of 161&#x02013;176 bp associated with the right termini of autosomal scaffolds. These terminal and sub-terminal satellites were also seen in peri-centromeric regions as was also seen in some midges [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. We note that the repeat lengths of these satellites are similar to nucleosome spacing lengths. For example, the length of DNA per nucleosome in <italic>Drosophila</italic> is ~&#x02009;175 bp [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>], which includes the linker region, and two of these candidate repeats are exactly 175&#x02013;176 bp. Interestingly, all 1.7&#x02013;3.3 kb RTRS units above have 1&#x02013;4 partial hits to the 176 bp satellite sequence, suggesting an ancient relationship between these satellites and transposons. This is also reminiscent of the cycling between retroelements and satellite DNAs found in the centromeres and telomeres across several <italic>Drosophila</italic> species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. Although it is possible that some of the scaffold termini may be sub-telomeric, as opposed to telomeric, our current model for <italic>B. coprophila</italic> telomeres based on the termini of these chromosome-scale scaffolds appears to include arrays of both RTRS and LCTTR satellites where autosomal centromere-proximal (left) termini are more correlated with RTRS arrays and centromere-distal (right) termini are more correlated with LCTTR arrays. This may be similar to other insects where different telomere sequences have been found on different chromosomes and even on the opposite sides of the same chromosome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>].</p><p id="Par68">The X chromosome scaffold has already benefited a study of the X chromosome variant, X-prime (X&#x02019;), which differs from the X by a large paracentric inversion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The X and X&#x02019; are thought to recombine inefficiently due to this inversion, and analyzing the divergence inside the inverted region suggested (i) the inversion is recent, perhaps originating within the last 0.5 million years, and (ii) there are internal blocks with different divergence rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. There are also interesting biological signals in the Hi-C maps that can be explored further. The notable example here are the three dots on the X chromosome Hi-C map that appear in the expected pattern of the three fold-back regions (FBRs) identified by Crouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Now that we have identified the fold-back region sequences within the scaffolds, it will be possible to begin defining what mediates their interactions and what function is served by doing so. Our work definitively shows that these interactions happen not just in spreads of larval polytene chromosomes, but in vivo in whole male pupae and female adults. The circular fold-back structure is not seen in spreads of mitotic chromosomes where the X is a rod. Therefore, the in vivo Hi-C interaction signal is likely not from mitotic chromosomes. However, in addition to signal from polytene chromosomes, the in vivo signal from whole pupae and adults could reflect fold-back interactions in interphase chromosomes of diploid cells. Indeed, polytene chromosomes are thought to be analogous to the interphase state.</p><p id="Par69">The X chromosome foldbacks seen in Sciarid polytene chromosomes might be a cytological manifestation of long-range loop interactions that have been described in other systems, such as mosquitoes and <italic>Drosophila</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. For example, mosquitos typically have loops spanning less than 1&#x000a0;Mb, but certain mosquito species have up to six giant loops spanning loci that are up to 31 Mb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. Moreover, one of the giant loops is on the mosquito X chromosome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. It is tempting to speculate that this might be evolutionarily related to the interactions among the three foldback regions (FBRs) seen on the <italic>B. coprophila</italic> X and X&#x02019; chromosomes where FBR1 and FBR2 are separated by 10.3 Mb and FBR2 and FBR3 are separated by 42.7 Mb (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab9" ref-type="table">9</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, meta-domains reflect interactions between TADs that are separated by up to 50 Mb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. Therefore, long range interactions as described here for the <italic>B. coprophila</italic> foldback regions on the X and X&#x02019; chromosome may have counterparts in other lower (eg, mosquito) and higher (eg, Drosophila) dipteran insects. Overall, it will be exciting to further elucidate in future studies what sequences and proteins mediate the long-range fold-back interactions, what function the long-range interactions serve, whether these regions and interactions are involved in other aspects of X chromosome biology, and if these interactions play a role in facilitating structural rearrangements on the X and X&#x02019; chromosomes.</p><p id="Par70">The chromosome-level nature of Bcop_v2 will allow researchers to design experiments and analyze data in a chromosome-specific way, the X chromosome being a shining example as described above. The location and sequences of the telomeres and centromeres are now more obvious and open to future investigation. The <italic>B. coprophila</italic> chromosome scaffolds will allow proper studies of synteny and chromosome evolution across closely and distantly related flies, and will be a valuable data point for investigations into ancestral karyotypes given the rearrangements and translocations of syntenic blocks across Dipteran evolution, as has been done for mosquitoes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>].

However, despite the emphasis on chromosome biology in this system, it lacked full-length sequence models of the chromosomes. To rectify this, a high quality Mb-scale genome assembly created from single-molecule long-read datasets from Oxford Nanopore, PacBio, and BioNano Genomics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] was further corrected and scaffolded to the chromosome-scale using Hi-C data from male pupae. The chromosome scaffolds were demonstrated to be of remarkable quality, and allowed us to test and explore several aspects of fungus gnat chromosomes. Regions along the scaffolds containing alleged horizontally-transferred genes have the same level of evidence and support as regions containing highly conserved Dipteran genes, supporting the possibility of HGT and ruling out artifacts from contamination. LINE-related retrotransposons are enriched in centromeric and pericentromeric regions whereas DNA transposons exhibit a sub-telomeric bias. The telomeres of fungus gnat chromosomes appear to harbor long complex terminal tandem repeats (LCTTRs) as has been seen in midges, but also may involve arrays of retrotransposon-related sequences. Finally, the physical interactions between three loci on the X chromosome seen on polytene chromosome spreads is not limited to larval salivary gland polytenes nor is it an artifact of the fixation and spreading procedures for polytene chromosome preparations as these physical interactions are also detected in vivo by Hi-C of whole male pupae and whole female adults. The regions of these three loci were identified along the X scaffold, and their sequences analyzed for the first time. Although these loci were long described in cytological studies as &#x0201c;three three-band repeats&#x0201d;, genomic analyses suggest the three regions are not simply three long paralogous sequences. They do not share the same genes, but may share short sequences. The chromosome-scale genome sequence, its gene annotations, its associated data, and the insights produced in this manuscript will be immediately useful and of major importance to the growing research community interested in the unique chromosome biology of <italic>Bradysia coprophila</italic>, and more generally to those interested in genome assembly, chromosome biology, Dipteran evolution, horizontal gene transfer, insect telomeres, and long-range chromosome interactions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec12"><title>Male pupae collection</title><p id="Par72">The dark-winged fungus gnat, <italic>Bradysia coprophila</italic>, was previously referred to as <italic>Sciara coprophila</italic> in chromosomal and molecular biology research papers since the 1920 s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>], and is also known by other names such as <italic>Sciara tilicola</italic> and <italic>Sciara amoena</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].

Following the manufacturer's instructions, intact cells from two samples of finely ground frozen male pupae were crosslinked using a formaldehyde solution, digested using the Sau3 A1 (^GATC) restriction enzyme, and proximity-ligated with biotinylated nucleotides. This creates chimeric molecules made from DNA fragments that came close together in vivo, but that may not be close together along the genome sequence. As instructed by the manufacturer's protocol, the chimeric molecules were pulled down with streptavidin beads and processed into an Illumina-compatible sequencing library.

The Hi-C data was processed, as described below, according to Phase Genomics recommendations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. To produce a corrected assembly, the reads were aligned to the 205 primary contigs of Bcop_v1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] using BWA-MEM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>] with the &#x02212; 5SP and -t 8 options specified, and all other options default.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. As in the LACHESIS method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], the Proximo scaffolding process computes an interaction frequency matrix from the aligned Hi-C read pairs that is normalized by the number of DPNII restriction sites (^GATC) on each contig. Proximo then constructs scaffolds by optimizing the expected interaction frequencies and other statistical patterns in Hi-C data. Using a brute-force approach, approximately 20,000 separate Proximo runs were performed to optimize the number of scaffolds and the concordance with the observed Hi-C data. Finally, Juicebox [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>] was again used to manually inspect for mis-join signals corresponding to scaffolding errors. The associated contigs from Bcop_v1 that were not included during the Hi-C scaffolding process were added back. Note that we also tried including the Bcop_v1 &#x0201c;associated contigs&#x0201d; (haplotigs, etc.) during the Hi-C scaffolding process. In doing so, we found that although the resulting scaffolds were extremely similar to those produced from using only the primary contigs, it resulted in erroneously stitching together primary and associated contigs previously identified as haplotigs rather than keeping them separate. Therefore, the results of using only the primary assembly were preferred.</p><p id="Par76">At the end of the scaffolding and correction process, there were 58 separate sequences not placed into the four chromosome-scale scaffolds (&#x0201c;unplaced&#x0201d;): 57 unscaffolded input contigs and a short (363 kb) Hi-C scaffold of 6 input contigs. Of the 57 unscaffolded input contigs, 46 were marked as &#x0201c;debris&#x0201d; (the regions cut out during the Hi-C correction step above). The &#x0201c;debris&#x0201d; was largely comprised of optical-map gap sequences from the input assembly. Six unscaffolded debris sequences ranging from ~&#x02009;25&#x02013;50 kb that had 100% N content were removed from the assembly (leaving 52 unplaced sequences). Furthermore, 24 unscaffolded sequences had leading or trailing NNNNN-content ranging from 1,489&#x02014;36,461 bp, making up ~&#x02009;6&#x02014;96% of the unscaffolded sequences in which they resided, that was trimmed off. Only ~&#x02009;19.5 kb of internal N content remained in the cleaned-up debris regions after removal and trimming of N-gap sequence. The primary assembly for Bcop_v2 consists of the four chromosome-scale scaffolds whereas the associated assembly for Bcop_v2 consists of the 52 cleaned-up unplaced sequences as well as all the &#x0201c;associated contigs&#x0201d; from Bcop_v1. For simplicity, even though the associated assembly of Bcop_v2 contains a scaffolded sequence, they are all referred to as &#x02018;associated contigs&#x02019; throughout. In Bcop_v2, the retained BioNano Genomics optical map gap sequences are represented as capital N&#x02019;s in the assembly and are of variable estimated lengths whereas the Hi-C gap sequences are represented as lower-case n&#x02019;s and are always arbitrarily set to 100 bp in length.</p><p id="Par77">There were 539 &#x0201c;associated contigs&#x0201d; from Bcop_v1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], largely comprised of haplotigs and repeat variants, that were not included during the Hi-C scaffolding process, which summed to 10.8 Mb and were ~&#x02009;20 kb on average.

Target-linked mate locations (interactions) in BEDPE format were visualized as arcs or links in IGV, which all emanate from the target region bin. However, although visualizing the links this way helps see all regions that are connected to the target bin by paired reads, it vastly misrepresents the interaction frequencies. Therefore, to visualize interaction frequencies across the scaffold, BEDtools was used to count the number of target-linked mates in bins that were constructed on the contig-bearing scaffold starting from the start/stop boundaries of the target region. Since interaction frequency decays with distance, log10 was also used (after adding a pseudocount of 1 to all bins) to better visualize long-distance interactions, such that a log10 score of 0 represented 0 interactions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Testing coverage expectations of the X chromosome compared to autosomes</title><p id="Par81">Sequencing and mapping coverage across the four chromosome-scale scaffolds was visualized using a variety of orthogonal genomic datasets produced with different technologies and different life stages from previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].

For simplicity and higher specificity, we used only the subset of Ortho Groups that are composed of a single ortholog from each and all of the five species, otherwise known as Single Copy Orthologs (SCOs). Thus, using the genomic location of a single gene from each species in an orthogroup of SCOs, we can make dot plots (or scatter plots), that show the location of the &#x0201c;same&#x0201d; gene in one species&#x02019; genome on the X-axis and another species&#x02019; genome on the Y-axis.

We call this approach EGGS (<underline>E</underline>ntropy of <underline>G</underline>ene <underline>G</underline>roup <underline>S</underline>huffling), of which code to help reproduce these entropy calculations can be found <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/JohnUrban/Bcop_v2">https://github.com/JohnUrban/Bcop_v2</ext-link>. Briefly, entropy can be thought of as a measure of uncertainty, information, disorder, or &#x0201c;mixed-up-ness&#x0201d;, and is often used to study systems that evolve from a highly ordered to a highly disordered state or from a non-random to a random state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Mathematically, entropy is defined as &#x02212; 1 times the sum of p*log(p) for all probabilities, p, in a set of probabilities, P. That is, &#x02212; 1*sum(p*log(p)). When log base 2 is used, entropy is expressed in &#x0201c;bits&#x0201d;. For &#x0201c;gene shuffling&#x0201d;, the initial non-random (lowest entropy) state corresponds to how genes are grouped on chromosomes within a given species. As genes get shuffled around into different chromosomal groupings across evolutionary time, they approach randomized (high entropy) states with respect to some target species (e.g., <italic>B. coprophila</italic>). To calculate the entropy between any two species, we used only SCOs that appeared on the chromosome-scale scaffolds of each species, which is to say we excluded those that appeared on unplaced contigs. We counted the number of SCOs that appeared on each pair of inter-species chromosomes (i.e. chromosome &#x0201c;i&#x0201d; from species A and chromosome &#x0201c;j&#x0201d; from species B), added a pseudo-count of 0.1 to the SCO count of each inter-species pair, then divided each inter-species pair SCO count by the sum of SCO counts across all pairs of inter-species chromosomes (including pseudo-counts). Note that, for <italic>D. melanogaster and A. gambiae,</italic> the SCO counts from the left and right arms of chromosomes 2 and 3 (2L, 2R, 3L, 3R) were summed to get the full counts for those chromosomes (2L +&#x02009;2R, 3L +&#x02009;3R). For each pair of species, this gave a table of joint probabilities of a SCO appearing on chromosome &#x0201c;i&#x0201d; from species A and chromosome &#x0201c;j&#x0201d; from species B (see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref> for an example). The inter-species entropy was computed from these joint probabilities using the entropy equation: &#x02212; 1*sum(p*log2(p)), where p is the matrix of joint probabilities. However, as each pairwise species comparison has a different lowest possible entropy state (the non-random initial state) and a different highest possible (fully random) entropy state given their SCO counts per chromosome, we needed to use min&#x02013;max normalization ((X-min)/(max&#x02013;min)) in order to compare entropy values across pairwise inter-species comparisons. To calculate the minimum (initial) entropy state for each species within the context of a pairwise comparison, we marginalized (i.e. summed) over the joint probabilities to get the marginal probabilities that a SCO came from each chromosome for a given species. The entropy of the marginal probabilities of both species was then computed separately, using the equation above, and averaged together to get the lowest entropy value the joint probabilities could take. When comparing a species to itself, the average simply returns the entropy of the marginal probabilities for that species. To calculate the maximum (fully random) entropy state between two species, the marginal probabilities for each chromosome of a given species were multiplied by the marginal probabilities for each chromosome of the other species. This yielded a table of fully-random joint probabilities where the probability of a SCO appearing on chromosome &#x0201c;i&#x0201d; from species A and chromosome &#x0201c;j&#x0201d; from species B was simply the product of the marginal probability of a SCO appearing on chromosome &#x0201c;i&#x0201d; from species A and the marginal probability of a SCO appearing on chromosome &#x0201c;j&#x0201d; from species B. For the given chromosomal SCO counts for each species, this produces the joint probabilities expected at random, and maximum entropy is computed on it as above: &#x02212; 1*sum(p*log2(p)), where p is the matrix of random joint probabilities. The Seaborn library [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref>] in Python3 was used to visualize the min&#x02013;max normalized entropy scores calculated against <italic>B. coprophila</italic> as a bar plot and all pairwise entropy scores as a clustered-heatmap.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Testing gene locations of &#x0201c;alien&#x0201d; P450 genes within the chromosome-scale scaffolds using a variety of genomic datasets</title><p id="Par88">If the &#x0201c;alien&#x0201d; cytochrome P450 (&#x0201c;CYP&#x0201d;) genes reported recently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] are contained within the nuclear chromosomes, then they should exhibit expected Hi-C interaction frequencies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] within the scaffolds. If they are external contamination erroneously stitched into the scaffold sequences, there should be severe drops in the Hi-C interaction frequency signal with these genes and the rest of the scaffold they reside in. To obtain all Hi-C interactions between a given &#x0201c;alien&#x0201d; P450 gene and all other sites in the genome, the same procedure described above for contig ends was used, here using Hi-C paired-end reads that had at least one of the mates mapped within the gene. For each &#x0201c;alien&#x0201d; P450 gene, the closest highly conserved fly gene that had a similar length (within 1% difference) was also interrogated the same way. Interactions and interaction frequencies in 100 kb bins were computed and visualized in IGV similar as described above, but with important differences. The number of interactions between a gene and the rest of the genome, and whether interactions are sparse or dense, is a function of gene length. To make valid comparisons with nearby conserved fly genes, gene length was controlled for in two ways. The first was to use nearby conserved fly genes of similar size (within 1%), as stated above. This helped match the observed interaction sparsity or density. The second was to normalize counts to each gene&#x02019;s length, then multiply by 10,000 such that the magnitude of counts for all genes corresponded to a gene length of 10 kb, which was chosen since the &#x0201c;alien&#x0201d; gene lengths spanned from ~&#x02009;1.8&#x02013;7.8 kb.</p><p id="Par89">Read depth can also differ significantly at sites of contamination, especially across different biological samples. Some samples may show low or no sequencing depth over sites where contamination was integrated into a genome assembly.

Two datasets were explored: male (XO) pupae data from this study as well as female X&#x02019;X Hi-C data from a recent analysis of the X&#x02019; chromosome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. We used our own method called SCOPE (<underline>S</underline>catter <underline>C</underline>lusters <underline>O</underline>f <underline>P</underline>aired <underline>E</underline>nds), of which the specific code for the analyses in this paper can be found at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/JohnUrban/Bcop_v2">https://github.com/JohnUrban/Bcop_v2</ext-link>. Briefly, paired-end Hi-C reads (in Juicer&#x02019;s Extra Short format [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]) that mapped to the X chromosome using the above pipeline were read into R where map locations were further processed to filter for paired reads with (i) inter-mate distances of at least 1&#x000a0;Mb, and (ii) minimum mapping qualities (MAPQ) of 10, although a range of MAPQs were explored, including no filtering, and gave similar end results. The 2D Binned Kernel Density Estimate (from the &#x02018;KernSmooth&#x02019; package) was then taken using a 1024 &#x000d7;&#x02009;1024 grid (~ 68.9 kb bins) with 250 kb smoothing bandwidths on both the x- and y- axes corresponding to where mate1 and mate2 mapped across the X. During optimization and exploratory analyses, kernel-smoothed 2D grids were visualized using levelplot from the &#x02018;lattice&#x02019; package. Peaks in the Z (heat) dimension of the 2D grid were called by identifying x,y-coordinates where the Z dimension was above the 99.8 th percentile across the entire grid. In other words, Z-peaks corresponded to pairs of distant loci (&#x0003e; 1&#x000a0;Mb) with the highest numbers of Hi-C reads connecting them. The x,y-coordinates of peaks in the 2D grid were then hierarchically clustered, and the tree was cut to identify k&#x02009;= 12 peak clusters on the 2D grid. The median, minimum, and maximum x- and y- coordinates of each cluster were obtained to help define the centers and the boundaries of interacting pairs of loci on the X chromosome, as was the coordinates of the peak summit bin (the bin with the highest interaction frequency in a peak cluster). The peak clusters were filtered for those whose median x-coordinates were separated by 5&#x000a0;Mb from the median y-coordinates. In other words, these were loci pairs separated by at least 5&#x000a0;Mb. Three of the four remaining peak clusters separated by at least 5&#x000a0;Mb corresponded to the interactions between putative FBRs 1 and 2, putative FBRs 1 and 3, and putative FBRs 2 and 3. The fourth remaining peak cluster corresponded to the breakpoint dots for the long paracentric inversion with the X&#x02019;. The peak clusters for loci separated by less than 5&#x000a0;Mb may correspond to (i) other smaller structural variations between the X&#x02019; and X, and (ii) other shorter Mb-range interactions of distal loci. The regions corresponding to the three FBRs and the two main X&#x02019; breakpoints were visualized on Hi-C maps using JuiceBox [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. Note that using inter-mate distances of 5&#x000a0;Mb instead of 1&#x000a0;Mb and k&#x02009;= 4 clusters gave the same end results without needing further filtering. With these parameters peak clusters ranged from 551 kb to 1.1 Mb (8&#x02013;16 bins) and had summit bins of 68.9 kb. We also identified parameters for much narrower estimates of FBR locations using MAPQ of 10, intermate distance minimum of 5&#x000a0;Mb, a 2048 &#x000d7;&#x02009;2048 grid (~ 34.4 kb bins) with a smoothing bandwidth of 50 kb, a peak quantile threshold of 0.9999, and k&#x02009;= 4 peak clusters, which produced four interaction peak clusters in the ~&#x02009;103&#x02013;551 kb range (3&#x02013;16 bins) with summit bin estimates of ~&#x02009;34.4 kb.</p><p id="Par93">The nucleotide distances between the mid-points of the FBR regions, X&#x02019; breakpoints, and centromeres observed on the X scaffold were compared to expected nucleotide distances given corresponding polytene map distances in proportion to the length of the X chromosome scaffold.

Assuming nucleotide lengths of zones are also similar, the ~&#x02009;70.5 Mb X-scaffold would indicate zone lengths of ~&#x02009;5 Mb and sub-zone lengths of ~&#x02009;1.68 Mb, which we used to compute expected lengths. The FBR coordinates were used to define both the sequences of the FBRs as well as the Genomic Complement (the genome sequence excluding the FBRs).

SAG collected male pupae, coordinated with Phase Genomics, and helped with chromosome maps and map positions. Hi-C library preparation, sequencing, and scaffolding was performed as a service provided by Phase Genomics. JMU performed the original Bcop_v1 assembly, and corresponded with Phase Genomics during the optimization process for Bcop_v2 scaffolding. JMU performed all subsequent analyses and operations, including subsequent Hi-C data processing, analysis, exploration and visualizations in all figures, chromosome identification, scaffold orientation, assembly evaluations, gene annotation lift-overs, comparative genomics and entropy analyses, HGT gene validations, repeat annotation and analyses, scaffold termini characterization, and fold-back repeat sequence extraction and characterization; JMU developed the ideas, analyses, and python/R code for dot plots (Lave), for entropy/MMNE analyses (EGGS), and for the long-range Hi-C interaction peak detection method to discover FBR and breakpoint locations (SCOPE); JMU made all figures and tables. ACS helped conceive of analyses, figures, and tables. All authors participated intellectually in the development and execution of this project. All authors wrote, read, and edited the manuscript.</p></notes><notes notes-type="funding-information"><title>Funding</title><p>Financial support has come from National Institutes of Health (NIH) NIH/GM121455 to SAG.
