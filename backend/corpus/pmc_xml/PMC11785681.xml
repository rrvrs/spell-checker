Limited information exists on intensive care unit (ICU) patients with the risk of suffering from the post-intensive care syndrome (PICS), summarizing long-term physical, mental and cognitive impairment. This web-based survey study aims to identify specific needs of former ICU patients for utilizing a newly developed, so called Post-Intensive Care Outcome Surveillance (PICOS) app to collect relevant PICS-related parameters. Methods: A prototype app was developed following interaction principles for interactive systems of usability engineering. Patients from four different German hospitals were asked about demographics, interaction with technology and their perception of the prototype regarding hedonic motivation, perceived ease of use and performance expectancy. Results: 123 patients participated in the survey; the majority owned and used smartphones. Nearly half of respondents would seek help from family members or caregivers using the app. There was a difference in affinity for technology for participants who own a smartphone and those who do not, t(116)&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;&#x02009;0.97, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;= .335, and no significant difference in affinity for technology whether the participants would like support when using the app or not, t(97)&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.81, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;= .073. The average hedonic motivation for using the app was M&#x02009;=&#x02009;4.44 (SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.304). Conclusion: This app prototype was perceived as both beneficial and easy to use, indicating its success among former ICU patients. Due to aging and ongoing health impairments, every second patient would need assistance with the initial use of the app.</p><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s10916-025-02151-w.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>PICS</kwd><kwd>mHealth</kwd><kwd>Mobile Application</kwd><kwd>Digital Health</kwd><kwd>Digital Skills</kwd><kwd>ICU</kwd><kwd>Mobile Phone</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Universit&#x000e4;tsklinikum RWTH Aachen (8915)</institution></funding-source></award-group><open-access><p>Open Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL.</p></open-access></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par7">The collection and analysis of data from former intensive care patients is particularly interesting due to the currently limited information available about this patient population. Survival rates of patients treated in intensive care units (ICU) have increased worldwide in recent years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. However, the period following a potentially protracted ICU stay is often characterized by a prolonged recovery process, including suffering from long-term physical, mental and cognitive impairments, a constellation of symptoms often referred to as post-intensive care syndrome (PICS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. This term is used to describe the interaction of a broad range of disorders arising after ICU discharge that were not diagnosed before ICU treatment. The prevalence of the symptoms varies widely among different ICU patient groups with an increased risk of morbidity and mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Furthermore, patients often need assistance in their daily life, which has a tremendous effect on the whole family life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. There is an urgent need to learn more about this particular patient group and potential long-term impairments.</p><p id="Par8">In this context, the development of a user-friendly, easy-to-handle and easy-to-understand app, would be beneficial (a) for the collection of data relevant to research on PICS, (b) to support a more personalized treatment, and (c) for engaging patients in daily self-care routines to learn and understand more about their own health condition. mHealth apps have shown successful results for other diseases to facilitate patient engagement and collect information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Since PICS-patients often exhibit significant constraints and a heterogeneous age range, it is particularly important to ascertain in advance how the app should be precisely tailored to ensure that patients derive satisfaction and are inclined to use it regularly.</p><p id="Par9">As part of the national Medical Informatics Initiative (MI-I), the DISTANCE project on which this research is based also strives to improve the availability of health-related data for research purposes. The prioritized aim of this research therefore was to identify the needs of former ICU patients for the utilization of an app to foster (a) and the potential for later extension to (b) and (c).</p><p id="Par10">The following objectives were addressed:</p><p id="Par11">O1: Development of a prototype of a patient-centred app, called the PICOS app (Post-Intensive Care Outcome Surveillance).</p><p id="Par12">O2: Presentation of O1 to former intensive care patients to answer the hypotheses H1 to H3 defined in chapter &#x0201c;Hypotheses&#x0201d;.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par13">The web-based survey was conducted as a multi-centre quality assurance measure and quantitative data from potential users were collected as an empirical evaluation procedure. The reporting complied with the CONSORT-EHEALTH checklist (V.1.6.1) by Eysenbach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] for evaluation reports of web-based and mobile health interventions.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study Use Case</title><p id="Par14">The study-related use case focuses on the aim of collecting PICS-relevant data for research through the app to be designed in this paper. As part of the national MI-I, this means that data is to be described using international standards (in particular HL7 FHIR) and managed via so-called data integration centers in order to make it reusable for research. Integration into hospital-specific electronic health records or the national electronic patient record is not intended currently. The sole purpose is data collection for research.</p><p id="Par15">In the future, after the patient&#x02019;s discharge, various parameters (see below) will be entered by the patient himself on his mobile device using the PICOS app, either daily or weekly. This data is transmitted to the data integration centre of the project-specific node of the MI-I. In addition, it is conceivable that the use case could be expanded in the future to include the research findings of this study to support healthcare provision.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Recruitment</title><p id="Par16">Potential future app users over 18 years old were recruited to take part in this survey study. Patients, who had been treated in the ICU for at least 72&#x000a0;h or who had been mechanically ventilated for more than 24&#x000a0;h were eligible to participate. As the aim of the survey is a potential impairment of PICS in former intensive care patients, participants were screened as soon as they met the criteria for potential ICU discharge and were then included upon transfer to the general ward. Pregnant women (due to potentially redundant hospital stay due to other reasons) and patients who were unable complete the questionnaire themselves were excluded. Study nurses approached potential participants on the general ward shortly after their transfer from the intensive care unit to enrol them into the survey study, just as it will be when patients use the PICOS app. The future aim is to ensure that patients can begin using the app while still hospitalized on the general ward, allowing project staff to be readily available for any questions or assistance.The questionnaire was written in German. Patients were recruited from four different hospitals in Germany: University Hospital RWTH Aachen, University Hospital Jena, University Hospital Leipzig and St. Franziskus Hospital M&#x000fc;nster.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Prototype of the PICOS app</title><p id="Par17">A clickable prototype of the developed PICOS app created using the prototyping tool <italic>Adobe XD</italic>. The prototype served to make the planned design tangible and give potential users an impression of the planned functionality and design. The prototype included a main page where the users were able to track their registered vital signs like blood glucose level, heart rate, blood pressure and weight as well as their activity through step tracking, with manual entries or via wearables (e.g. smartwatch). A weekly use of the PHQ-4 questionnaire (patient health questionnaire-4) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] with a 4-item scale asking for depression symptoms and anxiety was also was also incorporated into the app. No real data were captured when using this prototype.</p><p id="Par18">In the PICOS app, the users receive daily reminders about the completeness of their entries. From the main page, users can access an interface to manage their vital signs directly, update them or indicate if they are not relevant. From the main page, users could also access their medication plan, view their therapy plan, create an overview of caregivers and relatives, save documents, or manage their doctor and hospital visits (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).</p><p id="Par19">The main goals of the design were to create a usable interface with simple and intuitive operations. The user interface followed the principles of usability engineering for interactive systems as formulated in ISO 9241&#x02009;&#x02212;&#x02009;110 as an international standard [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The following principles were considered: task appropriateness, self-descriptiveness, conformity to expectations, learnability, controllability, fault tolerance, customizability.</p><p id="Par20">

Due to the vulnerability of the target group, the survey was kept as short as possible. The survey was evaluated by an expert panel with four researchers following the recommendations of Ikart [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. All items used had already been validated and applied in other surveys.</p><p id="Par22">For demographics, participants were asked about their age, their education level and gender identity. In addition, participants were asked if they own or use a smartphone and whether they would like support (e.g., from family members or caregivers) when using the PICOS app.</p><p id="Par23">The interaction with technology was operationalised by the German version of the <italic>Affinity for Technology Interaction (ATI)</italic> scale developed by Franke et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and based on the need for cognition-theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p id="Par24">The perception of the PICOS app was measured using the scale by Krishnan et al.

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="Sec20"><title>Principal Findings</title><p id="Par53">The main finding of this survey was that potential users assessed the PICOS app as beneficial and usable. Men showed a significantly higher affinity than women and the affinity for technical systems decreased significantly with age, which confirms hypotheses H1a and H1b. Surprisingly, people who owned a smartphone had no higher affinity for technology interaction than people who did not. There were also no differences in technical affinity for participants that would seek help and those who do not, therefore hypotheses H1c and H1d were rejected.</p><p id="Par54">The participants evaluated the hedonic motivation of the clickable PICOS prototype on a medium level. Meaning they neither agreed nor disagreed on perceiving the app as fun, entertaining, enjoyable, pleasuring, exciting, thrilling or delightful. This assessment was robust for all characteristics analysed (gender, age, possession of smartphone, need of support). Factors that could increase hedonic motivation for mHealth applications would include the absence of app dysfunctions, variety in app features to avoid boredom, a number of useful features, appealing designs and no app dependence on internet, stated by Woldeyohannes and Ngwenyama [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. However, the same authors questioned the significance of hedonic motivation for an mHealth app: &#x0201c;You won&#x02019;t use an app for fun&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Tamilmani et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] went even further, doubting whether hedonic motivation is an appropriate construct when dealing with technology that has utilitarian purpose.</p><p id="Par55">The participants tended to agree on the usefulness of the app for their daily life and health, this was also a robust result for all considered variables and underscores the usefulness of the app in the future beyond the collection of research data. Perceived usefulness is one of the key constructs of technology acceptance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and reflects also trust in the system and the entities behind it to achieve the desired outcomes enabling new possibilities or improving existing processes to achieve the desired outcomes through the app [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].The participants perceived the ease of use of the app during the learning process and during the daily interaction as rather easy. With older age, no smartphone ownership or use and the stated need for support among the patients, the perceived ease of use dropped significantly. Research shows that particularly middle aged and older adults &#x02013; who make up the majority of the potential user group for the PICOS app &#x02013; tend to give a higher value to the perceived ease of use when adopting a new digital application [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. In total, hypotheses H2a, H2c and H2d were partially confirmed, H2b was rejected. When participants had a higher affinity for technical interaction, their perception of the app was significantly higher for all perception variables of the PICOS app, which confirms hypothesis H3.</p><p id="Par56">When comparing the results with other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] the ATI score of the participants was slightly above those of two samples of the general public in Germany. Regarding mHealth adoption in general, Uncovska et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] pointed out that perceived benefits of mHealth apps are more relevant than scientific evidence and an effortless usage had to be ensured. Multiple systematic reviews or meta-analyses showed that especially high levels of performance expectancy and perceived ease of use (or effort expectancy) had a strong effect on technology acceptance and use intentions of mHealth apps [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].</p><p id="Par57">So far, there are few instruments to measure potential outcome parameters of PICS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. However, most of these instruments are only partly validated on ICU patients and there is also still shortage of tools measuring cognitive or physical activity. Furthermore, this data must be collected regularly and in large quantities to gain insights both for individual patients and for research. Based on existing tests designed to capture limitations in former intensive care patients, elements were integrated into the PICOS app. Using this app has the potential to streamline the retrieval and accessibility of medical information and data, thereby contributing to more efficient and effective healthcare services.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Implementation of the PICOS app and the PICOS Ecosystem</title><p id="Par58">Based on the findings of this study, the PICOS app for the Android operating system was implemented. It can be obtained for study participants via the Google app store. In addition, a separate web module was developed to enable medical staff to add data from the clinical context to the PICOS research dataset. The aim is to carry out a multicenter study for the clinical evaluation of the entire system.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Limitations</title><p id="Par59">A limitation of the survey is that the patients could only get a brief glimpse of the app and could only test it as a clickable prototype without real functionality. The impression in this test may differ from an actual use of the final app over a longer period. In addition, a recruitment bias can be assumed as particularly frail representatives of the target group either refused to take part in the study themselves or were excluded due to the conditions of participation. However, it can be assumed that people who did not participate in this study due to their very poor state of health would also not consider using the app. Therefore, the participants of this survey represent the potential user group well, but not necessarily the entire group of people who were treated on ICU. Another limitation is the timing of the survey. Patients were still in the hospital and have not yet fully recovered from their critical illness. Transferring the results to other user groups should also be done with caution, given the possible symptomatic impairments of patients in different areas of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Other target groups for similar mHealth apps, such as those without an ICU stay, may yield very different results. The following should also be noted when interpreting the results: As described within the technology acceptance model (TAM 3, Venkatesh and Bala [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]) and the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT, Venkatesh et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]) usage behavior is not the same as behavioral intention and only a result of the latter. This study therefore only makes statements regarding the behavioural intention, and conclusions regarding actual behaviour can only be drawn to a limited extent.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par60">This web-based survey study highlighted the initial phase of developing a user-friendly and intuitive app. Future studies should focus on the deployment of the developed PICOS app, enabling former intensive care patients to seamlessly integrate the app into their daily lives, starting directly after transferring from the ICU to the general ward to collect the initial data while still in the hospital and simultaneously provide on-site support for using the app. This integration enables the collection and storage of data trajectories post-hospital discharge, subsequently allowing scientists to analyse the data.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic Supplementary Material</title><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.</p><p>
