Advances in compact accelerator-based neutron sources with appropriate beam configuration systems have primarily driven this by separating the technique from costly and cumbersome fission-based sources, alongside improvements in treatment planning software and patient positioning devices<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Generally, NCT is an external beam radiotherapy modality that utilises neutron capture agents (NCA)&#x02014;biochemically targeted stable isotopes of high neutron capture cross-section&#x02014;in conjunction with an external neutron beam to trigger thermal neutron capture reactions within the target tissue. Current methods approved for clinical use deliver <sup>10</sup>B isotope to cancerous tissue via metabolic accumulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. The thermal neutron capture reactions of <sup>10</sup>B (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) are the foundational principle of boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT). The dominant reaction (n,&#x003b1;) results in the production of a high linear energy transfer (LET) &#x003b1;-particle (1.47&#x000a0;MeV/&#x003bc;m), recoil <sup>7</sup>Li nucleus (0.84&#x000a0;MeV/&#x003bc;m) and a prompt &#x003b3;-ray (478&#x000a0;keV), via the following mechanism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>:<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Schematics of the (n,&#x003b1;) neutron capture reaction in <sup>10</sup>B.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41598_2025_2382_Fig1_HTML" id="d33e209"/></fig></p><p id="Par3">A second, lower abundance (6%), (n,&#x003b1;) reaction occurs resulting in a 1.77&#x000a0;MeV &#x003b1;-particle plus 1.015&#x000a0;MeV Lithium nuclei. A third possible reaction is a basic radiative capture (n,&#x003b3;) whereby <sup>10</sup>B absorbs a neutron, emitting a gamma ray and forming stable <sup>11</sup>B. This particular reaction has a much smaller cross section compared to the (n,&#x003b1;) reaction cross section of 3840 barns. The particles&#x02019; produced by the (n,&#x003b1;) reaction have short penetration depth offering a precise targeting capability, causing lethal damage to the tumour or other targeted cells while sparing surrounding healthy tissue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">In Japan, NCT has been approved for treating recurrent head and neck cancers, and promising results have been observed in other cancers like melanoma and brain tumours<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Additionally, recent work has demonstrated that biologically relevant and clinically useful neutron fluxes are generated internally during proton and heavy-ion particle therapy, as a by-product of the particle irradiation itself<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Referred to as Neutron Capture Enhanced Particle Therapy (NCEPT)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, this concept extends the principles of NCT to applications in particle therapy (proton and carbon ion) treatments. Utilising this internally generated thermal neutron field could reduce primary ion beam doses and associated fractions, potentially improving patient outcomes and quality of life while offering a new treatment option for certain poor-prognosis cancers.</p><p id="Par6">In order to optimise and progress NCT research, access to thermal neutron radiation sources is essential. In general, the primary constraint for most radiotherapy basic research and development is accessing appropriate radiation sources. Access to the limited beam time available for research on clinical instruments is highly competitive and the costs associated with running these machines greatly limit the total time available. An inexpensive, straightforward neutron irradiation system that minimally affects standard operations would enable efficient and iterative experimentation necessary for developing novel pharmaceuticals and research of radiobiological mechanisms. This manuscript describes the repurposing of a pre-existing neutron imaging instrument (referred to as <italic>Dingo</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, in use on the Open-Pool Australian Lightwater (OPAL) research nuclear reactor run by the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation, for the purposes of radiobiological research and novel NCT development. Dingo is currently the only thermal neutron beam available for research in Australia.</p><p id="Par7">Research nuclear reactors like OPAL operate within highly restrictive environments governed by multiple regulatory frameworks and safety protocols. These facilities must comply with stringent national nuclear regulatory bodies (such as ARPANSA in Australia) that enforce comprehensive licensing requirements and regular safety assessments. Radiation safety considerations necessitate all movements of staff and equipment around the facility. Work health and safety protocols are exceptionally rigorous and detailed, requiring multiple levels of approval before being modified.The methodology described here has been designed to work within these multifaceted constraints and provide minimal disruption to regular operations.</p><p id="Par8">The Dingo instrument is designed as a thermal neutron imaging instrument and its primary uses include palaeontology, materials science, archeology and industrial/engineering applications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.

This in silico model simulates the entire beampath and allows precise prediction of the neutron field. This model is essential for ensuring the efficient use of the beam for irradiation purposes. This model has been validated in-beam and out-of-beam using a combination of absolute and relative measurements, including neutron activation analysis and Bonner sphere spectroscopy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. These are now able to be employed for quality assurance and validation purposes during radiobiological experimentation. The primary technique used for neutron flux measurements on the beamline is neutron activation analysis (NAA) of high-purity bare and cadmium covered gold foils. Gold responds to both thermal and epithermal neutrons, with significant cross-section peaks of 2.7&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>5</sup> barn and 3.6&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>3</sup> barn at 4.9&#x000a0;eV and 60.3&#x000a0;eV respectively, plus several resonance peaks in the hundreds of barns. To isolate the thermal neutron flux measurement, gold is typically used alongside cadmium-covered foil or wire because cadmium effectively absorbs thermal neutrons. This allows the epithermal neutron capture reaction rate from the cadmium measurement to be subtracted from the bare gold measurement, thereby isolating the thermal neutron flux<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par18">To achieve these irradiation conditions a method of using radiochromic films was employed to locate and target the beam while flux was measured by way of gold neutron activation analysis. A sample holder and carrier was designed to locate the samples for irradiation in the desired location within the confines of the existing beamline infrastructure. The approach was validated by examining an irradiation time dependent increase in &#x003b3;H2AX foci formation or fluorescence intensity, with and without the presence of [<sup>10</sup>B]-BPA, by microscopy and flow cytometry in glioblastoma tissue cultures. These results show a statistically significant increase in DNA damage in cells treated with [<sup>10</sup>B]-BPA compared to neutron irradiation alone. This confirms that simple, low cost repurposing of existing beamlines is an effective method for establishing a basic neutron radiation biology capability and has resulted in the first thermal neutron source available for this kind of research in Australia.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><p id="Par19">This section describes the experimental procedures for neutron irradiation studies at the OPAL reactor. The methodology includes techniques for sample positioning using EBT3 radiochromic films with cadmium sheets to visualize neutron field distribution, and quantification of thermal neutron fluxes using gold neutron activation. The biological experiments utilized U87-MG and T98G glioma cell lines cultured in MEM media and treated with 500&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M [10B]-BPA prior to neutron irradiation at estimated fluences of 1.5&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>10</sup> n/cm2 and 1.5&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>11</sup> n/cm2. Post-irradiation analysis included immunofluorescence staining to quantify &#x003b3;H2AX foci formation, with visualization via fluorescence microscopy and quantitative assessment through both manual counting and flow cytometry.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Sample positioning</title><p id="Par20">The OPAL reactor supplies 15 instruments with neutron beams however, one of its key applications is manufacturing of radiopharmaceuticals and neutron transmutation doping (NTD) of silicon. This requires inserting assemblies into the reactor core, which change the neutron scattering properties and may alter the spatial distribution of the neutron beams entering the beam port. Thus, characterisation of the neutron field position is necessary before commencing any neutron capture experiment to assure consistent sample positioning. Halving the distance between the pinhole and the samples increases not only the neutron flux, but also the variability in neutron intensities across the field, which is particularly important when operating in the high-intensity mode. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a robust and quick method to evaluate the relative position and planar distribution of the beam at Dingo.</p><p id="Par21">A simple solution for efficient estimation of the neutron field characteristics using EBT3 radiochromic films (Ashland) placed behind a 1.2&#x000a0;mm cadmium sheet was implemented. The cadmium sheet is wrapped in aluminium foil and the film affixed to it via aluminium adhesive tape. This assembly is attached to the sample holder, with the Cd facing the beam, placed into the relevant location in the beam path and irradiated for 10&#x000a0;min. Following irradiation, the cadmium sheet is removed leaving the film in place and left to self-develop for another 10&#x000a0;min to visualise the position of the beam relative to the sample holder. This approach enables the acquisition of an almost immediate relative image of the thermal neutron field through the low-energy &#x003b3;-rays produced by neutron capture in cadmium which ensures samples are correctly positioned in the desired planar region of the field. Since the reaction rates in the polymer depend on the deposited energy, the initial optical signal drops with decreasing neutron flux incident on the cadmium sheet. Thus, to determine the semiquantitative profiles of the neutron beam intensity, the film can be removed and self-developed for&#x02009;~&#x02009;12&#x000a0;h to account for the non-uniform response, as per manufacturer&#x02019;s directions. Following this the film is scanned using a flatbed scanner to generate a 2D image. The optical density (OD) of the film is calculated from the pixel intensity which in turn is proportional to thermal neutron flux and can be plotted in ImageJ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>.

The approach described above demonstrates that, within the restrictive environment of nuclear reactor infrastructure, repurposing of existing beamlines is a potentially viable approach for the establishment of a neutron radiation biology capability. While not comparable in capability, the cost of this approach is far less than building a dedicated facility. No permanent alterations to the existing infrastructure were required to achieve the successful irradiation of viable human tissue cultures at biologically significant flux and energy.</p><p id="Par36">By utilising commercially available radiochromic films, we were able to efficiently evaluate potential changes to the relative position and spatial distribution characteristics of the thermal neutron component of the beam at Dingo, which can occur due to modifications of the reactor core configuration. This approach increases experimental reproducibility and improves the positional accuracy of the samples. The thermal neutron flux can be effectively measured using gold NAA technique.</p><p id="Par37">Monte Carlo modelling of the neutron beam flux at the sample stage by Jakublowski et al. reported thermal neutron flux when running in high intensity mode at the sample stage of 4.7&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>7</sup> n/cm<sup>2</sup>&#x022c5;s<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. This accounts for approximately 59% of the neutron beam while the epithermal and fast neutron components comprise 21% and 20%, respectively. By approximately halving the distance to the primary shutter, the thermal neutron flux increases by nearly the factor of 4. It can be further increased by placing the samples immediately behind the tertiary shutter entry reaching 2.52&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>8</sup> (&#x000b1;&#x02009;2.73&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>7</sup>) n/cm<sup>2</sup> s.

Cells were kept in zero headspace at room temperature for the duration, which can introduce major confounding factors to the analysis of cell survival and proliferation, and precludes many measurements of interest such as the DNA damage measurement demonstrated here. Repeating this experiment with the methodology described above would result in a reduction of irradiation times to 79&#x000a0;min, with further reductions possible if the irradiation is restricted to the highest flux portion of the beam. This results in a much improved throughput and reduction of time spent at non-physiological conditions. Further opportunities for development to improve precision and accuracy, and therefore reduce irradiation time, have been identified. These include the integration of real-time quad-MOSFET beam-monitoring devices for instant feedback and automated instrument control based on the accumulated signal, rather than measurement time<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par38">Viable human tissue cultures were placed behind the tertiary shutter and irradiated for periods of up to 10&#x000a0;min; the cultures were successfully recovered and the resulting activation of HR and NHEJ DNA repair pathways measured by &#x003b3;H2AX immunocytochemistry and flow cytometry.

To prevent cultures dehydrating during setup and irradiation time all containers are prepared with as close to zero headspace as practically achievable. In order to reduce the impacts of both points it is important to minimise the time the cultures are exposed to these conditions. Efficient sample setup and retrieval is key to keeping the impacts of these factors consistent between irradiations. The significance of these factors needs to be taken into consideration on a per cell line basis for future work, as the impacts on downstream analysis will vary cell line to cell line, and with the measurement being taken.</p><p id="Par43">Inclusion of temperature control to the irradiation setup would be a valuable addition to this technique as it would allow for maintaining conditions in the cell cultures that are closer to physiological. Compact heating devices, such as Peltier heat exchanges that can be thermostatically controlled are being investigated. The complexities of placing such devices into such a neutron rich environment need to be taken into consideration from a functional and longevity perspective as well as the potential activation of the components. The current irradiation setup is constructed entirely out of plastic which does not activate to any significant extent under these conditions.</p><p id="Par44">The gold neutron activation analysis technique used in this study is the definitive method for calculating thermal neutron flux coming from nuclear reactors. As this technique directly measures the activation of <sup>198</sup>Au via gamma ray spectrometry, the quantification of the thermal neutron flux is straightforward and robust. The technique itself is time-consuming compared to the short irradiation times of 1&#x000a0;min or less used for the irradiation of biological samples, with results being received a minimum of 24&#x000a0;h post experiment. It also requires sufficient gold activation for reliable quantification of the gamma ray emission and calculation of thermal neutron fluxes. The addition of a real-time neutron monitoring device that can distinguish between thermal and epithermal neutrons would be a very valuable addition. Simulation testing has shown promising results for a device using MOSFET detectors covered with various converter materials: boron carbide alone, a combination of cadmium and boron carbide, or polyethylene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Since the neutron beam properties can vary between the measurements, real-time feedback will be extremely valuable to allow optimisation of experimental protocols to more efficiently utilise the available beamtime and improve both the precision, and accuracy of irradiations.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par45">The primary rate limiting factor for NCT research and development is the access to appropriate radiation sources. Typically, hours on such instruments are limited and the merit based access models extremely competitive. To accelerate development of novel NCAs and targets, more beamtime is required. We have implemented an approach to adapt Dingo, a thermal neutron imaging instrument on the OPAL reactor in Australia, to conduct biological irradiations for the purposes of radiobiological research and development. Sample positioning and techniques for beam targeting quality assurance and neutron flux measurements were implemented to provide a radiobiological irradiation capability with minimal modifications to existing infrastructure. Opportunities for further development to improve precision and accuracy have been identified. By promoting the exploration of existing nuclear reactor-based facilities for biological research, we aim to expedite NCA development and generation of radiobiological insights. This approach could enhance the application of more affordable accelerator-based neutron sources for cancer treatment by expanding the pharmacological options available for NCT and allow further optimisation of treatment plans. Additionally, particle beam therapy concepts like NCEPT&#x02014;which utilise neutrons naturally generated during treatment&#x02014;may further extend NCA applications to deep-seated and diffuse tumors, potentially introducing neutron capture therapy capabilities to established particle therapy clinics worldwide.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#x02019;s note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Atila Stopic&#x02014;gamma ray spectroscopy analysis of neutron activated gold.
