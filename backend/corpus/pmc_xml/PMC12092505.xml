In this study, an assembly is presented&#x000a0;that includes a paper crown modified with tyrosinase enzyme, soaked in a DES and positioned on a disposable screen-printed carbon electrode. The paper crown contacts the outer edge of the carbon disk working electrode, as well as the peripheral counter and reference electrodes. This assembly yields a portable and disposable electrochemical platform, effortlessly immobilising DESs onto a porous and economical supporting material like paper. Moreover, the entire configuration resulted in a sensitive, rapidly responsive, membrane-free gas sensor whose response time depended exclusively on the enzymatic reaction. The electroanalytical capabilities of this setup were evaluated through voltammetric and amperometric determinations of phenols in synthetic and real wine samples. The proposed gas enzymatic sensor demonstrated excellent analytical performance for detecting phenolic compounds, offering fast measurement times, simple operation, high sensitivity, wide linear range and good repeatability.</p><sec><title>Graphical Abstract</title><p id="Par2">

In fact, organoleptic properties, which include taste, smell and colour, are key indicators of quality, which is crucial so that wine can stand out among the high production available nowadays and be chosen by consumers. The presence of these volatile compounds in wines can lead to product returns and loss of confidence in the brand, causing significant economic losses in the wine industry, which has become extremely important at the social, cultural and economic levels of many regions. Thus, monitoring phenol levels helps winemakers assess wine stability and quality, prompting interventions such as filtration or sulphur dioxide addition to manage microbial contamination and prevent spoilage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Compared to chromatographic analytical methods, electroanalytical sensors are highly effective tools for diverse applications, not only because of their inherent selectivity and sensitivity, but also because they facilitate in situ measurements within the same environment as the analyte with cost-effective instrumentation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Carbon paste, glassy carbon and screen-printed electrodes modified by different compounds, such as metallic nanoparticles (NPs), metal oxide NPs, fullerene (C60), polymers and molecularly imprinted polymers, have been reported for the analysis of these compounds in wine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. For the quantification of 4-ethylguaiacol in wines, an extraction pretreatment with ether was necessary to successfully quantify this compound owing to the complexity of these samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par4">Conducting electrochemical measurements of these volatile phenols in the gas phase would avoid spoilage of wine samples, as it does not require any contact with the electrode. Furthermore, faster response times, owing to the faster diffusion rates of gases, and enhanced selectivity, because non-volatile compounds will not reach the working electrode, are provided in this way [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. However, problems arise when these devices operate in the gas phase because they are usually in a dry environment, where the aqueous electrolyte tends to evaporate, which can eventually affect the response, stability and lifetime of the sensor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Significant advantages can be harnessed by employing non-aqueous electrolytes in electroanalytical applications such as room-temperature ionic liquids or deep eutectic solvents (DESs). Although both electrolytes have shown similar performance in gas sensors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], DESs have been defined as a cheaper and greener alternative [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. DESs result from the mixing of the hydrogen bond acceptor (HBA) and hydrogen bond donor (HBD) components in stoichiometric ratios. Notably, they exhibit negligible volatility, good conductivity, high thermal stability and customisable chemical-physical properties (polarity, viscosity, conductivity, electrostability range, melting point, density) through the careful selection of HBDs and HBAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Hence, considering their low vapor pressure, excellent electrical conductivity and biocompatibility, DESs can be effectively used in electrochemical gas sensors and biosensors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. One of the most commonly used HBA is choline chloride (ChCl) in combination with different HBDs such as urea, oxalic, citric, succinic or amino acids, or glycerol (Gly) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In this paper, a simple setup is proposed for the headspace electroanalytical measurement of volatile phenols in food matrices, such as wines, based on the combination of ChCl and Gly to form the DES used as non-aqueous supporting electrolyte. The direct electrochemical oxidation of phenolic compounds usually leads to polymeric product build-up on the electrode surface, so their previous oxidation to quinones catalysed by tyrosinase (TYR) enzyme is highlighted as alternative [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The electrochemical reduction of the enzymatically produced quinones back to their original phenolic forms at cathodic potentials is associated with low noise and background currents, which leads to the detection of low analyte concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Thus, membrane-free TYR-based screen-printed carbon electrodes (SPCEs) have been developed for the detection of volatile phenols in wine, with both the enzyme and ChCl/Gly DES impregnated in paper crowns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The influence of modifying the working electrode with nanomaterials, such as AuNPs or C60, which have already been used for the detection of these phenolic compounds, has been studied prior to the enzyme immobilisation to record the maximum cathodic current.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Reagents and materials</title><p id="Par5">Analytical-reagent grade chemicals and Milli-Q water (Milli-pore, Bedford, MA, USA) were used. 0.1 M phosphate buffer solutions (KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, Fluka, Munich, Germany), adjusted to the appropriate pH by phosphoric acid (Panreac, Barcelona, Spain), or mixtures of ChCl and Gly from Sigma-Aldrich (Steinheim, Germany) were used as supporting electrolytes for electrochemical measurements.</p><p id="Par6">One millimolar of HAuCl<sub>4</sub> solutions was prepared by dissolving the appropriate amount of hydrogen tetrachloroaurate-(III) trihydrate (Acros Organics, Belgium) in 0.5 M sulfuric acid (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany).</p><p id="Par7">C60 (Acros Organics, Geel, Belgium) solutions were prepared in dichloromethane (Panreac, Barcelona, Spain) and activated in 1.0 M potassium hydroxide solutions (Carlo Erba, Val de Reuil, France).</p><p id="Par8">The filter paper used for supporting the DESs was purchased from Labor (Cordenons, Italy) as 50 cm &#x000d7;&#x02009;50 cm foils, 67 g/m<sup>2</sup>.

After the addition of a volume of the phenol standard solution into the cell, TYR could oxidise the molecules at the headspace in equilibrium with the liquid phase, and subsequently, the reduction current of the produced orthoquinone could be recorded by voltammetry or chronoamperometry (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Results and discussion</title><p id="Par17">First, voltammetric analyses were performed using different transducers to determine the electrochemical window of the enzymatic sensors that will be developed on them for the headspace detection of volatile phenols.

Initially, DES was deposited directly on the three electrodes of the SPCEs devices; however, no voltammetric signals due to phenols were observed. Therefore, the DES-impregnated filter paper was tested to provide contact between the three electrodes. The low density and high porosity of the filter paper may also facilitate subsequent enzyme immobilisation and oxygen permeation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The paper shape, that is, complete discs, discs with small holes and paper crowns, was optimised to ensure that the recorded current was not affected by the blockage in the diffusion of the volatile analyte through the DES (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A). The good redox behaviour of a 100 &#x000b5;g/L phenol solution was only observed when using the DES-impregnated paper crowns (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B), so this configuration was considered optimum for the following detection of volatile phenols using headspace TYR-based sensors.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p><bold>A</bold> Filter paper shapes tested for the placement of DES as supporting electrolyte for phenol electrochemical measurements using SPCEs. <bold>B</bold> Cyclic voltammograms recorded in the gas phase for a phenol standard of approx. 100 &#x000b5;g/L at SPCEs with DES-impregnated a complete disc, a disc with small holes and a paper crown.

In this way, the analytical response would be based on the electrochemical reduction of the enzymatically produced orthoquinone (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B). Since this cathodic current was perfectly registered for 4-ethylguaiacol solutions at AuNPs/SPCEs and AC60/SPCEs (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B), this phenolic compound was taken as a representative of the volatile ones in wine for headspace voltammetric and chronoamperometric measurements. As mentioned above, the oxidation of 4-ethylguaiacol at AuNPs/SPCEs or AC60/SPCEs occurred at a potential higher than +&#x02009;0.25 V (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B), so any cathodic current recorded from this potential towards more negative potentials should be attributed entirely to the reduction of the enzymatically produced orthoquinone. Thus, differential pulse voltammograms of 4-ethylguaiacol solutions were recorded after an incubation period of 10 min using TYR/AuNPs/SPCEs and TYR/AC60/SPCEs from +&#x02009;0.25 V to &#x02212;&#x02009;0.5 V.

The highest sensitivity for the detection of volatile phenols was obtained by using the enzymatic sensors based on AC60 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Thus, the variation in current at TYR/AC60/SPCE, reflecting the enzymatic activity of tyrosinase on the electrode surface, was analysed to quantify the volatile phenols in wine.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>Headspace chronoamperograms recorded for a 200 &#x000b5;g/L 4-ethylguaiacol solutions at a TYR/AuNPs/SPCE with a DES-impregnated paper crown.

This approach ensures more accurate results by avoiding reliance on a single concentration, and allows the variability of measurements to be assessed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Outlier points with a studentised residual above 2.5 in absolute value were removed to provide a proper evaluation of the calibration parameters obtained by ordinary least squares regression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. An RSD of 7.2% was statistically measured, expressing the relative variability of a three calibration curves recording in the 4-ethylguaiacol concentration range from 0.2 to 1.1 mg/L, indicating the consistency of the results (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>B).<fig id="Fig7"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption><p><bold>A</bold> Headspace chronoamperograms recorded for different 4-ethylguaiacol solutions at a TYR/AC60/SPCE with a DES-impregnated paper crown.

These measurements are crucial for assessing the sensitivity of the sensor and its ability to detect compounds in real samples such as wine. The limit of decision (CC&#x003b1;) and capability of detection (CC&#x003b2;) were determined based on a linear regression model according to ISO 11843, using the DETARCHI program, instead of the signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio method for CC&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. The probability of false positive (&#x003b1;), that is, of detecting erroneously the analyte when it is not in the sample, was fixed at a value of 0.05, which led to a CC&#x003b1; of 92 &#x000b5;g/L (&#x003b1; =&#x02009;0.05). CC&#x003b2; was calculated considering not only the probability of false positive (&#x003b1;), but also the negative one (&#x003b2;), that is, the probability of incorrectly not detecting the analyte when it is present. Similarly, a CC&#x003b2; value of 175 &#x000b5;g/L was set for &#x003b1;&#x02009;= &#x003b2;&#x02009;= 0.05.</p><p id="Par23">Finally, the trueness of this method was tested by spiking and recovering different wine samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Four wine samples from different grape varieties were studied in their original state and after addition of a known mass of 4-ethylguaiacol to a test portion. Headspace chronoamperograms were registered for the wines using TYR/AC60/SPCEs with DES-impregnated paper crown at &#x02212;&#x02009;0.1 V after an incubation period of 1&#x000a0;min. The developed procedure was straightforwardly applied to these complex samples, avoiding the usual extraction pretreatments required for red wines when using AC60/SPCEs in solution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. No increase in current was recorded due to the oxidation process of 4-ethylguaiacol at the surface of the electrode; therefore, it was stated that there were no volatile phenols in the samples in their original state. Recovery experiments were then performed by analysing the fortified wine samples using the standard addition method. Headspace chronoamperograms were recorded for the corresponding wine and successive additions of a 4-ethylguaiacol solution to the cell. As shown in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, the concentrations found in these samples agreed with that added, resulting in good recovery values. Although recoveries significantly different from unity, lower and/or higher, indicate that a bias affects the method, deviations lower than 20% are understood as sufficient to guarantee trueness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. The percentage of relative standard deviation (RSD) of these measurements, performed in triplicate, calculated from their standard deviation and average, was lower than 12%. These results highlight the applicability of the developed analytical method for the detection of volatile phenols in wines.

The use of a DES electrolyte guarantees an appropriate environment for headspace electrochemical measurements, which is a simple and green strategy for the development of this type of enzymatic sensors. The use of a paper crown modified with the enzyme tyrosinase, soaked in DES and placed on SPCEs was found to be the best configuration for sensor design development. AuNPs and C60 nanomaterials clearly influence the redox behaviour of different phenolic compounds. TYR/AC60/SPCEs were the transducers that showed the highest sensitivity for the detection of 4-ethylguaiacol as a representative of volatile phenols, with a capability of detection below the perception threshold of this compound in wines. The reproducibility of the enzymatic sensor in the analysis of both synthetic and fortified wine samples was also adequate, showing successful recovery values between 105 and 112%, without the need for prior sample treatment. Thus, the obtained results demonstrate that this novel enzymatic sensor can successfully replace classical analytical methods and suggest a future application for the in situ monitoring of phenol content in wineries.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher's Note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><p>P.
