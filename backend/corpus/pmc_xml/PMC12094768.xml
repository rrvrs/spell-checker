</self-uri><abstract><p>Invasive invertebrate pests have become a major threat to food security as global populations increase. Pesticides, often containing organophosphates, have long been used as agents for providing immediate short-term recovery, yet are often broad-spectrum, leading to the development of resistance. In insect species, one mechanism for resistance is known to be driven by mutations in acetylcholinesterase (AChE), an enzyme that catalyses the hydrolysis of acetylcholine. In this study, we explored a potential role for resistance-modified AChE in invasive pest land snails, using the Mediterranean snail <italic toggle="yes">Theba pisana</italic>. Following tissue transcriptomic investigation, an expanded family of AChE-like genes were identified that clustered phylogenetically into three individual clades, with one clade including vertebrate AChE. The majority of <italic toggle="yes">T. pisana</italic> AChE-like genes demonstrated the highest expression in the snail mucous gland during its reproductive stage. Subsequent proteomic analysis of trail mucus at the reproductive stage identified four AChE-like proteins as a major component. Immunolocalisation revealed that AChE-like protein(s) were prominent in the mucous gland secretory cells and widespread throughout the reproductive stage trail mucus, yet were largely absent from trail mucus at the non-reproductive stage. In summary, this study established a potential role for resistance-modified AChE-like proteins in pest land snail pesticide resistance via their deployment into trail mucus that may bio-scavenge organophosphates, rendering them ineffective. Their abundance during the reproductive stage is likely due to the snail&#x02019;s increased mobility, following periods of immobile aestivation.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The author(s) received no specific funding for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="4"/><table-count count="0"/><page-count count="15"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>Sequence datasets were deposited in the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA) database under accession number PRJNA858108.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>Sequence datasets were deposited in the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA) database under accession number PRJNA858108.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Invasive pest land snails have become an increasing threat to human activities such as trade, agriculture and transportation. These snails have become invasive pests due to their adaptability, rapid reproduction and lack of natural predators in their new habitats [<xref rid="pone.0323380.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0323380.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Pest snails are particularly noted for their agricultural damage, feeding upon a wide variety of crops, including fruits, vegetables and grains, which can lead to significant losses for farmers [<xref rid="pone.0323380.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323380.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Examples of invasive pest land snails include the giant African land snail (<italic toggle="yes">Achatina fulica</italic>), Rosy Wolf Snail (<italic toggle="yes">Euglandina rosea</italic>) and Asian Tramp snail (<italic toggle="yes">Bradybaena similaris</italic>) [<xref rid="pone.0323380.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0323380.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], as well as a variety of Mediterranean land snails. These are some of the most devastating invasive snail pests.</p><p>Mediterranean land snails are naturally distributed throughout the Mediterranean regions of Europe (e.g., Spain, Italy, France, Egypt), and include the white Italian snail, <italic toggle="yes">Theba pisana</italic> (O. F. M&#x000fc;ller, 1774) and vineyard snail, <italic toggle="yes">Cernuella virgata</italic> (da Costa, 1778) [<xref rid="pone.0323380.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323380.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The earliest recording of <italic toggle="yes">T. pisana</italic> in Australia was documented in the 1920s, initially in South Australia, and they have since extended their range to Victoria, Tasmania and Western Australia [<xref rid="pone.0323380.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Although <italic toggle="yes">T. pisana</italic> were an accidental introduction to Australia [<xref rid="pone.0323380.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], they were deliberately distributed to various other locations throughout the world in small but densely populated colonies, to eradicate microscopic pathogens [<xref rid="pone.0323380.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0323380.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p><italic toggle="yes">Theba pisana</italic> is considered an agricultural pest due to its ability to aestivate on the ears and stalks of cereal crops (e.g., wheat, barley, oat); as a result, snails can be inadvertently harvested, which can clog farming machinery and contaminate grain harvest. Aestivation is a behavioural response to high temperatures that allows the snail to avoid desiccation [<xref rid="pone.0323380.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323380.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Harvested crops may be downgraded or even rejected due to snail contamination, which is a severe burden to farmers. Australian crop farmers accumulate losses of over $19 million in yield per annum [<xref rid="pone.0323380.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323380.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323380.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Also, as an invasive snail, <italic toggle="yes">T. pisana</italic> acts as a vector (carrier) for helminth parasites that cause diseases [<xref rid="pone.0323380.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] that are detrimental to livestock and human health [<xref rid="pone.0323380.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323380.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. With changing climates, urbanization, inflation of food prices and escalated food consumption by humans, pestiferous snails are one of many drivers that influence the vulnerability of the agricultural community [<xref rid="pone.0323380.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Grain contamination by Mediterranean snails poses a serious threat to food security, and for this reason, population control is vital to mitigating damage by utilizing regulatory monitoring and management [<xref rid="pone.0323380.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>Pest snail control by crop growers has involved stubble management, cabling, rolling, slashing and grazing [<xref rid="pone.0323380.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Also, since the 1990s, CSIRO Montpellier (France) have investigated biological control agents to fight pest snails, including dipteran parasitoids and predators [<xref rid="pone.0323380.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0323380.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Flies that have a malacophagous life stage (feed on molluscs), which include those in Sciomyzidae and Sarcophagidae families, have been released to augment control measures of pest snails in the US (Hawaii), Italy, South Africa, France, and Australia. However, due to the incompatibility between host and parasite, results were deemed unsuccessful [<xref rid="pone.0323380.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323380.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323380.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Finally, management using organophosphates (OPs; including chlorpyrifos) and molluscicide baits have been implemented, but with liberal impact [<xref rid="pone.0323380.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0323380.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><p>Organophosphates that contain active metaldehyde-based ingredients and carbamate methiocarb have been predominantly used for the treatment of crop-infested areas as a form of snail control [<xref rid="pone.0323380.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In recent years, research regarding resistance to chlorpyrifos identified that benthonic bivalve molluscs such as the <italic toggle="yes">Scapharca inaequivalvis</italic>, are capable of overexpressing the enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE) from the foot and gill tissues, suggesting that the increased content of AChE may be a consequence of OP resistance [<xref rid="pone.0323380.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Another invasive pest to the agricultural and aquacultural environments, the golden apple snail <italic toggle="yes">Pomacea canaliculata</italic>, has been identified as having morphological changes in the head, body and digestive tract when exposed to chlorpyrifos, thus employing AChE activity as a form of resistance, as well as a bioindicator for exposure to toxicological agents [<xref rid="pone.0323380.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. This aligns with what is known for insects, whereby resistance-modified AChE has been a critical evolutionary driver for pesticide resistance [<xref rid="pone.0323380.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323380.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p><p>We hypothesized that <italic toggle="yes">T. pisana</italic> secrete AChE proteins into their trail mucus, which may function to neutralize pesticides. Utilizing tissue- and reproductive stage-specific transcriptomics, and supported by proteomics, we report the presence of an expanded family of AChE-like proteins that are highly secreted into trail mucus during the reproductive stage. This finding helps to provide some explanation as to the potential molecular signalling mechanisms involved in pesticide resistance and may be utilized for the future development of more sustainable biocontrol methods.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Animals and maintenance</title><p><italic toggle="yes">Theba pisana</italic> were collected from Lauderdale and South Arm, Tasmania (Australia), and brought to the University of the Sunshine Coast (Sippy Downs) between April-August 2023 (reproductive stage) and January-April 2024, (non-reproductive stage).

Obtaining knowledge as to why snails produce mucus for locomotion, adhesion, reproduction, aggregation, and various other functions has been integral to the elucidation of their ecological and evolutionary development. Despite this, the role of most proteins produced in trail mucus is relatively unknown. Here, we investigated a major protein component of trail mucus in the reproductive stage of <italic toggle="yes">T. pisana</italic>, compared with the non-reproductive stage, and propose a function for trail mucus associated with pesticide resistance.</p><p>There exists a vast amount of information surrounding vertebrate AChE due to its significant role in terminating acetylcholine-mediated neurotransmission [<xref rid="pone.0323380.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0323380.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>].

However, AChE potential role in overcoming OPs has been more intensively studied in invertebrates, particularly in the fruit fly (<italic toggle="yes">Drosophila</italic>) [<xref rid="pone.0323380.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] and ticks (<italic toggle="yes">Rhipicephalu</italic>s) [<xref rid="pone.0323380.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Molluscan gastropods are also excellent invertebrate models for investigating harmful biomarkers in an environment, especially since AChE activity functions in the space of inhibition against certain pesticides [<xref rid="pone.0323380.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>].</p><p>Towards a better understanding of land snail AChE-like proteins, the trail mucus from <italic toggle="yes">T. pisana</italic> was analyzed through mass spectrometry, which resulted in the identification of four AChE-like precursor proteins, all containing multiple cysteine residues. We identified that <italic toggle="yes">T. pisana</italic> may produce up to 21 AChE-like proteins based on tissue transcriptomic interrogation. Of them, we could report only eight as full-length sequences (which included the trail mucus AChE-like proteins), likely due to inefficient <italic toggle="yes">de novo</italic> assembly issues. Currently, there is no reference genome for <italic toggle="yes">T. pisana</italic>, which if available, would facilitate a more accurate and complete transcriptome assembly. The species with the highest sequence identity to <italic toggle="yes">T. pisana</italic> AChE-like proteins was <italic toggle="yes">Candidula unifasciata</italic>, a land snail with a slightly more aggressive nature for colonization in regions of Southern France and Germany [<xref rid="pone.0323380.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]; although both <italic toggle="yes">Candidula</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Theba</italic> have a high threshold for heat tolerance [<xref rid="pone.0323380.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323380.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>].

Thus, the expansion of AChE-like proteins could be specific to <italic toggle="yes">T. pisana</italic>; alternatively, more information is needed at the transcriptomic and proteomic levels for <italic toggle="yes">C. unifasciata</italic> to accurately know the AChE-like protein number.</p><p>It was surprising to observe large amounts of AChE-like proteins in <italic toggle="yes">T. pisana</italic> trail mucus, especially given its recognized role in neural signalling. AChE is well-known as a primary neural cholinesterase that breaks down acetylcholine and choline esters, which function as neurotransmitters [<xref rid="pone.0323380.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323380.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. In agricultural pest control, OPs bind to AChE, which leads to a reduction in the hydrolysis of acetylcholine and therefore creates an accumulation of acetylcholine in the neural synaptic cleft [<xref rid="pone.0323380.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Overstimulation of acetylcholine in postsynaptic membranes, left continuously open, destroys cholinergic transmission which severs communication in the nervous system, blocking nerve conduction and therefore achieves the desired effect of control [<xref rid="pone.0323380.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0323380.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Thus, our discovery of trail mucus AChE-like proteins deserved more in-depth investigation.</p><p>We found that <italic toggle="yes">T. pisana</italic> AChE-like proteins were phylogenetically distributed into three clades. Of interest, the vertebrate AChE proteins included in the phylogeny (<italic toggle="yes">Homo sapiens</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Danio rerio</italic>), appeared in a separate clade from the four-trail mucus AChE-like proteins, yet similar to nine <italic toggle="yes">T. pisana</italic> AChE-like proteins with relatively high neuronal gene expression. We speculate that these may function as conventional AChE, facilitating breakdown or neural acetylcholine. As previously mentioned, <italic toggle="yes">T. pisana</italic> are most active during the reproductive stage and thus are more vulnerable to pesticides.

Targeting the most abundant protein based on SDS-PAGE with Coomassie staining, 4 AChE-like proteins were identified. Comparative RNA-seq analysis found that gene expression of these proteins was exclusive to the mucous glands of reproductive stage individuals. AChE-like proteins have never been reported in land snail mucus, even following a recent thorough investigation of the common garden snail, <italic toggle="yes">Cornu aspersum</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0323380.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], a notorious garden pest also known for invasive tendencies and crop infestation [<xref rid="pone.0323380.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0323380.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. In that mucomic investigation, it was found that there were three types of mucus secretions, involved with shielding, adhesion, and lubrication [<xref rid="pone.0323380.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>].</p><p>A commercially available anti-zebrafish AChE (full sequence) was used to localize AChE-like proteins in <italic toggle="yes">T. pisana</italic> mucous gland tissue and trail mucus. Before localization, specificity was validated through western blotting, specifically a&#x02009;~&#x02009;60&#x02009;kDa protein band in the mucous tissue extract, which aligns with the expected size of the trail mucus AChE-like proteins. Spatial immunolocalizations within the mucous gland tissue confirmed that production and secretion most likely occurred in the mucous gland secretory cells, from which it could progress into the snail&#x02019;s trail mucus. Immunolocalization of trail mucus demonstrated AChE-like protein distribution throughout the mucus threads. This finding aligns with other invertebrate AChE-like protein research, which shows the versatility of secretory AChE functions, specifically towards resilience against OP target sites [<xref rid="pone.0323380.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323380.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0323380.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. Moreover, sequestered non-neuronal AChE proteins have been implicated in the inactivation of pathogenic or predatory invasion, and help regulate physiological functions [<xref rid="pone.0323380.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323380.ref080" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0323380.ref082" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>].</p><p>A recent study of another major pest snail, <italic toggle="yes">C. virgata</italic>, found that during reproductive stage (and compared to non-reproductive stage), the trail mucus contained a relative abundance of various proteins, including AChE, as well as leukocyte elastase inhibitors, cathepsin and agglutinin, all of which are known to have roles in immunity, defence and cell signalling [<xref rid="pone.0323380.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. That study was focussed on total protein profile changes between reproductive stages, which likely inferred reproductive readiness [<xref rid="pone.0323380.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. However, it does open up the possibility that other genes and proteins are of importance in pesticide resistance.</p><p>There is emerging evidence that interdisciplinary investigation in pest management, including molecular-based research on mucus, can better assist in developing practical agricultural applications [<xref rid="pone.0323380.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323380.ref083" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. Numerous tests using baits composed of OP targeted towards AChE activity have resulted in successful immediate outcomes; however, enzymatic targets open the door to species adaptation and subsequent resistance. Despite many agricultural attempts at control towards mitigation, these toxic pesticide methods are at best temporary measures without assurance of longevity. Risks associated with using conventional pesticides have been identified to suppress communities of land and water-dwelling snail pests, yet this has resulted in secondary outbreaks and susceptibility to a vicious cycle of pollution [<xref rid="pone.0323380.ref084" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323380.ref085" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. The knowledge obtained from our research at the molecular level could lead to further research into counteracting toxin-associated resistance. Alternatively, it may highlight the need for more natural alternatives to commercial pesticides, as has been developed through research into insect pheromones.</p></sec><sec id="sec017"><title>Conclusions and future research</title><p>In summary, this research provides new information regarding the makeup of snail trail mucus, using a significant invasive pest snail, <italic toggle="yes">T. pisana</italic>. We found that <italic toggle="yes">T. pisana</italic> secretes AChE-like proteins into trail mucus during the reproductive stage, a time in which they are most active and vulnerable to pesticides. Based on a multidisciplinary investigation, we demonstrated that AChE-like proteins are produced in the snail mucous gland and ultimately spread into the trail mucus, a likely mechanism to protect the snail from the direct impact of organophosphates. Although acetylcholinesterase had been speculated to be a mechanism by which insects have overcome pesticides, this is the first description of this function in a land snail.</p><p>For future research, it would be of interest to perform biochemical analyses focused on the bioactivity of trail mucus AChE-like proteins. This would assist in determining whether the function of AChE-like proteins in land snails includes both a neuronal role along with the ability to scavenge organophosphates. <italic toggle="yes">Theba pisana</italic> has diversified the number and location of AChE-like proteins, compared to vertebrates. It would also be of interest to observe any differences in <italic toggle="yes">T. pisana</italic> that have never (or rarely) been exposed to pesticides, if any such populations can be found. This would lead to a better understanding of the molecular mechanism of variation. Finally, in recognition of the ability of snails to adapt and overcome toxin-mediated biocontrol measures, the potential for pheromones, likely also present in trail mucus, should be further investigated to overcome current and emerging land snail pest invasions.</p></sec><sec id="sec018" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material id="pone.0323380.s001" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Acetylcholinesterase-like protein sequences found in <italic toggle="yes">Theba pisana.</italic></title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0323380.s001.docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pone.0323380.s002" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S2 Fig</label><caption><title>Immunolocalization of AChE-like protein in non-reproductive <italic toggle="yes">Theba pisana</italic> trail mucus.</title><p>(A, B) Immunolocalization showing low/no acetylcholinesterase-like protein (green) in trail mucus.</p><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0323380.s002.docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pone.0323380.s003" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Summary of <italic toggle="yes">Theba pisana</italic> AChE-like proteins (with <italic toggle="yes">Homo sapien</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Danio rerio</italic>), including gene ID, best species match, length, pI and molecular weight.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0323380.s003.docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pone.0323380.s004" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>Summary of <italic toggle="yes">Theba pisana</italic> reproductive trail mucus AChE-like protein gene expression in mucous gland, albumen gland, foot and cerebral ganglia tissue.</title><p>Expression is in transcripts per million.

</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>1. The author needs to provide the reference for following the specific protocol for the Identification and characterisation of acetylcholinesterase-like genes (Line 141-160).</p><p>RESPONSE: A reference has now been included to the Methods that justifies the protocol used &#x02013; i.e. The general protocol used to identify and characterise snail genes was as described by Ballard et al., 2021 and Ballard et al., 2025.</p><p>2. Italicize the word In Vitro (Line 367).</p><p>RESPONSE: In vitro has now been italicized.</p><p>3. Kindly add full stop before the beginning of a new sentence i.e., For pesticides in the Line 364.</p><p>RESPONSE: A full stop has been added.</p><p>4. It&#x02019;s advisable to authors to strictly follow one font style throughout the manuscript.</p><p>RESPONSE: We agree and have ensure consistency in font style throughout. i.e. Times New Roman, font size 12.</p><p>5. Provide single space before the &#x02018;a notorious garden pest&#x02019; (line 378).</p><p>RESPONSE: A single space has now been added.</p><p>6. Locate the epithelial folds and other described things in the Figure 4 probably using arrows.</p><p>RESPONSE: To assist in recognition of the relevant histological features, we have annotated the images to provide labelled spatial location of the mucous gland lumen, smooth muscle and villi that represent the epithelial folds. In addition, the scale bars have been updated for clarity.</p><p>7. Author needs to mention the accession number of AChE-like proteins genes in Theba pisana, in the Figure 1A and in the text also.</p><p>RESPONSE: We now include in the main text (as S1 File and S2 File) and Figure 1 legend (as S1 File) where all AChE-like sequences used in the analyses can be found. The NCBI BioProject database under accession number PRJNA858108 is provided in the Methods and Resources for those who want to assess the raw data.</p><p>8.

What is the hypothesis behind this study?</p><p>RESPONSE: We thank the reviewer for recognising no clear hypothesis statement. In the Introduction section, we have added the study hypothesis - We hypothesized that land snails secrete AChE proteins into their trail mucus, which may function to neutralize pesticides.</p><p>10.

We postulate that there are other proteins that could help facilitate pesticide resistance and should be further investigated.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>1- Please explain more details about Acetylcholinesterase analysis in material and method</p><p>RESPONSE: To help clarify details of the AChE identification and analysis, we have added new information to the Material and Method section:</p><p>- Line 143 &#x02013; The general protocol used to identify and characterise snail genes was as described by Ballard et al., 2021 (1, 2)</p><p>- Line 165 &#x02013; Trail mucus was collected using a method previously described by Ballard et al., 2021(1, 2)</p><p>2- Please improve the English style</p><p>RESPONSE: All authors have proofread the manuscript prior to our resubmission.

In molluscs, this role has been confirmed through studies in Aplysia (7) and Mytilus (8). However, AChE potential role in overcoming OPs has been more intensively studied in invertebrates, particularly in the fruit fly (Drosophila) (9) and ticks (Rhipicephalus) (10). Molluscan gastropods are also excellent invertebrate models for investigating harmful biomarkers in an environment, especially since AChE activity functions in the space of inhibition against certain pesticides (11).</p><p>References</p><p>1.
