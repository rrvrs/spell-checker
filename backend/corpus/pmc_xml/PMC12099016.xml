The high protective factor of the N95 against the virus made it a popular option (<xref rid="bibr2-21650799241230039" ref-type="bibr">Feng et al., 2020</xref>). In the workplace current standards and guidelines specify that N95 wearers must be clean-shaven during use to optimize fit, since facial hair may create a physical seal barrier between the N95 and the face (<xref rid="bibr4-21650799241230039" ref-type="bibr">Occupational Safety and Health Administration [OSHA], 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bibr6-21650799241230039" ref-type="bibr">Prince et al., 2021</xref>). The U.S. OSHA Respiratory Protection Standard (29 CFR 1910.134) requires employers to protect workers from respiratory hazards which includes providing respirators when needed and fit testing. Tight fitting respirators are not to be worn by employees who have facial hair or any conditions that interfere with face to facepiece seal or valve function (<xref rid="bibr10-21650799241230039" ref-type="bibr">U.S. Department of Labor, Occupational Safety and Health Administration, 2006</xref>), and an alternate device or protection will be needed. However, regulating N95 use in public spaces presents unique challenges, as some individuals cannot shave due personal circumstances. To provide guidance for those individuals, it is important to better understand the impacts of beard length on N95 fitting, thus effectiveness. Yet, there are limited data on how different beard lengths may affect fit. The studies that investigated different beard lengths used visual standards to separate participants into categories instead of measuring the beard length (<xref rid="bibr7-21650799241230039" ref-type="bibr">Sandaradura et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bibr8-21650799241230039" ref-type="bibr">Singh et al., 2020</xref>), investigated a narrow range of lengths (<xref rid="bibr6-21650799241230039" ref-type="bibr">Prince et al., 2021</xref>), or used different individuals for the bearded and the controls, not accounting for differences in facial structures between groups (<xref rid="bibr3-21650799241230039" ref-type="bibr">Fergin, 1984</xref>; <xref rid="bibr7-21650799241230039" ref-type="bibr">Sandaradura et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bibr9-21650799241230039" ref-type="bibr">Skretvedt &#x00026; Loschoavo, 1984</xref>).

Written informed consent was obtained from the participants for their anonymized information to be published in this article.

To ensure proper donning, participants performed a negative pressure seal check by cupping the N95 with both hands and sharply inhaling to create a noticeable negative pressure. If participants were unable to create negative pressure, they would redon their respirator or change the size until a proper seal was achieved. A steel sampling port was installed in each N95 using a TSI model 8025-N95 Fit Test Probe Kit, following manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions regarding procedure and location, to allow sampling behind the mask. The participant&#x02019;s N95 sampling port was then connected to a PortaCount Respirator Fit Tester 8038 (TSI<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, MN, USA) using 10&#x02009;feet of 0.25-inch conductive silicone tubing. An identical secondary tube was connected at the ambient sampling line. The system was set to continuously monitor ambient and behind mask particles in the size range 0.02 to 0.08&#x02009;&#x003bc;m at a sampling rate of 1&#x02009;per second. Participants then were cleared to start CSA&#x02019;s fit test. The test consisted of seven tasks designed to simulate daily activities and encompassed a series of torso, head, and facial muscle movements (e.g., bending at the waist, reading aloud, turning head left and right, and up and down). Participants performed each task in order continuously for 1&#x02009;minute before moving on to the next task. The fit factor (FF) was calculated as:</p><p>

(2020)</xref>, the present study did not show significant differences in FF scores and passing rate between bearded and clean-shaven conditions. Although shaving increased the passing rate by one participant and the mean FF scores from 89.9 to 107.7 it was not enough to reach significance. The conflicting results between both studies might be caused by the difference in sample sizes. The sample size in this study was much smaller than the <xref rid="bibr7-21650799241230039" ref-type="bibr">Sandaradura et al. (2020)</xref> study that used 105 participants. A larger sample size would be ideal in this study due to the large variability in our FF scores and dichotomic nature of the fit test (pass or fail). Future studies may want to replicate our design using a larger sample. Another possible explanation for the lack of significance in results was that only a single model of N95 was tested. Facial hair is only one of the facial attributes that can influence respirator fitting. Manufactures cannot account for every possible facial attribute when designing N95 models, meaning that some individuals will struggle more when trying to find a respirator that fits properly. Although all the N95s in this study passed the negative pressure test, a larger variety of N95 models and sizes would be ideal to help participants to find an optimal fit. In U.S. workplaces, employers must adhere to the OSHA Respiratory Protection Standard regarding respirator selection and usage and fit testing (<xref rid="bibr10-21650799241230039" ref-type="bibr">U.S. Department of Labor, Occupational Safety and Health Administration, 2006</xref>).</p><p>The regression analysis showed a decrease in FF scores with longer beard lengths. Previous studies also demonstrated similar trends (<xref rid="bibr6-21650799241230039" ref-type="bibr">Prince et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="bibr7-21650799241230039" ref-type="bibr">Sandaradura et al., 2020</xref>). The strongest negative linear relationship (slope&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;1.63) was found between FF scores and the beard in the chin area. N95 wearers in public spaces should be aware of the detrimental effects on fit with longer beards and, if not able to fully shave, minimize beard length specially around the chin area.</p><p>This study had three main differences when compared to previous studies: The first was the use of repeated measures design to investigate the effects of beard length on fit factor scores. That allowed for better control for facial differences between groups. Second, beard length was measured in three different locations, which allowed us to study the effects of facial hair location on FF scores. Finally, a larger range of beard lengths was investigated in this study (0&#x02013;76&#x02009;mm), when compared to a similarly designed study (0&#x02013;10&#x02009;mm; <xref rid="bibr6-21650799241230039" ref-type="bibr">Prince et al., 2021</xref>).</p><sec id="section9-21650799241230039"><title>Limitations</title><p>The present study also contains limitations. First, the model of N95 used in this experiment only had two sizes available (small and medium/large). Although all participants achieved proper seal with the N95 model, using a greater variety of models and sizes might have increased the passing rates. Future studies may also try having a sub-sample of the participants to do the CLE condition first, with participants returning later for the BEA condition, to investigate the effects of condition order on passing rates. Another limitation was sample size, and due to the nature of measures used, the sample size might have been insufficient to reach significance. Future studies should try to replicate this study with a larger sample.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="section10-21650799241230039"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This preliminary study shows a tendency of decrease in N95 fit with increase in beard length. This effect seems more pronounced when the beard is in the chin area. Additionally, achieving good fit with an N95 is challenging with or without facial hair, and fit testing for the general public should be performed whenever possible. In the U.S. workplace, respirator usage, and fit testing is governed by OSHA (29 CFR 1910.134).</p><boxed-text id="boxed-text1-21650799241230039" position="float"><caption><title>Applications to Professional Practice</title></caption><p>The COVID-19 pandemic changed our understanding of how vulnerable we are to viral transmission, and thus how we behave within public spaces to mitigate our newfound sense of risk. With the disease still not fully controlled and the promise of new variants and new pandemic waves in the future, the use of masks to protect against transmission will continue to be commonplace. Understanding how the length of beards&#x02014;not just their presence&#x02014;can affect the fit of N95s may help to develop new public policies and guidelines to better protect individuals in public settings during high transmission periods. Preliminary study data points out that longer beards, especially in the chin area, may interfere with N95 protection, leaving individuals more exposed to airborne viruses. Data from this study also demonstrated that achieving an acceptable mask fit and fit testing is indeed complex particularly for the public at large. Occupational health professionals can provide information to workers about the publics&#x02019; use of N95s and the importance of fit testing to achieve a proper face seal. Workers who do not require respiratory protection in the workplace can use this information for self-protection and also share the information with family and others. Lastly, the authors would like to acknowledge that this paper does not provide evidence to justify the presence of beards in work environments where there are regulations in place for respiratory protection provided by OSHA, such as healthcare.</p></boxed-text></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="section11-21650799241230039" specific-use="figshare"><title>Supplemental Material</title><supplementary-material id="suppl1-21650799241230039" position="float" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>sj-docx-1-whs-10.1177_21650799241230039 &#x02013; Supplemental material for Preliminary Results on How Longer Facial Hair Lengths May Interfere With N95 Respirator Efficacy: A Brief Report</title></caption><media xlink:href="sj-docx-1-whs-10.1177_21650799241230039.docx"/><p>Supplemental material, sj-docx-1-whs-10.1177_21650799241230039 for Preliminary Results on How Longer Facial Hair Lengths May Interfere With N95 Respirator Efficacy: A Brief Report by Vinicius da Eira Silva, Meagan Abele, Ian Bercovitz and Sherri Ferguson in Workplace Health &#x00026; Safety</p></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are grateful to the field personnel, SFU&#x02019;s biology department for providing us the space, and our participants.
