</self-uri><abstract><sec><title>Background</title><p>Uganda reported a significant reduction in the mortality rate of children under 5 years of age, from 146/1,000 live births in 2000&#x02013;42/1,000 live births in 2021. With the rollout of Option B+, the vertical transmission rate of HIV decreased from 13.0% (2012) to 6.0% (2019). However, its impact on the mortality rate among children is not well documented. We determined the mortality rate and associated risk factors among infants exposed and not exposed to HIV attending immunization clinics in Uganda.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We conducted an observational prospective cohort study of mother&#x02013;infant pairs (MIPs) with infants exposed or unexposed to HIV. We enrolled infants aged 4&#x02013;12 weeks. The inclusion criteria were biological mothers attending health facilities that provide routine immunization for children and/or postnatal care visits who were able to provide signed written informed consent; mothers or infants who were not severely ill; and those who consented to have their infants tested for HIV antibodies at baseline and follow-up visits every 3 months until the children were aged 18 months. Child-HIV infection and death were censored events. Children lost to follow-up or withdrawn from the study were censored from analyses at the last documented study visit. The outcome of interest was child mortality, and the independent variables were mother&#x02019;s age; infant HIV exposure status; infant sex; family socioeconomic status; marital status; education level; malaria during pregnancy; birth attendee; mother&#x02019;s ART initiation; mode of transport to health facilities; breastfeeding pattern; 4 or more ANC visits; and mother&#x02019;s baseline viral load nonsuppression and place of delivery. We used Kaplan&#x02013;Meier survival curves to estimate cumulative mortality probability and the Wilcoxon log-rank test to compare differences in cumulative survival functions. We used multivariate Weibull proportional hazards and Weibull accelerated failure time (AFT) regression models with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to identify factors associated with child death.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Among the 16,718 MIPs identified, 11,519 (68.9%) mothers consented to study follow-up. At the 18-month follow-up, 0.7% (79/11,519) of the infants had died, 40.5% (32/79) of whom were exposed to HIV. The overall child mortality rate per 1,000 person-years was 5.0 (95% CI: 4.0--6.2) and was significantly greater among the infants exposed to HIV (14.2; 95% CI: 10.0--20.0) than among the infants not exposed to HIV (3.5; 95% CI: 2.6--4.6). In the adjusted model, the mortality risk factors were HIV exposure status (aHR5.6 95% CI: 3.5--9.4), maternal age&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;25 years (aHR1.8; 95% CI: 1.1--2.9), living without a partner (aHR1.8; 95% CI: 1.1--2.9), and delivery at home (aHR2.2; 95% CI: 1.3--4.0).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Single young mothers living with HIV delivering at home increased the risk of child mortality. Identifying mothers with risk factors early for support could reduce the risk of child mortality.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source>

There has been a 59% reduction in the child underfive mortality rate (U5MR) globally in previous decades, from 93 to 38 deaths per 1,000 live births between 1990 and 2021. However, the reduction in the U5MR in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) was slower than that in other regions, with 74 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2021 [<xref rid="pone.0324122.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The implementation of the United Nations&#x02019; Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) started in 2016 with a target U5MR of no more than 25 deaths per 1,000 live births in every country of the world by 2030 [<xref rid="pone.0324122.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Uganda has yet to achieve this target, with a current U5MR of 42 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2021 [<xref rid="pone.0324122.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>Globally, communicable and infectious diseases such as pneumonia, diarrhea, HIV/AIDS, and malaria continue to be the leading causes of preventable underfive deaths [<xref rid="pone.0324122.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Other factors, such as death of the mother, child vaccination status, breastfeeding status and low birth weight, have also been shown in several studies to be associated with morbidity and mortality among infants and are more pronounced among infants exposed than those not exposed to HIV [<xref rid="pone.0324122.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0324122.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Mosley et al.&#x02019;s analytical approach to the study of the determinants of child survival in low- and middle-income countries highlights the premise that all socioeconomic determinants, such as income/wealth, the political economy and the health system of child mortality, operate through a common set of biological mechanisms or proximate determinants, such as maternal factors, nutrition, and personal illness control, to affect mortality [<xref rid="pone.0324122.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Exposure to HIV has been widely documented to be a risk factor for infant mortality in the ZVITAMBO trial, which reported a 2-year mortality rate of 9.2% in infants exposed but not infected compared with 2.9% in those not exposed to HIV [<xref rid="pone.0324122.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324122.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. However, maternal antiretroviral therapy (ART) use during pregnancy and breastfeeding has been shown to reduce mortality in children under 5 years of age to levels observed in children of mothers not infected with HIV in South Africa [<xref rid="pone.0324122.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Young mother, illiteracy and income inequality have been documented to predict the infant mortality rate (IMR) in low- and middle-income countries [<xref rid="pone.0324122.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In 2013, in accordance with the WHO guidelines, Uganda was among the first countries in sub-Saharan Africa to incorporate Option B+ (life-long universal maternal antiretroviral therapy (ART)) into its national prevention of vertical transmission of HIV strategy [<xref rid="pone.0324122.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]; since then, the percentage of pregnant and breastfeeding women living with HIV receiving lifelong ART has increased from &#x0003c;1% to &#x0003e;95%, and transmission rates have decreased from 24% to 6% from 2010&#x02013;2019 [<xref rid="pone.0324122.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0324122.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Uganda is a country with a mature generalized HIV epidemic, with an HIV prevalence of 5.8% among adults aged 15 years plus approximately 1.5 million people living with HIV [<xref rid="pone.0324122.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Over time, the HIV epidemic has had a negative impact on overall child mortality rates in the country; thus, with increased access to ART for pregnant women living with HIV, the rate of HIV-related child mortality has been declining in Uganda. To determine child mortality rates and associated risk factors among infants exposed and not exposed to HIV, we analyzed data from the evaluation of the Impact of the national program for prevention of vertical transmission of HIV in Uganda, a nationally representative cohort of infants exposed and not exposed to HIV in Uganda up to 18 months postdelivery.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><p>We analyzed data collected as part of the Uganda prevention of vertical transmission of HIV impact evaluation study, a prospective observational cohort study of vertical transmission of HIV. The study included a nationally representative sample of mother&#x02013;infant pairs (MIPs), including infants exposed and those not exposed to HIV, recruited from immunization clinics within health facilities from 20<sup>th</sup> September 2017&#x02013;26<sup>th</sup> February 2018. The health facility sampling frame included all private and public facilities that offered infant first DPT vaccination in 2015, of which 206 health facilities were randomly selected without replacement. Infants aged 4&#x02013;12 weeks and their biological mothers receiving routine health care at the selected facilities were screened. Trained research assistants obtained written consent and enrolled mother&#x02013;infant pairs. Mother-infant pairs were excluded if the infant or mother was severely ill or if the mother did not consent to infant HIV testing. The infants were followed until incident HIV infection, death, or 18 months of age. MIPs had follow-up visits at 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18 months postpartum, with a&#x02009;&#x000b1;6-week allowance for follow-up visits. All infants exposed to HIV were assessed for HIV infection at follow-up visits with infants aged &#x0003c;18 months via HIV DNA PCR via dried blood spots and those aged &#x02265;18 months through onsite rapid antibody testing. For mothers living without HIV, at every visit, they were screened for new HIV infection via onsite rapid antibody testing. In addition, mothers living with HIV underwent maternal viral load testing at the 6- and 12-month follow-up visits. Data were obtained through maternal and infant questionnaires and abstraction of selected clinical variables from the child&#x02019;s Child Health Card (CHC).</p><p>Child characteristics collected at baseline included age, sex, birth weight (low, defined as &#x0003c; 2.5&#x02009;kg), feeding practices from birth to enrollment (exclusive breastfeeding or not), and HIV exposure status. Maternal characteristics collected at baseline included age, marital status, education, HIV viral load suppression (&#x0003c;1000 copies/ml), type of birth attendee, malaria during pregnancy, gestational age at antenatal care (ANC) enrollment, place of infant delivery, mode of transport to nearest health facility, and maternal ART status (the timing of maternal ART initiation). Socioeconomic status (SES) index by quintiles was a composite measure derived from household income and assets.</p><p>Child mortality was defined as any child death that was verbally reported by the mother or caretaker (not a biological mother) during the follow-up period. We defined a child as an infant exposed to HIV, if it was born to a mother who had an HIV-positive status confirmed by data from either the CHC, ANC card, maternal outpatient card, or rapid HIV test result during any study visit. Children were defined as an infant not exposed, if they were born to a mother who had an HIV-negative status and did not seroconvert during the study.</p><sec id="sec003"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Our outcome of interest was all-cause child mortality within the follow-up period to child age 18 months. Children who experienced the primary endpoint of the parent study (HIV infection via vertical transmission of HIV) at the baseline visit were excluded from analysis. Children who were lost to follow-up (i.e., unable to contact or locate participants for three consecutive missed appointment visits) or withdrew from the study for other reasons (i.e., refusal to continue or relocate out of the study area) and children who seroconverted during the follow-up period were censored from mortality analyses on the date recorded on the study suspension form or the last recorded study visit; their time at risk was age at their last visit. The time at risk for children who died was age at death. We calculated percentages, median values, and mortality rates per 1,000 person-years for maternal and child characteristics. We estimated the cumulative mortality probability via Kaplan&#x02013;Meier curves and the log-rank test to compare differences in cumulative survival functions among infants exposed and those not exposed to HIV. We used plots of the log-log of survival functions to assess for Cox proportional hazards assumptions that were violated for most of the independent variables. For multivariate analysis, we therefore used Weibull proportional hazards and Weibull accelerated failure time (AFT) regression models with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to identify factors associated with hazard of child death. To identify independent factors associated with child death, stepwise regression with the minimum Akaike information criterion (AIC) between the full model and the reduced model was used to identify variables to include in the final model. The strength of the association was expressed as adjusted hazard ratios and associated 95% CIs as well as failure time ratios with a 5% level of statistical significance. We used multiple imputation by chained equation (MICE) to impute missing values for variables with less than 10% missing values to avoid bias when more than 10% of the data were missing [<xref rid="pone.0324122.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Variables with more than 10% missing data were dropped from the model. The imputed variables were infant sex, feeding practice, maternal age, marital status, socioeconomic status, malaria during pregnancy, mode of transport to health facilities, place of delivery and number of ANC visits. We conducted 20 imputations to create a set of conditional distributions for each imputed variable, which replaced the missing value with a set of plausible values that represent the uncertainty about the value to impute.</p><p>The analyses were not weighted for the complex survey design of the parent study. All the statistical analyses were conducted in Stata 16.0 (StataCorp, Lakeway Drive, Texas, USA).</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Ethical considerations</title><p>This study was reviewed and approved by the Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI) IRB with reference number GC/127/17/03/579 and registered with the Uganda National Council for Science and Technology (See 45 C.F.R. part 46.114; 21 C.F.R. part 56.114).

Of note,in 2011 13.8% of children under five years of age were under weight with increased vulnerability to diesases; the infant and under-five mortality rates were 54/1000 and 90/1000 live births respectively with HIV prevalence at 7.3% [<xref rid="pone.0324122.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324122.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The lower observed rate in this analysis could reflect that all infants in the study were engaged in health care regularly for study visits at the clinics where they could receive health education, vaccinations and child nutrition monitoring, which improved the quality of child health services and thus reduced the number of preventable child deaths [<xref rid="pone.0324122.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Furthermore, infants exposed to HIV and their mothers had access to prevention of vertical transmission of HIV interventions, including maternal ART; the use of cotrimoxazole prophylaxis to prevent opportunistic infections, malaria, and upper respiratory infections; and the promotion of breastfeeding following the guidance of the World Health Organization (WHO) and Ministry of Health (MOH), which recommends a longer duration of breastfeeding instead of replacement feeding for infants exposed to HIV [<xref rid="pone.0324122.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0324122.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>In this study, an approximately fourfold greater child mortality rate was observed among infants exposed than among those not exposed to HIV. These findings are consistent with the available literature showing that infants exposed to HIV have higher mortality rates than those not exposed to HIV do, ranging from 4.0&#x02013;13.6% [<xref rid="pone.0324122.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324122.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324122.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. This could be due to the infant feeding options available, such as exclusive breastfeeding or no breastfeeding, which poses different dilemmas. For example, longer breastfeeding may increase the vertical transmission of HIV and thus HIV-associated mortality, whereas shorter or no breastfeeding may expose the uninfected child to common illnesses such as pneumonia that lead to mortality [<xref rid="pone.0324122.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324122.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Notably, there was no significant difference in mortality rates between exclusively breastfed infants and those receiving mixed or replacement feeding in the first 6 months, although studies have documented greater mortality rates among infants exposed than those not exposed to HIV with similar feeding patterns [<xref rid="pone.0324122.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324122.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324122.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Other studies have shown that even after the introduction of prevention of vertical transmission of HIV policies and programs, infants exposed are at increased risk of severe bacterial infections, impaired cognitive function and death compared with those not exposed to HIV. While the causes of these poor outcomes are multifactorial, studies suggest that this could be attributed to the impaired innate and adaptive immune responses observed in infants exposed to HIV, secondary to ART exposure and maternal HIV infection [<xref rid="pone.0324122.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324122.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p><p>A mother&#x02019;s age of less than 25 years was a significant risk factor for child mortality, which is consistent with several studies that have shown associations between young maternal age and poor child survival [<xref rid="pone.0324122.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324122.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0324122.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. This is especially relevant for Uganda, with a teenage pregnancy rate of 25% and a high percentage of women under the age of 25 [<xref rid="pone.0324122.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Young maternal age is associated with child mortality risk factors such as low birth weights, preterm deliveries, limited exposure to reproductive health and low maternal health-seeking behaviors, especially postnatal care [<xref rid="pone.0324122.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0324122.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Low birth weight is a known risk factor for infant mortality and influences the health outcomes of newborns [<xref rid="pone.0324122.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324122.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. In this analysis, the absence of infant birthweight data precluded its inclusion in the analytical models. With the estimated unmet need for family planning at 30.4% among women aged 15--19 years in Uganda, strategies such as additional socioeconomic and educational support and meeting the family planning needs of young mothers may further reduce child mortality rates [<xref rid="pone.0324122.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324122.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324122.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0324122.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>].</p><p>In this analysis, both mothers living without a partner and those delivering an infant at home significantly increased the risk of child mortality. Nabongo et al., in their cohort study of children in rural Uganda, reported that the child&#x02019;s birthplace, which was not a health facility, was associated with child mortality [<xref rid="pone.0324122.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. These factors could be markers of a lower socioeconomic status of the household [<xref rid="pone.0324122.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Studies have revealed that low economic status is associated with infant mortality because it affects access to healthcare, nutrition, and social services [<xref rid="pone.0324122.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324122.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324122.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. The quality of health care received by the infant and mother is often determined by the place of delivery, with infants delivered at home not receiving the full package of postnatal care. Sarmistha provides new evidence that institutional delivery can significantly lower child mortality risk because it ensures effective and timely access to modern diagnostics and medical treatments to save lives [<xref rid="pone.0324122.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. While public health and treatment programs are in place to address the availability of healthcare services, interventions that enhance the economic well-being of the lower socioeconomic group might also have positive downstream impacts on child mortality. There were at least five limitations in this study<italic toggle="yes">.</italic> First, the total number of infant deaths identified was small, limiting the ability to perform regression analyses. Second, MIPs were recruited from child immunization clinics, creating selection bias in the sample. While immunization rates in Uganda are high, MIPs not engaging in early childhood care or engaging outside the enrollment age would not have been screened for participation in the study. The selection approach likely excluded children who were not immunized and were at high risk of mortality from vaccine-preventable diseases [<xref rid="pone.0324122.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Therefore, the study population might have represented a healthier subset of the broader community, which potentially underestimated the true burden of mortality in the general population. Third, the study was not able to actively follow-up MIPs that were transferred to areas outside of the 152 study sites. As a result, transient MIPs may have been lost to follow-up. Fourth, selection bias could also have been introduced because of the study eligibility criteria, which excluded MIP due to severe illness of either the infant or the mother, mothers who were unable to give informed consent and those who refused the infant&#x02019;s HIV antibody test at baseline. Finally, there were significant missing data for some of the critical variables, such as birth weight, due to a lack of source documents.</p><p>Mortality among infants exposed to HIV was significantly greater than that among those not exposed to HIV. Several factors, including HIV exposure, younger maternal age, the absence of a male partner, and home delivery of the child, increase the risk of mortality. Efforts to reduce child mortality could consider screening for these factors to be able to provide interventions during pregnancy and through the postpartum period for mothers whose children are at increased risk. Future studies are needed to explore how these factors drive mortality in this age group.</p></sec><sec id="sec007" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material id="pone.0324122.s001" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S1 Dataset</label><caption><title>Mortality dataset used in analysis.</title><p>(XLS)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0324122.s001.xls"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pone.0324122.s002" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S2 Data</label><caption><title>Dictionary.</title><p>Varible descriptions within the mortality dataset.</p><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0324122.s002.docx"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank the prevention of vertical transmission of HIV impact evaluation study staff, study participants and health facility teams for their time and effort.

Including additional significance testing, presenting absolute data on events, and expanding the discussion of unexpected findings would greatly strengthen the paper.</p><p>Here a list of suggestions:</p><p>- Abstract</p><p>-- Methods: The abstract should clarify where the study took place and the inclusion criteria for the participants. For example, were these women who brought their children to immunization clinics? This needs to be explicitly mentioned.</p><p>Additionally, the abstract should specify which variables were studied.</p><p>-- Conclusions: The conclusion about home delivery does not seem to be the most significant finding and could be reconsidered.</p><p>- Introduction</p><p>-- Confidence Intervals: It is unnecessary to include confidence intervals for descriptive data in this section (e.g., line 47). These figures are meant to provide context, and whether the estimate is 2.6 million or 3.1 million does not affect the overall argument. The same applies to line 53.</p><p>-- Option B+ Reference: On lines 69&#x02013;71, is there a reference to support the introduction of Option B+ in Uganda? If not, this should be included.</p><p>-- HIV Prevalence: The introduction should explicitly include data on HIV prevalence in Uganda. The phrase "a country with a mature generalized HIV epidemic" is vague and should be clarified with specific prevalence data. How many people are affected? Why is it important to study HIV and infant mortality? These points should not be taken for granted, as the introduction must justify every aspect of the study design.</p><p>- Methods</p><p>-- S1 Text Reference: The reference to S1 Text is unclear. Is it a paper under evaluation for publication? If so, this should be explicitly stated. Citing a Word document is not appropriate for academic referencing. If the text is published, cite the published version. If it is under evaluation, clarify its status and provide more detail about its content.</p><p>-- Study Design and Sampling: The inclusion criteria and sampling methods need to be explained more clearly. For example, when and how were the women recruited? Were all women included? The methodology should provide a detailed explanation of how the study was conducted.</p><p>- Results</p><p>-- Table 1: Consider including tests of significance to identify differences between the samples of deceased and surviving participants.</p><p>-- Table 2: Similarly, tests of significance could be added here to improve the robustness of the analysis.</p><p>-- Key Findings: The paper primarily discusses "when" events occur (e.g., which groups have shorter survival times). However, it is unclear whether it also addresses "how many" events occur in each group (e.g., the absolute number or proportion of deaths or transmissions). To strengthen the results, I suggest additional analyses:</p><p>--- Significance testing: Compare the proportions of events (e.g., transmissions or deaths) between groups with different characteristics using chi-squared tests for categorical variables or t-tests/Mann-Whitney U tests for continuous variables.</p><p>--- Cumulative risk analysis: Include Kaplan-Meier survival curves and log-rank tests to analyze both the timing and the number of events.</p><p>--- Absolute data: Present the absolute number of events (e.g., transmissions or deaths) for each group to complement the findings on timing.</p><p>--- These additional analyses would address the critical question: do certain characteristics reduce the overall risk of death/transmission, or do they merely delay it?</p><p>- Discussion</p><p>-- Comparison with Older Data: Comparing the study sample with rural data from 15 years ago may not be the most appropriate choice. Are there more recent studies or datasets, such as World Bank data, that could provide a better comparison? If you decide to compare with the older study, include context about the previous cohort, such as HIV prevalence, maternal nutritional conditions, and other relevant factors.</p><p>-- Time in Care and Viral Load: It is surprising that time in care and viral load were not associated with the outcomes. This finding is inconsistent with existing evidence, which shows that longer time in care is associated with reduced neonatal infections and improved survival rates. If your findings diverge from this, it is essential to discuss why this might be the case.</p><p>-- Explore better limitations of the study related to selection bias. Another limitation of the study is the potential selection bias introduced by recruiting only mother-infant pairs attending immunization clinics. This approach likely excluded children who were not immunized and who may be at higher risk of mortality from vaccine-preventable diseases. As a result, the study population may represent a healthier subset of the broader community, potentially underestimating the true burden of mortality and transmission in the general population.</p><p>Reviewer #2:&#x000a0;This manuscript describes child mortality rates, up to age 18 months, and associated risk factors, in Uganda, with a particular focus on comparing mortality rates by child HIV exposure status. It provides a valuable contribution to the field of research, particularly as the study period (2017 &#x02013; 2018) coincided with the Universal ART era - a time marked by increased maternal access to ART and a reduction in vertical HIV transmission rates. Please consider addressing the following comments to help strengthen this manuscript.</p><p>Comments to authors:</p><p>General</p><p>1. General - The comparison of child mortality rates by HIV exposure status appears to be a main focus of this study, however this was not listed as one of the aims. Consider bringing this into the aims.</p><p>2. General &#x02013; Language. Authors should be careful to use non stigmatizing person-first language. Consider infants who are exposed to HIV and infants unexposed to HIV instead of HIV exposed infants and HIV unexposed infants. Consider HIV vertical transmission prevention (VTP) instead of PMTCT.</p><p>3. General &#x02013; Authors should consider carefully reviewing the manuscript for inconsistencies in spaces between words.</p><p>Abstract</p><p>4. Abstract &#x02013; Line 31. Authors should consider adding that they used multivariate regression.</p><p>Introduction</p><p>5. Introduction - Line 53: 42 deaths (29-60) per 1,000 live births in 2021. Please specify if the (29-60) is a 95% CI.</p><p>6. Introduction &#x02013; Line 65.

PMID: 31974572; PMCID: PMC7884806.</p><p>7. Introduction &#x02013; Check consistency in number of decimal places used throughout.</p><p>Methods</p><p>8. Methods &#x02013; Which participants were excluded from the study?</p><p>9. Were mothers and children HEI tested for HIV at every visit? Is it possible that they weren&#x02019;t tested and that there could have been misclassification of children HEI and HUI? If so, this should be discussed under limitations. Children HEI that die may have been living with HIV at the time of death. Children HUI also need to have been tested to be sure that they are not living with HIV. Although less common, children may acquire HIV horizontally.</p><p>10. Methods &#x02013; Line 96. How was maternal ART status defined?</p><p>11. Methods &#x02013; Line 115. Should &#x0201c;Wilcoxon log-rank test&#x0201d; just be log rank test?</p><p>12. Methods &#x02013; Line 116. The authors state that they compared the differences in cumulative survival functions among HEIs and HUIs, however, these results were not shown in the results section.</p><p>13. Methods &#x02013; Line 119. Authors should consider clarifying that they did Weibull proportional hazards regression and Weibull accelerated failure time regression (two different models).</p><p>14. Methods &#x02013; Line 124. The authors should justify only using multiple imputation for variables with &#x0003c;10% missing values. What was done with variables that have &#x0003e;10% missing values and how did this affect your sample size for analyses?</p><p>Results</p><p>15. Results &#x02013; Table 1. Authors should consider positioning HIV related variables (maternal viral load and maternal ART) together in the table.</p><p>16. Results &#x02013; Table 1. For several of the variables (e.g. Feeding practice, maternal age, marital status) the reported proportions need to be revised as they are slightly off, e.g. the proportion of all mothers living with a partner should be 79.3% instead of 78.2%.</p><p>17. Under ART status, for the proportion of mothers who initiated during pregnancy, is this only among women who were diagnosed with HIV before pregnancy? Authors to consider a footnote to clarify.</p><p>18. Line 155 &#x02013; Should this refer to cumulative probability or mortality rate? Consider ensuring the sentence doesn&#x02019;t fall between Tables 1 and 2.</p><p>19. Table 2 &#x02013; What does unweighted number refer to?</p><p>20. Table 2 - Consider positioning overall mortality above and separate from sex.</p><p>21. Table 3 &#x02013; Include time ratios in the table caption.</p><p>22. Table 3 &#x02013; What were the sample sizes for the adjusted models?</p><p>23. Table 3 &#x02013; Consider a footnote for the table explaining why some of the estimates are bolded.</p><p>24. Line 169 &#x02013; 170 &#x02013; This figure refers to figure 1, but p=1.37 is not shown in the figure. Consider going into more detail about the results in Figure 1.</p><p>25. Figure 1 - It may be helpful to have a footnote explaining that the y axis has been scaled to be out of 1000.</p><p>26. Figure 1 &#x02013; There are three smaller graphs. Two are stratified by mothers age and gender respectively and the third, showing cumulative probability of infant mortality/1000, is not stratified. It is unclear whether the third graph is meant to be a Kaplan Meier curve. Additionally, these three graphs were not mentioned in the methods section. If the authors choose to include the three small graphs, they need to be referred to in the methods section and more clearly explained in the figure caption.</p><p>Discussion</p><p>27. Discussion line 193 - &#x0201c;4.0-13.6&#x0201d;, are these deaths per 1000 person years?</p><p>28. Line 203 &#x02013; &#x0201c;adoptive&#x0201d; should be &#x0201c;adaptive&#x0201d;</p><p>29.

These points should not be taken for granted, as the introduction must justify every aspect of the study design.</p><p>Response: Noted and the content edited to address the comments.</p><p>Methods</p><p>-- S1 Text Reference: The reference to S1 Text is unclear. Is it a paper under evaluation for publication? If so, this should be explicitly stated. Citing a Word document is not appropriate for academic referencing. If the text is published, cite the published version. If it is under evaluation, clarify its status and provide more detail about its content.</p><p>Response: The paper is under evaluation for the publication. With your guidance, we have dropped the reference and edited the methods section to provide the methodology details.</p><p>-- Study Design and Sampling: The inclusion criteria and sampling methods need to be explained more clearly. For example, when and how were the women recruited? Were all women included? The methodology should provide a detailed explanation of how the study was conducted.</p><p>Response: We have edited the methods section to provide the missing details.</p><p>Results</p><p>-- Table 1: Consider including tests of significance to identify differences between the samples of deceased and surviving participants.</p><p>Response: Edited and included.</p><p>-- Table 2: Similarly, tests of significance could be added here to improve the robustness of the analysis.</p><p>Response: Done</p><p>-- Key Findings: The paper primarily discusses "when" events occur (e.g., which groups have shorter survival times). However, it is unclear whether it also addresses "how many" events occur in each group (e.g., the absolute number or proportion of deaths or transmissions). To strengthen the results, I suggest additional analyses:</p><p>Response: Additional analysis done, and a table has been added to figure 1</p><p>--- Significance testing: Compare the proportions of events (e.g., transmissions or deaths) between groups with different characteristics using chi-squared tests for categorical variables or t-tests/Mann-Whitney U tests for continuous variables.</p><p>Response: Additional analysis done, and p-values added to the tables 1 and 2</p><p>--- Cumulative risk analysis: Include Kaplan-Meier survival curves and log-rank tests to analyze both the timing and the number of events.</p><p>Response: Figure 1 revised to include the suggestions.</p><p>--- Absolute data: Present the absolute number of events (e.g., transmissions or deaths) for each group to complement the findings on timing.</p><p>Response: Done and included in figure 1</p><p>--- These additional analyses would address the critical question: do certain characteristics reduce the overall risk of death/transmission, or do they merely delay it?</p><p>Response: Additional analyses have been done as guided above. Of note there was violation of Cox proportional hazards assumptions by most of the independent variables, thus the accelerated failure time model (ACT) was used as the alternative. Without the use of the Cox proportional hazards model, we could not assess how various covariates influence the hazard rate to help with identifying whether a characteristic reduces the risk or merely delays the event.</p><p>Discussion</p><p>-- Comparison with Older Data: Comparing the study sample with rural data from 15 years ago may not be the most appropriate choice. Are there more recent studies or datasets, such as World Bank data, that could provide a better comparison? If you decide to compare with the older study, include context about the previous cohort, such as HIV prevalence, maternal nutritional conditions, and other relevant factors.</p><p>Response: The two cohorts have a 6-year difference (2009/11 and 2017/19) and not 15 years. Yes, there are recent statistics, but they are more about infant mortality rates and under 5 mortality rates which are not comparable to our 2 years follow up period. We have added context of the 2009/11 cohort in the text as guided.</p><p>-- Time in Care and Viral Load: It is surprising that time in care and viral load were not associated with the outcomes. This finding is inconsistent with existing evidence, which shows that longer time in care is associated with reduced neonatal infections and improved survival rates. If your findings diverge from this, it is essential to discuss why this might be the case.</p><p>Response: Yes, time in care and viral load were not associated with the main outcome (Child Mortality) since time in care and viral load captured were for the mother and not the child. If these were for the child, then it would be diverging from the existing evidence.</p><p>-- Explore better limitations of the study related to selection bias. Another limitation of the study is the potential selection bias introduced by recruiting only mother-infant pairs attending immunization clinics. This approach likely excluded children who were not immunized and who may be at higher risk of mortality from vaccine-preventable diseases. As a result, the study population may represent a healthier subset of the broader community, potentially underestimating the true burden of mortality and transmission in the general population.</p><p>Response: Suggestion accepted, and the limitation section of the discussion has been edited to reflect it.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>This manuscript describes child mortality rates, up to age 18 months, and associated risk factors, in Uganda, with a particular focus on comparing mortality rates by child HIV exposure status. It provides a valuable contribution to the field of research, particularly as the study period (2017 &#x02013; 2018) coincided with the Universal ART era - a time marked by increased maternal access to ART and a reduction in vertical HIV transmission rates. Please consider addressing the following comments to help strengthen this manuscript.</p><p>Comments to authors:</p><p>General</p><p>1. General - The comparison of child mortality rates by HIV exposure status appears to be a main focus of this study, however this was not listed as one of the aims. Consider bringing this into the aims.</p><p>2. General &#x02013; Language. Authors should be careful to use non stigmatizing person-first language. Consider infants who are exposed to HIV and infants unexposed to HIV instead of HIV exposed infants and HIV unexposed infants. Consider HIV vertical transmission prevention (VTP) instead of PMTCT.</p><p>3. General &#x02013; Authors should consider carefully reviewing the manuscript for inconsistencies in spaces between words.</p><p>Response: Thank you for your time to comprehensively review our manuscript and the constructive feedback you have given.
