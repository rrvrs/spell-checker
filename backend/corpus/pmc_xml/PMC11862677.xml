Although non-suicidal self-harm and suicidal behaviour are distinct concepts, the two forms of deliberate self-harm frequently coexist and share key instrumental functions, such as escaping aversive internal states, reducing dysphoria or communicating distress, especially in patients with personality disorders.

Non-suicidal self-harm is very common in patients with borderline personality disorder often considered to have a mitigating effect on the internal stress of these patients and sometimes even neglected. The relationship between non-suicidal self-harm and suicidal ideation is an important one, and may reduce suicidal ideation in the short term but subsequently encourage further self-harm, thereby increasing the risk of suicide.</p><p>Particular attention must be paid to these patients and their self-harm, and specialised, comprehensive care is required.</p></sec><sec id="sec7267"><title>Disclosure of Interest</title><p>None Declared</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="1"/></counts></article-meta></front></article>
