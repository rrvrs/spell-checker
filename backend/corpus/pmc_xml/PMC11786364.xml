In the current study, we performed a comparative analysis of the compositional features in different lots of the same na&#x000ef;ve phage display library and monitored alterations in their peptide compositions during three rounds of amplification.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">We conducted three rounds of duplicate serial amplification of two different lots of the Ph.D.&#x02122;-12 phage display library. DNA from the samples was subjected to Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) using an Illumina platform. The NGS datasets underwent a variety of bioinformatic analyses using Python and MATLAB scripts.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">We observed substantial heterogeneity in the sequence composition of the two lots indicated by differences in the enhanced percentage of wildtype clones, reduced diversity (number of unique sequences), and increased enrichment factors (EFs) during amplification as well as by observing no common sequence between lots and decreased number of common sequences between the na&#x000ef;ve library and the consecutive rounds of amplification for each lot. We also found potential propagation-related target-unrelated peptides (TUPs) with the highest EFs in the two lots, which were displayed by the fastest-propagating phage clones. Furthermore, motif analysis of the most enriched subpopulation of amplified libraries led to the identification of some motifs hypothesized to contribute to the increased amplification rates of the respective phage clones.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par4">Our results highlight tremendous heterogeneity in the peptide composition of different lots of the same type of na&#x000ef;ve phage display library, and the divergent evolution of their compositional features during amplification rounds at the amino acid, peptide, and motif levels. Our findings can be instrumental for phage display researchers by bringing fundamental insights into the vast extent of non-uniformity between phage display libraries and by providing a clear picture of how these discrepancies can lead to different evolutionary fates for the peptide composition of phage pools, which can have profound impacts on the outcome of phage display selections through biopanning.</p></sec><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12985-024-02600-x.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Amplification</kwd><kwd>Bias</kwd><kwd>Compositional heterogeneity</kwd><kwd>Enrichment factor</kwd><kwd>Illumina sequencing</kwd><kwd>Motif discovery</kwd><kwd>NGS</kwd><kwd>Peptide library</kwd><kwd>Phage display</kwd><kwd>Propagation-related peptides</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>European Union&#x02019;s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme</institution></funding-source><award-id>670261</award-id><award-id>670261</award-id><award-id>670261</award-id><award-id>670261</award-id><award-id>670261</award-id><award-id>670261</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sinkjaer</surname><given-names>Anders Wilgaard</given-names></name><name><surname>Sloth</surname><given-names>Ane Beth</given-names></name><name><surname>Andersen</surname><given-names>Amanda Oester</given-names></name><name><surname>Jensen</surname><given-names>Malte</given-names></name><name><surname>Bakhshinejad</surname><given-names>Babak</given-names></name><name><surname>Kjaer</surname><given-names>Andreas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>the Danish National Research Foundation</institution></funding-source><award-id>126</award-id><award-id>126</award-id><award-id>126</award-id><award-id>126</award-id><award-id>126</award-id><award-id>126</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sinkjaer</surname><given-names>Anders Wilgaard</given-names></name><name><surname>Sloth</surname><given-names>Ane Beth</given-names></name><name><surname>Andersen</surname><given-names>Amanda Oester</given-names></name><name><surname>Jensen</surname><given-names>Malte</given-names></name><name><surname>Bakhshinejad</surname><given-names>Babak</given-names></name><name><surname>Kjaer</surname><given-names>Andreas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003554</institution-id><institution>Lundbeck Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Novo Nordisk Foundation</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Innovation Fund Denmark</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009863</institution-id><institution>Neuroendocrine Tumor Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>The Danish Cancer Society</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Arvid Nilsson Foundation</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Neye Foundation</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Sygeforsikringen danmark</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Research Foundation of Rigshospitalet</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Research Council of the Capital Region of Denmark</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>John and Birthe Meyer Foundation</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Research Council for Independent Research</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Copenhagen University</institution></funding-source></award-group><open-access><p>Open access funding provided by Copenhagen University</p></open-access></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9;

Phage display is an <italic>in vitro</italic> evolution methodology based on the physical connection between genotype (the nucleic acid sequence encoding a ligand) and phenotype (the expressed ligand on the phage surface), allowing for the identification of amino acid sequences that bind specifically to a variety of targets. The introduction of peptide libraries has developed phage display into a high-throughput approach by selection of hugely diverse combinatorial libraries (with millions of different peptide sequences) towards a given target. Peptide phage display has been used for the isolation of high-affinity binders to numerous relevant targets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], which represent a remarkable potential for the development of targeted gene and drug delivery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and imaging platforms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par29">The screening of phage display peptide libraries is conducted through the procedure of biopanning. This consists of two steps: a selection step in which phages bearing peptides with high binding affinity to the target are enriched and an amplification step in which already enriched phage clones are increased in copy number to yield a new pool as input for the subsequent round of biopanning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Amplification is performed by infecting the host bacterium with the enriched phage clones, typically a laboratory strain of <italic>E.coli</italic>, followed by precipitation of phage particles through extraction. Biopanning is an iterative process that is repeated in multiple rounds to obtain binders of sufficiently high affinity to the target [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Library selections through biopanning have shown promise in the identification of many target-specific ligands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p id="Par30">In recent years, next-generation sequencing (NGS) has been coupled to phage display, allowing the sequencing of millions of clones in parallel. There is an increasing body of research using NGS for analysis of the results of biopanning outputs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. However, there is a limited number of studies using NGS for investigation of the na&#x000ef;ve unselected phage display peptide libraries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. These studies have revealed compositional bias in the na&#x000ef;ve phage display libraries. Amplification, which is an integral component of biopanning, is known as one of the major causes of the inception of bias in phage display libraries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Amplification leads to the unwanted enrichment and isolation of propagation-related target-unrelated peptides (Pr-TUPs). These are peptides that are displayed on phages with a higher propagation rate, leading them to become enriched in the pool in a target-independent manner. Thus far, phage display research has witnessed the use of some experimental [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] and bioinformatic approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] for Pr-TUP identification. It has already been demonstrated that a significant number of Pr-TUPs might exist in the phage display peptide libraries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Due to their nonspecific enrichment during phage display selection, Pr-TUPs hold considerable potential for misinterpretation of the data obtained from biopanning. If these peptides remain unidentified, they can be mistaken as target-related peptides, posing an enormous challenge for the translation of peptides identified by phage display into the clinic. Therefore, it is highly important to clean biopanning data by identifying Pr-TUPs and removing them from the pool of selected peptides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. There are few studies on utilizing NGS for analysis of amplified phage display libraries and investigation of the evolution of phage pools during amplification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], and to our knowledge, there is no report based on a comparative study of compositional features in different lots of a na&#x000ef;ve phage display library and how they evolve differently during amplification.</p><p id="Par31">In the current work, we used NGS to perform a comparative analysis on two lots of the Ph.D.&#x02122;-12 Phage Display Peptide Library and monitor alterations occurring in the library during successive amplification rounds. The Ph.D.&#x02122;-12 Phage Display Peptide Library (manufactured by New England Biolabs) is the most widely used phage display peptide library. Our results highlight tremendous heterogeneity in the sequence composition of different lots of the same type of phage display library, leading to divergent evolutionary trajectories during amplification for these lots. Additionally, we identified and reported propagation-related peptides, which are displayed on fast-propagating phage clones, enriched during serial amplification of the two lots. We also conducted an extensive motif analysis on the na&#x000ef;ve and amplified phage pools of the two lots and found motifs hypothesized to contribute to the higher amplification rate of phage clones in the library.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Lots of the library show differential changes in the frequency of wildtype and unique clones during amplification</title><p id="Par32">The FASTQ files from NGS were processed using Python scripts. The files were cleaned based on their Phred score and whether they contained a peptide insert or not (See Materials and Methods; Sect.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Sec15" ref-type="sec">Analysis of NGS data</xref>). For each sample, the total number of reads, the number of cleaned reads, and the number of removed reads are found in Supplementary Tables&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">A1</xref> and&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">A2</xref>. Additionally, the percentage of reads that did not contain a peptide insert was determined. These were denoted as the percentage of wildtype reads (Supplementary Tables&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">A1</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">A2</xref>). It was found that the frequency of wildtypes increases during rounds of amplification in both lots. The na&#x000ef;ve library used in SA1 contains 10.36% wildtypes and during the experiment, this increases to an average of 90.37% in round 3. In the na&#x000ef;ve library used in SA2, the percentage of wildtypes is lower (5.99%), and the amplified phage pool also represents a lower percentage of wildtypes in round 3 (an average of 61.81%). The number of unique reads shows variation in the na&#x000ef;ve library of two lots and is decreased during amplification rounds with the largest reduction in round 3. These findings are illustrated in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. Although the increased frequency of wildtype clones and reduced number of unique clones are observed in both SA1 and SA2, the two different lots of the library display a remarkable discrepancy in quantitative changes of these compositional features both in the na&#x000ef;ve library and during serial amplification-driven evolution of the library.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Overview of the percentage of wildtypes (black) and the number of unique reads (blue) in the two lots in the naive library and through the different rounds of amplification.

The merged files also contained the calculation of EF. The merged files containing all sequences were used to prepare the stacked bar plots (Sect.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Sec4" ref-type="sec">Diversity changes follow lot-specific patterns during amplification</xref>). All sequences with an EF value were used for the analysis of overlapping sequences between amplification rounds (Sect.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Sec5" ref-type="sec">The library lots are completely heterogeneous in sequence composition and become more homogeneous during amplification</xref>) and the EF distribution (Sect.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Sec6" ref-type="sec">The distribution of enrichment factors of peptides becomes more divergent during amplification with substantial discrepancies between lots</xref>). For the analysis of global and positional frequencies of amino acids (Sect.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Sec7" ref-type="sec">Global and positional frequencies of amino acids indicate distinct compositional changes between lots and during amplification</xref>), the top 1000 sequences with EF &#x0003e; 1 were used. For motif analysis (Sect.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Sec8" ref-type="sec">Motif analysis led to the identification of some motifs with probable association with a higher amplification rate of phage clones</xref>), the top 18,622 sequences with EF&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;1 were included for motif discovery in the primary structure of peptides and all sequences with EF &#x0003e; 1 were used for motif discovery in the secondary structure of peptides. This is illustrated in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Overview of how the merged files representing sequences from different replicates were generated and how the generated files were used for different analyses.

The results can be found in Supplementary Tables&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">A1</xref> and&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">A2</xref> for SA1 and SA2, respectively. In the na&#x000ef;ve library, considerable differences in the percentage of distinct sequences can be observed between lots. In the na&#x000ef;ve library used in SA1 experiment, there are 61.89% distinct sequences, whereas the percentage of distinct sequences in the na&#x000ef;ve library for SA2 experiment is 96.66%. The biggest alterations in the percentage of distinct sequences during amplification are observed in SA2 (ranging from 96.7% in the na&#x000ef;ve library to an average of 24.6% after the third round of amplification). In SA1, the percentage of distinct sequences exhibited less variation during serial amplification (61.9% in the na&#x000ef;ve library and an average of 57.7% after the third round of amplification). We also investigated the composition of different lots, both the na&#x000ef;ve and amplified libraries, by cataloging peptides into frequency-based populations and illustrating the distribution of different populations within each sample through stacked bar plots. Here, each sample was grouped into bins of different frequencies (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Through rounds of amplification, it is expected that the population of singletons (sequences with a single copy) decreases, and peptide sequences with high abundances increase in copy number.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Stacked bar plots visualizing the frequency distribution of sequences observed in NGS data from the SA1 and SA2 experiments. Peptide sequences were grouped into bins (shown by different colors) according to their copy number. c.p.: copy number</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12985_2024_2600_Fig3_HTML" id="MO3"/></fig></p><p id="Par35">There was a remarkable difference in the proportion of singletons between the na&#x000ef;ve libraries of the two lots (45.58% for SA1 and 93.62% for SA2). Furthermore, both lots indicate the trend of a decreasing singleton population as well as an increase in the population of repeated sequences (i.e., non-singletons) during amplification, which was reflected by enlargement of the previously existing bins representing non-singletons (with lower frequencies) and appearance of new bins representing highly frequent peptides. Of note, round 3 of SA1 was an exception, which exhibited an increased percentage of the singleton population. This observation might be ascribed to the higher diversity of the singleton population in SA1 compared to SA2 (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">A3</xref>), leading to less elimination of the members of this population from the SA1 phage pool. However, the enhanced percentage of singletons in round 3 of SA1 was accompanied by a decrease in the number of unique sequences in the singletons, highlighting a decline in the size of this population similar to other rounds of amplification. The data used to generate Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> can be found in Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">A3</xref>. In general, the reduced percentage of distinct sequences as well as the decreased number of singletons provides evidence for the diminished diversity of phage display libraries during serial amplification of the pool and that there is a substantial heterogeneity between lots in the observed pattern of diversity changes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>The library lots are completely heterogeneous in sequence composition and become more homogeneous during amplification</title><p id="Par36">To investigate the heterogeneity of the two libraries in sequence composition, the number of common sequences in the naive library and different rounds of amplification was calculated for both experiments. Initially, it was found that no sequences were common between both lots, highlighting the large extent of heterogeneity of the two lots. In Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, the number of overlapping sequences for the different datasets of the two experiments is shown. As indicated in the Venn diagrams, for both lots there is a remarkable reduction in the number of common sequences between the naive library and consecutive amplification rounds shown by comparison at two levels as follows: NL-R1 (498,111) &#x0003e; NL-R2 (208,302) &#x0003e; NL-R3 (4,637) for SA1 and NL-R1 (110,274) &#x0003e; NL-R2 (68,624) &#x0003e; NL-R3 (9740) as well as NL-R1<inline-formula id="IEq19"><alternatives><tex-math id="M1">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

Using EF, peptides with actual enrichment during rounds of amplification can be identified. Relying on the absolute copy number (frequency) of peptides during amplification rounds can be misleading, as these peptides might also have a high frequency in the na&#x000ef;ve library. Peptide sequences with EFs &#x0003e; 1 have been enriched during amplification, whereas peptide sequences with EFs = 1 have not been enriched during amplification and peptide sequences with EFs &#x0003c; 1 have been de-enriched during amplification. Hence, in the quest of identifying Pr-TUPs, which are peptides displayed on clones with increased propagation capacity, a criterion of EF &#x0003e; 1 should be fulfilled. To evaluate the distribution of EFs in each amplified pool, plots were made showing EFs and the number of peptides having each EF (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Generally, we observe an increase in the EF values for both lots during rounds of amplification. For instance, the highest EFs in rounds 1 and 3 are 142.86 and 18,861.05 for SA1, whereas the highest EFs in rounds 1 and 3 are 101.77 and 126,105.90 for SA2. This enhancement in the EF values is accompanied by a decrease in the number of peptides with lower EFs and an increase in the number of peptides with higher EFs. The phage pool consists of a subgroup of peptide sequences with very high EF values in round 2 and more pronounced in round 3 for both lots. These can be considered as potential Pr-TUPs. The list of the top 1000 peptide sequences from round 3 of amplification of both lots is available in Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">A4</xref>. For both lots, the number of peptides with EFs &#x0003e; 10<sup>2</sup> notably increased in round 3 (from 1 sequence in round 1 of both lots to 199 sequences in round 3 of SA1 and 62 sequences in round 3 of SA2). Also, it is evident that with increasing rounds of amplification, the distribution of EFs becomes more diverse. This is clear from the broadening of the EF values in rounds 2 and 3 compared to the more compact pattern in round 1. This increasingly diverse distribution of EF values highlights a more heterogeneous distribution of peptide frequencies, which is caused by the remarkable enrichment of fast-propagating phage clones in the later rounds of amplification. During rounds of amplification, the phage pool diversity collapses resulting in a lower number of distinct phage clones but with notably higher propagation rates compared to the other clones of the library.</p><p id="Par38">When comparing the two lots, the distribution of EFs is substantially different. The most prominent difference is observed in round 3, which indicates with increasing rounds of amplification a higher divergence can be observed between the two lots.

The observed global frequencies for each amino acid were calculated for every sample and compared to the expected frequencies (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). It was found that the most common amino acid is serine, and the least common amino acid is cysteine in both lots. Substantial differences can be observed when comparing the expected frequencies for arginine, asparagine, aspartic acid, cysteine, glutamine, histidine, lysine, proline, serine, threonine, and tyrosine to the observed frequencies in na&#x000ef;ve library and rounds of amplification. Once comparing the amino acid frequencies in amplification rounds to the na&#x000ef;ve library, some similarities can be observed between lots, such as overrepresentation of arginine, asparagine, and lysine as well as underrepresentation of cysteine and glutamic acid. However, the two lots also indicate some discrepancies in the amino acid frequencies during amplification, such as overrepresentation of phenylalanine, as well as underrepresentation of aspartic acid, glutamine, proline, and tryptophan in SA1, but overrepresentation of tryptophan and tyrosine as well as underrepresentation of alanine and serine in SA2.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><p>Global frequency for the top 1000 peptide sequences ranked according to EF for both SA1 (upper graph) and SA2 (lower graph).

For the na&#x000ef;ve libraries from both lots, we observe a non-random pattern of amino acids, before being subjected to any selective pressure for amplification. We observe an overall underrepresentation of arginine, cysteine, and glutamine, and an overall overrepresentation of alanine, asparagine, aspartic acid, histidine, proline (except position one), serine, and threonine in the na&#x000ef;ve libraries of both lots. However, there are some dissimilarities between the na&#x000ef;ve libraries from the two lots, e.g., alanine and histidine show a higher representation in SA2 compared to SA1, whereas isoleucine, phenylalnine and tyrosine show a lower representation in SA2 compared to SA1. This discrepancy in the na&#x000ef;ve library will lead to differences in the amino acid composition in the amplified pools of the two lots. During rounds of amplification, several amino acids converge to a similar pattern in both lots, for instance, the presence of arginine increases in the last positions compared to the beginning of the peptide, where it is most underrepresented. Furthermore, leucine at position one becomes more underrepresented, whereas glycine and serine at position one become more overrepresented with rounds of amplification.</p><p id="Par42">Furthermore, comparison of the plots of amplified libraries from the two lots indicates lot-specific patterns of amino acid representation at many positions; e.g. position 5 of alanine, position 4 of asparagine, position 10 of aspartic acid, position 12 of glutamic acid, position 2 of glycine, position 6 of leucine, position 1 of phenylalanine, position 5 of proline, position 10 of tryptophan, position 5 of tyrosine, etc. As a whole, our findings reveal major differences in the amino acid composition of the most enriched peptides of the two lots and highlight different sequence-dependent evolution of these lots during rounds of amplification.<fig id="Fig7"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption><p>Positional frequency for the top 1000 sequences ranked according to EF for both SA1 (upper row) and SA2 (lower row).

Motif discovery in the primary structure of peptides was conducted through the STREME tool in the MEME database to identify ungapped tripeptide and hexapeptide motifs in the naive library and in the samples from amplification rounds. Only sequences with EF &#x0003e; 1 were included in the analysis to restrict motif identification to the most enriched sub-population of peptides in the pools. These highly enriched peptides are more likely to represent Pr-TUPs. The amino acid lengths were selected because a three-amino acid sequence is known as the minimal length for a functional motif [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] and a six-amino acid sequence is the average length of SLiMs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], which are short linear functional motifs found in nature. A search for motifs in the na&#x000ef;ve library was performed as a measure to identify background motifs (i.e., motifs with no association with amplification). The motifs identified by STREME are shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref> (hexapeptide motifs) and in Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">A1</xref> (tripeptide motifs). To obtain a deeper understanding of the probable contribution of these motifs to increased amplification, the number of reads containing the identified motifs was determined and an enrichment score (ES) for each motif during amplification rounds was calculated. ES was calculated as the ratio between the number of reads containing the motif in the given round of amplification and the number of reads containing the motif in the na&#x000ef;ve library (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and Supplementary Tables <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">A5</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">A6</xref>). A higher ES increases the probability of a motif being correlated with an increased amplification rate.</p><p id="Par44">The results of the motif analysis indicate that except for a few identical motifs (like DLR, WPL, VPV, GLR), most of the motifs differ between the lots (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref> and Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">A1</xref>). There are many dipeptide motifs that are likely false-positive hits stochastically found in the peptide pools. Furthermore, many of the identified motifs are present in a low number of unique reads. This is obvious for hexapeptide motifs that are found in a lower number of unique reads compared to tripeptide motifs (Supplementary Tables <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">A5</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">A6</xref>). There are some tripeptide motifs that are found in a remarkably high number of unique sequences (like LPL, SLP, LPS, DLR, among others). However, they all possess low ES. The only exception is the motif MAY which has the highest ES among all tripeptide motifs.</p><p id="Par45">Most of the hexapeptide motifs also possess low ES, but a few motifs including SVSRY, GRAMAY, RAMAYS, MAYSTI exhibit high ES (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">A6</xref>). Interestingly, three of these sequences harbor the penta-amino acid motif RAMAY that is conserved in rounds 1 and 2, and the tetra-amino acid motif MAYS that is conserved in rounds 2 and 3 of SA1. The tri-amino acid motif MAY has been conserved through all rounds of amplification. The conservation of these amino acid sequences during rounds of amplification as well as their absence in the na&#x000ef;ve library strengthens the hypothesis that these motifs might genuinely contribute to the increased amplification rates of the respective phage clones.<fig id="Fig8"><label>Fig. 8</label><caption><p>The discovered hexapeptide motifs from the STREME analysis on the top 18,622 sequences (ranked based on EF) of the na&#x000ef;ve library (NL), round 1 (R1), round 2 (R2), and round 3 (R3) of both SA experiments.

The FASTQ files underwent quality filtering using a Python script. Initially, the script removed reads with three nucleotides with a Phred score below Q20 to reduce the number of reads with sequencing errors. Then, the nucleotides were translated into amino acids. The script further removed reads without the GGGS-linker (i.e., wildtype sequences) and reads containing ambiguous nucleotides (i.e., &#x02018;X&#x02019; or &#x02018;*&#x02019;). The FASTQ files from different rounds of amplification were combined into files containing the sequences of all unique reads, the number of reads, relative frequency, and the calculated enrichment factor (EF) (i.e., na&#x000ef;ve library- round 1, na&#x000ef;ve library-round 2, etc.). The EF was calculated as the ratio between the relative frequency of the peptide sequence in one of the rounds of amplification and the relative frequency of the same peptide sequence in the na&#x000ef;ve library for both replicates. EF provides a measure of how much the sequence is enriched during rounds of amplification while taking into account the abundance of the peptide in the experimental input. Sequences with EF = 1 were considered to have no enrichment, whereas sequences with EF &#x0003c; 1 were considered to be de-enriched during amplification and sequences with EF &#x0003e; 1 were considered to be enriched. Furthermore, the script combines the files from different rounds of amplification with the na&#x000ef;ve library.</p><p id="Par59">For each experiment, two replicates were included.

The global and positional frequencies were determined by using the top 1000 peptide sequences ranked based on their EF values. The global and positional frequencies were compared to the theoretically expected values. The expected values were calculated based on the number of available codons for each amino acid according to the NNK codon randomization used for library construction. Motif analysis was performed on both the primary and secondary structures of the most enriched sub-population of peptide pools. Motif analysis on the primary structure of peptides was performed using the motif discovery tool STREME [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. This motif discovery tool identified ungapped tripeptide and hexapeptide motifs enriched compared to a shuffled dataset of the input sequences until three consecutive motifs were discovered with a p-value exceeding 0.05. The statistical test was a Fisher Exact Test. The input dataset consisted of the top 18,622 sequences (based on EF value) in FASTA format. This number of sequences was chosen as it allowed for equal treatment of all samples, being the highest number that could be extracted from each sample while remaining within the maximum limit that could be run. The discovered motifs were subsequently used to identify all motif-containing sequences in the na&#x000ef;ve library and amplification rounds of both SA experiments. Finally, the secondary structure of peptides was investigated for the presence of eight reported tetrapeptide motifs associated with <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-turn formation in the na&#x000ef;ve library and amplification rounds of both SA experiments. All sequences with an EF &#x0003e; 1 were included in this analysis. If sequences contained one of the <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-turn-related motifs, the analysis also noted if the motif was located at the N-terminus of the corresponding peptide.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par65">It is critically important to investigate the composition of phage display libraries to increase the likelihood of a successful ligand discovery. Gaining insights into the peptide content of phage pools can help in the development of successful selection strategies for finding target-specific ligands. On the other hand, amplification is a central component in phage display protocols; however, it is well known that amplification generates bias in the phage pools. Therefore, knowing how amplification can alter the sequence composition of phage display libraries is essential. To our knowledge, this is the first report based on deep sequencing by NGS in which the peptide composition of different lots of the same na&#x000ef;ve phage display library is investigated and their compositional features are monitored during three successive rounds of amplification. Additionally, we included two replicates for amplified phage pools to cover a broader diversity and for increased accuracy in our analyses.</p><p id="Par66">In the current work, a significant heterogeneity between peptide compositions in the two lots was found. This was highlighted by observing no common sequences between the two lots in the analysis of overlapping sequences (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). The observed heterogeneity between the two lots might have several explanations. First and foremost, it can reflect the actual heterogeneity present in the library. This arises during the library construction, as the complete sequence space cannot be covered by the library due to a limited transformation efficiency of phage vectors into the host bacterial cells. The theoretical sequence space of a 12-mer library is 4.1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>15</sup> and taking the maximal complexity 10<sup>9</sup> that can be achieved during transformation, the Ph.D.&#x02122;-12 library solely covers 0.00002% of all possible sequences in the optimal scenario. Another explanation is the sampling or preparation bias, as there are several steps in the experiments in which bias can happen. This type of bias can take place both before sequencing once the samples are prepared for NGS (withdrawal of phages from the na&#x000ef;ve library or amplified phage pools, DNA extraction from phages, PCR amplification, purification of PCR products, and indexing) and during sequencing of amplicons (loading a subset of phage-derived DNA onto the flow cell, amplification during sequencing, and the occurrence of sequencing errors). However, this is a less likely scenario, as no common sequence was found even in the na&#x000ef;ve libraries of both lots. Due to the larger diversity compared to amplified phage pools, na&#x000ef;ve libraries are less prone to sampling and preparation bias. Another less probable explanation is the restriction of the currently used NGS platforms which only cover a minor fraction of the whole sequence space present in the library. We also observed a decreased number of common sequences between the na&#x000ef;ve library and amplified pools with the progress of amplification (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Reduction in the number of common sequences between the na&#x000ef;ve library and rounds of amplification for each lot can be attributed to the competitive evolution of the pool under amplification pressure and, thus, the consequential elimination of many clones from the library. This pattern is observed in both lots; however, with some variations, suggesting that the two lots have different evolutionary trajectories. Heterogeneity between the two lots is also illustrated by discrepancies in the number of unique sequences and the percentage of wildtypes (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), as well as dissimilarities in diversities shown by the different percentages of singletons and repeated sequences between the two lots (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) where the entire peptide pool is included in the analysis. This heterogeneity is also reflected by differences in the distribution of EFs (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>), and the distinct patterns of amino acid frequencies (Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> and <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>) when using datasets sorted based on EFs.</p><p id="Par67">To investigate the diversity of phage pools, the number of distinct sequences was calculated. A decrease in the diversity of phage display libraries during amplification has been reported previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. In the present work, the reduced diversity of the phage display libraries was observed by the reduced number of unique sequences and the increased percentage of wildtypes (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). As seen in the figure, the number of unique sequences and the abundance of wildtypes are inversely correlated, and it can be seen for both lots that the largest increase in the wildtype frequency and the biggest collapse in the number of unique sequences occur in round 3. This might underscore that successive rounds of amplification can be avoided for library selection, as it leads to an increase in the wildtype percentage in the resulting phage pool. In the case of a biopanning sample, the percentage of wildtypes might increase even more, as it is likely that there are fewer competitors for wildtype clones in the phage pool. This is also in line with evidence from the literature highlighting that only one round of selection might be sufficient for the enrichment of target-binding ligands by using NGS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Our findings also revealed lot-specific patterns in the diversity changes.</p><p id="Par68">In the analysis of EF distribution across the two experiments during different rounds of amplification (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>), a trend of an enhancing number of fast-propagating clones (i.e., clones with higher EFs) and increasing EFs were observed for both lots. However, the heterogeneity between the two experiments is highly evident in this analysis, showing a similar trend, but with SA1 containing a larger pool of peptides with increased EFs. One of the major differences can be observed for round 3, where SA1 contains a higher number of peptides with high EFs and a broader distribution of different EFs compared to SA2. The global and positional frequencies of the individual amino acids were determined among the top 1000 peptide sequences, ranked according to their EFs (Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> and&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). The positional frequency provides additional insight into the pool of sequences, as the analysis can show differences in frequencies in a sequence-dependent context, enabling the identification of amino acid contents that are associated with amplification. The frequency patterns (under- and overrepresentation of certain amino acids in the amplified pools compared to the na&#x000ef;ve library) observed in the amplified samples in this analysis might be potential indicators of a higher amplification rate.</p><p id="Par69">The bias associated with amplification can be either sequence-dependent or sequence-independent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Sequence-independent bias results from mutations within the phage genome that increase the amplification rate of phage clones, irrespective of the displayed sequence. Thus far, point mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], genomic rearrangement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>], and genomic deletion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] have been described as causes for higher amplification rates of phage clones. Sequence-dependent bias has not been extensively examined. However, it has been found that some sequences infer a lower amplification rate of phage clones, and as a result, such sequences are under-represented in the library [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. On the other hand, little is known about sequences that increase the amplification rate of phage clones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. In line with this, we attempted to identify motifs that are likely associated with the increased amplification rate of phage clones. To rule out stochastically occurring motifs, the motifs had to meet some criteria. One criterion was that those sequences with the highest EFs (a dataset with the top 18,622 sequences ranked based on EF) were included in the analysis. Additionally, motif analysis was performed on the na&#x000ef;ve library as well, as a measure of identifying background motifs, which are not likely to be associated with a higher propagation capacity. Taking the vastly different compositions of the two lots into consideration, a similar motif between the two lots can bear valuable information about amplification. The length of the motifs was determined to be either three or six amino acids. A three-amino acid sequence is considered the minimal length of a motif [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], and a six-amino acid sequence is the average length of a short linear motif (SLiM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. SLiMs are short, conserved motifs rich in the intrinsically disordered regions of the human proteome and play important roles in many protein-protein interactions in nature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. The motif search in the current work is not restricted to the findings of the STREME analysis but contains a greater investigation into the STREME output to provide stronger evidence for the genuineness of the identified motifs. This was performed by calculating the number of absolute reads containing the given motif and calculating the ES for each motif during amplification. Our analysis led to the identification of some motifs with high ES (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), which have been conserved during rounds of amplification (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). These motifs are very likely to be associated with a higher amplification rate of the respective phage clones. However, they are not found in many of the highly frequent peptides (listed in Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">A4</xref>) that are displayed on the most enriched clones. This is due to the fact that higher propagation rate of these clones, which leads to their enrichment during amplification rounds, can also result from their genotypic features (e.g. propagation-enhancing mutations in the phage genome). Thus, the genetic mapping of mutations in the most abundant clones can offer more detailed insights into the mechanisms driving the propagation of these clones. The motif analysis was further extended to the secondary structure of peptides, where motifs associated with the formation of <inline-formula id="IEq87"><alternatives><tex-math id="M23">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

In our work, the data are based on the analysis of a large dataset obtained from NGS of the phage pools, unlike the previously mentioned report that relies on the analysis of a limited number of peptide sequences by Sanger sequencing of the phage pools.</p><p id="Par70">The emergence and undesirable isolation of TUPs in the biopanning outputs is very common and can be considered as the major issue associated with peptide phage display. Identification and reporting of Pr-TUPs hold great promise for the phage display community to help elucidate the nature of identified peptide leads. We identified the top 1000 sequences with the highest EFs (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">A4</xref>) from each lot of the Ph.D.&#x02122;-12 phage display library, which is the most commonly used phage display peptide library for biopanning according to the statistics available through Biopanning Data Bank (BDB). Our findings reveal that Pr-TUPs are specific to each lot. This can be explained by the extensive heterogeneity between the two lots of the phage display library in question. Our list of identified peptides can serve as a control for the analysis of biopanning data when using these two lots of the library, as the isolation of these sequences in the selection output cannot be attributed to target-specific selection and these peptide sequences should be filtered out of the biopanning output.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par71">Understanding the peptide composition of the na&#x000ef;ve and amplified phage display libraries can aid the search for promising target-binding ligands. The outcome of phage display selections can be affected by differences in the sequence composition of different lots of phage display libraries. In the current work, we investigated the composition of peptide pools at three different levels: the level of peptides, the level of amino acids, and lastly, the level of motifs. Our findings reveal substantial heterogeneity between different lots of the same phage display library, and additionally provide evidence for the different evolutionary trajectories of different lots of the library during amplification. This was observed by the considerable changes in the composition of the phage pool during the amplification of each lot and that these compositional changes are specific to each lot. The findings of the current study can be illuminating for phage display researchers by providing them with novel insights into the complexities of phage display peptide libraries and advancing their understanding of how these complexities can impact the interpretations of phage display selections.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>
