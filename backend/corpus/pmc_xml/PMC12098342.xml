The emergence of new variants of SARS-CoV-2 and ongoing post-COVID complications necessitate continuous exploration of effective treatments. Kaurenoic acid (KA) is a tetracyclic diterpenoid isolated from plants of the <italic>Copaifera</italic> genus and has been previously recognized for its anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, antifungal, and antitumor properties. However, there is a lack of knowledge about the <italic>in vitro</italic> effects of KA on viruses. Here, we evaluated its effect on SARS-CoV-2 replication for the first time.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results</title><p>KA demonstrated a high selective index of 16.1 against SARS-CoV-2 and robust effectiveness against the B.1.617.2 (Delta) and BA.2 (Omicron) variants. Mechanistically, KA was shown to impair the post-entry steps of viral replication. In a subgenomic replicon system, we observed a decrease in viral RNA synthesis in different cell lines. Using an infectious virus, a larger reduction in the release of SARS-CoV-2 virions was observed. We suggest that KA interacts with SARS-CoV-2 proteases through molecular docking.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, KA emerges as an inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 proteases and, consequently, its replication cycle. It could be a good candidate for further investigation in clinical assays against SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical"><title>Graphical abstract</title><p>

SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted mainly by respiratory droplets, leading to asymptomatic cases or causing symptoms such as cough, headache, and fever. However, numerous COVID-19 patients develop a severe chronic disease with dyspnea, hypoxemia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which eventually can lead to death. Furthermore, COVID-19 is also characterized as an extrapulmonary disease with kidney and liver injury, gastrointestinal symptoms, arrhythmias, and coagulopathy (<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">Trougakos et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">Hillary and Ceasar, 2023</xref>).</p><p>As of mid-2024, 10 vaccines used for prophylaxis against COVID-19 have received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), including vaccines manufactured by Sinovac-Coronavac, AstraZeneca/Oxford, Janssen, Pfizer/BioNTech, and Moderna (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/covid-19-vaccines-2024-2025" ext-link-type="uri">COVID-19 Vaccines for 2024-2025 | FDA</ext-link>). In addition, three directly acting antiviral drugs have been approved for COVID-19 treatment: polymerase inhibitors Remdesivir and Molnupiravir as well as the protease inhibitor Paxlovid&#x000ae; (<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">Beigel et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">Fischer et al., 2022</xref>; <xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">Jayk Bernal et al., 2022</xref>). Even though these drugs have played an important role in COVID-19 management, they were not designed to address the SARS-CoV-2 replication directly. In addition, they can induce viral resistance and adverse effects and are prescribed only for severe cases of COVID-19, which do not always result in a reduction in the duration of infection, hospitalization time, and/or mortality (<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">Amstutz et al., 2023</xref>). Additionally, COVID-19 still burdens health systems worldwide due to the emergence of variants of SARS-CoV-2 with mutations that result in increased transmissibility, immune evasion, and waning of immunity obtained through vaccination and/or previous SARS-CoV-2 infection (<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">Lippi et al., 2022</xref>). Altogether, these might interfere with the efficacy in controlling the current pandemic. In the worst scenario, patients who have recovered from COVID-19 frequently develop post-COVID syndrome, in which symptoms can last for 9 or more months. The symptoms/complications described so far encompass neurological effects (brain fog, loss and/or impairment in vision), thromboembolism, cardiac arrhythmia, infertility, deregulation of the menstrual cycle, and the thyroid gland (<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2024</xref>; <xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">Maruki et al., 2024</xref>). In this context, identifying novel molecules, especially those that are compatible with the already-approved ones, is an attractive approach for discovering new anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs.</p><p>Natural products (NPs) are important leads in developing drugs against a diversity of chronic and infectious diseases. The diversity of scaffolds and the structural complexity found in NPs are unparalleled (<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">Butler, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">Newman and Cragg, 2020</xref>). The importance and impact of NPs in the treatment of COVID-19 are evidenced by the fact that, to date, they continue to generate anti-SARS-CoV-2 candidates. Among them, the <italic>Marantodes pumilum</italic> extract, SKF7, was described as a SARS-CoV-2 inhibitor by impacting 3CLpro activity. Additionally, the arylnaphthalene lignan 6&#x02032;-hydroxy justicidin B, isolated from <italic>Justicia procumbens</italic>, reduced viral replication both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref rid="ref46" ref-type="bibr">Yoo et al., 2024</xref>), while xanthohumol and its derivatives from <italic>Humulus lupulus</italic> were characterized as SARS-CoV-2 protease inhibitors (<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">Herzog et al., 2024</xref>). Thus, investigating molecules isolated from natural sources reveals promising therapeutic potential.</p><p>Trees belonging to the genus <italic>Copaifera</italic> are an attractive source of bioactive molecules. The genus comprises 72 recognized species of which over 20 are found in Brazilian flora (<xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">Veiga et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">Leandro et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">Damasceno et al., 2019</xref>). NPs isolated from this genus showed good activity against ulcers, inflammation, leishmaniasis, and gonorrhea (<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">Furtado et al., 2018</xref>), and therefore these plants are frequently used in traditional medicine. Kaurenoic acid (KA) is a tetracyclic diterpenoid commonly found in <italic>Copaifera</italic> spp., and it is known for its anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, antifungal, and antitumor properties (<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">Leandro et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">Matos et al., 2018</xref>).

Therefore, here we evaluate and characterize the potential of KA to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec3"><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec4"><label>2.1</label><title>Cell culture and the compound</title><p>Human adenocarcinoma alveolar basal epithelial cells expressing ACE2 and TMPRSS2 receptors (A549-AT, National Institute for Biological Standards and Control [NIBSC], United Kingdom, #101004), African green monkey kidney cells expressing ACE2 (Vero-E6-ACE2, NIBSC, United Kingdom, #101001), and baby hamster kidney cells (BHK-21, ATCC #CCL-10) were cultivated in Dulbecco&#x02019;s modified Eagle&#x02019;s medium (DMEM; Sigma&#x02013;Aldrich, Gillingham, United Kingdom) supplemented with 100 U/mL penicillin (Gibco Life Technologies, Thermo-Fisher Scientific, Paisley, United Kingdom), 100 mg/mL streptomycin (Gibco Life Technologies, Thermo-Fisher Scientific, Paisley, United Kingdom), 1% (v/v) non-essential amino acids (Gibco Life Technologies, Thermo-Fisher Scientific, Paisley, United Kingdom) and 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS; Hyclone, Logan, UT, United States) at 37&#x000b0;C in a humidified 5% CO<sub>2</sub> incubator.

Briefly, <italic>C. oleoresin</italic> (150 g) was chromatographed over silica gel 60H (Merck, art. 7736) using vacuum liquid chromatography (VLC) (<xref rid="ref001" ref-type="bibr">Pelletier et al., 1986</xref>) with increasing amounts of 20% ethyl acetate in <italic>n</italic>-hexane as eluent, thus yielding six fractions (F1&#x02013;F6). Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) analysis and comparison with an analytical standard revealed that KA was present as the major compound in fraction 2 (23.3%). Then, F2 was submitted to another VLC using silica gel 60H (Merck, art. 7736) with increasing amounts of 3% ethyl acetate in <italic>n</italic>-hexane as the eluent, resulting in 10 fractions (F2.1&#x02013;F2.10). After TLC analysis, it was noticed that KA was present in the seventh fraction (F2.7; 11.4 g), thus yielding 5.7 g of this compound after washing with cold methanol. The compound identification was confirmed through spectroscopic analysis, with a purity between 95% and 98% confirmed by integration of peak areas in the <sup>1</sup>H nuclear magnetic resonance (<sup>1</sup>H NMR) spectrum. This method was based on a previous method published by our group (<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">Nascimento and Oliveira, 2001</xref>) and supported by the <sup>1</sup>H NMR studies (<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">Cushman et al., 2014</xref>).

First, as S-protein is crucial for SARS-CoV-2 virion formation and release, we assessed the effect of KA against the Delta and Omicron S-protein chimeras constructed using an infectious clone of the Wuhan strain. For this, the spike gene of SARS-CoV-2-mCherry was replaced with its counterpart from the Delta (B.1.617.2) or Omicron (BA.2) variants (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>).

In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of KA, a molecule with the potential to be employed in pre-clinical trials, against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Even though the effect of this compound against parasites such as <italic>Trypanosoma</italic> and <italic>Leishmania</italic> species (<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">Kian et al., 2018</xref>) is well described, only one study demonstrated through molecular docking calculations that KA could be an inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 by interacting with the Spike protein (<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">Santos W. et al., 2021</xref>). Our study describes and characterizes the antiviral activity of KA in cell culture against SARS-CoV-2 proteases. As a result of the low cytotoxicity, we found that the SI of KA against SARS-CoV-2 was 16.1, considerably higher than the SI against <italic>Leishmania infantum</italic> and <italic>Leishmania amazonensis</italic> (5.3 and 5.19, respectively) (<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">Kian et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, KA was previously described with low cytotoxicity in HEPG2 cells (CC<sub>50</sub> of 268.7 &#x003bc;g/mL), agreeing with our data in which the treatment resulted in low cytotoxicity to A549-AT cells (CC<sub>50</sub> of 212 &#x003bc;g/mL) and demonstrates the tolerance of this compound among different cell lines. In addition, other molecules isolated from natural sources were described with inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2, but with an SI between 2 and 10, which further emphasizes KA as a potent compound (<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">Herzog et al., 2024</xref>).</p><p>The analysis of the KA mechanism of action using different assays revealed that the compound had no virucidal effect and was unable to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 entry. In contrast, KA had a high impact in the SARS-CoV-2 post-entry stages. Interestingly, other extracts and compounds isolated from NPs have been described as affecting post-entry steps of SARS-CoV-2 replication by interacting with host cell responses or directly with viral proteins (<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">Herzog et al., 2024</xref>). In this study, different parameters were used to evaluate the mechanism of action of KA. The first parameter involved using a subgenomic replicon to monitor the synthesis of subgenomic RNA, while the second parameter involved infectious virus experiments to measure the synthesis of full-length genomic RNA. In all assays employed, KA decreased viral replication in the maturation and release steps, even in different VOCs. Previous data showed that isolated molecules were able to inhibit different SARS-CoV-2 VOCs, and together with our results, it further emphasizes the unique architecture that plays an essential role in fighting pathogens (<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">Santos et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">Chuong et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">Nurlela et al., 2022</xref>; <xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">Uppal et al., 2022</xref>; <xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">Grosche et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>KA was able to block the release of infectious virions of the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant, while it did not affect mCherry expression (which occurs from subgenomic RNA) in experiments performed using SARS-CoV-2-Wuhan-Delta-Spike. As such, we may hypothesize that in the native context, the S-protein of the Delta variant causes high susceptibility to KA. In contrast, in the context of the Wuhan strain containing the Delta S-protein, it results in resistance. Additionally, this can be further emphasized by the capacity of the S-protein of Delta to be more fusogenic and form syncytia in cell culture (<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">Saito et al., 2022</xref>), which could interfere with the fluorescence measurements in the assay by allowing mCherry signal from infected cells to spread across the cell layer, independently of infectious virion release. Since total fluorescence in each well was measured, rather than contagious virion release alone, the assay might underestimate KA&#x02019;s effect on viral release specifically, posing a limitation of the technique employed here. This limitation was reported before with the GFP reporter gene, where complemented GFP signals did not increase significantly over time among cells with syncytia formation, compared to nanoluciferase signals (<xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2022</xref>), showing that infection is occurring, but fluorescence signals can have a delay. Furthermore, the employment of viruses carrying different reporter genes could also help in assessing the viral replication and not be impacted by the syncytia formation (<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">Chiem et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Undoubtedly, KA can impair SARS-CoV-2 replication by significantly disrupting the assembly and/or release of SARS-CoV-2 virions. Interestingly, KA interaction with SARS-CoV-2 S protein was exploited in molecular docking calculations, demonstrating some stability with alkyl, pi-alkyl, H-bond, and Van der Waals interactions with negative binding energy (<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">Santos W. et al., 2021</xref>). In our study, the data support the hypothesis that the KA effect is related to other proteins besides S, since no entry inhibition was observed in the antiviral assays performed. Interestingly, an <italic>in silico</italic> assay with kaurene diterpenoids analogs against the M<sup>pro</sup>, PL<sup>pro</sup>, nucleocapsid (N), and membrane (M) proteins from SARS-CoV-2, revealed that kaurene derivatives evaluated were interacting with the proteases with low values of Gibbs free energy, which might result in reduced SARS-CoV-2 assembly (<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">Nurlela et al., 2022</xref>). Here, our data shows a higher score and lower binding energy in molecular docking with PL<sup>pro</sup>, an important polyprotein processing enzyme essential for the maturation and formation of the replicase-transcriptase complex (RTC) (<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">Shin et al., 2020</xref>). The PL<sup>pro</sup> cleaves proteins after the substrate LXGG sequence inside the substrate binding pocket, which is the region where KA was shown to interact, and therefore, can be a competitive inhibitor of the substrate. Notably, natural products were previously identified as reversible inhibitors of PL<sup>pro</sup>, among those, tanshinones from <italic>Salvia miltiorrhiza</italic>, chalcones and coumarins from <italic>Angelica keiskei</italic>, and polyphenols from <italic>Broussonetia papyrifera</italic> (<xref rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr">Wasilewicz et al., 2023</xref>). In another study, the inhibition of PL<sup>pro</sup> resulted in low levels of SARS-CoV-2 subgenomic replication and decreased the release of infectious virus into the supernatant (<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">De Oliveira et al., 2020</xref>). This agrees with our data, in which we demonstrate that KA treatment decreased the SARS-CoV-2 titer in supernatant without impacting viral genomic RNA levels in cytoplasm is consistent with the hypothesis that the effect of the compound on the virion assembly and release may be due to its interaction with PL<sup>pro</sup>, and since this protein is highly conserved among variants would explain the effect against them. Regardless of whether this is the case or not, our data obtained using natural Delta and Omicron variants clearly shows that the target of KA is not affected by the mutations accumulated in these SARS-CoV-2 variants.</p><p>Another aspect of the potential therapeutic potential of KA is its safety profile. The pharmacokinetics and oral bioavailability of KA in Wistar rats were previously evaluated (<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">Matos et al., 2018</xref>), showing that the compound possessed satisfactory stability and was widely distributed in fluids and organs intravenously administered at 50mg/kg. The ability of compounds to traverse cell membranes is consistent with our data, which suggests that it strongly affects the post-entry stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection. KA was described as an anti-inflammatory agent in animal models, recovering the nitric oxide pathway, inducing IL-1&#x003b2;, and upregulating NLRP12 in <italic>L. amazonensis</italic>-infected macrophages treated with KA. These, in association with our findings of KA effect on SARS-CoV-2 replication, are a combination that is particularly significant considering the pathogenesis of COVID-19, with the disease resulting in increased IL-6 and other inflammatory cytokines in the patients&#x02019; blood (<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">Miranda et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">Cao and Li, 2020</xref>). Therefore, administering this compound <italic>in vivo</italic> may contribute to enhanced recovery by viral clearance and anti-inflammatory mechanisms.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec22"><label>5</label><title>Conclusion</title><p>Kaurenoic acid (KA) is a novel inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 replication with an SI of 16.1. KA specifically impairs post-entry steps of SARS-CoV-2 replicative cycle by decreasing the RNA replication and viral release by possibly interacting with its proteases PL<sup>pro</sup> and M<sup>pro</sup> substrate pocket, disrupting virion assembly and release. Importantly, this effect remains consistent across different SARS-CoV-2 isolates, indicating the potential for future emergent variants.
