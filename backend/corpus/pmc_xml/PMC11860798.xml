The conserved HA stem domain, particularly the long &#x003b1;-helix (LAH) epitope, is a focus of universal vaccine research due to its cross-protective potential. Additionally, Fc-mediated functions such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) are recognized as important protective immune mechanisms.

Neutralization titers were detected in viruses of the same strain as the vaccine strain, but not in classical or pandemic strains (H5N1, H7N9).

Introduction</title><p>It has been reported that the protective immune responses against Influenza A viruses (IAVs) elicited by current influenza vaccines depend on vaccine-induced neutralizing antibodies that primarily target hemagglutinin (HA) [<xref rid="B1-vaccines-13-00140" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-vaccines-13-00140" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-vaccines-13-00140" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The HA proteins of IAVs are the main targets of neutralizing antibodies and undergo continuous evolution owing to selective pressure from antibody responses, which are directed primarily at the distal membrane receptor-binding subdomain of the molecule [<xref rid="B4-vaccines-13-00140" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Genetically, HA proteins of IAVs are classified into 18 subtypes and grouped into two groups [<xref rid="B5-vaccines-13-00140" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Antibodies induced by vaccination or infection primarily neutralize homologous strains within the same subtype. IAV HA proteins consist of two major domains: the head and stem. The HA head domain is the most mutable region in IAV proteins, which limits the cross-reactivity of vaccine-induced antibodies to other IAV subtypes or antigenic variants. Consequently, the current influenza vaccines are effective only against a narrow range of IAV strains with HA epitopes that are antigenically similar to the vaccine strain. This limitation has reduced their effectiveness against other IAV subtypes, including in future pandemics. HA proteins of IAVs contain multiple classes of antibody epitopes, some of which are relatively conserved among strains [<xref rid="B1-vaccines-13-00140" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B6-vaccines-13-00140" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-vaccines-13-00140" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-vaccines-13-00140" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-vaccines-13-00140" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-vaccines-13-00140" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-vaccines-13-00140" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In contrast, conformational epitopes in the HA stem domain are conserved across different subtypes and are the primary targets of several universal influenza vaccines under clinical trials [<xref rid="B1-vaccines-13-00140" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B6-vaccines-13-00140" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-vaccines-13-00140" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B12-vaccines-13-00140" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. One notable epitope in the long &#x003b1;-helix region of the HA stem domain is known as the long &#x003b1;-helix (LAH) epitope, which is linear and occluded in the HA trimer structure, distinguishing it from the conformational stem epitope exposed in the native trimer structure. Antibody responses against the LAH epitope are known to increase at local sites following viral infection as the LAH epitope becomes exposed in the HA form after membrane fusion [<xref rid="B13-vaccines-13-00140" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-vaccines-13-00140" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-vaccines-13-00140" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>Recently, IgG Fc-mediated functions of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) have garnered attention as protective immune responses against IAV infection [<xref rid="B16-vaccines-13-00140" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-vaccines-13-00140" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-vaccines-13-00140" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The effectiveness of ADCC and ADCP depends on the affinity of IgG for both the antigen epitope and the activated Fc&#x003b3; receptor (Fc&#x003b3;R). In humans, IgG1 has the highest affinity for Fc&#x003b3;R binding, followed by IgG3, IgG2, and IgG4, in that order [<xref rid="B19-vaccines-13-00140" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Therefore, the balance between the IgG subclasses is an important factor in the effectiveness of universal influenza vaccines. Indeed, multiple lines of evidence have correlated IgG subclass profiles with the cross-protective abilities of influenza vaccines [<xref rid="B7-vaccines-13-00140" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B20-vaccines-13-00140" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-vaccines-13-00140" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-vaccines-13-00140" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-vaccines-13-00140" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Antibodies targeting the head&#x02013;interface epitope bind to multiple HA subtypes across both group 1 (e.g., H1 and H5) and group 2 (e.g., H3 and H7) and engage in Fc-mediated effector functions through non-neutralizing IgG to confer multivariant protection. Similarly, cross-protective IgG antibodies against the LAH epitope are non-neutralizing and, similar to antibodies against the HA stem domain, provide protection via IgG Fc-mediated effector function [<xref rid="B10-vaccines-13-00140" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-vaccines-13-00140" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B13-vaccines-13-00140" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Therefore, this study aimed to comprehensively evaluate the capacity of antibody-mediated cross-reactive protective responses following vaccination with the current seasonal influenza vaccines. First, IgG antibody titers against the HA head, stem, and LAH regions of the vaccine strains induced by vaccination were measured. Next, the antibody function was assessed using neutralization titers and ADCC/ADCP activity as parameters. The results showed that the IgG antibodies against the HA head and stem regions of the vaccine strains were significantly elevated after vaccination. In contrast, antibodies against the LAH region, a highly conserved epitope, showed no correlation with the neutralization breath scores. However, the ADCC and ADCP breath scores were significantly correlated with IgG1 levels against the HA stem region, suggesting that the HA stem-targeted antibodies induced by the current vaccine may exhibit cross-reactivity. Despite these results, it is generally accepted that the antibodies elicited by current seasonal influenza vaccines are not expected to provide cross-protective effects [<xref rid="B24-vaccines-13-00140" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Therefore, although cross-reactive antibodies may be induced, their quantities may be insufficient to achieve a protective effect.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-vaccines-13-00140"><title>2.

The rHA proteins used in the ELISA assays were produced in-house. Specifically, synthetic cDNA for each antigen was obtained through artificial gene synthesis and inserted into a plasmid under the control of a CMV promoter. This plasmid was subsequently transfected into Expi293 cells, which were cultured for five days post-transfection. After the culture period, the supernatants were collected, and the target antigen proteins were purified using His tag affinity chromatography. Peptides rather than full-length proteins were used to specifically evaluate the LAH region, as the latter would also include non-specific regions, potentially confounding the results. In brief, 96-well plates were prepared by coating them with 50 &#x000b5;L of rHA protein solution (0.5 &#x003bc;g/mL) and LAH peptide solution (0.5 &#x003bc;g/mL). Afterward, the plates were washed four times with 0.05% Tween20 in sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS-T), blocked using ChonBlock (Chondrex, Woodinville, WA, USA) at room temperature for 2 h, and incubated with diluted serum samples for another 2 h at room temperature. Next, the plates were washed and incubated for 1 h with various secondary anti-human IgG antibodies, including mouse anti-Human IgG Fc-BIOT (SouthernBiotech, USA), mouse anti-Human IgG1 Fc secondary antibody-HRP (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), mouse Anti-Human IgG2 Fc-BIOT (SouthernBiotech, Birmingham, AL, USA), mouse Anti-Human IgG3 Hinge-BIOT (SouthernBiotech, Birmingham, AL, USA), or mouse Anti-Human IgG4 Fc-BIOT (SouthernBiotech, Birmingham, AL, USA).

Therefore, we investigated the regions of the HA protein that are targeted by antibodies induced by the current seasonal influenza vaccine and characterized the antibodies that recognize these regions.</p><p>Initially, total IgG antibody titers against the HA head, stem, and LAH regions of the vaccine strains were measured using serum samples collected at two time points (pre-vaccination and 1 month post-vaccination) from 50 individuals vaccinated with the November 2022 seasonal influenza vaccine.

Anti-H1 LAH-specific and anti-H3 LAH-specific total IgG levels were measured using peptides specific to the H1 and H3 LAH epitopes, respectively. In contrast to the anti-HA stem antibody, anti-H1 LAH-specific total IgG increased in only 6 of 50 individuals (12%), and anti-H3 LAH-specific total IgG increased in only 7 of 50 individuals (14%) post-vaccination (<xref rid="vaccines-13-00140-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A).</p><p>Furthermore, the affinity between IgG and Fc&#x003b3;R plays an important role in protection against IAV infection in vivo and depends mainly on the Fc region.

Neutralizing antibody titers were assessed for each of the 10 viral strains. To quantify the serum neutralizing titers, scores were assigned based on the neutralizing antibody titer of each virus strain (score 1 for titers between 21 and 80, score 2 for titers between 81 and 640, score 3 for titers between 641 and 1280, and score 4 for titers &#x0003e; 1280) (<xref rid="app1-vaccines-13-00140" ref-type="app">Supplemental Figure S1</xref>). The neutralizing titers against viruses of the same strain as the H1 and H3 vaccine strains were divided into two categories: score 1 for 56% and 62%, respectively, and score 2 for 44% and 38%, respectively, for all 50 individuals. For A/Guangdong-Maonan SWL1536/2019 (H1N1), which is similar in age to the vaccine strain, 26% of the individuals had a score of 1, 16% had a score of 2, and 2% had a score of 3.

Cross-Reactive ADCC Activity Induced by Current Seasonal Influenza Vaccination in Serum</title><p>To investigate the cross-protective effects of HA-specific antibodies mediated by the Fc region, which is considered an important function beyond the neutralizing activity of cross-reactive antibodies, ADCC activity was measured using 10 viral strains, similar to those used for the measurement of neutralizing antibody titers.

For A/Vietnam/1194/2004 (H5N1), ADCP activity was observed in 36 of 50 individuals, with 34% scoring 1 and 32% scoring 2. A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9) was active in 13 of 50 individuals, but all showed low activity, scoring only 1 (<xref rid="app1-vaccines-13-00140" ref-type="app">Supplemental Figure S3</xref>). These results indicate that the ADCP activity of cross-reactive IgG antibodies induced by vaccination differed between viral strains, regardless of the year of virus isolation. To quantify cross-reactive ADCP activity based on these data, H1N1 and H5N1 viruses were classified as group 1 and H3N2 and H7N9 as group 2, following the same classification used for neutralizing activity measurements. Cross-reactive ADCP activity scores were calculated as the ADCP group 1 breadth score, ADCP group 2 breadth score, and ADCP group 1 + 2 breadth score, representing the sum of group 1 and group 2 points (<xref rid="app1-vaccines-13-00140" ref-type="app">Supplemental Figure S3</xref>). To verify the cross-reactivity of the ADCP activity of antibodies induced by vaccination, we first divided the viruses into groups 1 and 2 and calculated the ADCP activity scores for each group (ADCP group 1 breadth score, ADCP group 2 breadth score). Group 1 and group 2 points were then summed to obtain an overall ADCP activity score (ADCP group 1 + 2 breadth score).</p><p>Next, we examined the correlation between cross-reactive ADCP activity and serum levels of anti-H1 HA-specific, anti-H3 HA-specific, and anti-H1 HA stem-specific IgG. There was a significant correlation between the ADCP group 1 breadth score and anti-H1 HA head-specific total IgG and IgG1 against the vaccine strain (r = 0.4780, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.0004; r = 0.5003, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.0002, respectively), but no significant correlation was observed between the ADCP group 1 breadth score and anti-H1 HA head-specific total IgG and IgG1 (r = 0.0009517, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.99480) (<xref rid="vaccines-13-00140-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>A).

Relationship Between Cross-Reactive Neutralization Antibody, ADCC, and ADCP Activity in Serum</title><p>Finally, to examine the relationship between various cross-reactive responses to HA-specific IgG induced by the current vaccine, we analyzed the correlation between cross-reactive neutralization, ADCC, and ADCP activities. Specifically, we first analyzed the correlations between the neutralization group 1 breadth score and the ADCC group 1 breadth score, the neutralization group 2 breadth score and the ADCC group 2 breadth score, and the combined neutralization group 1 + 2 breadth score and the ADCC group 1 + 2 breadth score (r = 0.0884, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.5418; r = &#x02212;0.0785, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.5880; r = 0.0988, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.4947, respectively) (<xref rid="vaccines-13-00140-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>A).

Discussion</title><p>IAV HA proteins are the primary targets of neutralizing antibodies. However, HA genes undergo continuous evolution due to the selective pressure exerted by antibody responses, which are directed primarily toward the distal membrane receptor-binding subdomain of the molecule [<xref rid="B4-vaccines-13-00140" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Antibodies induced by vaccination or infection can neutralize homologous strains within a specific subtype but have limited cross-reactivity with other IAV subtypes or antigenic variants. As a result, current influenza vaccines are effective only against a narrow range of IAV strains with HA epitopes that are antigenically similar to the vaccine strain and may be ineffective against other IAV subtypes, including potential future pandemic strains. Additionally, it is generally accepted that antibodies induced by current seasonal influenza vaccinations are not expected to provide cross-protection [<xref rid="B31-vaccines-13-00140" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In fact, Grohskopf et al. reported that the vaccine effectiveness during the 2017&#x02013;2018 influenza season was 62% against influenza A[H1N1] pdm09 virus, 22% against influenza A[H3N2] virus, and 50% against influenza B virus [<xref rid="B32-vaccines-13-00140" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. This low effectiveness has generally been attributed to an antigenic mismatch between the vaccine strain and circulating viruses. To overcome this limitation, it is necessary to develop a universal vaccine that can protect against both seasonal and potentially pandemic IAV strains [<xref rid="B33-vaccines-13-00140" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p><p>In this study, we used sera from 50 individuals vaccinated against influenza strains in November 2022 to measure antibody titers against the HA head of vaccine strains H1 and H3, the primary targets of current vaccines, and the HA conformational stem, which is the primary target of several universal influenza vaccines under clinical evaluation. We also measured antibody titers against the LAH epitope, which induces non-neutralizing but cross-protective IgG antibodies that are distinct from the HA-conforming stem. The results showed that antibody titers against HA of the vaccine strains increased in all individuals after vaccination. Antibody titers against the HA stem also increased in 72% of individuals for total IgG and in 90% of individuals for IgG1 after vaccination. We subsequently examined the correlation between antibody titers against the vaccine strain HA and age or BMI, revealing no significant correlation with either parameter (<xref rid="app1-vaccines-13-00140" ref-type="app">Supplemental Figure S4</xref>).</p><p>In a study by Yassine et al., which used an HA stem probe similar to ours to evaluate pre-vaccination sera in influenza, Ebola, and SARS DNA vaccine trials, approximately 60% of the individuals were reported to react to the HA stem [<xref rid="B28-vaccines-13-00140" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In contrast, in our cohort, antibody titers against the LAH epitope showed little change before and after vaccination, which is consistent with the findings of Wang et al. [<xref rid="B13-vaccines-13-00140" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. This finding suggests that the current seasonal influenza vaccine alone is unlikely to induce antibodies against the LAH epitopes.</p><p>Regarding the neutralizing activity, no correlation was observed between the neutralization breath score and antibody titers against H1 or H3 head-specific IgG or H1 HA stem-specific regions. These findings are consistent with previous reports, indicating that neutralizing antibodies are effective only against IAV strains with HA epitopes that are antigenically homologous to the vaccine strain [<xref rid="B31-vaccines-13-00140" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. However, the neutralizing titers induced by the vaccination were divided into two distinct groups. This variability may be influenced by factors such as individual differences in the likelihood of producing neutralizing antibodies post-vaccination, the rate of antibody maturation, or age. However, further studies are needed to clarify these effects. The observation that the neutralizing titers against the previous year&#x02019;s virus strains were higher than those against the vaccination strains suggests that some individuals may have been sensitized to the previous season&#x02019;s influenza virus before vaccination.</p><p>In contrast, ADCC and ADCP breath scores showed high correlations in group 1, group 2, and group 1 + 2, indicating that the induction of antibodies with Fc-mediated effector functions is effective in cross-protection. The strong correlation between H1 HA stem-specific antibody titers and ADCC and ADCP group 1 breath scores reflects the characteristics of HA stem antibodies. Notably, in a study by Leon et al., HA stem-targeting antibodies are particularly effective at inducing Fc receptor-mediated effector functions such as ADCC and ADCP, suggesting a potential role in providing cross-protection against diverse influenza strains [<xref rid="B34-vaccines-13-00140" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. This indicates that Fc-mediated cross-reactive functions can be achieved, to some extent, even with the current influenza vaccine. However, it should be noted that the ADCC and ADCP activities in this study were evaluated in vitro. Further research is required to determine the levels of activity necessary to confer protective effects in vivo. For example, in non-human primate models (NHPs), the trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) did not induce ADCC activity or CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses, although binding antibodies were detected. In contrast, natural H1N1 infection has been reported to induce strong ADCC and CD8+ T cell responses against multiple H1 viral strains [<xref rid="B35-vaccines-13-00140" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="B36-vaccines-13-00140" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. This suggests that it may be challenging to elicit cross-reactive ADCC activity in humans by vaccination with the current vaccine alone. Nevertheless, it may be possible to develop more precise criteria for ADCC and ADCP activities that can predict in vivo efficacy by monitoring the occurrence of influenza infections in individuals vaccinated with current vaccines.</p><p>Recently, efforts have been made to develop new vaccines aimed at inducing ADCC or ADCP activity through HA-specific antibody responses that cross-react with multiple groups of IAVs. Many vaccines have been specifically designed to induce antibodies against conformational epitopes of the HA stem domain. For example, a vaccine expressing a stabilized H1 HA stem antigen without an immunodominant head domain (H1ssF vaccine) has been developed using ferritin nanoparticles as a vector. Phase I clinical trials of this vaccine have been conducted in healthy adults aged 18 to 70 years [<xref rid="B37-vaccines-13-00140" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="B38-vaccines-13-00140" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The results showed that H1ssF vaccination induced strong plasmablast responses and sustained the induction of H1 HA stem-specific memory B cells one week post-vaccination, with a 16-fold increase in response by 2 weeks, regardless of age. Furthermore, analysis of antigen-specific antibodies induced by the vaccine revealed that they targeted two conserved epitopes on the H1 HA stem, suggesting that the vaccine-induced antibodies are capable of broadly neutralizing group 1 subtype viral strains, including strains with pandemic potential [<xref rid="B37-vaccines-13-00140" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Additionally, cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies against the conserved HA stem of group 1 influenza viruses persisted and were detectable for more than a year after vaccination. ADCC activity against the H1 and H5 strains was also measured in participants&#x02019; post-vaccination sera and increased by an average of 7.3-fold at two weeks post-vaccination and remained 7.5-fold above baseline at week 18 [<xref rid="B38-vaccines-13-00140" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].</p><p>Although this study provides valuable insights into the immune responses induced by the current seasonal influenza vaccine, it has several limitations. First, the participant sample size was relatively small, which may limit the generalizability of the findings. Second, evaluations of ADCC and ADCP activities were conducted in vitro, and the in vivo relevance of these activities remains uncertain. Third, the study focused on antibody responses, without assessing other aspects of immunity, such as T-cell responses, which also play a crucial role in protection against influenza. Fourth, this study evaluated responses against influenza A viruses, while cross-reactivity with influenza B viruses was not assessed. Finally, we did not conduct a longitudinal follow-up to evaluate the durability of the observed antibody responses. Future research should address these limitations by incorporating larger cohorts, in vivo models, and comprehensive analyses of both humoral and cellular immune responses, as well as potential cross-reactivity with influenza B viruses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec5-vaccines-13-00140"><title>5.
