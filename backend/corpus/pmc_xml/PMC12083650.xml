This is problematic as ovarian cancer is one of the deadliest gynecologic cancers with platinum resistance contributing to poor survival. However, the mechanism by which ovarian cancer cell metabolism contributes to platinum resistance is not well understood. Herein, metabolic signatures were determined in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer cell lines compared to the more platinum-sensitive parental lines. Chemoresistant ovarian cancer cells showed increased oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) compared to chemosensitive cells. This was associated with elevated levels of glutaminolysis and tricarboxylic acid (TCA)-related metabolites supporting their dependence on OXPHOS. Key enzymes involved in glutaminolysis, specifically, glutamic-pyruvic transaminase 2 <italic toggle="yes">(GPT2),</italic> were upregulated in chemoresistant compared to chemosensitive cells. Interestingly, high <italic toggle="yes">GPT2</italic> gene expression is associated with worse prognosis in ovarian cancer patients, adding translational relevance to the pre-clinical findings. GPT2 knockout in chemoresistant cells restored the metabolic phenotype to that of the sensitive cells and reversed drug resistance. These data suggest that GPT2 is a critical link between glutaminolysis, the TCA cycle, and OXPHOS and is a potential target to attenuate the increased metabolic activity associated with a chemoresistant phenotype.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>ovarian cancer</kwd><kwd>metabolism</kwd><kwd>GPT2</kwd><kwd>glutamine</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>

We detected no significant changes in arginine, aspartic acid, histidine, lysine, glutamic acid, alanine, threonine, asparagine (Supplementary Fig. 1). However, we observed significantly lower levels of serine, methionine, isoleucine, valine, phenylalanine and tyrosine in cisplatin-resistant cells compared to their parental cells (Supplementary Fig. 1).

Glutamine is a non-essential amino acid that supports anaplerosis<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>. The latter is a metabolic process that allows the replenishment of glutamine-derived intermediates to sustain the rapid proliferation of cancer cells and to adapt to metabolic demands<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>. One study demonstrated that highly invasive ovarian cancer cells are dependent on glutamine for proliferation and tumor growth<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. In their invasive model, glutamine was found to play a key role in supporting mitochondrial function. Specifically, it facilitates an increase in glutathione production&#x02013;reducing reactive oxygen species. Thereby protecting the mitochondrial integrity and promoting the survival and proliferation of ovarian cancer cells<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. Furthermore, a recent study focused on cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer cells demonstrated that resistant cells rely on glutamine metabolism<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>, highlighting the metabolic adaptations that underlie resistance in ovarian cancer by exploiting glutamine utilization for survival. However, the exact players of this metabolic adaptation for cisplatin-resistance have not been fully characterized.</p><p id="P15">Herein, we characterized the metabolic profile of cisplatin-resistant high grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) cell lines by assessing glycolysis and OXPHOS activity. Our results demonstrated that the cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer cells (OVCAR3-CP5 and OVCAR8-CP5) predominantly utilized OXPHOS, suggesting an increase in mitochondrial activity. These observations align with our previous findings as we established that chemoresistant ovarian cancer cells depend on OXPHOS and exhibit enhanced mitochondrial function<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. Interestingly, this reliance on OXPHOS may imply enhanced TCA cycle activity. For instance, the TCA cycle is central for producing metabolites involved in nucleotide biosynthesis (e.g., oxaloacetate) and the electron carriers NADH and FADH<sub>2</sub><sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> which are necessary for redox reactions to occur during OXPHOS for ATP production. Recently, we demonstrated that the inhibition of the TCA cycle utilizing the inhibitor CP1&#x02013;613, which targets TCA cycle enzymes pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDHA1) and 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase (OGDH), significantly decreased the growth of xenografts derived from resistant ovarian cancer cells<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. This finding reveals the critical role of TCA cycle activity in the survival of chemoresistant ovarian cancer. In our current study, we observed that cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer cells show enhanced glutaminolysis-related metabolites, which were correlated with increased levels of TCA cycle intermediates. Notably, we also observed significantly increased lactate in the cisplatin-resistant cells compared to the cisplatin-sensitive counterparts. The increase in lactate levels suggests metabolic reprogramming as described by the Warburg effect<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> Altogether, these results strongly indicate that HGSOC platinum-resistant cells are capable of rewiring their metabolism towards glutaminolysis to enhance mitochondrial activity.</p><p id="P16">To identify a potential target that mediates mitochondrial activity, we evaluated genes involved in glutaminolysis and the TCA cycle. Glutaminolysis begins with the conversion of intracellular glutamine into glutamate, catalyzed by the enzyme glutaminase (GLS)<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>. Notably, a previous study demonstrated that platinum-resistant ovarian cancer cells exhibit high levels of GLS expression<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. This study emphasizes the role of glutaminolysis in platinum resistance and establishes that this is driven by high GLS expression<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. In our study, we observed that GLS is overexpressed in the OVCAR8CP5 cell line while remaining comparatively low in the OVCAR3CP5 cell line. Nonetheless, our targeted metabolomics revealed that both cell lines exhibit significantly increased glutamate levels, thereby suggesting the active enzymatic function of GLS. Glutamate is a critical metabolite in fueling the TCA cycle, as it can be converted into &#x003b1;-ketoglutarate (or 2-oxoglutarate) through the activity of glutamate dehydrogenase 1 (GLUD1) or the mitochondrial aminotransferases such as glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase 2 (GOT2) and glutamic-pyruvic transaminase 2 (GPT2)<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup></p><p id="P17">GPT2 is an important regulator of glutaminolysis. GPT2 is a mitochondrial enzyme that catalyzes the reversible transamination of glutamate and pyruvate, resulting in the production of &#x003b1;-ketoglutarate and alanine<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>. This enzyme aids in anaplerosis, maintaining the functionality of the TCA cycle activity in cancer cells<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>. Moreover, GPT2 has been implicated in the progression and tumorigenesis of breast cancer<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> colorectal cancer<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup>, and glioblastoma<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup>. In these studies, GPT2 mediated a metabolic shift that enhances the production of &#x003b1;-ketoglutarate and facilitates ATP production for cell survival and growth<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>. To our knowledge, GPT2 has not been studied in the context of ovarian cancer. Our comprehensive gene expression analysis revealed a significant upregulation of <italic toggle="yes">GPT2</italic> in both OVCAR8 and OVCAR3 platinum-resistant cell lines. This finding was further corroborated by the observed elevated GPT2 protein levels in these cell lines. Herein, we identified GPT2 as the potential regulator of glutaminolysis, which supports the TCA cycle and OXPHOS for ATP production, ultimately leading to platinum resistance.</p><p id="P18">In order to investigate the role of GPT2 in the context of cisplatin resistance, we conducted knockout studies. The complete knockout of <italic toggle="yes">GPT2</italic> revealed its potential involvement in tumorigenesis and platinum-resistance mechanism. Our experiments using soft agar demonstrated a significant reduction in the size of colonies formed by the GPT2 knockout clones, both in conditions where the clones were treated with cisplatin and untreated. This finding showed that GPT2 knock-out prevents the ability of these cells to proliferate and form colonies and instead, increased sensitization to cisplatin treatment. Subsequently, GPT2 knockout disrupts glutaminolysis and TCA cycle activity as demonstrated by low OXPHOS activity and decreased TCA cycle intermediates. The lower baseline OXPHOS correlates with a metabolic shift, which more closely resembles cisplatin-sensitive ovarian cancer cells. This suggests that GPT2 knockout may reverse the cisplatin resistance phenotype. Furthermore, the decreased levels of TCA cycle metabolites reveal metabolic reprogramming that could enhance sensitivity to cisplatin-based chemotherapy as observed in the soft agar studies. Collectively, these results demonstrated that knocking out GPT2 leads to significant metabolic rewiring in cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer cells, ultimately favoring resensitization to cisplatin treatment.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="P19">Altogether, our results show that platinum-resistant high-grade serous ovarian cancer cell lines depend on OXPHOS. Our platinum-resistant models showed elevated glutaminolysis and TCA cycle-related metabolites, which are associated with the upregulation of the glutaminolysis-related enzyme GPT2.

TCA standards were reconstituted in (water and acetonitrile, 20:80) to prepare 10 mg/ml stock solutions. Linear standards curve at the range of 5&#x02013;1000 ng/ml of each analyte (citric acid, aconitase, iso-citric acid, <italic toggle="yes">&#x003b1;</italic>-ketoglutaric acid, itaconate, &#x003b1;-ketoglutarate, succinic acid, fumarate, and malic acid) was produced from stock solutions in the relevant matrix. Each standard (100 <italic toggle="yes">&#x003bc;</italic>l) was mixed to obtain a 7-point standard calibration curve within a range of 5&#x02013;1000 ng/ml. Each internal standard (10 <italic toggle="yes">&#x003bc;</italic>g/ml) (isotope-labelled TCA mixtures standards mix Sets 1 and 2 A) was spiked into all samples as an internal standard (final concentration) to allow quantification based on the ratio of the internal standard to each intermediate peak. Approximately, 3 million cells were rapidly rinsed by 2 mL of 37&#x000b0;C deionized water to the cell surface. Cells were collected in 2-ml tubes after washing, followed by adding 500 &#x003bc;L of extraction solution (acetonitrile and water [80:20]) and stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C for further processing. 10 &#x003bc;L of each isotope-labeled TCA mixtures standards mix (Sets 1 and 2 A) was added as an internal standard followed by vortex to mix. Three cycles of extraction were carried out by vertexing for 1 min followed by sonicating for 1 min (each). After sonication, samples were kept at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C for protein precipitation, followed by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 20 min at 4&#x000b0;C. Supernatants were loaded into pre-conditioned Phenomenex Strata XL-100 60 mg/3 ml cartridges (Torrance, CA) and passed through it using positive pressure manifold (Agilent Technologies). Flow through was collected subsequently and 100 &#x003bc;L of filtrate was mixed with 100 &#x003bc;L of water for the LC-MS/MS system. The TCA cycle and its intermediate metabolites were identified and quantified based on retention time and m/z match to injections of authentic standards, retention time and accuracy bases and were quantified using internal standard area for the respective metabolites. Phenomenex Luna-NH2, 2.0 &#x000d7; 150 mm, 3 &#x003bc;m column was used to achieve an optimal separation of all TCA intermediates. The flow rate of 0.25 ml/min was used with a mobile phase A (10 mM NH<sub>4</sub>OAc buffer at pH 9.8) and mobile phase B (acetonitrile). Column temperature was optimized at 25&#x000b0;C for the best chromatographic separation. The metabolites were eluted from the column at a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min using a gradient system (mobile phase B): 80% (0.01&#x02013;0.5 min), 80&#x02192;20% (0.5&#x02013;18.0 min), 20% (18.0&#x02013;19.5 min), 20 &#x02192; 80% (19.5&#x02013;22 min), and re-equilibration (22&#x02013;25 min). TCA cycle intermediates were monitored using negative MRM (multi reaction monitoring) polarity. Identification was achieved based on retention time and MS/MS ion conformation. Seven calibration standards ranging from 5 to 1000 ng/ml were subjected to the full extraction procedure 3 times before analysis. The mean correlation coefficients of each metabolite were linear r2 &#x0003e; 99 and were obtained (<italic toggle="yes">n=</italic> 3) from 5 to 1000 ng/ml. The calibration curve, prepared in a control matrix, was constructed using peak area ratios of the calibration samples by applying a one/concentration weighting (1/x) linear regression model.
