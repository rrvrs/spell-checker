These soil-dwelling organisms are crucial for lignocellulosic biomass degradation, which has both ecological and industrial significance. While previous studies have demonstrated polysaccharide deconstruction abilities in a few myxobacterial species, we aim to elucidate the distribution of their Carbohydrate Active Enzymes (CAZymes) domains per organism, with a focus on proteins involved in the catabolism of critical polysaccharides such as cellulose, lignin, xylan, starch, pectin, fructan, chitin, and dextran, across 61 high-quality sequenced myxobacterial genomes. Our findings reveal that 3.5% of the total genes at the median level have domains related to CAZyme functions across different myxobacterial families. Notably, family Archangiaceae (4.4%) and Myxococcaceae (3.7%) members exhibit the most significant genomic diversity and potential for degrading multiple substrates within lignocellulosic biomass. These plentiful CAZymes probably enable these majorly soil-harboring myxobacteria to breakdown various carbohydrate substrates into simpler biological molecules, which not only allow these organisms to sustain in poor-nutrient environments but also enable them to be critical players in carbon cycling and organic matter decomposition. Overall, it can be postulated that myxobacteria have an unexplored genomic potential that may play an integral role in the degradation of recalcitrant plant biomass, potentially influencing soil health and composition. This study further suggests the critical ecological importance of these CAZymes in sustaining the balance of terrestrial ecosystems and diverse industrial applications.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>myxobacteria</kwd><kwd>comparative genomics</kwd><kwd>carbohydrate active enzymes (CAZyme)</kwd><kwd>polysaccharide degradation</kwd><kwd>soil-dwelling bacteria</kwd><kwd>lignocellulosic biomass</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>The author(s) declare that financial support was received for the research and/or publication of this article.

As per recent studies, the most abundant biologically renewable resource on earth is the lignocellulosic biomass (LCB; <xref rid="ref74" ref-type="bibr">Yousuf et al., 2020</xref>), which is primarily composed of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin (<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">Cortes-Tolalpa et al., 2017</xref>). LCB captures attention as it can serve as an alternative to fossil fuels and pave the way to become the source of biofuels, to meet the ever-increasing demand for energy (<xref rid="ref83" ref-type="bibr">Zoghlami and Pa&#x000eb;s, 2019</xref>; <xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">Inyang et al., 2022</xref>). Other important polysaccharides are xylan, a component of hemicellulose (<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">Bajpai, 2009</xref>); chitin, which is abundant in the shells of arthropods like crabs, shrimps, and insects, and produced by bacteria and fungi (<xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">Mohammed et al., 2021</xref>); pectin, mostly found in plant cell walls and peels of citrus fruits (<xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">Mudgil, 2017</xref>); fructans, which are reserve carbohydrates (<xref rid="ref62" ref-type="bibr">Stick and Williams, 2009</xref>) and dextrans, which are microbial water-soluble exopolysaccharides (<xref rid="ref61" ref-type="bibr">Silva et al., 2017</xref>). The utilization of LCB or other polysaccharides requires physiochemical processing and degradation (<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">Ezeilo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">Devi et al., 2022</xref>) by diverse Carbohydrate-Active enZymes (CAZymes; <xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">Ezeilo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="ref75" ref-type="bibr">Zerva et al., 2021</xref>). Based on their mechanisms of action, these CAZymes can be classified into three categories, i.e., (1) enzymes involved in their assembly or glycosyltransferases (GT), and (2) enzymes involved in their breakdown&#x02014;glycoside hydrolases (GH), polysaccharide lyases (PL), carbohydrate esterases (CE), and (3) accessory functions that contain auxiliary activities (AAs) and carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs). GHs carry out the hydrolysis of the glycosidic linkage, GTs help in the making of glycosidic bonds, PLs cause the breakdown of glycosidic bonds in a non-hydrolytic manner, CEs hydrolyses the carbohydrate esters, AAs are redox enzymes that play a role in association with other CAZymes, and CBMs help in adhesion to the carbohydrate molecule upon which the enzymes act (<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">Lombard et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, the understanding of enzymatic reactions behind these processes can help in improving strategies to cope with the recalcitrant nature of some polysaccharides toward degradation (<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">Ezeilo et al., 2017</xref>), further helping in utilizing their potential more efficiently.</p><p>Using a diversity of enzymes specific to each carbohydrate substrate, microorganisms degrade miscellaneous carbohydrates in their ecological niches such as the soil (<xref rid="ref73" ref-type="bibr">Yeager et al., 2017</xref>), oceans (<xref rid="ref60" ref-type="bibr">Sichert and Cordero, 2021</xref>), or the human gut (<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">Flint et al., 2012</xref>) and maintain equilibrium in those ecosystems. Based on the abundance of these enzymes, LCB decomposition potential has been reported for bacteria, fungi, as well as protozoa (<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">Harindintwali et al., 2022</xref>). Recent metagenomic studies of rhizosphere microorganisms have shown a plenitude of carbohydrate-active enzymes in Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Verrucomicrobia, Gemmatimonadetes and Firmicutes (<xref rid="ref64" ref-type="bibr">Tashkandi and Baz, 2023</xref>). Bacteroidetes members have also been reported to encode a lot of carbohydrate-degrading genes, playing a critical role in carbohydrate digestion in our gut (<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">Flint et al., 2012</xref>). The cellulose-degrading potential of <italic>Pseudomonas</italic>, <italic>Streptococcus,</italic> and <italic>Bacillus</italic> species has been widely utilized with several applications in the paper, food, and biofuel industries (<xref rid="ref76" ref-type="bibr">Zhang and Dong, 2022</xref>). However, myxobacteria, which are a notable group of large-genome size non-pathogenic soil-dwelling social microbes, have not been investigated extensively.</p><p>Myxobacteria belong to the order Myxococcales within the phylum Proteobacteria, however, recently, the International Committee on Systematics of Prokaryotes (ICSP) classified them under a new phylum, Myxococcota (<xref rid="ref47" ref-type="bibr">Oren and Garrity, 2021</xref>; <xref rid="ref49" ref-type="bibr">Panda et al., 2022</xref>). They are a fascinating group of prokaryotes depicting complex social behavior in the form of fruiting body formation, social motility or swarming, biofilm formation, and predation (<xref rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr">Mu&#x000f1;oz-Dorado et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="ref84" ref-type="bibr">Zusman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">Kaiser et al., 2010</xref>). Most of these organisms are aerobic with gigantic genomes ranging from 9 to 16 Mbps, with a few exceptions (<xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">Mohr, 2018</xref>). Myxobacteria are typically soil bacteria that can thrive in almost any kind of environment, be it temperate regions, tropical rain forests, arctic tundra, deserts, or marine/saline environments. They are known as &#x02018;wolf-pack&#x02019; predators and can prey upon bacteria (both, Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria) and fungi through toxic secretions into the extracellular environment (<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">Marshall and Whitworth, 2019</xref>). An industrially and clinically pertinent characteristic of myxobacteria is that they have a remarkable potential to produce a plethora of secondary metabolites showing a broad spectrum of biological activities such as anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, immunosuppressive effects, and insecticidal, anti-malarial, and herbicidal activities (<xref rid="ref53" ref-type="bibr">Reichenbach, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">de Frias et al., 2018</xref>). Overall, these diverse aspects make myxobacteria quite extraordinary and distinct from other bacteria and, therefore, intriguing to study.</p><p>Order Myxococcales have been classified into three broad suborders, nine families, 20 genera, and&#x0202f;&#x0003e;&#x0202f;200 species (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>; <xref rid="SM2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S1</xref>; <xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">Mohr, 2018</xref>). Most of the members are soil microbes, with a few being marine; however, only some organisms are well studied for their carbohydrate degradation activities, mainly in the context of predation, where these enzymes help in the breakdown of the cell wall of prey bacteria (<xref rid="ref81" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">Li Y. et al., 2022</xref>; <xref rid="ref77" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2023</xref>). <italic>Sorangium cellulosum</italic> of the suborder Sorangiineae decomposes cellulose and crystalline cellulose.

This phylogeny depicts two major clades differentiating into suborder Cystobacterineae members and Nannocystineae and Sorangiineae members together, further separated into their subclades. All families but Archangiaceae show a monophyletic distribution, thereby making a single clade for all members at the genus and species level.

We also mapped the organism-wise CAZyme CDS distribution to the phylogeny alongside the total CDSs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>) and we saw that some species have a higher CAZyme density. Our analysis reported that myxobacteria utilize almost 2&#x02013;5% of the total CDSs in carbohydrate-degrading enzyme functions. This study further revealed that members of the suborder Cystobacterineae in the dataset we curated have a slightly higher proportion of CAZyme domains in their genomes as compared to suborder Sorangiineae with median values of 3.66 and 3.11%, respectively (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>), with the lowest, 2.16%, in suborder Nannocystineae.

However, as we have more representation from Cystobacterineae members in the present dataset, future studies should include more members from other suborders to confirm this correlation.

Based on this, we hypothesize that CAZyme density is not dependent on the number of CDSs the organism has. To further confirm this, we checked the correlation between genome size and CAZyme proteins (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>), which revealed that most of the family Archangiaceae members encode more CAZymes as compared to other families. Although we see this potential in Archangiaceae through our comparative genomics approach, experimental validation is required to confirm the expression of these CDSs. Overall, owing to several positive and negative outliers, we found a suboptimal/slightly positive correlation between genome size and CAZyme counts (R<sup>2</sup>&#x0202f;~&#x0202f;0.61). Several organisms deviate from the trendline, and this highlights that despite their relatively smaller genome size, their immense CAZyme potential is an aspect that must be explored and utilized further.</p><p>This analysis provided an organism-wise distribution for all 61 organisms for all CAZyme categories, their families, and subfamilies (<xref rid="SM3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S2</xref>).

Archangiaceae members have approximately two times more GHs (160) encoded in their genomes as compared to Polyangiaceae (111) and Myxococcaceae (83), at the median scale. Irrespective of having the largest genome size, <italic>Minicystis rosea,</italic> and other <italic>Sorangium</italic> spp. organisms have almost 30&#x02013;45% lesser number of GHs, suggesting that Archangiaceae members have the largest genomic potential in terms of carbohydrate degradation as supported by their glycosyl hydrolases encoded proteins. To our surprise, we do not see any major difference in other categories such as GT, PL, CE, and AAs at the median level suggesting their less variation across the dataset. However, CBM numbers showed a large variation of up to two times in Archangiaceae (116) as compared to Polyangiaceae (54) and Myxococcaceae (63), at the median scale, which is almost in correlation with GH numbers. Correlation studies between each CAZyme category with the genome size suggested no correlation for GTs, low correlation for GHs and CBMs (R<sup>2</sup> value ~0.38), moderate correlation (R<sup>2</sup> value ~0.50) for AA and PL, and good correlation for CEs (R<sup>2</sup> value 0.83; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>).</p><p>In the process of seeing an overall picture of the distribution of the major CAZyme families and subfamilies across all taxonomic families, we created a ball and dot map of all categories which have an average total of &#x0003e;10 proteins at all taxonomic families (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). As expected from our above findings, the Archangiaceae family has a greater relative abundance in nearly all major GH families, which are the key domains in polysaccharide degradation.

Lignocellulosic biomass presents a complex and intricate matrix that is not readily accessible for enzymatic degradation. However, glycoside hydrolases (GHs) and related enzymes exhibit the capability to break down these structures (<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">Ezeilo et al., 2017</xref>), a process that holds significant implications for biofuel production. Consequently, such investigations contribute to the expanding knowledge of these potentially economically valuable enzymes and their natural sources.</p><p>Using the enzyme-specific EC numbers (curated from literature) as a query in the CAZyme database, we first curated a list of CAZyme families that are specific to the enzymatic degradation of each of our chosen substrates (<xref rid="SM4" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S3</xref>), followed by their distribution across all myxobacteria (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). Many CAZyme families act on a single carbohydrate substrate but some are bifunctional and involved in the degradation of more than one substrate (the last few domains on the x-axis).

A recent study has reported a GH19 enzyme, C25GH19A, which is chitin-induced in <italic>Corallococcus silvisoli</italic> c25j2 (<xref rid="ref82" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2024</xref>). An anti-fungal GH18 chitinase, CcCti1, was also identified and further studied in <italic>Corallococcus</italic> sp. EGB (<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2019</xref>). Based on the distribution of these families, the suborder Cystobacterineae members demonstrate encoding potential for chitin degradation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). Within this suborder, members of the family Archangiaceae exhibit the highest median number of chitinase domain-containing proteins, with a median value of 23 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5B</xref>). <italic>Vitiosangium</italic> sp. GDMCC 1.1324 possesses the highest number of chitin-degrading domains, totalling 34 (<xref rid="SM5" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S4</xref>). Among Archangiaceae, previous studies have shown that members of the genus <italic>Cystobacter</italic> can degrade chitin but <italic>Archangium gephyra</italic> cannot (<xref rid="ref59" ref-type="bibr">Sharma and Subramanian, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">Lang et al., 2015</xref>). Following the previous study, our study shows that <italic>A. gephyra</italic> DSM 2261 has a lower count of chitinase-associated domain-containing proteins as compared to a higher count (19 proteins) in the <italic>Cystobacter</italic> members <italic>C. fuscus</italic> DSM 52655 and <italic>C. ferrugineus</italic> Cbfe23 (29 and 30 proteins respectively). Among Myxococcaceae, chitin-degrading enzyme domains have been previously reported in <italic>Corallococcus</italic> species and <italic>Myxococcus</italic> species (<xref rid="ref57" ref-type="bibr">Shahbaz and Yu, 2020</xref>; <xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2019</xref>). With a median value of 20 proteins, Myxococcaceae members stand second highest after Archangiaceae. Chitinase domains GH18, GH19, and GH23 showcase endochitinase activity among which the first two are always majorly associated with other domains whereas the last one majorly works independently (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). GH18 plays a role in chitobiosidase activity as well and in our data, it is majorly associated with several CBMs, such as CBM12, CBM13, CBM2, CBM44, CBM5, CBM8, CBM13, CBM61, and CBM 37. Similarly, GH19 is present with CBM12, CBM13, CBM2, and CBM50. However, GH23 is mostly independent (515 proteins) but when associated with an accessory domain, it is one or two or three replicates of CBM50 itself. This suggests that CBM50 has some additional evolutionary relatedness with GH23. GH48 acts both on cellulose as well as chitin (endochitinase activity). Our study revealed that this domain is only present in a few members of the family Archangiaceae along with two members of the family Polyangiaceae, i.e., <italic>Minicystis rosea</italic> DSM 24000, <italic>Polyangium fumosum</italic> DSM 14668.</p></sec><sec id="sec22"><title>Dextran degradation</title><p>Suborder Cystobacterineae has the highest genomic potential for dextran degradation as well (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>).

Pectin-degrading pathways have also been earlier reported in <italic>S. cellulosum</italic> (<xref rid="ref56" ref-type="bibr">Schneiker et al., 2007</xref>). Overall, CE8 was found in only 3 proteins which are encoded by <italic>Archangium violaceum</italic> genomes (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>) and our analysis reveals that all 3 of those proteins have varying architecture, one having CE8 in triplicates, one with the domain PL9_4, and the other with the pectinase specific PL1 itself. GH28 is found in 18 proteins overall, while mostly present alone, this domain could also be found associated with one accessory domain which is PL9_2, or two accessory domains PL9_2 and PL9_4 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). The accessory PL9_4 plays a role in the peptidoglycan lyase activity, while no specific activity has been characterized for PL9_2 as per the CAZyme database. PL1 mostly occurs alone, or it can be with other accessory domains such as PL9, mannose/xylan binding CBM13, the rhamnose binding CBM67, and CBM37.</p><p>Overall, our data indicates that the Archangiaceae, Myxococcaceae, and Polyangiaceae families have significant carbohydrate-degrading genomic potential, warranting further exploration, experimental validation, and utilization. Conversely, the pathogenic <italic>Pajaroellobacter</italic> demonstrates the lowest distribution of CAZymes across all classes, which is consistent with expectations for a pathogenic organism that has reduced genome size.

Notably, certain species within the genera <italic>Myxococcus</italic>, <italic>Corallococcus</italic>, <italic>Archangium</italic>, and <italic>Nannocystis</italic> are also found in harsher environments such as deserts and high-altitude regions. These topsoil bacteria are frequently isolated from the dung of herbivorous animals and decaying plant material, which serve as well-known predominant sources of complex polysaccharides (<xref rid="ref52" ref-type="bibr">Reichenbach, 1999</xref>). The polysaccharide catabolism potential of organisms using the carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZyme) database mapped on their encoded genes can underscore their value for industrial applications. It has been previously shown that Gemmatimonadetes, Actinobacteria, and Proteobacteria members are crucial for nutrient cycling because of their high CAZyme potential (<xref rid="ref79" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2023</xref>). <italic>Streptomyces</italic>, <italic>Micromonospora</italic>, a few <italic>Mycobacterium</italic> and <italic>Propionibacterium</italic> strains have enriched carbohydrate-active enzyme (CAZyme) domains, which have been found to help in lignocellulose biomass degradation (<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">Lewin et al., 2016</xref>). The role of <italic>Streptomyces</italic> species in nutrient cycling has been elucidated in several studies (<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">Book et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">Sidar et al., 2024</xref>; <xref rid="ref63" ref-type="bibr">Takasuka et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">Book et al., 2014</xref>). Insect associated <italic>Streptomyces</italic> species with genome sizes in the range of 6.9&#x02013;7.4&#x0202f;Mb encode 130&#x02013;185 CAZyme proteins with percentage CAZyme proteins in the range of 2.3&#x02013;2.9% (<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">Book et al., 2014</xref>), which helps them in sustaining their relationship with insects. A metagenomic analysis of an anaerobic digestion microbiome exposed to acidosis revealed that Bacteroidetes MAGs constitute 8.8%&#x0202f;&#x000b1;&#x0202f;1.8% of CAZyme genes whereas Firmicutes MAGs with 3.6%&#x0202f;&#x000b1;&#x0202f;1.1%, Spirochaetes MAGs with 2.9%&#x0202f;&#x000b1;&#x0202f;1.2% (<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">Bertucci et al., 2019</xref>) and a smaller percentage of myxobacterial MAGS was also present in such ecosystem.</p><p>In this study, we revealed the genomic potential of polysaccharide catabolism in a diverse representation of myxobacterial species by diving deep into analyzing the CAZyme domains involved in degrading the major substrates cellulose, starch, xylan, fructan, lignin, pectin, dextran, and chitin. Members of Sorangiineae, especially <italic>Sorangium cellulosum</italic> have been well-known as cellulose degraders as the name suggests, however, the genomic background of these activities was not much studied. Our research fills this gap and reveals that many other myxobacterial species possess considerable, yet underexplored, capacities for polysaccharide deconstruction. The degradation of polysaccharides, especially lignocellulosic biomass, holds immense potential for biofuel production. Previous research has shown that overexpression of certain plant-associated domains, like glycosyltransferases (GTs), can enhance biomass formation (<xref rid="ref72" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2017</xref>). This concept could be explored and applied to harness the converse catabolic activities of myxobacteria for increasing efficiency.</p><p>Our findings indicate substantial variability in genomic CAZyme potential among these large-genome harboring myxobacterial families and organisms, with some species exhibiting high potential for substrate-specific degradative capabilities despite having relatively small genomes. Notably, members of the soil-dwelling Archangiaceae family demonstrated a remarkable richness in CAZymes. It is important to recognize and mention that deriving biological conclusions from high-throughput studies such as ours, which involve multi-organism and multi-level comparisons, heavily relies on the quality of publicly available genome assemblies. Most of the assemblies used in our study have complete genomes with high-quality genome annotations, however, a few of them are incomplete, multi-contig assemblies that may not capture the total encoding potential. The inclusion of these draft assemblies was to avail the maximum taxonomic and genomic diversity available at the time of data curation. Despite these limitations, our deep analysis has unveiled new avenues of knowledge.</p><p>While we performed this analysis at three levels- suborder, family, and organism, there may be cases where a bacterium/its family may have immense genomic potential but is not expressing the same when it comes to its expression in its life cycle. Genomic studies alone cannot address these limitations, necessitating extensive experimental validation. We urge experimental researchers to verify whether high counts of substrate-degrading CAZyme domains correlate with increased degradation efficiency. Nonetheless, the carbohydrate degradation potential highlighted in our study is substantial and provides a basis for designing experiments to harness this capability for practical applications. The dataset used in the study is taxonomically broad but still limited to certain well-studied myxobacterial groups. This could introduce phylogenetic bias, where the observed patterns in CAZyme distribution might not be generalizable to other, less-studied phylogenetically close groups. We acknowledge this limitation and suggest the inclusion of more taxa in future studies to provide a more complete picture.</p><p>In conclusion, we present a comprehensive high-throughput genomic analysis of the Carbohydrate Active enZymes-encoding potential of 61 myxobacteria members (order Myxococcales or currently known phylum Myxococcota), examining their genomic diversity at the levels of suborder, family, and genus, as well as their functionality in terms of singular or multiple enzymatic activities. Comparative analysis among members of order Myxococcales revealed variations in carbohydrate utilization potential and recommended that lignocellulose biomass degradation is not universally conserved and similar within these groups of organisms. Such carbohydrate degradation analyses lay a preliminary foundation for utilizing myxobacterial organisms in diverse paper-pulp, food-beverage, textile, and biofuel industries.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><title>Abbreviations</title><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>CAZy, Carbohydrate Active Enzymes; LCB, lignocellulosic biomass; GH, glycoside hydrolases; GT, glycosyl transferases; PL, polysaccharide lyases; CE, carbohydrate esterases; AA, auxiliary activities; CBM, carbohydrate-binding modules; NCBI, National Center for Biotechnology Information; CDS, Coding Sequence; GC%, Guanine-Cytosine percentage.</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group><fn id="fn0001"><p>
