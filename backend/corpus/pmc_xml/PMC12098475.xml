Infections are a major cause of poor prognosis in children with hematologic diseases. So far, there has been limited research on the use of plasma cfDNA mNGS in children with hematological disorders at high risk of infection.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 73 children with hematological disorders suspected of early infection admitted to Anhui Children&#x02019;s Hospital between September 2023 and February 2024. The diagnostic performance and clinical implications of mNGS versus conventional microbiological testing (CMT) were evaluated.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The positive rate of mNGS was significantly higher than that of CMT (69.86% vs 31.51%, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). When compared with the final clinical diagnosis, the sensitivity of mNGS was significantly higher than that of CMT (71.88% vs 35.94%, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). There is a high degree of agreement between the positive results of the two assays (78.95%). A total of 46 pathogens were identified in children with hematologic diseases, of which 41 pathogens were detected by mNGS and only 12 pathogens were detected by CMT. In these patients, the most common bacteria detected were <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> and <italic>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</italic>. <italic>Human betaherpesvirus 5</italic> (CMV) was the most commonly detected virus. All fungi were detected only by mNGS. Overall, mNGS had a positive effect on the clinical treatment for 65.75% of patients in this study. Positive results are more likely to be obtained with mNGS when white blood cell counts, neutrophil counts, and lymphocyte counts are low.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Early plasma cfDNA mNGS improved the performance of pathogen detection in children with hematological diseases.

Deficiencies in immune function make children more susceptible to infection by a variety of pathogens. In particular, children with hematologic malignancies, especially those undergoing chemotherapy or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), are more likely to develop infections due to immune system damage, which is one of the leading causes of death in these children when infected (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Maschmeyer et&#x000a0;al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et&#x000a0;al., 2023</xref>). Early intervention in children with infectious diseases can reduce the risk of death (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Abe et&#x000a0;al., 2019</xref>). However, uncertain diagnosis and treatment may lead to disease progression or death, and excessive use of inappropriate antimicrobials may lead to the emergence of multidrug-resistant bacteria, increasing the medical burden of patients (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Wu et&#x000a0;al., 2024</xref>). Therefore, it is very important to provide patients with pathogen detection and diagnosis in a timely manner so that appropriate antimicrobial agents can be used or adjusted for early targeted therapy.</p><p>Patients with blood disorders are prone to symptoms of infection such as fever after treatment (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Guo et&#x000a0;al., 2022</xref>). Early identification and exclusion of the patient&#x02019;s infection is crucial. Due to the time-consuming nature of traditional testing methods and the low pathogen detection rate, children with suspected infections often receive empiric antimicrobial therapy, which can lead to antibiotic abuse (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Martinez and Wolk, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Martinez-Nadal et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>). Although blood cultures are the gold standard for detecting blood infections in patients, blood cultures have low sensitivity and are highly influenced by antibiotic use (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Wu et&#x000a0;al., 2024</xref>). As a result, 15% to 60% of cases remain undiagnosed despite routine laboratory testing (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Schlaberg et&#x000a0;al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Xu et&#x000a0;al., 2024</xref>).</p><p>Unbiased metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) has been used in the diagnosis of many types of infectious diseases (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Blauwkamp et&#x000a0;al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Kalbitz et&#x000a0;al., 2024</xref>). As an auxiliary tool for routine testing, it addresses the shortcomings of conventional microbial testing (CMT), including the low positive detection rate, the time-consuming nature, and the detection bias greatly influenced by antibiotic use (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Miao et&#x000a0;al., 2018</xref>). Previous studies have focused on the performance of mNGS in adults and more in pediatric patients, with more studies of the performance of patients with hematologic malignancies (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Wang et&#x000a0;al., 2022</xref>; <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Feng et&#x000a0;al., 2024</xref>; <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Wang et&#x000a0;al., 2024</xref>). However, the early diagnosis and real clinical impact of mNGS on children with hematologic disorders is limited. Therefore, we evaluated the diagnostic performance and clinical impact of plasma mNGS in children with hematologic diseases in a tertiary children&#x02019;s hospital in southern China to better understand the clinical application of plasma mNGS in children with hematologic diseases.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2_1"><label>2.1</label><title>Patient enrolment and study design</title><p>We retrospectively enrolled 80 patients with hematological disorders with suspected or confirmed infection who underwent blood mNGS testing at Anhui Children&#x02019;s Hospital in China from September 2023 to February 2024. According to our inclusion/exclusion criteria, data from a total of 73 patients were included in the current study for analysis. The inclusion criteria are as follows (1): hematologic diseases (2); High suspicion of infection, such as: fever (&#x0003e;38 &#x000b0;C), symptoms of respiratory/gastrointestinal/urinary tract infection, etc.; (3) Other relevant conventional microbial tests, such as culture, G/GM testing, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were completed simultaneously within 7 days of blood mNGS testing. Exclusion criteria are as follows: (1) non-hematologic disease; (2) incomplete case information; and (3) lack of paired CMT. Hematologic diseases mainly include leukemia, lymphoma, multiple myeloma, aplastic anemia, etc (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Wang et&#x000a0;al., 2024</xref>). Non-hematologic diseases mainly include diseases other than hematologic ones. In addition, we collected the demographic characteristics of the patients, clinical history, laboratory tests, treatment procedures. Two experienced clinicians independently assessed the patient&#x02019;s clinical symptoms, laboratory tests, CMT, and response to treatment for the final diagnosis of infection.</p><p>This study was approved by the Ethics Committee (EYLL-2023-016) of Anhui Children&#x02019;s Hospital, China.

The readouts were compared to the human reference genome GRCh38 (hg38) by using Bowtie2 software to remove the human sequence (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Langmead and Salzberg, 2012</xref>).

Pathogen positivity is determined using a reading per ten million (RPTM) value. The viruses needed to reach an RPTM threshold of &#x02265;3 to be considered positive; For bacteria and fungi, this threshold was &#x02265;8. When the RPTM value was &#x02265;1, specific pathogens, including <italic>cryptococcus</italic> and <italic>mycobacteria</italic>, were identified as positive (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Wang et&#x000a0;al., 2024</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2_4"><label>2.4</label><title>Clinical impact of mNGS on treatment management</title><p>Based on the mNGS results, the clinical impact of mNGS on the treatment was assessed as positive, negative, and no effect (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Xu et&#x000a0;al., 2023</xref>; <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Zhu et&#x000a0;al., 2023</xref>). Positive effects suggest that mNGS can be useful in antibiotic adjustment or confirm empiric regimens. Negative effects mean unnecessary treatment. No effect indicates that treatment has not been adjusted despite a negative or positive mNGS result, or that the patient has been discharged or died by the time mNGS reports are available.</p></sec><sec id="s2_5"><label>2.5</label><title>Statistics analysis</title><p>Independent variables were expressed as counts and percentages.

They were classified into infected (n=64) and non-infected groups (n=9) based on their final clinical diagnosis, which was mainly determined by clinical symptoms, microbial test results, laboratory indexes, imaging features, and clinical treatment. Hematologic disorders included 13 cases (17.81%) of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), 37 cases (50.68%) of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), 7 cases (9.59%) of neuroblastoma (NBL), 3 cases (4.11%) of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), 2 cases (2.74%) of hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), 2 cases (2.74%) of Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL), 5 cases (6.85%) of aplastic anemia (AA) or other types of anemia, and 4 cases (6.25%) of other hematologic diseases. Of these patients, 66 (90.41%) were immunosuppressed, mainly due to chemotherapy for malignancy. Based on the final clinical diagnosis, the most common site of infection in infected patients was co-infection of the blood and lungs (43.75%), followed by blood-only infections (29.69%) and lung-only infections (15.63%).

In patients who are eventually clinically diagnosed as infectious, the most common site of infection was blood, followed by the lungs.

In this study, the positive rate of plasma cfDNA mNGS was significantly higher than that of the gold standard &#x0201c;BC&#x0201d; and CMT by about 38%-57%, especially in infectious patients. A number of hematological studies have reported that the positive rate of BC is low, only 10%-13%, and in this study, the positive rate of BC is only 12.33%, which is also similar to previous studies, although BC is an important reference for clinical diagnosis, it is difficult to detect pathogens quickly and broadly by blood culture alone (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Nannan Panday et&#x000a0;al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et&#x000a0;al., 2023</xref>). The significant advantages of mNGS in detection have also led to its recommendation as an additional detection method for first-line detection tools (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Li et&#x000a0;al., 2021</xref>). Compared to BC, mNGS achieved a sensitivity of 75%. The sensitivity of mNGS was 71.88% as a reference to the final clinical diagnosis. This is similar to a previous systematic review of infection in patients with hematologic disorders, and plasma mNGS has significant advantages over CMT in detecting microbial infections (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Chen et&#x000a0;al., 2024c</xref>). Previous studies have shown that in adult patients with hematologic disorders, the overall coincidence rate of blood mNGS was 51.02% when CMT was used as a reference (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Hao et&#x000a0;al., 2022</xref>). Although the patient population in our study was children, the overall coincidence rate of mNGS compared to CMT was similar to that of adults (47.95%). However, when the final clinical diagnosis is used as the criterion, mNGS shows lower specificity, although it has higher sensitivity than CMT. This differs from previous studies, which may be due to the fact that in our study, CMT included culture, smear, G/GM testing, and targeted PCR testing for pathogens. In contrast, the broad spectrum of mNGS leads to false-positive results, decreasing its specificity. In particular, most of the false-positive results detected in this study were herpes viruses identified by mNGS. Low abundance of DNA viruses is also a major cause of false-positive results in patients with hematologic disorders (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Wu et&#x000a0;al., 2024</xref>). It is important to note that the final results of mNGS still need to be adjudicated by professional clinicians to avoid interference from non-pathogenic microorganisms.</p><p>mNGS technology has identified a wider range of infectious pathogens in patients with hematological disorders. Forty-one pathogens were detected by mNGS, compared to only 12 by CMT. Patients with blood malignancies have an increased risk of bacterial infections after chemotherapy (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Thacker et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Wu et&#x000a0;al., 2024</xref>).

But it&#x02019;s worth noting that more <italic>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</italic> was detected in our study, which differs from the epidemiology of patients with hematological diseases. We reviewed the clinical information of the patients and found that these children all had infections that occurred during the winter months, so the detection of <italic>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</italic> may be associated with seasonal infections in children. For the detection of viruses, CMV and EBV are the most common viruses detected, which is basically consistent with the pathogen spectrum in previous studies (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et&#x000a0;al., 2022</xref>; <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Chen et&#x000a0;al., 2024b</xref>). In addition, mNGS was more sensitive in the detection of fungi, and the fungi in all 4 patients were detected by mNGS, while CMT was negative. Timely identification of fungal infections is essential for patients with hematological diseases, which also reflects the advantages of mNGS in the detection of fungi (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Guo et&#x000a0;al., 2022</xref>). Despite the broad spectrum and high sensitivity of mNGS in detecting pathogens, some pathogens are still detected only by CMT. We found that the main pathogens missed by mNGS were Mycoplasma pneumoniae and influenza viruses (A and B), which may be due to the fact that PCR targets Mycoplasma pneumoniae and influenza viruses (A and B) in CMT assays. Several previous studies have also shown that targeted PCR has higher detection sensitivity for specific pathogens compared to mNGS (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Hu et&#x000a0;al., 2021</xref>). Therefore, supplementing with plasma mNGS can provide valuable insights when infection is suspected in patients with hematologic disorders at an early stage.</p><p>Plasma mNGS had a positive effect on the treatment of 65.75% of patients. This is mainly focused on reducing unnecessary drugs based on the results of mNGS. Unnecessary antibiotic treatment will lead to the development of drug resistance and increase the medical burden of patients (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Wang et&#x000a0;al., 2024</xref>). 26.03% of patients adjusted or increased the use of targeted antimicrobial drugs according to mNGS results. Although clinicians always empirically use broad-spectrum antibiotics when infection is suspected, mNGS can help target antibiotics and improve clinical symptoms in patients (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Chen et&#x000a0;al., 2024c</xref>). However, in our study, there were still 34.25% of patients who were not affected by mNGS, and they mainly focused on the negative results of mNGS and did not provide a reference for the adjustment of antibiotics. In addition to this, mNGS also had a positive effect on 33.33% of non-infected patients, which led to the discontinuation of antibiotics due to the exclusion of infection. mNGS had a significant positive effect in patients with suspected infection in the early stage, benefiting most patients.</p><p>Patients with blood disorders are more likely to develop neutropenia after clinical treatment (chemotherapy, transplantation, etc.), and patients are more likely to develop infections. In our study, patients with neutropenia were more likely to have positive results for mNGS testing, which is consistent with previous reports. Previous reports have demonstrated that pediatric patients with hematologic malignancies and neutropenia are more susceptible to bacterial infections, which was also confirmed in our study, where more bacterial species were detected by blood mNGS (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Wu et&#x000a0;al., 2024</xref>). In addition to this, we also found that lower WBC and lymphocyte counts made it easier to obtain positive results for mNGS. This may be due to the fact that lower white blood cell and lymphocyte counts increase the risk of severe infection, meaning that patients are more critically ill, and mNGS tests are more sensitive and more likely to obtain positive results in patients with severe disease (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Chang et&#x000a0;al., 2023</xref>). Additionally, pediatric patients with low lymphocyte counts are more susceptible to CMV infection (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Zhan et&#x000a0;al., 2022</xref>). In our study, CMV was also the most commonly detected virus. These results provide valuable reference for using mNGS detection in patients with suspected infection at an early stage.</p><p>However, our research also has some limitations. First, because this is a retrospective study, we did not collect samples for mNGS on the same date, resulting in the majority of patients receiving empiric antimicrobial therapy prior to mNGS testing. This may have an impact on the results of mNGS and CMT. Second, although we have a verdict on clinical infection, there is still a lack of criteria for each pathogen to determine whether they are clinically relevant or not, so the final verdict is still determined by the subjective experience of the clinician. Finally, this is a small retrospective study, the results may be biased and a prospective study of large-scale, multicenter subjects is still needed to further validate the relevant findings.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><label>5</label><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study demonstrated the value of plasma mNGS in the diagnosis of suspected infection in children with blood disorders in the early stage. mNGS is far superior to BC and CMT in detecting infections and helps rule out infections. mNGS detection at an early stage of infection helps in the identification of pathogens and the precise treatment of antimicrobial drugs, thereby improving patients&#x02019; symptoms and reducing mortality.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank the participants in the study.</p></ack><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s6"><title>Data availability statement</title><p>The data presented in the study are deposited in the SRA (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA1227282/" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA1227282/</ext-link>) repository, accession number PRJNA1227282.</p></sec><sec sec-type="ethics-statement" id="s7"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>This study was approved by the Ethics Committee (EYLL-2023-016) of Anhui Children&#x02019;s Hospital.
