active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) is commonly
perceived as more efficient when performed using continuous-flow methods,
whereas batch processes are often seen as less favorable due to their
limitations in yield, heat and mass transfer, and safety. This perception
largely stems from existing studies that focus on green metrics such
as the E-factor and yield. However, a comprehensive comparison of
batch and flow processes through full techno-economic analyses (TEA)
and life-cycle assessments (LCA) remains underexplored, leaving key
aspects of their environmental and economic impacts inadequately assessed.
This work addresses this gap by presenting a detailed comparison of
batch and flow syntheses of seven industrially relevant APIs, including
amitriptyline hydrochloride, tamoxifen, zolpidem, rufinamide, artesunate,
ibuprofen, and phenibut. Eleven environmental impact categories within
the framework of nine planetary boundaries were assessed, and the
study also included an evaluation of capital and operating costs for
both production methods. The results demonstrated that, on average,
continuous-flow processes are significantly more sustainable with
improvements in energy efficiency, water consumption, and waste reduction.
Flow processes also show a marked reduction in carbon emissions and
up to a 97% reduction in energy consumption, highlighting their potential
for greener API manufacturing. Despite these advantages, the study
identified areas where the continuous-flow technology requires further
development. Specifically, manufacturing certain APIs in flow show
lower-than-average improvements in operating expenditure and land
system changes, the latter being directly correlated with the consumption
of organic solvents, that can be comparable to or even higher than
in batch. These challenges highlight the need for further optimization
of flow processes to fully realize their potential in API production.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="short"><p>This study compares batch and continuous-flow

are essential to human health and the well-being of a
growing and aging global population, playing a key role in achieving
the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal on &#x0201c;Good Health
and Well-Being&#x0201d;. Pharmaceuticals encompass a wide variety of
chemical compounds designed to ensure safe and effective therapies.
Among these, active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) are specific
chemical entities intended to exert an effect on chemical and biological
targets. Currently, the manufacturing of APIs largely relies on traditional
batch processes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref></sup> One factor contributing to the extensive use of batch manufacturing
is the adaptability of chemical production units, enabling the synthesis
of a wide range of APIs within the same facilities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref></sup> This flexibility allows manufacturers to switch between
different production processes with relative ease, accommodating varying
chemical reactions and adjusting to market demands without the need
for extensive reconfiguration or new infrastructure. However, batch
synthesis methods present limitations in process productivity, resulting
in inefficient mixing of the reaction mixture, limited heat and mass
transfer characteristics, and lower process safety margins.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></sup> Additionally, scaling up batch processes poses significant challenges
due to a lower surface area-to-volume ratio, which raises concerns
about heat transfer control, hotspot formation, and insufficient mixing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref></sup> As a result, the production of APIs is recognized as one of the
most energy- and material-intensive industries within the chemical
sector, contributing (only in 2023) to 358 megatons of greenhouse
gas emissions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref></sup> This is equivalent to 6% of global
CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, more than those from the automotive industry.
This critical issue often flies under the radar, but is due to the
industry&#x02019;s stringent regulatory requirements, high-risk aversion,
and the need for extensive validation and market acceptance.</p><p>Over the past two decades, continuous-flow processes have emerged
as a potential alternative to batch processes in the preparation of
APIs, and many drugs, including artemisinin and rufinamide, have been
transitioned to continuous flow operation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>a).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref></sup> Flow techniques promise
better control of operating conditions, leading to safer operations,
homogenized mixing, reduced waste, enhanced transfer phenomena, and
lower solvent and energy usage compared to batch reactors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref></sup> It has been also hypothesized that the potential of this technology
to enhance sustainability lies in its capacity to reduce the environmental
footprint compared to conventional methods.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref></sup> However, to date, comparisons of API production processes in batch
and continuous-flow configuration still primarily exploit basic green
metrics such as the E-factor, process mass intensity (PMI), and yield
analysis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref></sup> While these metrics are valuable
for assessing certain aspects of process sustainability, such as material
efficiency and waste generation, they fall short of providing a complete
evaluation of the overall environmental impact of a process and do
not account for critical factors such as energy consumption, greenhouse
gas emissions, and the broader life-cycle implications of raw material
sourcing, waste disposal, and process scalability (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>a). Additionally, these metrics
often overlook economic feasibility, which is essential for integrating
sustainable practices in real-world industrial applications, especially
when considering capital and operational costs, regulatory compliance,
and market acceptance,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref></sup> as also emphasized
in a recent critical review.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref></sup> Therefore,
it is not surprising that a comprehensive techno-economic analysis
(TEA) and life-cycle assessment (LCA) encompassing the full scope
of API production in flow, and the holistic evaluation of the batch-to-microreactor
transition, has never been conducted. In particular, TEA is important
for assessing a process&#x02019;s economic feasibility considering
capital investment and operating costs along with service life, maintenance
requirements, and utilities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref></sup> Additionally,
LCA evaluates the environmental impacts of processes in a standardized
manner.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref></sup> This highlights the need for
a detailed investigation that thoroughly assesses the economic feasibility
and environmental impact across a diverse range of APIs, to pave the
way for more informed and sustainable manufacturing practices.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Timeline highlighting

As the reader can appreciate, by selecting APIs with diverse chemical
structures and synthetic pathways, we aimed to ensure a broad evaluation
of both economic feasibility and environmental impacts, making the
findings more widely applicable and rigorous to the pharmaceutical
sector. The process simulations and techno-economic analysis were
performed using Aspen Plus V11 while the environmental assessment
was achieved using SimaPro V9.5. Detailed analytical data are included

initiated the work by conducting a techno-economic analysis
to evaluate the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of the flow technology,
which is crucial for obtaining essential data on resource utilization.
We quantified, in particular, the energy used in the two configurations
(<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssuschemeng.4c09289/suppl_file/sc4c09289_si_001.pdf">Table S1</ext-link>, Supporting Information). Generally,
the batch manufacturing process exhibited energy consumption ranging
from 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> W h<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> g<sub>product</sub><sup>&#x02013;1</sup> to 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>2</sup> W h<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> g<sub>product</sub><sup>&#x02013;1</sup>. In contrast,
the continuous-flow process demonstrated a significantly lower range
from 10<sup>&#x02013;2</sup> W h<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> g<sub>product</sub><sup>&#x02013;1</sup> to 10<sup>1</sup> W h<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> g<sub>product</sub><sup>&#x02013;1</sup>. From a quantitative perspective,
the implementation of the continuous-flow process enhanced energy
efficiency by one order of magnitude compared to the batch process,
consistently achieving an overall enhancement exceeding 30% and with
an average improvement of approximately 78% (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssuschemeng.4c09289/suppl_file/sc4c09289_si_001.pdf">Table S1</ext-link>, Supporting Information and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>a). The ibuprofen flow process demonstrated
the highest enhancement by 97%. This exceptional performance was accompanied
by 91% reduction in energy consumption for the phenibut process, from
9.51 W g<sub>product</sub><sup>&#x02013;1</sup> h<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> to 0.82 W g<sub>product</sub><sup>&#x02013;1</sup> h<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>. These results stemmed from the continuous-flow technique improving
productivity, owing to higher yields and a greater amount of target
products in a shorter time. The lowest fraction of minimization in
energy efficiency was observed in the tamoxifen process, which decreased
from 1.49 W g<sub>product</sub><sup>&#x02013;1</sup> h<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> to 0.99 W g<sub>product</sub><sup>&#x02013;1</sup> h<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>. The increased energy efficiency observed in the continuous-flow
system was attributed to several characteristics inherent to continuous-flow
technology. We explored correlations with multiple factors, such as
reaction kinetics and advanced mass and heat transfer, but we could
find that energy efficiency primarily correlates with process duration
alone. This suggests that shorter reaction times in the continuous-flow
system, which inherently demands less electricity, drive the observed
reduction in total energy consumption. This relationship is illustrated
for the seven processes in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>b.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Energy reductions per gram of product and per hour in

for batch and flow
processes, as shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>c, demonstrated the performance difference in the energy efficiency
between the two methods. Batch processes exhibit an average energy
consumption of approximately 10<sup>3</sup> kWh. Conversely, flow
processes showed a statistically relevant reduced energy consumption
on the order of 10<sup>1</sup>&#x02013;10<sup>2</sup> kWh. The capital
cost expenses of the processes and their reductions are illustrated
in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>a (and detailed
in <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssuschemeng.4c09289/suppl_file/sc4c09289_si_001.pdf">Table S2</ext-link>, Supporting Information). The
batch configuration was estimated to cost between $3,000,000 and $7,000,000,
whereas the continuous-flow technology ranged from $2,000,000 to $4,000,000.
From an economic point of view, the continuous-flow method leads to
a less drastic decrease in capital cost expenses. The best performance
in terms of capital cost reduction was observed in the rufinamide
process, which experienced an almost 50% drop from $7,030,000 to $3,520,000.
However, capital cost reductions are case-dependant, as it was also
noted that other processes, such as ibuprofen, exhibited reduction
performance below 10%. Capital costs between batch and flow processes
for the seven APIs were statistically investigated in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>b. The batch process demonstrates
a slightly lower average operating cost compared to the flow configuration.
The observed variability in the operating costs is primarily attributed
to differences in infrastructure and instrumentation expenses, which
account for nearly 50% of the total costs. The higher average and
variability of batch processes indicated that the method requires
more resource-intensive infrastructure (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssuschemeng.4c09289/suppl_file/sc4c09289_si_001.pdf">Table S3</ext-link>, Supporting Information). In fact, in continuous systems,
the reactor operates with a consistent feed and flow of reactants,
which allows for a compact design optimized for efficient mass and
heat transfer. This reduction in reactor volume directly lowers the
quantity of construction materials needed as well as associated costs.
In addition to the capital cost expenses, yearly operating costs
were also assessed, considering the raw material and the utility and
maintenance expenses (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>c). The batch manufacturing processes exhibited an average
annual operating cost of $3,640,000 on average, while the flow configuration
demonstrated a slight reduction in expenses, averaging $3,360,000
on average (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssuschemeng.4c09289/suppl_file/sc4c09289_si_001.pdf">Table S4</ext-link>, Supporting Information).
However, for the seven processes, variations in operating costs were
not statistically significant (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>d). In other words, the reduction in costs observed
with the flow configuration is likely not due to a definitive trend
that can be generalized across chemical processes. The analysis, in
fact, suggests that there is no strong evidence to support that the
flow configuration consistently leads to lower operating costs in
a meaningful way.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Capital cost expenses for the seven processes in batch

not
solely dependent on a specific process but reflect, in statistical
terms, the broader perspective on the advantages of continuous manufacturing.
In transitioning from batch to continuous-flow methods, capital costs
may be reduced due to smaller reactor sizes. This reduction is especially
beneficial for the pharmaceutical sector, where high initial investments
can hinder the adoption of new technologies. However, annual operating
costs might not experience a similar decline. For pharmaceutical companies,
this implies that although the initial capital investment in continuous-flow
systems is appealing, the decision to transition should also take
into account long-term operational efficiencies and the potential
for improved product quality and consistency. Companies may find it
most advantageous to adopt flow manufacturing, for example, for high-volume
production of well-established products, where capital savings can
be complemented by operational efficiencies over time or for new product
developments when launching new pharmaceutical products. This approach
allows companies to design processes specifically optimized for continuous
flow, sidestepping the complexities and costs associated with retrofitting
existing batch systems and facilitating a smoother integration of
advanced technologies from the outset.</p><p>In addition, a study
of 15-year net present value (NPV) projections
at a discount rate of 8% (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssuschemeng.4c09289/suppl_file/sc4c09289_si_001.pdf">Figure S8</ext-link>, Supporting
Information) was conducted to demonstrate clear financial advantages
of flow processes over batch processes across all seven APIs. Initially,
both methods show negative NPV values due to the high capital investment
required. However, flow processes consistently achieve breakeven points
earlier, with breakeven times ranging from year 7 to year 12 depending
on the API, compared to later breakeven points for batch processes,
which occur between years 9 and year 14. This earlier breakeven for
flow processes is attributed to their reduced operating costs, lower
resource consumption, and streamlined operations. Additionally, the
slope of the NPV analysis for flow processes is steeper than that
for batch processes, indicating higher profitability growth over time.
By the end of the 15-year period, flow processes show consistently
higher NPV values across all APIs, reflecting their superior long-term
economic viability. The widening gap between the NPV curves of batch
and flow methods highlights the cumulative financial advantage of
flow processes, which stems from their efficiency in energy, solvent,
and water usage, as well as lower environmental impacts, as demonstrated
in previous analyses.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><label>2.2</label><title>Life-Cycle Analysis of

of the manufacturing processes, we then moved to a comprehensive LCA
of the seven selected processes to identify key areas where improvements
can be made, quantify resource consumption, and evaluate emissions
associated with each process.</p><p>Regarding water consumption (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>a), the batch manufacturing
process resulted in a usage ranging between 10<sup>&#x02013;2</sup> and 10<sup>1</sup> m<sup>3</sup> per unit of product, whereas the
continuous-flow process demonstrated a significantly lower range,
between 10<sup>&#x02013;3</sup> and 10<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> m<sup>3</sup> per unit of product (detailed in <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssuschemeng.4c09289/suppl_file/sc4c09289_si_001.pdf">Table S5</ext-link>, Supporting Information). This indicates that the continuous-flow
process consumes one-to-two orders of magnitude less water compared
to the batch process, leading to a reduction of water usage of between
50 and 90%. The reduction in water consumption in the continuous-flow
process can be attributed to several factors inherent to this technology.
Continuous-flow systems generally operate at lower temperatures and
pressures, resulting in the more efficient utilization of reagents
and solvents. This efficiency leads to decreased water usage needed
for cooling and cleaning unit operations. Additionally, the compact
design and enhanced control over reaction parameters in continuous-flow
systems further reduce the need for solvents and water, as reactions
occur in a more controlled and steady-state environment, minimizing
the requirements for excess water in the handling and processing stages.
The greatest reduction was obtained in the ibuprofen production process,
which achieved a 99% reduction in total solvent usage per gram of
the target product, from 20.70 m<sup>3</sup> throughout the batch
process to 5.4 m<sup>3</sup> in the continuous-flow method. In contrast,
the artesunate production process exhibited the lowest reduction in
total water consumption, with a decrease of only 46%, from 0.0072
m<sup>3</sup> to 0.0039 m<sup>3</sup>, well below the average reduction
of 81% in most of the seven pharmaceutical processes.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Water consumption for

usage is
visible (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>b).
Specifically, lower water usage can be linked with reduced electricity
consumption as less energy is required for cooling and processing
operations. Thus, this linear relationship points out the significance
of water efficiency not only in terms of resource conservation but
also in terms of its potential impact on overall energy consumption
and environmental sustainability. In fact, the water-energy nexus
is a critical consideration in evaluating manufacturing processes
due to the interdependence between water consumption and electricity
usage. The statistical analysis supported the variations in water
consumption between batch and flow processes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>c).</p><p>The effects on land system changes,
which consider the impact of
technology on deforestation and destruction of natural habitats, are
depicted in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>d. It was observed that the batch processes exhibited a change on
land systems ranging from 10<sup>&#x02013;4</sup> to 10<sup>&#x02013;2</sup> m<sup>2</sup> per unit of product, while the continuous-flow method
led to a slight reduction of one order of magnitude, resulting in
a range of 10<sup>&#x02013;4</sup> to 10<sup>&#x02013;3</sup> m<sup>2</sup> per unit of product (detailed in <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssuschemeng.4c09289/suppl_file/sc4c09289_si_001.pdf">Table S6</ext-link>, Supporting Information). Considering 1 gram of product,
the phenibut process showed the best performance with a decrease of
97% from 0.00468 m<sup>2</sup> in batch to 0.00015 m<sup>2</sup> in
flow, due to the minimization of toluene and tetrahydrofuran usage
from 23.3 g g<sub>product</sub><sup>&#x02013;1</sup> and 17.1 g g<sub>product</sub><sup>&#x02013;1</sup> in batch to 7.6 g g<sub>product</sub><sup>&#x02013;1</sup> and 0.1 g g<sub>product</sub><sup>&#x02013;1</sup> in flow, respectively. In addition, ibuprofen exhibited a reduction
of more than 85% in land system changes because of less solvent (methanol)
usages (from 48.2 g g<sub>product</sub><sup>&#x02013;1</sup> in batch
to 3.5 g g<sub>product</sub><sup>&#x02013;1</sup> in flow). Moreover,
the rufinamide process demonstrated only a 30% reduction due to the
similar amounts of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) used during the manufacturing
processes of the two configurations, noted as 14.0 g<sub>DMSO</sub> g<sub>product</sub><sup>&#x02013;1</sup> and 11.9 g<sub>DMSO</sub> g<sub>product</sub><sup>&#x02013;1</sup>, respectively. The correlation
between land system changes and solvent usage in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>e can be attributed to the
environmental footprint associated with the production and disposal
of solvents. The extraction of raw materials for solvent production
often involves land use changes, including deforestation and habitat
destruction. Thus, reducing solvent consumption not only lessens the
direct environmental impact of manufacturing processes but also diminishes
the associated land use changes linked to solvent life-cycle management.
In the cases of phenibut and ibuprofen, the significant reductions
in solvent usage led to substantial decreases in land system changes,
illustrating that efficient resource management in manufacturing can
contribute to minimizing ecological disruption. Conversely, in the
rufinamide process, the limited reduction in solvent usage resulted
in only a modest decrease in land system change, highlighting the
importance of optimizing solvent utilization as a strategy for promoting
environmental sustainability within pharmaceutical manufacturing.
The statistical analysis presented in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>f supports these findings, although it also
shows that the variation of land system changes the variation in land
system changes is not statistically significant, and this might indicate
that solvent consumption is not substantially different between batch
and flow configurations. This could mean that while flow processes
are often expected to reduce solvent usage due to continuous operation
and improved efficiency, in practice, the reduction is not as pronounced.
This could be due to the need for comparable solvent volumes for reaction
control, cleaning, or separation steps, making the overall solvent
consumption between the two processes relatively similar.</p><p>The
environmental performance of the seven processes was investigated
by evaluating their greenness, considering both the E-factor (mass
of waste per mass of product) and carbon emissions (kg CO<sub>2</sub> equiv). Continuous-flow processes generated fewer processes relative
to the target product (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref></xref>a). In fact, the E-factor of batch processes ranged between
10 and 110, while continuous-flow technology significantly outperformed
batch methods, exhibiting an E-factor range of 2 to 20, hence with
an average reduction of 87% (detailed in <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssuschemeng.4c09289/suppl_file/sc4c09289_si_001.pdf">Table S7</ext-link>, Supporting Information). This improvement can be attributed
to the intrinsic characteristics of continuous-flow techniques, including
overall higher yields, lower waste production, and minimization of
solvent usage, as discussed above. Notably, with respect to the shift
from traditional batch reactors to a continuous-flow method, the artesunate
process showed an excellent example of green production, achieving
a 97% drop in E-factor. In addition, the phenibut and ibuprofen processes
also followed this trend with ca. 93% reductions, respectively. Also,
the rufinamide process performed the lowest drop in E-factor by 85%.
The higher E-factor in batch processes is demonstrated in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref></xref>b, which well depicts
the high propensity for waste generation in batch systems.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>E-factor for
the seven processes in batch and flow (a). Statistical
analysis of the E-factor results (b). CO<sub>2</sub> emissions for

The circle in the statistical analysis in (b) and (d) represents the
average value, the square represents the median, and the line serves
as a guide for the reader.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="sc4c09289_0005" id="gr5" position="float"/></fig><p>It is important to note, however, that while the E-factor provides
valuable insights into waste generation, it does not account for the
carbon emissions associated with the production processes. This limitation
means that the E-factor alone may not fully capture the environmental
impact of a manufacturing process, particularly in terms of its contribution
to greenhouse gas emissions. Carbon emissions can arise from various
sources, including energy-intensive thermal processes required for
heating, cooling, or phase changes, as well as from solvent evaporation,
reagent decomposition, and byproduct formation. Additionally, emissions
may result from upstream activities such as raw material extraction,
transportation, and purification, as well as downstream processing
steps like separation, purification, and waste treatment. Therefore,
an assessment of carbon (CO<sub>2</sub>) emissions was also performed
for the batch and flow methods (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref></xref>c,d).</p><p>Batch configurations resulted in carbon
emissions (kg of CO<sub>2</sub> equiv) ranging from the order of magnitude
of 10<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> to 10<sup>1</sup>, and via the implementation
of the continuous-flow
method, the emissions were obtained in a range of 10<sup>&#x02013;2</sup> to 10<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>. The flow technology significantly lowered
the carbon emissions by one order of magnitude with a 79% reduction
on average (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssuschemeng.4c09289/suppl_file/sc4c09289_si_001.pdf">Table S8</ext-link>, Supporting Information).
Similar to the results of E-factor, the ibuprofen process demonstrated
an outstanding reduction performance by 97% from emitting 0.41 kg
of CO<sub>2</sub> equiv to 0.01 kg of CO<sub>2</sub> equiv. This outcome
was obtained during the analysis due to longer durations (to produce
the same amount of product) for batch reactors, which led to higher
electricity usage throughout the manufacturing stage. Additionally,
the phenibut process also followed this well-executed trend by performing
a 95% decrease from 0.43 kg of CO<sub>2</sub> equiv to 0.02 kg of
CO<sub>2</sub> equiv. Finally, carbon emissions in the amitriptyline
hydrochloride process showed the lowest minimization by 45% as a result
of the implementation of the continuous-flow method.</p><p>These findings
highlight important insight regarding the interplay
between CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, water consumption, and energy use.
Notably, some processes that exhibit low E-factors, such as rufinamide,
may still generate significant CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and consume
considerable amounts of water due to their high energy requirements.
Therefore, an integrated approach to sustainability assessment is
essential to make informed decisions that promote sustainability across
all dimensions of production. Finally, the environmental impacts of
the seven processes were analyzed for the first time in the flow chemistry
field in relation to the nine planetary boundaries (detailed in <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssuschemeng.4c09289/suppl_file/sc4c09289_si_001.pdf">Tables S9&#x02013;15</ext-link>, Supporting Information),
including ocean acidification, biosphere integrity (both functional
and genetic), carbon emissions, atmospheric aerosol loading, land
system change, biogeochemical flows (in terms of phosphorus and nitrogen
cycles), and freshwater use (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref></xref>). The average reduction in ocean acidification across
the seven processes was 72%. The phenibut process demonstrated the
greatest reduction, with a 95% decrease, due to the lower electricity
consumption and operating hours of the continuous-flow method compared
to batch processing as well as reduced benzaldehyde feedstock usage.
The ibuprofen process similarly showed a 92% reduction in ocean acidification.
In contrast, the amitriptyline hydrochloride process exhibited the
smallest reduction, at 41%, primarily due to the reduction in tetrahydrofuran
(THF) usage. Atmospheric aerosol loading, a critical environmental
category linked to human health due to fine particulate matter affecting
air quality, was significantly reduced in the phenibut and ibuprofen
processes with reductions of 95 and 90%, respectively. These reductions
were largely driven by the decreased use of trimethyl orthoformate
(TMOF) and THF. Furthermore, continuous-flow methods led to a greater
than 60% reduction in the phosphorus cycle impacts for five of the
seven processes. In the case of the nitrogen cycle, the phenibut process
exhibited an impressive 98% reduction, largely due to decreased nitromethane
and toluene usage, highlighting the efficiency of the continuous-flow
technique and its lower solvent requirements. The impacts on genetic
biosphere integrity, which are related to the carcinogenic effects
of chemicals on the ecosystem, were also investigated. The ibuprofen
process achieved a 98% reduction in this category, primarily due to
a substantial decrease in the use of isobutylbenzene (1.12 to 0.21
g) per gram of product.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>Integrated planetary analysis for the seven

of environmental
impacts across the aforementioned 18 categories and enabled an in-depth
examination of component-specific contributions and facilitated the
identification of critical environmental hotspots. To build upon these
outcomes and to offer an alternative perspective, both batch and flow
techniques for the seven different API manufacturing processes were
assessed via an Endpoint method. The Endpoint method consolidated
the Midpoint impacts into three higher-level damage categories such
as human health, ecosystem quality, and resource scarcity. By combining
the precise Midpoint results with the aggregated Endpoint outcomes,
we provide a robust and comprehensive assessment of the environmental
performance of the seven processes capturing both detailed category-specific
impacts and their broader environmental effects. The implementation
of the continuous-flow method resulted in an average reduction of
74% across the seven processes based on the average outcomes observed
in the respective categories of the Endpoint method (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssuschemeng.4c09289/suppl_file/sc4c09289_si_001.pdf">Tables S22&#x02013;23, S30&#x02013;31, S38&#x02013;39, S46&#x02013;47, S54&#x02013;55, S62&#x02013;63, S72&#x02013;75</ext-link>, Supporting Information).
In addition, among the seven processes evaluated, the ibuprofen, phenibut,
and tamoxifen processes demonstrated the most substantial reductions
in damage categories, achieving average decreases of 95, 93, and 89%,
respectively. In contrast, the amitriptyline process exhibited the
lowest performance, with an average reduction of 43%. Based on the
in-depth evaluation of the Endpoint method, it was observed that the
Endpoint results demonstrated a consistent alignment with the trends
observed in the Midpoint method analysis. Overall, this study highlighted
once more the effectiveness of continuous-flow methods in enhancing
the environmental performance across multiple dimensions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3"><label>3</label><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, we carried out a thorough

effects were also studied through nine planetary

the need to focus also on optimizing solvent management and operating
conditions to fully exploit the potential of the flow microreactor
technology. Currently, these aspects are not being maximized, leading
to inefficiencies and missed opportunities for improving sustainability
and cost-effectiveness. Overall, our results can empower the pharmaceutical
industry to make informed decisions regarding the adoption of continuous
methods and could influence policy development by emphasizing the
economic and environmental benefits of adopting more sustainable manufacturing
