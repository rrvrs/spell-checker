This study aimed to identify the difficulties faced by specialists in the diagnosis and management of rare diseases, as well as to gather their recommendations for potential solutions. An expert committee specializing in inborn metabolic disease and genetics developed a comprehensive survey, which was then distributed online to professionals working with rare diseases. A total of 21 specialists actively engaged in the management of rare diseases participated in the survey. All participants acknowledged the substanstial significant diagnostic challenges associated with rare diseases, with 86% indicating that these diagnostic challenges negatively affect their clinical practice. The primary obstacles encountered in the diagnosis and follow-up of rare diseases were low awareness, a lack of a multidisciplinary approach, insufficient numbers of specialists and inadequate infrastructure, limited newborn screening programs, challenges in accessing treatment, and insufficient psychosocial support. All participants emphasized the need for a multidisciplinary approach in the management of rare diseases. Proposed solutions included enhanced training for healthcare professionals, the establishment of multidisciplinary teams and diagnostic algorithms, the regular convening of councils and meetings, and the establishment of robust registries. While all participants rated their own clinical experience as proficient in diagnosing and treating rare diseases, the establishment of multidisciplinary teams was the most frequently suggested area for improvement.</p><p id="Par2">
<italic>Conclusion</italic>: Addressing the challenges in the diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring of rare diseases requires a multifaceted approach, including raising awareness, enhancing patient services, developing robust research and improving the infrastructure, establishing multidisciplinary care frameworks, and implementing preventive medicine and social policies.

Although rare individually, rare diseases affect a population size equivalent to the third largest country in the world collectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Currently, it is estimated that over 300 million people globally are living with one or more rare diseases. Seventy percent of these diseases manifest in childhood. Approximately 72% of all rare diseases are attributed to genetic causes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Non-genetic rare diseases include cancers, autoimmune diseases, congenital malformations, and toxic and infectious diseases. The high frequency of consanguineous marriages in our country increases the risk of rare diseases, resulting in an estimated 5 to 6.4 million individuals in T&#x000fc;rkiye being affected by these conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">Inadequate coverage of rare diseases in medical education limited awareness among physicians, a scarcity of specialists dedicated to these conditions, the absence of specific health policies, challenges in accessing laboratory analyses on time, and a lack of multidisciplinary evaluation can collectively contribute to significant delays in the diagnosis of rare diseases. Such diagnostic and treatment delays may result in increased mortality and morbidity. Under the leadership of the Autism, Mental Special Needs, and Rare Diseases Department within the Turkish Ministry of Health and with contributions of all invited stakeholders, the &#x0201c;2023&#x02013;2027 Rare Diseases Health Strategy Document and Action Plan&#x0201d; has been published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par9">In our country, various training programs on rare diseases are available for healthcare professionals providing valuable opportunities to assess clinicians&#x02019; experiences and needs across different disciplines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Istanbul as a major metropolitan city receives immigrants from diverse regions of Turkey and serves as a healthcare hub for patients from across the country. The Istanbul Faculty of Medicine is one of the Turkiye&#x02019;s leading centers for rare diseases, offering a multidisciplinary approach by bringing together specialists from all relevant fields. For the past 6&#x000a0;years, Istanbul University Istanbul Faculty of Medicine has organized educational meetings on Rare Disease Day to enhance awareness, address diagnostic and treatment challenges, and explore potential solutions. These meetings provide a platform where clinicians from various specialities discuss current developments, existing challenges, and strategies for managing rare diseases within their respective fields. These meetings are planned to improve the visibility of rare diseases by sharing and exchanging knowledge between clinicians, Turkish Ministry of Health officials, patients, and their families, as well as representatives from non-governmental organizations. Prior to the Rare Diseases training meeting in 2023, an online survey was conducted to identify and discuss the challenges pediatric clinicians face in diagnosing and treating rare diseases and to explore the potential solutions. The survey results, evaluated in this study, are expected to highlight the difficulties encountered in the diagnosis and treatment of rare diseases in our country and propose viable solutions. This study represents the first of its kind conducted in T&#x000fc;rkiye on this subject.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><p id="Par10">The study included 21 participants from 16 different subspecialties of pediatrics who attended the Rare Diseases Day meeting organized by Istanbul University Istanbul Faculty of Medicine in 2023. Participants were asked to provide and record their age, gender, and specialty. A Turkish-language online survey was administered to gather data on rare diseases, the challenges faced by patients with rare conditions, and potential solutions. Designed by a committee of inborn error of metabolism (IEM) experts and geneticists based on literature data and field observations, this survey consisted of both open-ended and multiple-choice questions to obtain detailed responses to specific challenges encountered in the diagnosis and treatment of rare diseases and to provide suggestions for solving these problems. In addition to multiple-choice questions, a Likert-type scale was also used for some questions (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Istanbul University Istanbul Faculty of Medicine (Ethics Committee number: 2024/1662).

Consequently, various nations have developed national strategic action plans for rare diseases. The Australian Government launched the country&#x02019;s first National Strategic Action Plan for Rare Diseases in February 2020 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Similarly, Japan, despite its rare disease policies dating back to the 1970s, only enacted new laws to aid these patients in 2014 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In our country, the &#x0201c;2023&#x02013;2027 Rare Diseases Health Strategy Document and Action Plan&#x0201d; was published in 2022 to address this pressing issue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par35">Approximately 72% of all rare diseases are attributable to genetic causes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Our study, when querying departments about the rare diseases they most frequently encounter, revealed that the majority were genetic diseases (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Departments frequently encountering rare diseases in daily practice (81&#x02013;100%) include medical genetics, inborn metabolic diseases, and pediatric hematology, primarily dealing with genetically induced diseases and cancers. In November&#x02013;December 2019, the Economist Intelligence Unit conducted a survey among 503 healthcare workers across five Asia&#x02013;Pacific countries to assess their understanding of rare diseases and identify challenges within national healthcare systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Remarkably, 14% of healthcare professionals surveyed (including 10% of specialists) reported never having seen a patient with a rare disease in their careers. Contrastingly, all participants in our survey had encountered a patient with a rare disease, though it should be noted that our sample size was smaller and all participants were affiliated with a university hospital.</p><p id="Par36">In our study, all participants acknowledged the difficulty of diagnosing rare diseases, with 90% indicating that this challenge significantly impacted their daily practice. This finding aligns with the Economist Intelligence Unit survey, where participants also identified diagnostic difficulty as the primary issue in rare diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par37">In Europe, registration systems for rare diseases have been established for various purposes, including defining the natural history and phenotypic diversity of rare diseases, improving treatment indications, devising risk stratification strategies, and developing disease-specific guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Consistently, 85% of our participants advocated for a distinct registration system for rare diseases.</p><p id="Par38">The importance of a multidisciplinary approach in the diagnosis and management of rare diseases is well-recognized. In 2015, UD-PrOZA (Program for Undiagnosed Rare Diseases) was founded at the Ghent University Hospital in Belgium to facilitate the diagnostic process for adult patients with undiagnosed rare diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. This multidisciplinary initiative resulted in definitive diagnoses for 18% of patients. In various countries, similar single-center or multi-center multidisciplinary teams have been established, achieving a definitive diagnosis rate of up to 67% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Our survey results align with these findings, with all participants advocating for a multidisciplinary approach in the management of rare diseases. However, the majority acknowledged significant challenges in translating this approach into routine clinical practice. Key criteria for the successful implementation of multidisciplinary teams include the formal establishment of the team, regular joint meetings, and the integration of joint outpatient clinic services.</p><p id="Par39">Diagnosing rare diseases presents major challenges due to their low prevalence, heterogeneous clinical manifestations, and often limited awareness within the medical community. A multidisciplinary approach significantly improves diagnostic accuracy by harnessing a wide array of specialized expertise and advanced diagnostic methodologies. This model facilitates comprehensive patient evaluation through holistic assessments and regular interdisciplinary case discussions, enabling the development of personalized treatment plans tailored to the specific needs of each patient. Moreover, early and precise diagnoses, supported by continuous monitoring, contribute to better patient outcomes. In addition to improving clinical care, a multidisciplinary approach fosters advancements in medical knowledge through collaborations with research institutions and enhances education and awareness, within the medical community. It also provides critical support to patients and their families by offering genetic counseling and comprehensive psychosocial services. This collaborative framework ensures that patients with rare diseases receive optimal care while deepening the overall understanding and management of these complex conditions.</p><p id="Par40">Beyond the absence of a multidisciplinary approach, other substantial challenges in diagnosing rare diseases include limited awareness and a shortage of experienced, specialized healthcare professionals. These interconnected issues highlight the critical need for a comprehensive strategy aimed at improving the diagnosis and management of rare diseases. Such a strategy should encompass raising awareness among both healthcare providers and the general public, strengthening infrastructure, to support rare disease diagnosis and care, enhancing the training and expertise of medical professionals, and establishing robust support systems for patients and families. Awareness training was among the solutions proposed by participants to improve rare disease diagnosis and treatment. For example, at the Necker-Cochin Faculty of Medicine in Paris, all third-year medical students are offered an optional 30-h training course in rare diseases, supplementing routine genetics training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Elliot et al. suggested that similar courses could be implemented in Australia to aid general practitioners and other clinicians in the early diagnosis and management of rare diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p id="Par41">The capability of our clinic to accurately diagnose rare diseases and administer appropriate treatment was evaluated positively, with 50% rating it as good and 50% as very good, attributable to the clinic&#x02019;s inherent advantages (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). However, it is acknowledged that patients with rare diseases in rural areas of our country have a much lower chance of receiving timely diagnosis and treatment.</p><p id="Par42">This study aimed to highlight the challenges and solutions experienced by experts dealing with rare diseases at a university hospital in T&#x000fc;rkiye. Our study is the first of its kind conducted in T&#x000fc;rkiye, and the expert opinions on the problems and potential solutions for rare disease patients in our country will contribute to the literature and inspire further studies with larger participant groups.</p><p id="Par43">In conclusion, this study highlights significant challenges and potential solutions for the diagnosis and treatment of rare diseases in the clinical practice. It is the first study of its kind in our country, where a wide range of rare diseases are observed. Despite advances in medical technology, the most critical barriers to diagnosing, treating, and monitoring rare diseases remain inadequate laboratory infrastructure and low awareness among healthcare professionals. Addressing these challenges requires a multifaceted approach, including increasing awareness of rare diseases, enhancing medical training, strengthening R&#x00026;D and production capacities, fostering multidisciplinary collaboration, and implementing preventive healthcare and supportive social policies.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>WHO</term><def><p id="Par3">World Health Organization</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IEM</term><def><p id="Par4">Inborn error of metabolism</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>R&#x00026;D</term><def><p id="Par5">Research and development</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>UD-PrOZA</term><def><p id="Par6">Program for Undiagnosed Rare Diseases</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher's Note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We extend our sincere gratitute to the expert participants for their invaluable contributions, sharing their experiences, and for their unwavering support and collaboration throughout this study.</p></ack><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>Gulden Fatma GOKCAY, Mubeccel DEMIRKOL and Fatmahan ATALAR conceptualized and designed the study and critically revised the manuscript.
