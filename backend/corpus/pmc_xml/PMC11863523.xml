Despite being labelled &#x02018;rare&#x02019;, they encompass over 220 tumour types and collectively account for one in five cancer diagnoses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Some examples of tumour types considered rare are head and neck cancers, sarcomas and neuroendocrine cancers. Patients with rare cancers often face a more challenging illness trajectory than those with common cancers, including delays in diagnosis, incorrect treatments, and limited access to clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Furthermore, the 5-year survival rate for individuals with rare cancers is significantly lower at 52%, compared to 69% for those with common cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In a recent systematic review, it was reported that patients with a rare cancer experience various adverse psychosocial outcomes following diagnosis, including depression, anxiety, suicidality, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Also, patients with a rare cancer were reported to have a higher risk of PTSD and suicidality compared to those with common cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">In addition to the significant challenges patients with a rare cancer face following their diagnosis, patients living in rural, regional or remote areas also struggle to access clinical, psychological, and informational support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Recent data suggest that cancer patients residing far from metropolitan centres are at a higher risk of dying within five years of diagnosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Similar to patients with a rare cancer, rural cancer patients encounter numerous obstacles when accessing care, including limited availability of treatments and support services, transportation barriers, financial difficulties, and restricted access to clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Qualitative research suggests that many unique psychosocial needs of rural cancer patients remain unmet, particularly in the domains of financial help, travel support, information needs, accessing care and connection with others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">One approach frequently used to address psychosocial needs of cancer patients is provision of peer support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Peer support is defined as &#x02018;a system of giving and receiving help founded on key principles of respect, shared responsibility, and an agreement of what is helpful&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] (p. 6). A peer, in this context, is defined as &#x02018;an equal, someone with whom one shares demographic or social similarities&#x02019;, and support refers to &#x02018;the kind of deeply felt empathy, encouragement and assistance that people with shared experiences can offer one another within a reciprocal relationship&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] (p. 1). Peer support can take many forms including structured or unstructured approaches; group or individual services; in-person or telehealth meetings; and can occur with a range of frequencies, with individual sessions varying in duration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Peer support may be led by either trained professionals or peers themselves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], often those who share a diagnosis with the person being supported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">Peer support for cancer patients has many benefits. Patients often seek emotional insights and advice on coping from those who have had similar experiences, thereby enhancing their preparedness and emotional resilience [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Peer support groups provide structured platforms for individuals to share experiences and offer mutual emotional support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. This approach is rooted in patient and community empowerment and complements traditional psychosocial care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], which is paramount in the context of rural residents who may struggle to access healthcare required. Participation in these groups can combat isolation, provide access to diverse coping strategies, and empower individuals through shared experiences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Although the benefits of peer support for cancer patients are clear, challenges, such as navigating emotions and discerning the reliability of information, underscore the need for structured, quality peer support integrated into broader cancer care initiatives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p id="Par9">Despite the unique psychosocial needs of patients with a rare cancer living in rural, regional and remote areas, and despite the proven benefits of peer support for cancer patients, existing peer support services tend not to reach underserved communities including those diagnosed with a rare cancer living in rural regional or remote areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The present study therefore aimed to explore the characteristics of peer support programs for patients with a rare cancer living in rural, regional or remote areas. Specifically, the research questions addressed were: (1) &#x02018;what do patients with a rare cancer living in rural, regional or remote areas and stakeholders want from a peer support program?&#x02019; and (2) &#x02018;what are the perceptions of healthcare providers about the feasibility of achieving such a peer support program?&#x02019;</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Participants and recruitment</title><p id="Par10">Two groups of participants were recruited: people with rare cancer living in rural, regional or remote areas and those providing services to this group (healthcare providers). Although the primary focus was on gathering insights from those who would ultimately benefit from a peer support service, the perspectives of relevant healthcare providers (e.g., medical specialists and supportive care workers working with this patient group) were also considered valuable to identify potential feasibility and implementation challenges of any peer support service proposed for operation within the existing health system. Sample size was determined using information power, a concept based not on numerical size alone, but on the richness and relevance of the data in addressing the research question. Information power is influenced by several factors including the specificity of the sample, the study aims, the strength of the theoretical framework, the quality of dialogue and the chosen analytical strategy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Given the study&#x02019;s focused objectives and targeted participant group, the sample size was deemed sufficient to generate meaningful insights.</p><sec id="Sec4"><title>People with rare cancer</title><p id="Par11">People with rare cancer were eligible for inclusion if they: (i) had been diagnosed with a rare tumour type in the past 5 years, (ii) lived in a rural, regional or remote location (areas defined using the Modified Monash Model as regional centres, small, medium &#x00026; large rural towns, remote communities and very remote communities), (iii) were aged 18 years or over, (iv) were comfortable with the English language, and (v) did not self-identify as having a serious psychiatric illness. People with rare cancer were recruited with the help of partner organisation Rare Cancers Australia (RCA). RCA is the largest patient platform in Australia, connecting with roughly 85 patients with a rare cancer a month. RCA assisted with recruitment by contacting potentially eligible participants through: (i) a database of registered users, and (ii) official RCA social media channels. Interested participants were asked to contact the research team, from whom they were directed to an online questionnaire which included a participant information sheet, eligibility questions, a consent form and demographic questionnaire. Purposive maximum variation sampling was used to recruit participants that varied on the key dimensions of age and gender.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Healthcare providers</title><p id="Par12">Participants were eligible for inclusion if they: (i) had worked with at least one rare cancer patient, in a rural regional or remote setting, in the past 5 years, and (ii) were comfortable communicating in the English language. These participants were recruited via existing networks of both the research team, and the advisory group for the project. Potential participants were invited to complete an online questionnaire which included a participant information sheet, eligibility questions, consent form and demographic questionnaire. Purposive maximum variation sampling was used to recruit participants that varied by age, gender and job title.

Both focus groups and interviews were conducted online using teleconferencing software Zoom and were led by LH. Focus groups and interviews were audio recorded using Zoom functions and were transcribed verbatim. The transcription was de-identified, and each statement was assigned a unique number due to the large number of participants and the inability to determine individual speakers from the audio recording. Focus groups and interviews followed a semi-structured format with questions focussing on participants&#x02019; prior experience with peer support, as well as key points for inclusion in a future peer support service (see Appendix <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">A</xref> for the topic guide).

Next, initial codes were generated systematically across the entire dataset, organising data into meaningful groups. In the third step, themes were searched for by collating codes into potential themes and gathering all relevant data for each potential theme. In the fourth step, these themes were reviewed as a team, checking if they worked in relation to the coded extracts and the entire dataset, generating a thematic map of the analysis. The themes were then defined and named, refining the specifics of each theme and the overall story the analysis tells, ensuring clear definitions and names for each theme.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>Sample characteristics</title><sec id="Sec12"><title>People with rare cancer</title><p id="Par17">A total of 39 people with rare cancer were recruited (see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> for participant characteristics).

Five themes related to the <bold>who</bold>, <bold>what</bold>, <bold>how</bold>, <bold>where</bold> and <bold>when</bold> of peer support. Taken together, these themes described a hypothetical &#x02018;ideal&#x02019; peer support service for patients with a rare cancer living in rural, regional and remote Australia as perceived by both people with a rare cancer and healthcare providers. In one additional theme, the practical <bold>challenges</bold> associated with delivering such a service were identified. Each theme is discussed in more detail below.</p><sec id="Sec15"><title>Who is a peer?</title><p id="Par22">Participants engaged in rich debate about exactly who was considered a peer in the context of patients with a rare cancer living in rural, regional and remote areas. Some participants felt that having the same, or a similar diagnosis, was important because these individuals were likely to have had a similar experience and be relatable. Others felt that the specific diagnosis was not important, but that a peer should have a diagnosis that falls under the umbrella of a rare cancer diagnosis. This was because participants recognised the more difficult trajectory faced by a rare cancer patient and indicated that hearing from somebody with any rare cancer diagnosis would be useful. Experience with similar forms of treatment was also described as defining a peer. Healthcare providers added that grouping people with similar diagnoses or treatment pathways could help to prevent people experiencing unrealistic expectations due to differing illness trajectories and treatment options.<disp-quote><p id="Par23"><italic>&#x0201c;So if you have someone that goes to the same treatment</italic>,<italic> you tend [to] listen to whatever they&#x02019;re gonna say to you</italic>,<italic> because you guys share the same diagnosis.&#x0201d; (Patient 23</italic>,<italic> Focus group 4)</italic>.</p><p id="Par24"><italic>&#x0201c;I just think it would be beneficial</italic>,<italic> with peer support to have people of similar cancers or similar treatment pathways. I think that&#x02019;s where some of the confusion lies is when they go</italic>,<italic> oh yes</italic>,<italic> but I spoke to somebody that had this certain type of cancer and they&#x02019;re fine now and XYZ and then it looks different for them&#x02026;&#x0201d; (Healthcare provider 9</italic>,<italic> Female</italic>,<italic> 30</italic>,<italic> Care coordinator)</italic>.</p></disp-quote></p><p id="Par25">Participants (both patients and healthcare providers) also described the phase of illness as relevant to finding the right cohort. Most participants wanted a person to support them who was further along in their cancer journey, so that they could advise them of what lies ahead, and even encourage a sense of hope and reassurance.<disp-quote><p id="Par26"><italic>&#x0201c;&#x02026;Because I need the experience. I need their treatment advice. I would also need a survivorship (sic.) in the group. That will help me and give me hope.

For instance, some participants felt that it was important that a peer was the same gender, age or culture. Others wanted to connect with peers who had children, or with peers that had similar interests to them.</p><p id="Par28">
<disp-quote><p id="Par29"><italic>&#x0201c;&#x02026; people generally wish to connect on one of two things</italic>,<italic> they want to speak with someone who&#x02019;s had a&#x02026;similar diagnosis and treatment. Or they might say I&#x02026; just want to speak with someone who had kids in primary school. So</italic>,<italic> I might [ask]&#x02026;whether they think it might be more helpful to speak with someone who&#x02019;s been through something clinically quite similar or socially similar.&#x0201d; (Healthcare provider 8</italic>,<italic> Female</italic>,<italic> 32</italic>,<italic> Supportive care worker)</italic>.</p></disp-quote>

</p><p id="Par32">All participants acknowledged that forming a meaningful connection with peers could be challenging and could not be predicted based on demographic factors or life experiences alone. Participants instead often spoke about the traits they perceived as being important in a supportive peer. These were characteristics that transcended all life experiences, whether clinical or social. Traits included empathy, sympathy, being understanding, being able to navigate support, cultural sensitivity and the ability to create a safe and comfortable environment.</p><p id="Par33">

</p><p id="Par37">As well as discussing <bold>who</bold> they would consider to be a suitable peer, patients spoke about the reciprocal nature of peer support, and spoke about the experience of, or desire to, <italic>provide</italic> peer support to others. Patient participants spoke about wanting to provide peer support for altruistic reasons, highlighting that they wanted to give the support to others that they had needed and received themselves throughout their journey.<disp-quote><p id="Par38"><italic>&#x0201c;So</italic>,<italic> I think</italic>,<italic> sometimes it can be very</italic>,<italic> very good for people and I think I was giving a lot back because I&#x02019;ve been through a lot more treatment probably than a lot of my current peer groups that I know about in the Australian groups at least.

They frequently spoke about ensuring boundaries were put in place, acknowledging that it can take time for an individual to be in a place where they are ready to support another, and that this was a fluctuating headspace.<disp-quote><p id="Par40"><italic>&#x0201c;You have to find a way to match people with where they&#x02019;re at in their journey. I&#x02019;m more able to talk about it now. I couldn&#x02019;t say the C word for about a year. And maybe sort of at the 6-month to 18-month mark I wouldn&#x02019;t have been able to talk to other people about it.

Participants suggested that the most important aspect of a peer support program was providing an opportunity to learn through experiential knowledge obtained from others. People with a rare cancer and healthcare providers alike acknowledged that peer support allows patients to learn &#x02018;tips and tricks&#x02019; from those who have been through this journey, with these tips generally not available to them from clinicians. Specifically, participants wanted to learn strategies for dealing with medication or treatment side effects, practical solutions to problems such as debt and travelling to appointments and how to deal with family and friends.</p><p id="Par42">

</p><p id="Par44">
<disp-quote><p id="Par45"><italic>&#x0201c;I think you find also that peer support is where you get some very practical advice that health professionals don&#x02019;t necessarily always have as easily.

</p><p id="Par46">Partnered with this experiential knowledge, patient participants also wanted to receive more information about their diagnosis, treatment options and their cancer journey. Though participants favoured the delivery of this information in a peer support setting, they wanted this information to come from a trained healthcare professional as opposed to the experiential knowledge imparted by peers.<disp-quote><p id="Par47"><italic>&#x0201c;And then</italic>,<italic> once a week</italic>,<italic> sometimes once in 2 weeks</italic>,<italic> the group is led by a medical doctor and they always give advice on how to manage our cancer&#x02026; Mostly it&#x02019;s about the emotion</italic>,<italic> how to open your emotions</italic>,<italic> your feelings. And secondly is like a reminder how to take your medications and what you need to do medically to keep fit.&#x0201d; (Patient 6</italic>,<italic> Focus group 2)</italic>.</p></disp-quote></p><p id="Par48">Alongside seeking information and tips, patient participants expressed a strong need for emotional support from a peer support program. One of the main functions of a peer support program was described as facilitating relationships with others. This need was described as particularly important for people with a rare cancer, who often lacked opportunities for unplanned interactions due to their unique treatment regimens. Participants wanted a space where they could share their troubles and receive emotional support from others who had undergone similar experiences. Knowing that others had faced similar challenges was described as comforting.</p><p id="Par49">

</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>How should peer support be delivered?</title><p id="Par55">There was little consensus on the delivery format for peer support, both within participant groups (patients and healthcare providers) and across participant groups. Participants had mixed views on whether peer support should be delivered in a group setting or on an individual basis. Group settings were noted to open patients up to a diverse array of experiences, which was described as beneficial. Group settings also meant that the emphasis went beyond talking to listening, and this appealed to many. Conversely, participants reported that individual settings might encourage more open communication because of less concern about anonymity and privacy and this, in turn, could lead to greater rapport than in a group setting.<disp-quote><p id="Par56"><italic>&#x0201c;&#x02026;I prefer the group. Because [in] the group we have people with diverse information</italic>,<italic> diverse history</italic>,<italic> diverse professions when it comes to cancer management and treatment&#x02026; if you have [an] individual</italic>,<italic> it&#x02019;s not going to give you a wider knowledge&#x02026; There must be variation</italic>,<italic> so I prefer groups.&#x0201d; (Patient 8</italic>,<italic> Focus group 2)</italic>.</p><p id="Par57"><italic>&#x0201c;I think with rare cancers</italic>,<italic> I think one-to-one is probably preferable as it is</italic>,<italic> perhaps</italic>,<italic> just that ability to really ask more in-depth questions of someone. And to establish rapport over time</italic>,<italic> people might find that helpful.&#x0201d; (Healthcare provider 8</italic>,<italic> Female</italic>,<italic> 32</italic>,<italic> Supportive care worker)</italic>.</p></disp-quote></p><p id="Par58">There were mixed views on whether peer support groups should be structured or unstructured. The main benefit of structured sessions was that they encouraged participation from everyone. However, participants noted that unstructured sessions gave patients a greater sense of power and control, allowing for more free-flowing and natural conversations.<disp-quote><p id="Par59"><italic>&#x0201c;I think you need a little bit of structure</italic>,<italic> otherwise people won&#x02019;t go.

Preferences for frequency of peer support ranged from weekly to quarterly, and preferences for length of the intervention ranged from three sessions to ongoing.<disp-quote><p id="Par63"><italic>&#x0201c;It really depends on the day and week or your mood</italic>,<italic> or just where you&#x02019;re at basically.

However, there was disagreement about who was best placed to moderate these sessions. Although some suggested that it was important that healthcare professionals lead groups, believing their clinical expertise could prevent the spread of misinformation, others contended it would be more appropriate for a patient to lead the group, notwithstanding the sustainability challenge of this approach. A third suggestion was that carers might be well placed to lead peer support groups. Regardless of the facilitator&#x02019;s identity, participants strongly advocated facilitator training, particularly because of the need for sensitivity in many of the topics covered.<disp-quote><p id="Par65"><italic>&#x0201c;I think that moderation is so important and particularly when people are early diagnosed&#x02026; to have a bit of a sanity checking aspect&#x02026; guardrails&#x02026;when people are very vulnerable&#x02026; you do need someone to stop people [talking]&#x02026; about the final stages of your relatives&#x02019; death&#x02026;.

Participants acknowledged that peer support could offer them different things at different stages, and that needs and wants were not static. Therefore, a flexible model of delivery that suited different styles of communication was viewed as desirable.<disp-quote><p id="Par67"><italic>&#x0201c;Mixed kind of modes of [delivery]&#x02026;depending how you feel</italic>,<italic> but also mix[ed]&#x02026;conversations&#x02026;sometimes you don&#x02019;t even want to talk about cancer you just wanna be in a safe space with people who are having a crappy day just like you.

In fact, participants spoke of peer support as being like a &#x02018;family&#x02019; or a &#x02018;home away from home&#x02019;.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Where should peer support take place?</title><p id="Par69">There were mixed opinions on whether peer support should take place online, over the telephone, in person or a combination of all three. Many participants (both patients and healthcare providers) acknowledged that although their preference would be for an in-person peer support service, for pragmatic reasons, for instance the broad geographic diversity of rural patients, and the infrequent prevalence of rare cancers, online or telephone delivery was probably more appropriate.<disp-quote><p id="Par70"><italic>&#x0201c;Preferably</italic>,<italic> in person face to face</italic>,<italic> but I think for a rare cancer in rural setting</italic>,<italic> you&#x02019;re not gonna do that.

These benefits were felt keenly during the pandemic, when patients with a rare cancer were extremely isolated due to social distancing requirements. Participants also spoke about generally preferred methods of communication.<disp-quote><p id="Par72"><italic>&#x0201c;So there needs to be some sort of virtual and online element to that.

</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>When do people want to receive peer support?</title><p id="Par76">Both patient and healthcare provider participants believed that peer support would be beneficial at all stages, including pre-diagnosis, diagnosis, treatment, post-treatment, and advanced palliative care. They particularly recognised the emotional toll of receiving a cancer diagnosis, especially a rare one, highlighting the need for peer support during this time.

However, participants also identified several challenges to delivering such a service. One of the most common issues raised by both patients and healthcare providers was the possibility of misinformation being shared in a peer support group. Participants were particularly concerned about being told about treatments that were outdated or not based on scientific evidence. These participants strongly advocated for peer support sessions to be moderated by a trained medical professional to minimise the amount of misinformation shared.</p><p id="Par84">
<disp-quote><p id="Par85"><italic>&#x0201c;&#x02026;a lot of the information that is peddled on internet forums or peer groups should be taken with a grain of salt because it often lacks scientific rigour.

</p><p id="Par86">Participants also expressed concerns about being exposed to others&#x02019; &#x02018;horror stories&#x02019;. More broadly, participants were worried about the emotional impact of hearing others&#x02019; cancer journeys, and whether this would help or hinder their own emotional state. Healthcare providers emphasised the importance of follow-up care with patients who become distressed as a result of peer interactions.<disp-quote><p id="Par87"><italic>&#x0201c;I don&#x02019;t bring up the horror stories.

For example, many online peer support groups are worldwide, and so patients might get their hopes up about a treatment that is not available in their place of residence.<disp-quote><p id="Par90"><italic>&#x0201c;A lot of people in this group have done treatment of other sorts overseas and when I&#x02019;ve looked at what Australia&#x02019;s got in comparison to the same treatment</italic>,<italic> there&#x02019;s only just like one centre</italic>,<italic> for instance</italic>,<italic> that&#x02019;s just being built in South Australia but they won&#x02019;t be taking any patients in for 18 months.&#x0201d; (Patient 30</italic>,<italic> Focus group 5)</italic>.</p></disp-quote></p><p id="Par91">Patient and healthcare provider participants also described a range of interpersonal problems that could arise, particularly in group settings. For instance, some raised the possibility that social dynamics within the group might make some individuals feel uncomfortable, and others might lack confidence when speaking in a group setting. Even one-on-one support could lead to problems, specifically an over-reliance on the peer support worker. Participants also described concern about losing group members to cancer, which could ultimately make them feel worse.<disp-quote><p id="Par92"><italic>&#x0201c;Sometimes I feel like there is this feeling of exclusion [when]&#x02026; other people are actually talking about a certain situation whereby you don&#x02019;t have any experience about or maybe this discussion has been going on for a very long time&#x02026;you start feeling like you don&#x02019;t really have any better business in the space.&#x0201d; (Patient 19</italic>,<italic> Focus group 3)</italic>.</p><p id="Par93"><italic>&#x0201c;The other risk is loss&#x02026;we&#x02019;re gonna lose people because that&#x02019;s the community that we&#x02019;re in.

Specifically, participants showed some scepticism about the level of interest in participating in an intervention like this, noting that due to the rarity of the disease, it could be difficult to engage people with a rare cancer in such an intervention. Moreover, it was noted that those living in rural, regional and remote locations are less likely to seek support, and this again may inhibit uptake to such an intervention. More broadly than this, participants acknowledged that peer support simply &#x02018;isn&#x02019;t for everyone&#x02019;, and that cancer patients are often very preoccupied with other medical appointments and this may mean they have little interest in a peer support program.<disp-quote><p id="Par95"><italic>&#x0201c;So</italic>,<italic> for some they really like [peer support] and others they don&#x02019;t have the time or the energy&#x02026;&#x0201d; (Healthcare provider 1</italic>,<italic> Female</italic>,<italic> Age not reported</italic>,<italic> Care coordinator)</italic>.</p></disp-quote></p><p id="Par96">Both people with a rare cancer and healthcare providers had concerns around the feasibility of delivering peer support.

</p><p id="Par100">Participants highlighted various factors important in defining a peer, including diagnosis, treatment, demographic similarity, and shared life experience. This aligns with existing literature, in which peers are defined as &#x02018;an equal, someone with whom one shares demographic or social similarities&#x02019; and peer support is described as &#x02018;understanding another&#x02019;s situation empathically through the shared experience of emotional and psychological pain.&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] (p. 1). Previous research has also indicated that cancer patients prioritise a shared cancer diagnosis when identifying peers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. However, in the present study a number of participants indicated that simply sharing a diagnosis did not automatically make someone a peer. This suggests that identifying peers who might support a rare cancer survivor requires a more tailored, patient-centred approach and that further research could explore the variables that define peer status and how these vary between people and across time. Consistent with previous definitions of peers in the literature, participants in our study emphasised the importance of reciprocity in peer support, valuing both the opportunity to give and receive support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p id="Par101">Participants discussed peer support as a valuable source of education and learning, highlighting the unique ability of peers to foster experiential learning. This aligns with previous studies conducted with patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], and is recognised as a key component of peer support more broadly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Participants suggested that the need for information was likely to be more acute for patients with a rare cancer than for more common cancer patients because of the lack of information and resources available for most rare cancer survivors. Indeed, in previous research, it has been confirmed that the most frequently reported unmet needs for patients with a rare cancer fall within the information domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. This suggests that peer support programs should consider including the provision of information, beyond that provided through peers sharing their experiences. Beyond seeking information, both patients and healthcare providers acknowledged that peer support can provide emotional support and connection with others. This finding is consistent with previous research on patients in the cancer field [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] and aligns with broader models of peer support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], highlighting the need for peer support models to emphasise the importance of social connection and emotional support.</p><p id="Par102">Participants expressed a clear preference for a flexible, multi-modal approach to the delivery of peer support, with this including both online and offline options, synchronous and asynchronous methods, and individual and group settings. These preferences align with previous typologies of peer support for cancer patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] and research showing patient satisfaction with complex, multicomponent psychosocial interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Participants cited both practical and personal reasons for desiring a combination of modalities. For example, rural participants emphasised the importance of online support for accessibility, while also appreciating benefits like anonymity. Previous research supports these findings, showing that rural cancer survivors value digital technology approaches to their care, especially telemedicine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Future peer support should therefore aim to offer a flexible, multi-modal program and further research should explore the efficacy of individual components of such a complex intervention.</p><p id="Par103">Participants argued that peer support is useful at all stages of a cancer journey, supporting guidelines that indicate that psychosocial care should be available from initial diagnosis, through treatment, and into survival and palliative care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Participants suggested that the time of diagnosis was a particularly difficult time for patients with a rare cancer, who did not have access to good information about their prognosis. Peer support was therefore deemed to be particularly helpful at this phase of illness, and suggests a need for healthcare practitioners to signpost newly diagnosed patients, or patients who are struggling to receive a diagnosis, to peer support services. This is supported by previous research which found that patients chose when and how to engage with peer support, with treatment decision points deemed a particularly salient time for engaging with peer support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p><p id="Par104">Participants also discussed the challenges of peer support. Both healthcare providers and people with rare cancer expressed concerns about exposure to misinformation, the emotional impact of hearing others&#x02019; cancer stories (which could lead to both pessimism and unrealistic optimism), interpersonal issues, and questions about the acceptability and feasibility of peer support. These concerns are supported by a review of qualitative research, which identified challenges in cancer support groups for instance confronting the suffering of others, divergent information needs, distressing group dynamics, and difficulties related to leadership and sustainability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Future research should aim to elucidate strategies for overcoming these challenges, including through review of pre-existing peer support services.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Study strengths and limitations</title><p id="Par105">This study recruited a diverse group of participants, including patients with a rare cancer and healthcare providers, ensuring a comprehensive range of perspectives. By specifically targeting patients with a rare cancer living in rural, regional, and remote areas, it addressed the needs of a population often underrepresented and underserved in research. The use of purposive maximum variation sampling further enhanced the diversity by including participants with varied backgrounds in terms of age and gender. In particular, the study benefitted from excellent representation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, a group often under-represented in health research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. This is important given that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have both a higher incidence rate of cancer than non-Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, as well as an increased mortality rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Moreover, there is evidence emerging that the peer support model is both appropriate and beneficial for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cancer patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>].</p><p id="Par106">The study&#x02019;s collaborative recruitment approach, partnering with Rare Cancers Australia, was also a significant strength. Rare Cancer Australia&#x02019;s extensive network facilitated the recruitment of a sufficient number of participants, increasing the study&#x02019;s reach and credibility among potential participants. The use of multiple data collection methods, combining focus groups and individual interviews, allowed for flexibility and enriched the data quality. Capturing both collective and individual perspectives provided a more nuanced understanding of participants&#x02019; experiences and views.</p><p id="Par107">However, this study is not without limitations. The recruitment process relied on participants volunteering to contact the research team, thereby introducing self-selection bias. Moreover, given that participants were recruited through an existing non-government organisation supporting people with rare cancers (i.e., Rare Cancers Australia), those who chose to participate were already linked into both peer and information access support. The application of the results to the broader population of people diagnosed with rare cancer is unclear and future research should aim to collect data from people not utilising existing rare cancer support services. Furthermore, the study excluded patients who did not speak English comfortably, or who self-identified as having a serious psychiatric illness. This exclusion criterion resulted in the omission of important groups of people with rare cancer, with these people likely to experience more isolation and have even greater support needs. The observations provided by healthcare providers supporting people with a rare cancer were important contributions to the study, notwithstanding the small sample size and limited diversity. With no healthcare providers identifying as Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander and a small number of different roles represented, the data from this group might not fully capture the range of views necessary for comprehensive service implementation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par108">In this study it was confirmed that several aspects of peer support were described as important for patients with a rare cancer living in rural, regional, and remote settings. Peers provided useful access to information, a crucial need of people diagnosed with rare cancer, particularly at the diagnosis stage. Additionally, participants wanted to hear from patients further along in treatment, with this viewed as particularly important for patients with a rare cancer, who often have a limited prognosis. Practical considerations were also noted; the rural location of participants resulted in a preference for online or other remote methods of peer support delivery.</p><p id="Par109">Ultimately, healthcare providers and people with rare cancer emphasised the need for a flexible approach to the development and delivery of peer support. This included being adaptive in considering who a peer is, as well as offering complex, multicomponent and multimodal interventions that meet the varied and fluctuating needs of patients with a rare cancer living in rural, regional and remote communities. Future research should aim to build on the foundations of this study by co-designing a multimodal peer support intervention with patients with a rare cancer living in rural, regional and remote communities.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.</p><p>
