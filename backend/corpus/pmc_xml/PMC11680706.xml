To develop new strategies to improve the outcome of aggressive breast cancer patients, we studied how PARP inhibition radiosensitizes breast cancer models to proton therapy, which is a radiotherapy modality that generates more DNA damage in the tumor than standard radiotherapy using photons. Two human BRCA1-mutated breast cancer cell lines and their isogenic BRCA1-recovered pairs were treated with a PARP inhibitor and irradiated with photons or protons. Protons (9.9 and 3.85&#x000a0;keV/&#x000b5;m) induced higher cell kill independent of BRCA1 status. PARP inhibition amplified the cell kill effect to both photons and protons (9.9 and 3.85&#x000a0;keV/&#x000b5;m) independent of BRCA1 status. Numbers of &#x003b3;H2AX foci, micronuclei, and cGAS-positive micronuclei were significantly higher in BRCA1-mutated cells. Cell cycle distribution and stress-induced senescence were not affected by PARP inhibition in our cell lines. In vivo, the combination of protons (3.99&#x000a0;keV/&#x000b5;m) and PARP inhibition induced the greatest tumor growth delay and the highest survival. We found that PARP inhibition increases radiosensitization independent of BRCA1 status for both protons and photons. The combination of protons and PARP inhibition was the most effective in decreasing clonogenic cell survival, increasing DNA damage, and delaying tumor growth.</p><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1038/s41598-024-81914-w.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>DNA repair inhibitor</kwd><kwd>PARP inhibitor</kwd><kwd>Radiosensitization</kwd><kwd>Proton therapy</kwd><kwd>Radiobiology</kwd><kwd>Radiotherapy</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Breast cancer</kwd><kwd>Radiotherapy</kwd><kwd>Targeted therapies</kwd><kwd>DNA damage and repair</kwd><kwd>DNA damage response</kwd><kwd>Double-strand DNA breaks</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21CA252411</award-id><award-id>R21CA252411</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shaitelman</surname><given-names>Simona F.</given-names></name><name><surname>Sawakuchi</surname><given-names>Gabriel O.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>National Cancer Institute,United States</institution></funding-source><award-id>P01CA261669</award-id><award-id>P01CA261669</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shaitelman</surname><given-names>Simona F.</given-names></name><name><surname>Sawakuchi</surname><given-names>Gabriel O.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100019329</institution-id><institution>Emerson Collective</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007313</institution-id><institution>University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IRG</award-id><award-id>IRG</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shaitelman</surname><given-names>Simona F.</given-names></name><name><surname>Sawakuchi</surname><given-names>Gabriel O.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer Nature Limited 2024</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par9">Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs) are a family of proteins involved in several cellular processes. PARP1 is the most important member of the PARP family because of its involvement in DNA damage response (DDR) and DNA repair. The catalytic activity of PARP1 results in the recruitment of several proteins involved in DDR. PARP1 is actively involved in base excision repair, which repairs base damage and single-strand break (SSB) lesions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. PARP1 is also involved in sensing double-strand break (DSB) lesions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. In homologous recombination (HR), it helps to recruit BRCA1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. However, PARP1 has also been implicated in reducing HR by PARylation of BRCA1, which stabilizes BRCA1&#x02019;s interaction with receptor-associated protein 80 (RAP80), limiting its function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. It is likely that PARP1 helps to &#x0201c;fine-tune&#x0201d; the level of HR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. PARP1 also has roles in non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), where it promotes the kinase activity of the DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. PARP1 has also been linked to alternative-NHEJ repair<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. PARP1 is best known for its clinical relevance in BRCA1-mutant cancers. The loss of functional BRCA1 leads to a synthetic lethal relationship with PARP1 inhibition. The mechanistic basis for this relationship is thought to lie in the accumulation of SSB lesions and base damage that ordinarily would be repaired by PARP1 activity. During replication, these lesions become DSB lesions that generally do not create suitable substrates for NHEJ machinery and therefore require HR and functional BRCA1 activity to maintain cell viability.</p><p id="Par10">PARP inhibition has been used as monotherapy in the treatment of BRCA1- or BRCA2-mutant breast cancers. Several studies have shown that BRCA1-mutated breast cancer cells are more sensitive to the cytotoxic effect of PARP inhibition than those that are BRCA1-intact<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Clinically, PARP inhibitors have improved outcomes compared with conventional therapy for both advanced and early-stage BRCA1/2-mutated breast cancer as well as ovarian and prostate cancers by extending disease-free and overall survival<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Several PARP inhibitors have been approved by both the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency to treat patients with BRCA1/2-deficient ovarian, breast, and castration-resistant prostate cancers. Of note, most of the current clinical approved PARP inhibitors also inhibit PARP2. Despite the observed improvement in outcomes from PARP inhibitors, up to 40% of patients with BRCA1/2-mutant cancers either do not respond initially to PARP inhibition or develop resistance to it<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Combinations of PARP inhibition with other agents have been proposed to overcome resistance in such patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. The diverse role of PARP1 in DDR and DNA repair has raised interest in combining PARP inhibitors with other DNA-damaging therapies for patients who do not carry BRCA1/2 mutations. Radiotherapy is a particularly relevant option, because recent advancements in radiation delivery now allow the administration of high radiation doses to the tumor with relatively low doses to adjacent normal tissues, which may maximize the effect of PARP inhibition in the tumor while minimizing toxicity in normal tissue. Another advancement in radiotherapy has been the development of new treatment modalities such as proton therapy. In preclinical studies, protons were found to be more effective than photons for killing cancer cells because of their higher linear energy transfer (LET)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, which induces more complex and clustered DNA damage than do lower LET photons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par11">PARP inhibitors have been observed to radiosensitize lung, melanoma, pancreas, liver, prostate, and breast tumors to photon radiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. However, relatively little is known about how PARP inhibition affects cells treated with protons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Radiotherapy is also known to enhance the formation of micronuclei (MN); cytoplasmic DNA, which often occurs in the form of MN, was recently recognized as a mediator of DDR&#x02013;associated immune response through the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)-stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. This effect and others such as the induction of senescence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, which can have both tumor-suppressing and tumor-promoting effects owing to immunogenic effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, are being recognized as important responses for further improving the effectiveness of radiotherapy.</p><p id="Par12">Here we investigate PARP inhibition combined with clinical photon or proton beams in the context of BRCA1 wild-type and mutant breast cancer models.

We confirmed here that protons are more effective in killing breast cancer cells independent of BRCA1 status (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). For some of the data, the LET of 9.9&#x000a0;keV/&#x000b5;m was greater than that achieved at the middle of the spread-out Brag peak (SOBP) (2&#x02013;4&#x000a0;keV/&#x000b5;m), which probably explains why the RBE values at D<sub>10%</sub> in our study were much greater than the clinically used 1.1 value. However, we did observe an RBE at D<sub>10%</sub> of 1.17 for the 4T1 cell line for an LET of 3.85&#x000a0;keV/&#x000b5;m. BRCA1 is well known to operate in HR, where it facilitates loading RAD51 onto single-stranded DNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Defects in HR are thought to enhance sensitivity to high-LET radiation because of DNA damage clustering<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>, which NHEJ is ineffective to repair. Although the importance of HR increases with LET<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>, NHEJ remains by far the most important pathway in radiation response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. This may explain the lack of difference in RBE according to BRCA1 status.</p><p id="Par30">PARP inhibition can lead to unresolved SSB lesions and bulky adducts at single-strand damage sites because of PARP1 trapping<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. Both lesion types eventually require BRCA1-mediated HR for the cell to remain viable, which is unavailable in BRCA1-mutant cell lines, leading to cell death. PARP inhibition increased the radiosensitivity to both radiation types and generally reduced the RBE, except in HCC1937-BRCA1 cells. We believe that this finding results from a proportion of the damage induced by high-LET protons and relatively high dose for the radiosensitive HCC1937 isogenic cell lines being lethal without disrupting the DNA repair response, thereby conferring no added benefit from disruption of PARP1; however, a larger proportion of the damage induced by photons becomes lethal only if PARP1 is disrupted. Similarly, Park et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> observed unchanged RBE values of BRCA1-proficient breast cancer cell lines treated with Olaparib and protons compared to protons alone. Notably, however, even though the RBE was modestly reduced or unchanged, combining protons with PARP inhibition was the most effective treatment for cell killing, with the lowest D<sub>10%</sub> observed in all cell lines tested owing to the higher LET of protons. This is an important consideration for clinical translation when different radiation modalities are combined with a radiosensitizing agent, and for considering whether a fixed RBE is the most appropriate metric when combining protons with radiation modulators.</p><p id="Par31">In both BRCA1-mutant and wildtype cells, persistent &#x003b3;H2AX foci at 72&#x000a0;h after irradiation was significantly higher for 9.9&#x000a0;keV/&#x000b5;m protons alone compared to photons alone, indicating that proton-induced DNA damage is harder to repair, which could be due to the proton-induced DNA damage being more complex and clustered than that of photons. However, this needs to be further studied. In both BRCA1-mutant and wildtype cells, PARP inhibition (compared to DMSO) induced a non-significant increase in persistent &#x003b3;H2AX foci after photons or protons. The small increase in &#x003b3;H2AX foci after PARP inhibition could be related to the relatively high dose of 5&#x000a0;Gy used for the radiosensitive HCC1937 isogenic pair, in which a dose of 5&#x000a0;Gy may be sufficient to overwhelm the cells with DNA damage. Similarly to our data, Park et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> observed a trending of more &#x003b3;H2AX foci after combining radiation (either photons or protons) with Olaparib compared to radiation alone.</p><p id="Par32">We further explored the response to photons and 9.9&#x000a0;keV/&#x000b5;m protons by investigating cell cycle distribution. An important aspect of a cell&#x02019;s response to irradiation is temporarily halting cell cycle progression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. This allows the cells time to repair DNA damage, preventing mitotic cell death. Sensitivity arising from PARP inhibition is thought to be attributable in part to PARP1 trapping<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>, which creates lesions that prevent cell cycle progression because the DNA replication machinery cannot replicate through the chromatin-PARP1 complex. Ultimately, this can lead to stalled and eventually collapsed forks and cell death<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. Our results suggest that the reduction in G1 populations in BRCA1-mutant cells was much more pronounced with radiation regardless of PARP inhibition. Although BRCA1-restored cells showed a significant decrease in G1 populations when PARP inhibition is combined with protons compared with photons (Fig. S8). This was accompanied by an increase in cells in G2. This suggests that transition to M is blocked for a prolonged period. Protons alone led to greater G1 depletion and G2 block than photons alone, probably because of the higher LET and increased persistent DNA damage as indicated by our &#x003b3;H2AX foci data.</p><p id="Par33">A further cell cycle&#x02013;related effect is the induction of senescence. Our data supports the concept that radiation-induced DNA damage triggers senescence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. However, in our BRCA1 mutated cells, &#x003b2;-galactosidase levels are not impacted by radiation type or PARP inhibition in our cell line. We hypothesized that protons alone would induce greater levels of senescence than photons alone because the higher LET of protons would result in more unresolved DNA damage, which we observed when we examined residual &#x003b3;H2AX foci and cell cycle. This finding has been linked with permanent blockade of the G1/S transition, which is also associated with increased senescence-associated &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. Prolonged G2 arrest has also been linked with radiation-induced senescence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>, which agrees with our findings. However, the combination of PARP inhibition with radiation or radiation type (photons versus protons) seems to have no effect on senescence induction in our cell line. This is in contrast to Huart et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup> who observed that radiation combined with Olaparib could increase senescence when lower doses of the inhibitor and radiation were used. In our study, no additional senescence induction was gained from combining radiation with Olaparib. This could be because the radiation dose we used may be sufficiently high to induce senescence on its own. Also, this could be a cell line dependent effect and needs to be confirmed in other cell lines. Moreover, a BRCA1 mutation has been associated with increased cellular reactive oxygen species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>, which could predispose BRCA1-mutated cells to stress-induced damage, which could also explain the higher level of senescence in BRCA1 mutated cells. Indeed, in the absence of PARP inhibition, senescence was approximately three times higher in BRCA1-mutated cells than in BRCA1-recovered cells (Fig. S9). Radiation-induced senescence has been observed across a range of LET values<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. Interestingly, Schniewind et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup> showed that protons (3.7&#x000a0;keV/&#x000b5;m) led to lower levels of senescence compared with photons, possibly because of more cell death. This is in contrast with our data and needs to be further studied since many factors probably dictate whether a cell dies or enters senescence, including intrinsic factors like genetic abnormalities (e.g., p53 status), extrinsic factors such as radiation dose, tumor microenvironment, and modifying factors such as PARP inhibition.</p><p id="Par34">Current findings suggest that a key signaling mechanism by which immune activation is achieved after radiotherapy is through cytoplasmic DNA fragments originating from ruptured MN, which activate the cGAS-STING pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>. Our results showed that cells with mutant BRCA1 had more baseline MN than BRCA1-restored cells and that PARP inhibition alone could increase MN in BRCA1-mutant cells, probably because of the reduced HR capacity but also the increased requirement for HR owing to the unrepaired lesions induced by PARP inhibition and PARP1 trapping. We noted more cGAS-positive MN in BRCA1-mutant cells, and PARP inhibition could increase this. No differences in cGAS-positive MN were noted in BRCA1-restored cells when radiation was combined with PARP inhibition. Several factors could influence the binding of cGAS to DNA, such as the size of the DNA fragment and the presence of other proteins such as DNA repair proteins that could mask the cGAS-binding site in double-stranded DNA. Also, the lack of BRCA1 could lead to more binding sites for cGAS to bind to DNA because downstream HR proteins such as RPA and Rad51 are not recruited properly. Another consideration that may influence cGAS binding is the size of the DNA fragment, with longer DNA fragments being more effective at activating cGAS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>. This effect is probably the most influenced by radiation type, because in a cell-free system, higher-LET radiation has been shown to lead to shorter DNA fragments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>. However, we did not observe any less cGAS binding in the proton-irradiated groups relative to the photon-irradiated groups.</p><p id="Par35">Finally, using an aggressive triple negative breast cancer model that is BRCA1 wildtype, we show that protons combined with PARP inhibition significantly delayed tumor growth (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>), supporting the in vitro studies indicating that the combination of protons and PARP inhibition generates more cell kill and persistent DNA damage than photons&#x02009;+&#x02009;PARPi, photons alone or protons alone. Protons alone presented a lower effectiveness to delay tumor growth than photons alone, which is contrary to our in vitro preliminary data. This could be due to difficulties to cover the entire tumor with protons with a homogeneous proton dose because the lateral penumbra of the proton beam is much sharper than that of the photon beam, which makes it challenging to align the tumors at the beam edge while sparing their bodies. The ratio of the tumor volume on day 17 between protons&#x02009;+&#x02009;PARPi vs. protons alone (3.2&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.7, mean&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;SD) is significantly higher compared to photons&#x02009;+&#x02009;PARPi vs. photons alone (0.87&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.25, mean&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;SD), indicating that PARPi radiosensitizes protons more than photons for 4T1 tumors.</p><p id="Par36">Our studies have limitations. We used a high LET for protons (9.9&#x000a0;keV/&#x000b5;m) and a relatively high dose (5&#x000a0;Gy) for a radiosensitive cell line (HCC1937) for most of the in vitro assays. The high LET and relatively high dose for a radiosensitive cell line could have masked some of the effects of PARP inhibition. Clinically, LET regions of around 9.9&#x000a0;keV/&#x000b5;m is only present in the distal edge of the beam (residual range in water of about 0.20&#x02013;0.24&#x000a0;mm) in very small regions of the tumor and whether these high LET values are clinically relevant need to be further studied. Another limitation is that although not significant, the tumor volume at the day treatments started (day 0) was systematically lower for the photons&#x02009;+&#x02009;PARPi and protons&#x02009;+&#x02009;PARPi groups compared to those for the photons alone and protons alone groups (Fig. S6). However, because the initial tumor volumes for photons&#x02009;+&#x02009;PARPi and protons&#x02009;+&#x02009;PARPi are very similar, our conclusion that at day 17 protons&#x02009;+&#x02009;PARPi is more effective than photons&#x02009;+&#x02009;PARPi still holds. We used a single dose of 11&#x000a0;Gy for our in vivo studies because of difficulties with proton beam time availability for consecutive days to enable a more clinically relevant fractionated schedule. However, we confirmed that the tumor growth delay of one fraction of 11&#x000a0;Gy is equivalent to a more clinically relevant fractionated schedule of 6&#x000a0;Gy per fraction in three consecutive days to a total of 18&#x000a0;Gy (Fig. S10).</p><p id="Par37">In summary, our data indicate that PARP inhibition radiosensitizes both BRCA1-mutant and BRCA1-recovered breast cancer cells to photons and protons.

The beam crossed the couch, water-equivalent plastic blocks, and bottom of the 6-well plates to a combined water equivalent depth of 4.42&#x000a0;cm before reaching the cells. The proton dose rate ranged from 1 to 3&#x000a0;Gy/min, depending on the stability of the beam.

Cells were then treated with DMSO or PARP inhibitor for 1&#x000a0;h, irradiated with photons or protons at doses ranging from 0 to 6&#x000a0;Gy, and stained at 9&#x02013;18 days after irradiation. Colonies were stained with crystal violet (HT90132-1&#x000a0;L, Sigma Aldrich) diluted to 1:5 in absolute ethanol. Plates and flasks were air-dried overnight and then scanned with a high-resolution flatbed scanner (Expression 10000 XL, Epson, Los Alamitos, CA). Platting efficiencies were 13% for HCC1937; 10% for HCC1937-BRCA; 18.5% for MDA-MB-436, 21.6% for MDA-MB-436-BRCA and 53.0% for 4T1. Images were analyzed, and colonies with more than 50 cells were counted. The survival curves were then fit with the linear quadratic model to extract parameters of the cell survival curve such as D<sub>10%</sub>, the dose to reduce survival to 10%. We also defined the sensitization enhancement ratio (SER) at D<sub>10%</sub> as the D<sub>10%</sub> from survival curves in which cells were treated with DMSO divided by D<sub>10%</sub> from survival curves in which cells were treated with PARP inhibitor.

We then calculated a threshold defined by the mean foci number plus 2&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;SD of the control condition to score foci in the treatment groups. Numbers of MN per nucleus were manually counted for at least 600 nuclei in each treatment group. The number of nuclei per image, number of MN-positive nuclei, and number of cGAS-positive MN were manually counted.
