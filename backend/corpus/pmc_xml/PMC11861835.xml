This study investigated the dynamics of dengue virus transmission and evolution in Central India from 2019 to 2023, focusing on the emergence of new strains and their impact on outbreak patterns. For this, 40 mosquito pools and 300 patient samples were recruited for the study. Phylogenetic and Bayesian evolutionary analyses performed on CPrM region and whole genome sequences generated by Sanger and Illumina sequencing, respectively, revealed the emergence and predominance of a novel DENV-2 genotype IV lineage III strain in the 2019 and 2023 outbreaks, which displaced the previously circulating DENV-1 genotype responsible for the 2016&#x02013;2017 outbreak. Despite pre-existing DENV-1 neutralizing antibodies in the community (67 healthy volunteers), the novel DENV-2 strain exhibited higher viral loads and a greater reproduction number (R0), contributing to rapid disease spread. Molecular clock and Shannon entropy analyses suggest that DENV evolution occurred within the mosquito vector, driven by natural selection. Our findings highlight the importance of continuous DENV surveillance, including genetic characterization in both vectors and hosts, to understand viral evolution and predict future outbreaks. Rapid urbanization and inadequate sanitation in densely populated regions like India create ideal breeding grounds for mosquitoes, facilitating the introduction and establishment of novel DENV strains. Interrupting the vector&#x02013;DENV&#x02013;host cycle through targeted interventions is crucial for effective dengue control.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>dengue</kwd><kwd>DENV</kwd><kwd>mosquitoes</kwd><kwd>Bayesian analysis</kwd><kwd>outbreak prediction</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>MPCST</funding-source><award-id>3891/CST/R &#x00026;D (Bio-Sci)/2018</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>MPCST (3891/CST/R &#x00026;D (Bio-Sci)/2018) (Extramural grant).</funding-statement></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-viruses-17-00144"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Dengue is the most prevalent acute febrile illness transmitted by arthropods, caused by the dengue virus, with approximately 390 million new cases reported annually [<xref rid="B1-viruses-17-00144" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Female <italic toggle="yes">Aedes</italic> mosquitoes carrying the dengue virus (DENV) are the main vector of transmission [<xref rid="B2-viruses-17-00144" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. There are four different serotypes of DENV: DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-4. Based on genetic and antigenic differences, these serotypes are further divided into different genotypes [<xref rid="B3-viruses-17-00144" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-viruses-17-00144" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] with a ~30% inter-serotype variability [<xref rid="B5-viruses-17-00144" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-viruses-17-00144" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Clinical signs and symptoms of DENV infections range from low-grade fever to severe hemorrhagic fever and even death [<xref rid="B7-viruses-17-00144" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The symptoms usually appear 5&#x02013;8 days after an incubation period of 3&#x02013;15 days. Clinical manifestations of dengue can range from an infection with no symptoms to a serious, potentially fatal illness if left untreated [<xref rid="B8-viruses-17-00144" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Expanded dengue syndrome, dengue fever, dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), dengue shock syndrome (DSS), undifferentiated febrile disease, and atypical dengue are the classifications used to describe cases [<xref rid="B9-viruses-17-00144" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Children, expectant mothers, and the elderly, particularly those with concomitant conditions like diabetes or hypertension, are among the groups most at risk of contracting dengue.</p><p>Diverse climatic conditions make the Indian subcontinent an epicenter for dengue disease, with 33 million infections [<xref rid="B1-viruses-17-00144" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], while in Central India, dengue epidemics have been occurring since 2009 [<xref rid="B10-viruses-17-00144" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-viruses-17-00144" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-viruses-17-00144" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Although previous studies have highlighted the importance of distinct serotypes and genotypes in determining the likelihood of an epidemic, little is known about the underlying genotype and serotype of the dengue outbreak [<xref rid="B13-viruses-17-00144" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) remains underexplored in this endemic region. Nonetheless, studies have demonstrated that subsequent infections with distinct DENV serotypes raise the chance of developing severe disease by three to four times, and various DENV serotypes co-circulate in endemic locations [<xref rid="B14-viruses-17-00144" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Higher plasma viremia has been linked to severe dengue sickness [<xref rid="B15-viruses-17-00144" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. However, some studies showed that viremia is not the main driver of inflammation after a dengue infection, as it was higher in individuals with a primary infection [<xref rid="B16-viruses-17-00144" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>There is still some uncertainty surrounding how new dengue virus strains emerge and how viremia levels in both humans and mosquito vectors influence disease severity. To better understand the frequency and impact of emerging viral shifts, thorough research is essential. Until an effective vaccine becomes widely available, controlling mosquito populations remains the primary method for reducing dengue transmission. Variations in the dengue virus&#x02019;s genetic makeup contribute to differences in virulence and transmission between serotypes, leading to diverse patterns of disease severity. Consequently, monitoring the molecular characteristics of circulating DENV genotypes and serotypes is vital for predicting and managing outbreaks. Additionally, studying the molecular epidemiology of DENV in both human and mosquito populations is critical for improving epidemic forecasting and guiding public health interventions. </p><p>From September 2019 to 2023, this study examined the seroprevalence and genetic epidemiology of DENV in both hosts and vectors in Bhopal, a dengue-endemic region in Central India. This research aimed to bridge the knowledge gap regarding how high viremia, driven by a high reproductive number (R0) in hosts/vectors, and neutralizing antibody responses may predict future dengue outbreaks in endemic areas. Molecular characterization revealed the emergence of new genotypes and serotypes in vectors, influencing strain competition and transmission dynamics. This contributes to the cyclical outbreaks observed every two to three years, enhancing our understanding of improved outbreak management.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-viruses-17-00144"><title>2.

Molecular Clock Analysis of the WGS Using Bayesian MCMC</title><p>Molecular clock analysis was performed using a dataset that included eight whole genome sequences of DENV-2 (a total of sixty-two sequences) and two whole genome sequences of DENV-1 (a total of fifty-two sequences) from this investigation. The Bayesian MCMC approach, provided in BEAST v1.8.4 [<xref rid="B26-viruses-17-00144" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], was used to calculate the nucleotide substitution rates and time to their most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) of the DENV-1 and DENV-2 strains. The Bayesian information criterion (BIC) was used to determine the best-suited nucleotide substitution model using jModelTest 2 [<xref rid="B27-viruses-17-00144" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Based on the lowest BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion) scores, the GTR + G model for DENV-1 and the TrN93 + G + I model for DENV-2 were determined to be the most appropriate models for Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis. We employed a strict molecular clock model with constant size for both viruses. The MCMC chain was run in two stages: 100,000 for DENV-1 and 30,000 for DENV-2. Every 1000 steps, parameter values were sampled. Log-Combiner v1.8.1 was used to merge the log files from the two different MCMC investigations, with 10% burn-in sets for each run. Log data were viewed using Tracer v1.6 in order to confirm chain convergence and ascertain whether an effective sample size (&#x0003e;200) had been achieved for all parameters. HPD intervals of 95% were assessed to ascertain the degree of uncertainty in the parameter estimates. TreeAnnotator v1.8.1 was used to generate a maximum clade credibility tree.

Discussion</title><p>Bhopal, one of the largest cities in terms of both population and area in Central India, an endemic dengue zone, has seen frequent DENV outbreaks over the past 20 years [<xref rid="B10-viruses-17-00144" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-viruses-17-00144" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-viruses-17-00144" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Dengue outbreaks, occurring every 2&#x02013;3 years, result in significant morbidity and mortality in the region. Despite extensive research on dengue, knowledge gaps remain in understanding the circulating DENV variants, transmission dynamics, and factors influencing disease severity. Understanding dengue&#x02019;s etiology and progression requires monitoring of genomic alterations, primarily through the evolutionary dynamics of sequences. To address these gaps, this study utilized genomic sequencing, phylogenetic analysis, and Bayesian MCMC to investigate the molecular epidemiology of DENV in hosts and vectors. Additionally, DENV seroprevalence was assessed in a seemingly healthy population to understand disease dynamics.</p><p>The present investigation revealed that DENV-2 was predominant in both the host and vector, followed by DENV-1, DENV-3, and DENV-4. The DENV-2 isolates recovered belong to genotype-IV (lineage III), dominating both host and vector samples, indicating an epidemiological relationship between DENV serotype mosquitoes and human cases. This study revealed a displacement of the native DENV-1 genotype-V (clade C) strain by the DENV-2 genotype-IV (lineage-III) strain in the Bhopal region. This transition was notable during the periods of 2016&#x02013;2017 and 2019&#x02013;2021, reflecting a competitive replacement between the serotypes <xref rid="app1-viruses-17-00144" ref-type="app">(supplementary Figure S10)</xref>. The new genotypic and lineage variants of DENV-2 circulating in the vectors may likely contribute to the higher incidence of dengue cases. According to earlier research, &#x0201c;stochastic events attributable to the low rate of virus transmission during the inter-epidemic period&#x0201d; could be the cause of the rise of dominant serotype [<xref rid="B34-viruses-17-00144" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Experimental infection trials within <italic toggle="yes">Aedes aegypti</italic> infected with either DENV-1, DENV-4 (mono-infection), or both viruses (co-infection) indicate that DENV-4 had a competitive advantage in a co-infection scenario. Although, no significant differences in transmission or dissemination were observed [<xref rid="B35-viruses-17-00144" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. These findings emphasize the ability of mosquitoes in endemic areas to harbor multiple DENV serotypes, with natural selection driving the replacement of one genotype by another due to vector-mediated dynamics [<xref rid="B36-viruses-17-00144" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p><p>This study suggests that the DENV-2 serotype likely achieved greater viral loads in vectors compared to native DENV-1, enabling its rapid proliferation and dominance in the region. Seroprevalence statistics suggested that immunity against DENV-1 in the population provided limited protection against the newly emerged DENV-2 genotype. This lack of neutralizing antibodies against DENV-2 facilitated the outbreak.</p><p>The comparison of the viral loads (viremia) in host patients revealed an additional finding that the DENV NS1-positive participants who needed hospitalization for thrombocytopenia, high-grade fever, or abnormal liver function tests had high viral loads. These results are consistent with research from Vietnam showing that elevated viremia is linked to severe dengue manifestations such as DHF or DSS [<xref rid="B15-viruses-17-00144" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. However, contrasting results from another study have been observed showing that viremia in DENV infection is not associated with a cytokine storm [<xref rid="B16-viruses-17-00144" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The findings suggest that a high viral load or reproduction number (R0) plays a crucial role in establishing a transmission chain, as it enables the host to maintain elevated viral loads early in the infection; these conditions facilitate the displacement of native strains and the propagation of new DENV genotypes. When mosquitoes feed on infected hosts with high viremia, it enables the transmission of emerging strains. This process underscores the epidemiological impact of viremia in driving the emergence and spread of novel DENV variants. The phenomenon of genetic variants and the competitive displacement of the original strain of the virus have had a substantial impact on the epidemiology and global pathogenicity of dengue illness [<xref rid="B35-viruses-17-00144" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="B37-viruses-17-00144" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p><p>Genetic analysis found a predominance of synonymous amino acid mutations, which do not alter the protein structure or function, suggesting sequence conservation across the viral proteome. This is further supported by the Shannon entropy analysis, indicating minimal variation in protein-coding regions. This stability has implications for vaccine development, as monitoring proteomic changes can help predict viral behavior and inform vaccine design strategies [<xref rid="B38-viruses-17-00144" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. This study also signifies the use of non-structural genes as similar diversity to structural DENV genes; this may advocate distinct evolutionary pressures [<xref rid="B39-viruses-17-00144" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].</p><p>Bayesian evolutionary analysis estimated that DENV-1 and DENV-2 have their respective average nucleotide substitution rates of 3.77 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup> substitutions per site year and 3.62 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup> substitutions per site per year, respectively. This suggested that DENV-2 evolved more slowly than DENV-1 and experienced more early evolutionary events. The estimated mean root age of DENV-2 was 841 years (95% HPD 731&#x02013;981 years), while the inferred mean root age of DENV-1 in 2021 was 654 years (95% HPD 582&#x02013;735 years). These results are in line with research that has already been published [<xref rid="B4-viruses-17-00144" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B40-viruses-17-00144" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].

This year is also rather near to our mean estimate for the TMRCA of all serotypes. The broadest estimate suggests a composite TMRCA of DENV was about 1670 years ago [<xref rid="B42-viruses-17-00144" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. This period corresponds with the first documented medical report of &#x0201c;water poison&#x0201d;, a dengue-like disease that was transmitted by mosquitoes in third-century China [<xref rid="B26-viruses-17-00144" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. This study predicted a major divergence in cosmopolitan genotype stemmed from the emergence of an Indian subcontinent lineage approximately 123 years ago.</p><p>Vectors play a crucial role in the emergence of new genotypes, as viral replication in mosquitoes influences the evolutionary trajectory of DENV. This study also provides crucial information on how high viremia in hosts and the emergence of new DENV in vectors by natural selection maintain the transmission cycle in endemic areas. However, predicting the outbreak or emergence of a new DENV strain remains a difficult task despite advances in understanding the host&#x02013;virus pathophysiology, tracing the evolution of the viruses, and genetic epidemiology. A key limitation of this study was the inability to evaluate differences between primary and secondary DENV infections, which could provide deeper insights into disease dynamics. Until the proper antiviral medication or vaccines are developed, routine surveillance of DENV serotypes and genotypes in endemic areas will remain essential for forecasting large-scale outbreaks. Early detection of shifts in circulating strains can inform public health interventions, minimizing the impact of dengue epidemics.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec5-viruses-17-00144"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>According to the current study, DENV-2 was the most prevalent serotype during the dengue outbreaks in the Bhopal region of Central India in 2019 and 2021, followed by other serotypes. Compared to earlier studies, tMRCA was found earlier, and low substitution rates based on the entire genome were noted. The current study investigated how the high viral load emerging DENV-2 genotype-IV (lineage-III) replaced the circulating native strain of DENV-1 and DENV-2, despite some disagreement on the origin time estimate of DENV. It may be brought on by the presence of monotypic protective antibodies against a particular serotype or by the competitive displacement of novel strains with high viral loads. In this endemic region, new serotypes and genotypes may emerge as a result of future outbreaks, as the study also found that all serotypes are co-circulated at the vector level. It is unknown which serotype will ultimately manifest in the vector&#x02019;s midgut to initiate an outbreak. Molecular characterization, epidemiology, and vector surveillance, however, can greatly enhance predictions for severe dengue outbreaks in the future and break the cycle of outbreaks that recur every two to three years, which is linked to high death rates in the region. Continuous vector, virus, and DENV molecular epidemiology surveillance would help medical professionals make the necessary preparations for future outbreaks in the absence of a dengue vaccine in endemic areas.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We would like to thank AIIMS Bhopal director, Institutional Human ethics committee (IHEC) AIIMS Bhopal and the funding agency MPCST extramural grant no 3891/CST/R &#x00026;D (Bio-Sci)/2018.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclaimer/Publisher&#x02019;s Note:</bold> The statements, opinions and data contained in all publications are solely those of the individual author(s) and contributor(s) and not of MDPI and/or the editor(s).
