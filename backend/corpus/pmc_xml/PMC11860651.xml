The birth cohort of each person was defined by the decade of birth year(1940s, 1950s, etc). Mental ill health was assessed with the MHI5 from the SF36, in each wave and K10 from alternate waves. We estimate and compare penalized smooth trends in mental health for each cohort using restricted maximum likelihood (REML) using generalized additive mixed modelling (GAMM). Cohort effects are captured by directly estimating the differences between the smooth age trends of adjacent cohorts.</p></sec><sec id="sec1702"><title>Results</title><p>Later cohorts were more likely to have poorer mental health, higher distress, more likely to be single and unemployed, and less&#x000a0;likely to be chronically ill or disabled. Mental health was worse for younger age-groups in each survey year, and this discrepancy is much greater in more recent surveys - consistent with a birth cohort effect. Millennials (those born in the early 1990s) had a lower score at the same age as earlier generations, and the later cohorts do not show the age-related improvement seen in other earlier cohorts as they aged. At age 30 the average MHI-5 score of those born in the 1990s was 67, compared to 72.5 and 74 for people born in the 1980s and 1970s.</p></sec><sec id="sec1703"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The deterioration in mental health over time which has been reported in large cross-sectional surveys, likely reflects cohort-specific effects related to the experiences of young people born in the Millennial generation and, to a lesser extent, those from the immediately prior cohort born in the1980s. We need to understand whether later cohorts are less resilient to similar risk factors&#x000a0;experienced by earlier cohorts or whether they experience&#x000a0;more and/or a greater severity of risks for mental ill-health. Such evidence is critical if the deteriorating pattern of mental health is to be arrested.</p></sec><sec id="sec1704"><title>Disclosure of Interest</title><p>None Declared</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="1"/></counts></article-meta></front></article>
