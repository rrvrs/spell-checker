One of the most pressing challenges in this context is the growing shortage in the availability of conventional fodder. This scarcity has intensified the search for alternative feed sources, with particular interest in underutilized resources often considered waste due to limited knowledge of their nutritional value. This study aimed to assess whether watermelon plant silage (WPS) could be used as a forage source in ruminants. The chemical composition of WPS and alfalfa hay (AH) was analyzed. Results showed similar protein content (21.1 <italic toggle="yes">vs.</italic> 18.9 g CP/100 g DM, respectively), with WPS exhibiting higher crude fat content (3.16 <italic toggle="yes">vs</italic>. 1.29 g/100 g DM) but lower hemicellulose (9.95 <italic toggle="yes">vs</italic>. 14.6 g/100 g DM) and cellulose (20.0 <italic toggle="yes">vs</italic>. 26.8 g/100 g DM) content compared to AH. In the first <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> trial, WPS and AH were incubated independently to compare their fermentation behavior. WPS produced a higher concentration of short chain fatty acids (SCFA) (65.9 <italic toggle="yes">vs</italic>. 61.0 mM; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.304), lower proportions of propionate (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.001), and higher proportions of isobutyrate (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.001). In a second <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> trial, a formulated goat diet (commercial concentrate and AH in a 1:1 ratio) was used as a control to assess the impact of replacing 25% and 50% of AH with WPS. Trends towards higher value were observed in pH and CH4 concentration as AH was replaced by WPS. The study concluded that WPS could serve as a viable fodder to replace AH in conventional goat diets, simultaneously reducing agricultural waste and serving as a regenerative model for implementing circular economy strategies in affected agronomic sectors.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation through the project PID2020-119746RB-I00</institution>

In March 2020, the European Commission adopted a new Circular Economy Action Plan to increase the growth of sustainability that includes a &#x0201c;waste and recycling&#x0201d; policy aimed to protect the environment and human health [<xref rid="pone.0323553.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The main targets of this policy are to stimulate innovation in recycling and improve waste management. These policies become increasingly more important because the world&#x02019;s population is expected to increase by 33% over the current population by 2050 [<xref rid="pone.0323553.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], which will increase the demand for agricultural products [<xref rid="pone.0323553.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], while the natural resources and provision of services from agriculture will not grow [<xref rid="pone.0323553.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Furthermore, in response to the growing global population, there is a current proposal to shift animal feed towards products that are inedible for humans but suitable for livestock, such as crop by-products. This approach aims to replace human-edible products in animal diets, thereby increasing the overall food supply for human consumption [<xref rid="pone.0323553.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In parallel, livestock is suffering from the negative effects of the warmer climate, which generates the scarcity of forage availability and, in consequence, the increase in prices, causing the need for searching alternative strategies to feed animals must be sought for the sector&#x02019;s economic sustainability [<xref rid="pone.0323553.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Thus, including by-products in livestock feeding could help address the challenges of this emerging scenario by reducing the cost of feed and improving sustainability on-farm, both from the economic and environmental point of view [<xref rid="pone.0323553.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Specifically, the biomass generated in the case of the watermelon plant was 100 million tons/year in 2019 worldwide [<xref rid="pone.0323553.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Watermelon fruit and even its seeds have been assayed [<xref rid="pone.0323553.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] but, to our knowledge the study of Hassan et al. [<xref rid="pone.0323553.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], is the only one published on the suitability of using the watermelon plant as forage, and this has been carried out <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> using sheep as an animal model for meat production systems. However, several studies concluded that there were substantial interspecific differences between goats and sheep in their ability to digest and utilize the nutrients of a number of by-products [<xref rid="pone.0323553.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323553.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Another aspect to consider is that, the high moisture content may be the main challenge for the practical use and conservation of watermelon plants, because it usually contains certain amounts of discarded fruits left on the plant after harvesting. Nonetheless, ensiling is a technique usually chosen to address this problem and, in addition, it can also enhance the substrate&#x02019;s nutritional value and increase its acceptability [<xref rid="pone.0323553.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Ensiling low-value agricultural residues represents an innovative strategy to generate high-quality feed for livestock, and its use can, at a minimum, maintain animal performance and health, while allowing the storage of large quantities of agricultural waste that provide a valuable source of feed for livestock when fresh forage is scarce [<xref rid="pone.0323553.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. We hypothesized that watermelon plant silage (WPS), because of their intrinsic properties, that resemble those of the medium-good quality forage [<xref rid="pone.0323553.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], could be beneficial for dairy goats feeding. Alfalfa hay (AH) is the most widely available high-quality forage used in intensive dairy goat feeding. In the southern Iberian Peninsula, due to the region&#x02019;s climate, AH is typically dried as hay rather than ensiled, with hay being the preferred form of feed for this livestock typology. However, AH faces an additional challenge: its availability and consequently its price are subject to significant variability and uncertainty, largely dependent on interannual climatic fluctuations and the impacts of global warming. This work aimed to study the nutritional value of WPS, as well as to assess the impact of replacing AH with WPS on different rumen <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> fermentation parameters using goats as donors of inoculum of the rumen microbiota.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Animals and feeding</title><p>Animal procedures and care were conducted in accordance with the Spanish regulations (RD 53/2013) that transpose the European Directive (2010/63/EU) on the protection of animals used in experiments or alternative scientific purposes. Experimental protocols were approved previously by the CSIC Ethical Committee for Experimental Animal Protection and authorized by the regional Andalusian government (procedure 06/07/2023/61) as the competent body in the matter. he experimental procedures did not involve causing pain or sacrificing animals. Four Murciano-Granadina goats (46 &#x000b1; 4 kg body weight) fitted with rumen cannula were used in this study as donors of the inoculum to be used in the experimental procedures of <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> ruminal fermentation. The handling of the animals did not involve causing them pain or sacrificing them, the procedure for extracting the rumen contents was of mild severity and their living spaces included environmental enrichment measures at all times.

id="sec004"><title>Silage preparation</title><p>The watermelon growing area was fertilized with 175 kg/ha of an NPK mixture (ratio 2.6:0.8:3.4) before planting. The study utilized the entire watermelon plant (<italic toggle="yes">Citrullus lanatus</italic> Thunb. Sugar Baby variety) at its post-harvest phenological stage, encompassing branches and leaves but excluding roots. This plant material is typically considered agricultural waste and left in the field after fruit harvesting. In our case, the collected plant matter included small quantities of unharvested fruits that remained as surplus, deemed commercially insignificant. The WPS was prepared by pressing and wrapping with four to six layers of &#x0201c;bale wrap plastic&#x0201d; (25 &#x003bc;m stretch film). This was performed using a bale wrapper machine with a front-loader (Vicon RF 135 Balepack 3D Opticut 23, Brazil). Formic acid (0.45% of fresh matter) was previously added to facilitate the drop in pH. Bales were opened after 68 days of ensiling and pH was measured (3.61 &#x000b1; 0.53). When opened, the colour, aroma and lack of mould were checked as an indicator of the quality of the ensiling process and some samples were squeezed to obtain separate juice fractions for the determination of the concentration of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) as indicators of proper fermentation that ensure the absence of proliferation of clostridia or enterobacteria. Thus, the silage juice showed values of 2.86 &#x000b1; 0.002 and 0.171 &#x000b1; 0.005 g/100 g DM of WPS, respectively for acetate and propionate (Mean &#x000b1; SD), while the values for the rest of the SCFA were negligible (&#x0003c; 0.04 g/100 g DM). Representative samples of watermelon plant and WPS were freeze-dried and ground before chemical analysis and <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> experiments.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Experimental design and samplings</title><p>Two <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> trials were carried out using the methodology based on the non-renewed culture system of ruminal microorganisms [<xref rid="pone.0323553.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] inoculated with rumen fluid from goats. In the first experiment, samples of WPS and AH were incubated independently to compare their fermentative behaviour. The AH used in both this experiment and the subsequent one was obtained from a mixture of samples collected from different locations on various bales of forage.</p><p>A complete randomized design was used in the first trial, and the main effect was the type of forage (AH and WPS). The same amount of DM (300 mg) of each forage was carefully weighed into 120 ml Wheaton bottles. Twelve bottles were prepared per type of forage (four sources of inoculum in triplicate). Approximately 500 ml of rumen content was collected from the rumen of four fistulated fasting (12 h) goats and filtered through four layers of cheesecloth. The rumen fluid of each goat (n = 4) was mixed separately in 1:3 proportion with buffer solution [<xref rid="pone.0323553.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. One bottle per buffered inoculum was incubated as blank (without diet). Then, 40 ml of culture media in bottles containing either AH or WPS were added and incubated in triplicate for each donor animal. The bottles were incubated at 39 &#x002da;C for 72 h and the gas pressure in each bottle was measured using a wide range pressure meter (Sper Scientific LTD, Scottdale, AZ, USA) at 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 48 and 72 h after the start of incubation. These data were used to calculate the kinetics of gas production from forage fermentation as described later. The gas production (GP, ml) was measured using a system consisting of a 40 ml capacity syringe coupled to the pressure meter via a three-way stopcock. This apparatus was connected to a needle inserted into the bottle&#x02019;s headspace. The gas was extracted using the syringe until the system&#x02019;s pressure equalized with atmospheric pressure and then the volume (ml) was noted. After 24 h of incubation, one of the three initially prepared set of bottles was opened, the pH was measured, using a pH-meter (Crison GLP 22, Hach Lange, Barcelona, Spain), and samples (0.80 ml) of each bottle were obtained for SCFA determination following the methodology described by Arco-P&#x000e9;rez et al. [<xref rid="pone.0323553.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>The second <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> trial evaluated the effect of replacing AH with WPS in different proportions using a completely randomized design, and the main effect was the substitution rate: 0, 25 and 50%. The samples weighted into the Wheaton bottles were: 1) Control diet consisting in 300 mg of dairy goats-formulated diet of AH and commercial concentrate (50:50 ratio), 2) the same diet as before diet but where 25% of the AH was replaced by WPS, 3) a diet where 50% of the AH was replaced by WPS. One bottle per buffered inoculum was incubated as blank (without diet). <italic toggle="yes">In vitro</italic> incubations were prepared following the same protocol as in the first trial, with 9 bottles per level of AH substitution by WPS (three inoculum sources in triplicate). Each bottle contained 300 mg DM of the respective diet and 40 ml of incubation solution. The bottles were incubated at 39 &#x000b0;C for 72 hours. Gas pressure measurements were taken at the same time intervals and following the same procedure as in the initial experiment. Additionally, after 24 h of incubation, one bottle from each triplicate set was opened to measure pH, and samples were collected for SCFA quantification.</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>Chemical analyses</title><p>The dry matter (DM) (method 934.01), organic matter (OM) (method 942.05) and crude fat (CF) (method 920.39) in both WPS and AH were evaluated in triplicate according to the AOAC procedures [<xref rid="pone.0323553.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The nitrogen (N, AOAC method 990.03) was determined by Dumas procedure (Leco TruSpec CN&#x000ae;, St. Joseph, Michigan, USA) to obtain the crude protein (CP = total N g/100 g DM &#x000d7; 6.25). Neutral (NDF) and acid (ADF) detergent fibre were analyzed following the sequential procedure of Van Soest [<xref rid="pone.0323553.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] using the Ankom 220 Fiber Analyzer (ANKOM Technology). The cellulose was solubilized with 72% sulfuric acid for acid detergent lignin (ADL) determination. These fibre fractions were expressed excluding residual ash. The total carbohydrates amount was calculated taking into account the proportion of ashes, CP and CF, using the following formula: Total carbohydrates (%) = DM &#x02013; (Ashes + CP + CF). The non fibrous carbohydrates were calculated using the following formula: Non fibrous carbohydrates (%) = Total carbohydrates &#x02013; NDF. Finally,the gross energy (GE) content was measured determined by using an adiabatic calorimeter (Parr Instruments Co. model 1356, Moline, IL, USA).</p><p>Heavy metals and mineral contents were determined by atomic spectroscopy inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) analysis. The analyses were carried out in duplicate. The content of some essential and non-essential minerals was estimated. The method was based on the addition of a mixture of Milli-Q water and 65% HNO<sub>3</sub> to the sample (1:3), followed by digestion in an ultra-wave digester at 220 &#x002da;C for 15 min and cooling to 60 &#x002da;C under high pressure. The product was then transferred to a volumetric flask and diluted with Milli-Q water. Determinations were conducted using an ICP-OES 720-ES system with a sea spray nebulizer and axial torch. Two spectral lines per element were selected, with linearity (correlation coefficient &#x02265;0.995) ensured by utilizing standard solutions. Each analytical result was obtained by calculating the average of the two spectral line readings.</p><p>The amino acid (AA) composition of forages was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography using a Waters Lambda-Max LC Spectrophotometer detector (Waters Corporation, USA) applying the Waters&#x000ae; Pico-Tag method, which involves precolumn derivatisation with phenylisothiocyanate.

The principle of ensiling is based on preserving green fodder under anaerobic conditions to support the growth of lactic acid-producing bacteria, which generate lactic acid and cause a decrease in the pH of the conserved material [<xref rid="pone.0323553.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>Several studies have shown promising results when using plant silages to feed ruminants [<xref rid="pone.0323553.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323553.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], but is scarce the scientific literature on the suitability and adequacy of the watermelon plant ensiling, especially considering the entire plant and not only surplus fruits. According to the literature [<xref rid="pone.0323553.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], maintaining upper limits of 3% acetate and 0.5% propionate in the squeezed silage liquid has been established as a good indicator of adequate fermentation of the silage and the absence of clostridia or enterobacteria proliferation. In the WPS, the percentages of acetate and propionate were 2.86% and 0.171%, respectively. These authors also argued that high concentrations of these acids are related to a low voluntary feed intake of silage in cows, although it may not be directly attributable to those compounds, rather because they also can be considered indicators of an incorrect conservation or storage. In any case, SCFA concentrations in silage are proportional to the moisture content, that in the case of WPS (almost 85%, conferred by the presence of watermelon fruits in the pre-silage mixture) was much higher than the average of the studies reviewed in the cited work (75% upper limit).</p><p>Similar to what Lin et al. [<xref rid="pone.0323553.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] found when analyzing the impact of AH silage on the its chemical composition, the nutrient composition of the WPS hardly changed concerning what the plant had before the ensiling process. They reported a significant reduction in water-soluble carbohydrates, probably for a reason that can explain the decrease in hemicellulose in exchange for the increase in cellulose (in a magnitude close to 20%) observed in our study. The main explanation could be that hemicellulose could be susceptible to being used to a greater extent by certain microorganisms involved in the fermentation that occurred during the ensiling process.</p><p>Some authors reported variations in the saturation of fatty acids due to the ensiling, but there is no available information on the impact of this process on the plant CF content that could explain the increase (by more than 100%) of this nutrient observed in the WPS. However, Hassan et al. [<xref rid="pone.0323553.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], reported a WPS CF content similar to that in our product (2.80 <italic toggle="yes">vs.</italic> 3.09 g/100 g DM, respectively), whereas Ibrahim et al. [<xref rid="pone.0323553.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] found a range of CF content in the intact watermelon plant (from 1.19 to 1.82 g/100 g DM) which covered the value of our observation (1.40 g/100 g DM) before ensiling.</p><p>Alfalfa stands out among forage crops due to its high levels of CP and energy, which minimize the necessity for additional supplements in feed and makes it ideal for inclusion in the diets of high-yield dairy ruminants. The comparison between the composition of WPS and AH used in our trial reflected that the former showed a higher content of minerals, CP and CF, while AH contained higher NDF, ADF and ADL proportions. Considering this, and that the NDF content (nearly 50%) of the AH used in our study, it can be regarded as a medium-quality forage legume, while WPS could be expected to offer a higher potential for providing ME. The ADF represents the percentage of highly indigestible and slowly digestible components in forages, including cellulose, lignin, pectin, and ash. A lower ADF value in WPS, approximately 25% less than in AH, suggests that this forage might be more digestible and thus suitable for dairy goats.</p><p>The lower OM and carbohydrates content in WPS likely resulted from the presence of earth in the obtained plant samples, suggesting that the collection method used in this experiment may have been suboptimal. This same reason would explain the very high calcium (Ca) content since the WPS cultivation soil in this study was made up of quaternary deposits of the Ca luvisol type. Minerals are necessary for metabolic processes in small ruminants and Ca is required for lactation, maintenance and growth in small ruminants. Those requirements have been reported to be between 1.2 to 2.6 g/kg DM [<xref rid="pone.0323553.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] and, while AH is considered rich in Ca source (4.40 g Ca/kg DM), the concentration of this element in WPS exceeded almost twenty times the upper threshold of the requirements range (44.7 g Ca/kg DM in WPS). However, if the Ca is in the form of carbonates of soil contamination, the bioavailability of this element may be lower and, adversely, it could depress the absorption of Fe [<xref rid="pone.0323553.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Nevertheless, Ca is one of the primary nutrients in ruminant diets, following protein and energy in importance. It plays crucial roles in maintaining acid-base balance, facilitating muscle contraction, transmitting nerve impulses, and contributing to protein biosynthesis, especially in lactating animals [<xref rid="pone.0323553.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Calcium is also essential for skeletal mineralization, and its adequate supply can prevent diseases such as osteomalacia, osteoporosis, and fibrous osteodystrophy [<xref rid="pone.0323553.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Most plant-based foods, except for leguminous forages, have low Ca content. Consequently, proper Ca supplementation in ruminant diets typically relies on animal-derived and inorganic sources, which have a bioavailability greater than 66% [<xref rid="pone.0323553.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The high Ca concentration in WPS could potentially serve as an effective alternative source. Thus, in a relevant way WPS could reduce the costs associated with dietary Ca supplementation in ruminant nutrition.</p><p>The WPS showed higher concentrations of K, Mg and Na, and lower of Fe, Al, Zn, Ti, As, B, Si and Sr than AH. In comparison with AH, and contrarily to described by Hassan et al. [<xref rid="pone.0323553.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], the low heavy metals content of WPS draws attention, which would constitute it as a safe fodder for animals.</p><p>The AA analysis plays a crucial role in examining the make up of proteins, as well as in studying the constituents of foods and animal feeds and their potential to cover the protein requirements of the different animal species. Moreover, EAA is defined as AA whose carbon skeletons are not synthesized <italic toggle="yes">de novo</italic> by animal cells or AA that are insufficiently synthesized <italic toggle="yes">de novo</italic> by animal cells relative to metabolic needs [<xref rid="pone.0323553.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Although many species of rumen bacteria are capable of <italic toggle="yes">de novo</italic> synthesizing AA, ruminants&#x02019; diets must provide sufficient protein and EAA when high rates of growth or lactation are required [<xref rid="pone.0323553.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Ibrahim et al. [<xref rid="pone.0323553.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] studied the AA composition of different parts of the watermelon plant (<italic toggle="yes">Citrullus vulgaris</italic>) and their results regarding proportions of AA in stem and leaves can be considered equivalent to those found in our study, including the observation related to a proportion higher in NEAA than in EAA. They also concluded that most of the AA values of the watermelon plant are comparable with those of most vegetable proteins, an observation that can also be extended to the comparison of WPS with AH performed in our study. Nevertheless, it should be noted that the ratio of AA-N in WPS was 18% lower than in AH, probably indicating a worse protein value for WPS. This limitation could potentially be offset by the higher total N content (exceeding 11.5%) of this alternative fodder, which might be suitable for promoting microbial synthesis in the rumen.</p><p>The <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> gas technique, which relies on volume and pressure measurements, has been used for decades to assess the degree of fermentation of diets in ruminants [<xref rid="pone.0323553.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] and monogastric animals [<xref rid="pone.0323553.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. It serves as an initial approach for the evaluating the nutritional potential of novel and alternative sources of feed for animal production. Using the <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> gas technique allows to reduce the cost, time and use of <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> experiments [<xref rid="pone.0323553.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] and is considered a replacement and reduction system to implement two of the three Rs (replacement, reduction and refinement) principles to address the ethical protection of experimental animals. For this reason, this technique is currently widely used in animal nutrition laboratories, and its methodological application continues to evolve and improve [<xref rid="pone.0323553.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].</p><p>When evaluating the nutritive value of unexplored feeds, it is important to consider the rumen fermentation parameters, which adequacy indicates that it can be conveniently degraded by the animal and supplies the required nutrients. In the present study, in terms of rumen fermentation dynamics, the WPS was shown to lead a fermentative process similar to AH regarding the asymptotic limit (A) of GP, indicating the suitability of its inclusion in the diet of goats. Although the range of ME values for medium quality AH reported in the literature, determined through <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> tests, typically falls between 8 and 9 MJ/kg DM, and differs from the 7.72 MJ/kg DM found in this study, it is important to recognize that the <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> values obtained are still valid for comparing the energy availability of AH and WPS. This allows for an assessment of the suitability of WPS as a potential substitute for AH. Nonetheless, the ME calculations following the model proposed by Menke and Steingass [<xref rid="pone.0323553.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], which considered the GP and the chemical composition (CP and OM) of the substrates, did not revealed significant differences for the AH in comparison to WPS. Thus, the underestimation obtained in the calculation of ME was due to the low GP records, which resulted from a lower ruminal inoculum to buffer ratio in our study (1:3) compared to that used in the work of mentioned authors (1:2).</p><p>The end products of dietary carbohydrate fermentation in ruminants are SCFA, mainly acetate, propionate and butyrate [<xref rid="pone.0323553.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. All of them are the main source of energy in ruminants, accounting for more than 70% of total ME [<xref rid="pone.0323553.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Acetate and propionate are essential for fat synthesis and gluconeogenesis [<xref rid="pone.0323553.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. In the present study, when comparing WPS to AH <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> fermentation, we found that WPS fermentation promoted similar acetate and butyrate proportions to the AH but lower propionate rate. Considering the total SCFA production, the energy potential showed by the rumen fermentation of the WPS was equivalent to AH. Total SCFA production is typically expressed in relation to digested OM as an indicator of fermentation efficiency, and such calculation turned out to be completely equivalent for both types of forage, with values of 24.2 and 23.8 mmol of SCFA/g of digested OM for WPS and AH, respectively. When examining the CH<sub>4</sub> proportion in the total GP, a trend to increase the methanogenic potential of WPS compared to AH. The isobutyrate and isovalerate proportions were lower for AH compared to WPS. These SCFAs are iso-acids and are involved in the stimulation of microbial protein synthesis [<xref rid="pone.0323553.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].</p><p>The second trial did not reflect a greater impact at the levels of 25 and 50% replacement of AH by WPS on rumen fermentation parameters, except for trends to linearly increase the methanogenic activity of the diet. The CH<sub>4</sub> production in the rumen is mediated by the release CO<sub>2</sub> and hydrogen, which are generated from the synthesis of SCFA during carbohydrate fermentation, and represents an energy loss for the animal. An efficiency index for this process involves relating methanogenesis to the SCFA production derived from diet fermentation. Thus, regarding the observed trend towards increased methanogenicity of the diet with the inclusion WPS, it is important to note that no significant differences were observed in the aforementioned index (ml CH<sub>4</sub>/mmol SCFA). This suggests that the trend may be attributed to shifts in the fermentation process extent rather than to greater fermentation inefficiency.Based on the results obtained in Experiment 1, an increase in both ME and total SCFA production might have been awaited during Experiment 2 due to the inclusion of WPS in the diet. However, this effect was not observed, likely due to synergistic interactions that occurred in the utilization of the nutrient combination from forages and concentrate by ruminal microorganisms.</p><p>Regarding the decrease in acetate as we increased the inclusion of WPS, similar results have been found in an <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> study in cows where mulberrry was included up to 10%, which had a similar composition to our WPS in terms of ADF and NDF, reporting a decrease in acetate formation [<xref rid="pone.0323553.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].</p><p>Isovalerate is a SCFA produced in ruminal fermentation from leucine, which has been found in high proportions in WPS. This fact could be responsible for an increase in isovalerate in the experiment. However, these differences were not observed when comparing the <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> ruminal fermentation of WPS to AH, so the mechanism by which this variation in these isoacids occurs is not entirely clear.</p><p>In an <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> trial, Soliman et al. [<xref rid="pone.0323553.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] used a mixed ration for lactating cows (40:60 forage to concentrate ratio) to study the replacement of berseem (leguminous plant) hay by dried watermelon vine in different percentages (0, 25, 50, 75 and 100%) and observed, contrary to our observations, that OMD and total SCFA production decreased from a 50% of hay replacement. From this substitution level, they also observed a detrimental effect on productive parameters (i.e., milk yield and its dry extract). Nevertheless, it is necessary to consider that the quality of the watermelon plant used by these authors had significantly lower nutritional characteristics compared to the WPS in our study, as it had lower protein contents and higher cellulose and, especially, hemicellulose contents.</p><p>Recently, Hassan et al. [<xref rid="pone.0323553.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], studied the impact of the replacement (10, 20 and 30%) of sunflower meal (protein concentrate that represented 6% of the diet) with WPS using an <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> approach with rumen inoculum from sheep and no effect was observed on GP or total and molar proportions of SCFA. This agrees with our results, although the total proportion of inclusion of WPS in the diet was much higher in our case, which indicates that a considerable replacement of the standard diet with WPS has no harmful effects on rumen fermentation.</p><p>As global dairy consumption continues to grow, sustainable livestock production becomes increasingly crucial. Besides, climate change and geopolitical instability are significantly impacting forage production and availability, leading to reduced yields, lower quality, and higher prices. These factors are threatening the economic sustainability of livestock farms. In this context, alternative feed sources like WPS could offer substantial cost savings, as they require minimal production costs beyond collection and transport [<xref rid="pone.0323553.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323553.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. The magnitude of this reduction is indeed variable in the global dairy goat sector, and forage typically accounts for 25&#x02013;50% of the total feed ration which costs is particularly significant in dairy goat farming. To provide a representative reference, in our study area (Andalusia), Morales-Jerrett et al. [<xref rid="pone.0323553.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] found that feed costs (including concentrates and fodder) represent 58.5 &#x000b1; 3.9% of the total cost structure for dairy goat farms of different typologies.</p><p>Dairy goat production is an efficient system to transform the energy contained in waste feedstocks to good quality foods through the contribution of microbial protein synthesis [<xref rid="pone.0323553.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323553.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Utilizing WPS offers significant environmental benefits by repurposing food industry waste to reduce landfill waste and promote a circular economy. As with other by-products, compared to conventional forage, WPS requires fewer resources, potentially reducing carbon footprint and greenhouse gas emissions [<xref rid="pone.0323553.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. This approach addresses waste management challenges while contributing to more sustainable livestock farming practices in the face of climate change and resource constraints.</p><p>Based on the results of this initial <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> nutritional evaluation of WPS, which suggest its potential as an alternative forage, further <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> evaluations are needed due to the inherent limitations of this approach, particularly regarding intake, absorption and animal performance or production. First, animal trials should be designed to study <italic toggle="yes">in situ</italic> ruminal degradability, particularly of important WPS nutrients such as protein, as well as the intestinal availability of rumen-undegraded protein. Furthermore, it is crucial to determine the energy and nutrient balance in animals where WPS constitutes a substantial portion of the forage fraction in their diet, at levels comparable to the highest proportions tested in this study. Finally, an on-farm evaluation of WPS inclusion in dairy goat diets would be highly beneficial to assess its effects on animal performance, milk production and composition, as well as its impact on the farmer&#x02019;s economy and the carbon footprint of the final product.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec013"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study shows that the nutritional value of watermelon plant silage suggests it may be suitable for use as a forage component in the formulation of diets for dairy goats. This claim would be based both on its chemical composition and on the fact that, compared to alfalfa hay as a reference forage, its inclusion in the ration did not alter the different parameters of <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> ruminal fermentation and the supply of nutrients and energy.

It needs to mature and reflect this statement by the authors. Abstract</p><p>line 24 replace total volatile fatty acids with short-chain fatty acids throughout the paper. You need to review this conclusion and its relationship with the title of the work.</p><p>Introduction:</p><p>Line 62 replace palatability with acceptability, a more technical term for animal nutrition</p><p>Materials and methods:</p><p>In line 74 (Animals and Feeding) what was the concentrate composed of and what was the roughage used in the diet of fistulated animals? There was a mineral mixture, which protein source was used? Diet formulated to meet what nutritional requirements? What variety of watermelon was used? What type of fertilizer did the plants receive (nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium)? This influences the chemical composition of the future silage.</p><p>In line 92, wouldn't the objective of formic acid be to reduce the pH and not increase it? Present the pH of watermelon silage after</p><p>In line 101 (Experimental Design) you need to make the statistics used clear.

</p><p>Reviewer #1: Considering the in vitro results of this paper, its title is very bold, stating the replacement of alfalfa hay with watermelon silage mainly in terms of energy and dry matter content. It needs to mature and reflect this statement by the authors.</p><p>&#x02022; Authors: The title has been rewritten following the indications of R#1: &#x0201c;Chemical composition and in vitro nutritional assessment of watermelon (Citrullus lanatus) plant silage as a forage option for Murciano-Granadina goats&#x0201d;.</p><p>Abstract</p><p>line 24 replace total volatile fatty acids with short-chain fatty acids throughout the paper. You need to review this conclusion and its relationship with the title of the work.</p><p>&#x02022; Authors: The term &#x0201c;total volatile fatty acids&#x0201d; has been replaced with &#x0201c;short-chain fatty acids&#x0201d; throughout the paper. Consequently, the abbreviation VFA has been replaced by SCFA.</p><p>Introduction:</p><p>Line 62 replace palatability with acceptability, a more technical term for animal nutrition</p><p>&#x02022; Authors: The term &#x0201c;palatability&#x0201d; has been replaced with &#x0201c;acceptability&#x0201d;, the only time this word is mentioned throughout the text.</p><p>Materials and methods:</p><p>In line 74 (Animals and Feeding) what was the concentrate composed of and what was the roughage used in the diet of fistulated animals? There was a mineral mixture, which protein source was used?</p><p>&#x02022; Authors: Clarifications regarding the doubts about the feeding of animals donating ruminal inoculum, rightly raised by R#1, have been included in the text, in the Animals and Feeding section</p><p>Diet formulated to meet what nutritional requirements?</p><p>&#x02022; Authors: The paper justifying the ration employed to cover the &#x0201c;protein and energy&#x0201d; requirement of this breed has now been cited in the Animals and Feeding section, and included in the references list of the manuscript. (Prieto et al. 1990. Protein and energy requirements for maintenance of indigenous Granadina goats, Brit. J. Nutr. 63 155&#x02013;163).</p><p>What variety of watermelon was used?</p><p>&#x02022; Authors: &#x0201c;Sugar Baby&#x0201d; variety of watermelon was employed. This information has now been included in the beginning of the Silage Preparation section.</p><p>What type of fertilizer did the plants receive (nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium)? This influences the chemical composition of the future silage.</p><p>&#x02022; Authors: &#x0201c;The watermelon growing area was fertilized with 175 kg/ha of an NPK mixture (ratio 2.6:0.8:3.4) before planting.&#x0201d; This sentence has now been included in the beginning of the Silage Preparation section of the manuscript.</p><p>In line 92, wouldn't the objective of formic acid be to reduce the pH and not increase it? Present the pH of watermelon silage after</p><p>&#x02022; Authors: Yes, R#1 is right. Formic acid was used to enhance the pH reduction. The sentence has been corrected to make it easier to read (included in the Silage Preparation section): &#x0201c;Formic acid (0.45% of fresh matter) was previously added to facilitate the drop in pH&#x0201d;.</p><p>In line 101 (Experimental Design) you need to make the statistics used clear. A completely randomized design was used with 2 treatments (watermelon silage and alfalfa hay) and 8 incubation times. Was it in a subdivided installment over time? How was this data analyzed?</p><p>&#x02022; Authors: Following the indications of the R#1, the design of Experiment 1 has been clarified in the text (second paragraph in the Experimental Design and Samplings section): &#x0201c;A complete randomized design was used in the first trial, and the main effect was the type of forage (AH and WPS). The same amount of DM (300 mg) of each forage was carefully weighed into 120 ml Wheaton bottles. Twelve bottles were prepared per type of forage (four sources of inoculum in triplicate)&#x0201d;, and: &#x0201c;These data were used to calculate the kinetics of gas production from forage fermentation as described later.&#x0201d;</p><p>Data resulted from this trial were analysed as described in &#x0201c;Statistical analysis and calculations&#x0201d; section: &#x0201c;The comparison between AH and WPS fermentation parameters was analysed by a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)&#x0201d;</p><p>In line 119 In the second in vitro trial, I ask the same question as in line 101. Detail the experimental design.</p><p>The topics (line 101 Experimental Design) and (line 164 Statistical analysis) could be together in the same text to facilitate understanding. How were orthogonal contrasts performed? Detail information.</p><p>&#x02022; Authors: Following the indications of the R#1, the design of Experiment 2 has been clarified in the text (Line 130 and forward): &#x0201c;The second in vitro trial evaluated the effect of replacing AH with WPS in different proportions using a completely randomized design, and the main effect was the substitution rate: 0, 25 and 50%.)&#x0201d;, and Lines 134-136: &#x0201c;In vitro incubations were prepared following the same protocol as in the first trial, with 12 bottles per level of AH substitution by WPS (four inoculum sources in triplicate).&#x0201d;</p><p>Data resulted from this second trial were analysed as described in &#x0201c;Statistical analysis and calculations&#x0201d; section (Lines 182-): &#x0201c;The effect of substituting AH with WPS was also analysed with ANOVA, followed by orthogonal polynomial contrast to evaluate linear trends in the effect of increasing substitution levels&#x0201d;. The results of this analysis have been described in the Results and Discussion sections.</p><p>In line 129, how was crude energy (CE) presented in table 1 determined?</p><p>&#x02022; Authors: It was certainly a mistake on our part. The description of the method for determining Crude Energy (CE) is now detailed in the text on the final part of the first paragraph of the Chemical Analyses section: &#x0201c;The gross energy (GE) content was measured determined by using an adiabatic calorimeter (Parr Instruments Co. model 1356, Moline, IL, USA).&#x0201d;</p><p>Additionally, the text has been improved by replacing the term &#x0201c;crude energy&#x0201d; with &#x0201c;gross energy&#x0201d;, which is more appropriate for animal nutrition studies.</p><p>Results:</p><p>In line 221, the digestibility of organic matter did not show a effect (p&#x0003e;0.05), so there is no need to say that it was numerically greater, because what matters is the statistical result.</p><p>&#x02022; Authors: Thank you for your valuable observation. Text has been corrected and now is described as: &#x0201c;In contrast, OMD was similar for WPS and AH. (471 and 410 g/kg, respectively; P = 0.126).&#x0201d;</p><p>The quality (resolution) of figures 1 and 2 needs to be improved.</p><p>&#x02022; Authors: I apologize. It was really a mistake. Figures 1 and 2 have been improved in quality and are attached as new files. Additionally, we have checked their resolution in the PACE platform as indicated in the journal</p><p>Discussion:</p><p>In line 334 the authors mention in vitro gas technique, but in the material and methods it is not clear that this technique was used, for example how the pressure was measured at each incubation time.</p><p>&#x02022; Authors: Thank you for your valuable comment. If I have misunderstood your statement, I sincerely apologize. However, we believe that the procedure for measuring pressure and volume of gas production has been described in the 'Experimental Design and Sampling' section (second paragraph). Nonetheless, we have made some revisions to enhance the clarity of the text.</p><p>Conclusions:</p><p>The authors conclude that watermelon silage can be used as a suitable ingredient in formulating diets for dairy goats, given the positive effects observed on rumen fermentation and the ability to provide nutrients and energy. In relation to the title of the article &#x0201c;Watermelon Plant Silage: A Viable Alternative to Alfalfa Hay for Feeding Murciano-Granadina Goats&#x0201d; and considering the discussion in line 368 that the second in vitro trial replacing alfalfa hay at 25 and 50% with silage of watermelon did not increase metabolizable energy and the concentration of short-chain fatty acids, I suggest a reformulation in the title of the paper or in this conclusion. It's not coherent.</p><p>&#x02022; Authors: I appreciate your precise correction. In accordance to the revised tittle, conclusion has been modified following your suggestion:</p><p>&#x0201c;This study shows that the nutritional value of watermelon plant silage suggests it may be suitable for use as a forage component in the formulation of diets for dairy goats. This claim would be based both on its chemical composition and on the fact that, compared to alfalfa hay as a reference forage, its inclusion in the ration did not alter the different parameters of in vitro ruminal fermentation and the supply of nutrients and energy. This evidence supports the use of watermelon plant silage as an alternative source in ruminant feeding, although in vivo studies are required to elucidate the influence of this fodder on voluntary feed intake and animal performance and production.</p><p>In addition, the inclusion of watermelon plant silage would contribute to the circular bioeconomy by utilizing agricultural waste as a feed source for livestock. This approach would help alleviate the problem of shortage of conventional fodder while potentially reducing costs for livestock farmers.&#x0201d;</p><p>Reviewer #2: Review: Manuscript (PONE-D-24-50314)</p><p>Review of &#x0201c;In vitro fermentation dynamics and microbial change as influenced by different plastic sources combined with urea and molasses using the ruminal fluid of swamp buffalo&#x0201d;</p><p>General comments:</p><p>In this manuscript the authors aim to propose different silage sources from watermelon plant to replace alfalfa hay in dairy goats diet using in vitro methods. In general, the manuscript addresses an important problem that is often overlooked in animal feeding and environmental sectors. There are numerous strengths to this study, including its diverse sample and well-informed hypotheses.</p><p>The topic of the paper well fits within the scope of the journal, but I would consider it for publication only after moderate revisions are performed below:</p><p>Abstract:</p><p>The abstract seems good and informative; however, it is long and I suggest shortening it.</p><p>I would recommend adding an introductory sentence at the start of the abstract.</p><p>&#x02022; Authors: I'm grateful for your constructive remarks. Abstract has been considerably shorted (from 365 to 286 words) and now contains an introductory statement.</p><p>Keywords:</p><p>Keywords should be listed in alphabetical order. I suggest avoiding the repetitions to increase the chances of the article being found</p><p>&#x02022; Authors: A Keyword section has been listed (by-products nutritive value evaluation, circular economy, forages, in vitro rumen fermentation, watermelon plant silage).</p><p>Introduction:</p><p>Seems good, however, this section should be amended using more recent scientific references.</p><p>&#x02022; Authors: The Introduction section has been modified to contain updated references where possible.</p><p>Material and methods:</p><p>The M&#x00026;M section needs to be supported with updated references.</p><p>&#x02022; Authors: As a result of the application of the observations of the different reviewers, the Material and Methods section has been substantially modified and, when possible, updated references have been referred.</p><p>Results</p><p>This section is generally well-written, however, I recommend removing all sentences, as no significant effect was observed.</p><p>&#x02022; Authors: Thank you for your feedback. We appreciate your comments and, to address them, in the Results section, all comments mentioning "numerically&#x0201d; differences have been removed even though no statistically significant differences (P&#x0003e;0.05) or trends to be so (P&#x0003e;0.1) were found. Nevertheless, let us propose that since this is a nutritional evaluation study of WPS versus another reference forage, such as alfalfa hay, the authors consider it is important for the reader to highlight the lack of significant differences in key parameters of the nutritional value. This would also apply when mentioning the lack of differences when forage replaces conventional forage (experiment 2). In such cases, the absence of differences would be "good news" for the hypothesis that WPS can be an alternative forage.</p><p>We believe the proposed modifications comprehensively respond to the reviewer's observations. We remain open to further discussion and refinement of our manuscript.</p><p>Discussion</p><p>In general, I suggest explaining the results and avoiding comparing them with other studies if it does not impact on the main conclusions.</p><p>&#x02022; Authors: Thank you very much particularly for this comment, which clearly indicates your successful commitment to clarity and coherence between the initial hypothesis, objectives, and conclusions of the scientific work. Nonetheless, following your advices and those of the other reviewers, the title, objectives, and conclusions have been modified, and consequently, the discussion has been rewritten, which I believe represents, in general, a clear improvement of the article. I hope that the discussion is now more closely aligned with the suggestion you made in this aspect.</p><p>Conclusion:</p><p>Seems good, however, should be re-written avoiding repeating the results and using abbreviations.</p><p>&#x02022; Authors: In order to collect your instructions along with those of another reviewer, the Conclusions section has been rewritten.</p><p>References</p><p>I urge the authors to update the references.</p><p>&#x02022; Authors: Several of references have been updated, especially those used in the Introduction section.</p><p>Tables and figures:</p><p>In general, the presentation/communication of tables 1 and 2 requires improvement.</p><p>&#x02022; Authors: Tables 1 and 2 have been modified following the reviewers&#x02019; recommendations.</p><p>Reviewer #3: This article is an innovative contribution to sustainable livestock farming, exploring the potential use of watermelon plant silage (WPS) as an alternative forage source for dairy goats.

We have expanded the "Statistical Analysis" section: &#x0201c;Data analysis was performed using SPSS software (IBM Corp. IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 29.0.0.0, Armonk, New York, USA). The comparison between AH and WPS fermentation parameters was analyzed by one-way ANOVA. Normality and homoscedasticity assumptions for ANOVA were verified using the Shapiro-Wilk test (p &#x0003e; 0.10 for all variables) and Levene&#x02019;s test (p &#x0003e; 0.05), respectively. The effect of substituting AH with WPS was assessed via ANOVA with orthogonal polynomial contrasts to evaluate linear trends across increasing substitution levels. These analyses examined the impact of forage type and substitution levels on degradation parameters (GP, ME, OMD, pH, SCFA, and CH&#x02084; production). Fisher&#x02019;s Least Significant Difference (LSD) test was selected for planned pairwise comparisons following significant ANOVA results (p &#x0003c; 0.05). No unplanned comparisons were conducted, maintaining the per-comparison error rate (&#x003b1; = 0.05). Trends were noted for P values between 0.0</p><supplementary-material id="pone.0323553.s002" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>Attachment</label><caption><p>Submitted filename: <named-content content-type="submitted-filename">Response to Reviewers PONE-D-24-50314.docx</named-content></p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0323553.s002.docx"/></supplementary-material></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="aggregated-review-documents" id="pone.0323553.r004" specific-use="decision-letter"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0323553.r004</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision Letter 1</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Raza</surname><given-names>Sayed Haidar Abbas</given-names></name><role>Academic Editor</role></contrib></contrib-group><permissions><copyright-statement>&#x000a9; 2025 Sayed Haidar Abbas Raza</copyright-statement><copyright-year>2025</copyright-year><copyright-holder>Sayed Haidar Abbas Raza</copyright-holder><license><ali:license_ref xmlns:ali="http://www.niso.org/schemas/ali/1.0/" specific-use="textmining" content-type="ccbylicense">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</ali:license_ref><license-p>This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution License</ext-link> , which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.</license-p></license></permissions><related-article ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.1371/journal.pone.0323553" id="rel-obj004" related-article-type="reviewed-article"/><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>Submission Version</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></front-stub><body><p>
