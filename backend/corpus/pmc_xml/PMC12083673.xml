Current <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> models that utilize IL-4/IL-13 stimulation fail to capture the transcriptional and functional heterogeneity of TAMs observed in vivo. In this study, we utilize a serum-free indirect co-culture model with patient-derived xenolines to polarize primary human macrophages and characterize their molecular and functional phenotypes. We demonstrate that xenoline-polarized macrophages diverge from classical M1/M2 states and instead adopt transcriptional signatures reflective of TAM subsets identified from patients. Notably, macrophages polarized with the radiation-therapy selected xenoline, JX14P-RT, exhibited gene expression patterns enriched for interferon response and hypoxia, mirroring recurrent GBM samples. In contrast, JX14P TAMs showed enrichment in phagocytic gene sets. Functional validation of these phenotypes revealed discrepancies between the transcriptionally predicted and observed phenotypes, emphasizing the importance of integrating phenotypic validation in sequencing studies. Altogether, our findings establish xenoline-polarized macrophages as a more physiologically relevant alternative to traditional models, offering a useful model for studying tumor-immune interaction <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic>.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by National Institutes of Health, including the National Cancer Institute (R01CA236911 to EEA; U01CA223976 and 3U01 CA223976-03S1 to CDW; R01CA258248 and R01NS134798 to CRM) and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (R01HL168659 to EEA).

Despite multidisciplinary approaches to treating GBM, including the use of maximally-safe surgical resection, ionizing radiation, temozolomide, Tumor Treating Fields, and various immunomodulatory agents, recurrence is almost inevitable [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. This is largely driven by a subpopulation of cells called brain tumor-initiating cells (BTICs), which exhibit marked resistance to conventional therapies and are thought to repopulate the tumor following treatment [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p id="P5">BTICs engage in multiple reciprocal signaling mechanisms to recruit peripheral monocytes and differentiate and polarize them into TAMs [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>, <xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. The first step of this reciprocal interaction is the recruitment of peripheral monocytes via secretion of chemoattractants such as CCL2 (MCP-1) [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Colony-stimulating factor 1 (CSF-1/M-CSF), which is constitutively expressed by BTICs, promotes monocyte differentiation into macrophages [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>, <xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>].</p><p id="P6">GBM secretes a wide range of factors, including extracellular vesicles (EVs) and cytokines, which polarize these macrophages toward a tumor-supportive phenotype. EVs derived from GBM induce TAM secretion of CCL2, IL-6 and VEGF, which promote monocyte recruitment, tumor invasion, and angiogenesis, respectively [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. In parallel, GBM-derived immunosuppressive cytokines such as IL-10, macrophage-inhibitory cytokine 1 (MIC-1), and TGF-&#x003b2; inhibit macrophage phagocytosis and stimulate TAMs to secrete additional IL-10 and TGF-&#x003b2;, further suppressing T-cell activation and proliferation [<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. TGF-&#x003b2; also promotes the expression of MMP-2, MMP-9, and MMP-14, facilitating ECM remodeling and tumor invasion [<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Concurrently, GBM secretes proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-6, and IL-8 [<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, <xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>, <xref rid="R65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. These cytokines enhance TAM secretion of IL-6 and CCL2, further promoting invasion, angiogenesis, and monocyte recruitment [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Despite this seemingly paradoxical secretion of both pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, these pathways act in concert to reshape the tumor microenvironment (TME) to promote immune evasion, vascularization, and invasion [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, <xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>, <xref rid="R65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>].</p><p id="P7">TAMs comprise up to 40% of the total cells in GBM and account for more than 70% of infiltrating immune cells [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Given their abundance and substantial influence on GBM biology, TAMs present a compelling target for immunotherapy. However, most clinical trials to date have focused on the adaptive arm of the immune system with limited success, largely due to the redundant expression of immunosuppressive ligands by both GBM and TAMs [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p><p id="P8">Several single cell studies have revealed that there is a plethora of diverse subsets of macrophages present in the TME with unique gene expression profiles, functional states, and cell surface markers. Despite advancements in the field, many researchers still utilize the archaic M1/M2 dichotomy, effectively ignoring the heterogeneity and plasticity of TAM subsets (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). This is largely due to a dearth of high-fidelity <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> models of TAMs. Traditionally, macrophage polarization states have been classified as resting (M0), pro-inflammatory (M1), or anti-inflammatory (M2a-d). The reductionist model states that M1 macrophages may mount an immune response against tumors, and that M2 macrophages promote tumor growth and immunosuppression [<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Most <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> studies utilize interleukins 4 and 13 to polarize macrophages towards an M2a state to mimic TAMs [<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. While this method is highly reproducible, it does not recapitulate the function or heterogeneity of TAMs seen in vivo [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].</p><p id="P9">Gupta et al. identified, through single-cell RNA sequencing of primary and recurrent GBM, seven distinct subsets of tumor-infiltrating Monocyte-Derived Macrophages (MDM) and Macrophages (MAC): MAC_Perivascular, MAC_IFN, MDM_Inflam, MAC_Anti-Inflam, MAC_Lipid_Metab, MAC_Metab_Hypoxia, and MDM_Phagocytic [<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. These subsets provide a refined lens through which to assess macrophage heterogeneity beyond the traditional M1/M2 framework. The MAC_Perivascular subset is associated with an anti-inflammatory state and resides within the perivascular niche and is elevated for LYVE1 expression. LYVE1<sup>+</sup> TAMs promote tumor vascularization by promoting the expansion of perivascular mesenchymal cells [<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The MAC_IFN and MDM_Inflam subsets both exhibit inflammatory signatures. Specifically, MAC_IFN is defined by the upregulation of Interferon signature genes, which is associated with the mesenchymal phenotype and decreased median survival [<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The MDM_Inflam subset is marked by elevated expression of SELENOP, which encodes selenoprotein P (SEPP1). This subset corresponds to the SEPP1<sup>hi</sup> subset identified by Pombo Antunes et al., whose proportion was increased in recurrent GBM [<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The MAC_Lipid_Metab, MAC_Metab_Hypoxia, and MAC_Anti-Inflam subsets are enriched for hypoxia-related genes. MAC_Lipid_Metab also exhibited signatures associated with lipid metabolism. In contrast, MAC_Metab_Hypoxia is elevated for HMOX1, a marker of myeloid cells that produce IL-10, which drives T-cell exhaustion [<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The Mac_Anti-Inflam subset exhibits gene signatures associated with chronic inflammatory stimulation and is enriched for EREG, a key regulator of PD-L1 expression, implicating it in immunosuppressive signaling [<xref rid="R64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. These hypoxic subsets reflect the functional specialization of TAMs in response to nutrient deprivation and hypoxia, two hallmark features of the GBM TME [<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Lastly, the MDM_Phagocytic is a subset of tumor-infiltrating macrophages that is defined by increased markers of receptor-mediated endocytosis. These subsets illustrate the pro- and anti-inflammatory spectrum present within the TAM compartment.</p><p id="P10">Given that BTICs reprogram nearby macrophages through secreted cytokines and extracellular vesicles, we hypothesized that indirect co-culture of macrophages with patient-derived xenograft (PDX) cells grown in BTIC conditions (xenolines) would influence macrophage polarization and function. <bold>In this study we compared the phenotype and function of xenoline-polarized macrophages to classical M0, M1, and M2a states, to discourage continued reliance on IL-4/IL-13-induced M2a macrophages as TAM models.</bold></p><p id="P11">Multiple studies have demonstrated that the proportion of some macrophage subtypes differs between primary and recurrent gliomas [<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. These differences are likely driven by the genetic and epigenetic adaptations that occur in response to chemoradiation, resulting in distinct cytokine and metabolite secretion profiles. To mimic the changes seen between primary and recurrent GBM, the Willey and Gillespie labs developed radiation therapy (RT) selected patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models [<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. These models enable investigation of RT-driven adaptations using matched xenolines, thereby minimizing baseline intertumoral variability [<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. <bold>In this study, we assessed how these adaptations influence TAM polarization using our serum-free co-culture system and the paired GBM xenolines.</bold></p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Cell culture</title><sec id="S4"><title>Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) media</title><p id="P12">Dulbecco&#x02019;s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM)/F12 50/50 (#10&#x02013;090-CV, Corning, USA), B27 supplement minus Vitamin A (50X) (#12587010, Gibco, USA), 1% penicillin-streptomycin (#30&#x02013;001-CI, Corning, USA), 1% sodium pyruvate (#5000CI, Corning, USA), EGF (20 ng/mL) (#PHG0311, Gibco, USA), FGF (20 ng/mL) (#PHG0261, Gibco, USA).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>TheraPEAK<sup>&#x02122;</sup> X-VIVO<sup>&#x02122;</sup>&#x02212;15 Serum-free Hematopoietic Cell Medium (X-Vivo)</title><p id="P13">TheraPEAK<sup>&#x02122;</sup> X-VIVO<sup>&#x02122;</sup>&#x02212;15 Serum-free Hematopoietic Cell Medium (#BEBP02&#x02013;055Q, Lonza, Switzerland) supplemented with 1% GlutaMAX (#35050&#x02013;061, Gibco, USA), 1% penicillin-streptomycin (#30&#x02013;001-CI, Corning, USA), and 1% sodium pyruvate (#5000CI, Corning, USA).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>GBM patient-derived xenolines.</title><p id="P14">The JX14P xenoline was originally obtained from Mayo Clinic and maintained in the UAB Brain Tumor Model Core and was approved for use on a UAB IRB approved protocol (IRB-300002910).

GenePix Pro software (v7.4.0) was used to extract and quantify the background-subtracted fluorescence intensities (F532 Mean &#x02013; B532) for each cytokine. The resulting data was tabulated and exported to R (v4.3.2) for analysis. Raw cytokine array data were processed by normalizing signal intensities to the POS2-control on each slide to account for slide-specific effects. The LIMMA (v3.58.1) package was used to identify differentially expressed (DE) cytokines. A design matrix was constructed using the model.matrix function, followed by fitting a linear model with lmFit(). Pairwise contrasts were defined with makeContrasts() and applied to the model using constrasts.fit() and eBayes() to moderate variance.

Interestingly, the cytokine expression profile of JX39P-RT polarized TAMs reflected a hybrid phenotype, exhibiting both M1-like (MMP9) and M2-like (VEGF) features, suggesting deviation from the M1/M2 dichotomy <bold>(Fig. S1C-D, F-G)</bold>. We performed phenotypic characterization on the different polarization states of these macrophages. M2-polarized macrophages had the greatest phagocytic capacity against the xenolines JX39P and its matched radiation-therapy selected counterpart, JX39P-RT (39P, M2 vs all other groups <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01; 39P-RT M2 vs all other groups <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.005).

Based on the limited proteomic and transcriptomic profiling, the xenoline-polarized TAMs did not distinctly resemble either the M1 or M2 polarization state. In fact, they most closely resemble the M0 state, corroborating previous reports [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Moreover, consistent with previous reports, THP-1 macrophages failed to fully express markers associated with M2 polarization, despite increasing M2-associated cytokine transcription, thereby limiting their utility as a comparative model [<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].

To further characterize the differences among these polarization states, we performed bulk RNA sequencing on PBMC-derived macrophages from four different donors polarized toward classical M0, M1, and M2 states as well as toward the JX14P and JX14P-RT TAM phenotypes. An anonymized donor identifier was included as a covariate in our design formula to account for inter-donor immunological variability. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of the top 500 variable genes revealed that the polarization state strongly drives the transcriptional heterogeneity of PBMC-derived macrophages (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). Principal component analysis (PCA) demonstrated that the first two principal components accounted for ~ 73% of the total variance (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). PC1 (49% variance) separated xenoline-polarized TAMs and M0 from classical M1 and M2 states. Notably, JX14P-TAMs clustered with the M0 state. In contrast, JX14P-RT TAMs clustered distinctly from M0 with partial overlap with JX14P TAMs. We next characterized the secretome of these macrophage polarization states using the RayBiotech GS1 cytokine array, which semi-quantitatively detects 20 analytes. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering showed that the polarization state significantly alters the cytokine secretion patterns of PBMC-derived macrophages (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>). PCA of GS1 cytokine array data revealed that the first two principal components accounted for ~ 88% of total variance, with PC1 (69% variance) distinguishing xenoline-polarized macrophages and M0 from classical M1 and M2 states. M1 and M2 macrophages clustered distinctly, reflecting differences in their cytokine expression profiles. JX14P and JX14P-RT TAMs shared similar cytokine profiles. These results indicate that the variation of the secretome is primarily driven by polarization state, and that TAMs polarized by xenolines do not align with either M1 or M2 macrophages. Together, these findings confirm that PBMC-derived macrophages respond robustly to classical M1 and M2 stimuli. Moreover, xenoline-polarized macrophages exhibit transcriptional and secretory profiles that diverge from canonical polarization states, further challenging the binary M1/M2 framework frequently used in TAM studies.</p><p id="P34">Macrophages polarized by JX14P exhibit distinct transcriptomic, kinomic, and cytokine expression profiles from M2 macrophages.

Conditioned media (CM) from JX14P-RT TAMs significantly promoted more invasion than CM from M0 (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001), M1 (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05), and M2 (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001) macrophages; however, no significant differences were observed between CM from JX14P-RT TAMs and JX14P TAMs (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.9995) (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7E</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">F</xref>). Additionally, CM from 14P TAMs significantly promoted more invasion compared to M0 (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0005) and M2 (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01). GSEA of the MAC_Perivascular gene set predicted increased angiogenic potential in JX14P and JX14P-RT.</p></sec><sec id="S26"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p id="P40">Advances in GBM research have been hindered by limitations of preclinical models that fail to accurately replicate the tumor&#x02019;s complex microenvironment. Traditional macrophage models often lack the cellular diversity and structural organization seen in GBM, leading to discrepancies between preclinical findings and clinical outcomes. Of particular concern is the widespread use of IL-4/IL-13 polarized macrophages, a reductionist model that fails to replicate the functional diversity and heterogeneity of TAMs that we see <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. In this study we demonstrate that macrophages polarized via indirect co-culture with GBM xenolines exhibit unique transcriptional profiles that diverge from the M1 <bold>(Fig. S5 &#x00026; 7)</bold> and M2 phenotypes (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Our findings align with an earlier report suggesting that TAMs, broadly, resemble the M0 phenotype [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. However, there are several differences between TAMs and the M0 phenotype <bold>(Fig. S4 &#x00026; 6)</bold>. Both JX14P TAMs and JX14P-RT TAMs displayed enrichment of hallmark signatures related to interferon response, hypoxia, and EMT, while showing decreases in signatures related to lipid metabolism. Additionally, both TAM subsets exhibited increased expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-8 and anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 relative to M0, highlighting the seemingly paradoxical secretion of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines that work in concert to promote GBM growth. Interestingly, both JX14P and JX14P-RT TAMs exhibited increased IL-6 secretion relative to IL-4/IL-13-polarized M2a macrophages. Their cytokine profiles align more closely with the M2d phenotype, a TAM-like state induced by IL-6 and Leukemia Inhibitory Factor, rather than the classically described M2a phenotype [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], further bringing the utility of M2a macrophages as TAM models into question. Moreover, while both xenoline-polarized macrophage populations exhibited divergence from M2a macrophages, they also differed significantly from one another. These findings argue against a &#x0201c;one-size fits all&#x0201d; approach and instead support a tailored, xenoline-specific modeling strategy that reflects tumor-intrinsic influences on macrophage polarization.</p><p id="P41">Recent studies have identified many promising innate immunomodulatory therapeutic targets using these reductionist models. For example, CD47 blockade and disruption of the APP-CD74 axis have been shown to enhance the phagocytosis of GBM cells <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> [<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. However, it is important to note that these results were obtained using resting macrophages, which not only have elevated phagocytic signatures relative to both of our TAM models but also exhibit significantly enhanced phagocytosis relative to JX14P-RT TAMs against the xenoline JX14P (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">B</xref>). Using macrophage models that are inherently primed for phagocytosis may lead to the identification of therapeutic targets that ultimately fail in clinical trials due to exaggerated effects observed <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic>. To address these modeling limitations, it is imperative to adopt more physiologically relevant models that better capture TAM heterogeneity in GBM.</p><p id="P42">While murine models such as GL261 have been instrumental in advancing our understanding of GBM biology and immune regulation, they fail to recapitulate key aspects of GBM biology. Syngeneic murine models like GL261 and CT2A were developed through chemical mutagenesis and harbor mutations that are infrequently observed in human GBM [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. GL261, in particular, is immunologically &#x0201c;hot&#x0201d; due to its high mutational burden and elevated MHC class I expression, making it poorly representative of the immunosuppressive TME characteristic of GBM [<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Notably, many early studies targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 axis employed GL261, contributing to inflated expectations about the clinical efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade in GBM [<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="R61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>, <xref rid="R62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>].</p><p id="P43">Concurrently, recent scientific and regulatory committees have increasingly emphasized reducing reliance on preclinical animal models, citing longstanding ethical concerns, limited translational relevance, and advancements <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">ex vivo</italic> model systems. The FDA has adopted initiatives that permit new approach methodologies, such as organoid modeling, to identify therapeutic candidates for clinical trials. Our approach aligns with this paradigm shift by bridging organoid and immunological research. By polarizing primary macrophages with patient-derived xenolines, our model enables incorporation of immune components into GBM organoid platforms, allowing for more physiologically accurate investigations of tumor-immune interactions. Indeed, our findings highlight the utility of xenoline-polarized macrophages as a more physiologically relevant TAM model relative to traditional IL-4/IL-13-polarized macrophages. Unlike IL-4/IL-13 polarized macrophages, xenoline-polarized TAMs exhibit a broader spectrum of transcriptional and functional states that more closely mirror the complexity of the tumor microenvironment. This includes simultaneous enrichment of inflammatory, hypoxic, and EMT signatures that are typically observed <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic>. Additionally, our co-culture models faithfully recreate some of the differences in macrophage gene signatures observed between primary and recurrent glioblastoma, notably our JX14P-RT TAMs exhibited an enrichment in the MAC_IFN subset. Conversely, JX14P TAMs displayed an enrichment of the MDM_Phagocytic subset, which was non-significantly enriched in primary patient samples. This further supports the relevance of our co-culture system in capturing the phenotypic diversity of TAMs across disease states. Importantly, because these polarization states are generated through tumor-secreted factors rather than artificial cytokine stimulation, they may more accurately reflect the immune programming that occurs within the glioma microenvironment. Taken together, our findings highlight xenoline-polarized macrophages as a versatile and translationally relevant model for investigating TAM function, therapeutic targeting, and immune adaptation during glioblastoma progression.</p><p id="P44">This model is not without its limitations. We suspect that our recurrent TAM model was not enriched for MAC_Metab_Hypoxia, MAC_Lipid_Metab, and to a lesser extent, MAC_Anti-Inflam subsets, partially due to the absence of a hypoxic niche in our model. Perhaps the addition of an ECM in a direct co-culture would allow for the formation of hypoxic niches in a tumoroid model. Also, it is important to note that the sequencing of our TMA includes transcripts from all cell types within the tumor, and thus observed signatures may reflect contributions from non-macrophages populations. Future studies must employ single cell sequencing methods to definitively quantify the relative proportion of each subset within the different polarization states to help elucidate what extracellular dependencies are necessary to better replicate TAM biology in the <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> setting.</p><p id="P45">Additionally, we recognize that while GSEA provided useful predictions regarding macrophage function, several of our <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> assays revealed discrepancies between the signatures and observed phenotypes. Although the MDM_Phagocytic gene set predicted the highest phagocytic capacity in the M1 macrophages and lowest in M2, the M2 macrophages exhibited the highest rate of phagocytosis against JX14P compared to JX14P TAMs and JX14P-RT TAMs. Additionally, M0 exhibited increased phagocytosis relative to JX14P-RT TAMs. Similarly, while JX14P-RT was enriched for EMT transition and promoted greater invasion than M0 and M2 macrophages, their invasion-promoting capacity did not significantly differ from JX14P TAMs and M1 macrophages.</p><p id="P46">Finally, despite multiple enrichments in MAC_Perivascular signatures in xenoline-polarized TAMs, HUVEC tube formation assay revealed no differences in angiogenic potential across polarization states. However, it must be noted that these discrepancies in the tube formation assay are not exclusively computationally related. The tube formation assay results may have been skewed for multiple reasons. First, macrophage capacity to support angiogenesis may be dependent upon additional parenchymal or stromal interactions, as previously reported [<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Additionally, the proportion of CM used or the concentration of EGF and FGF in the basal media may have affected assay sensitivity. Altogether, the discrepancies in the functional assays illustrate a broader issue, the inconsistent discordance between transcriptomic predictions and functional phenotypes.</p><p id="P47">The discordance highlights the necessity for functional validation of gene sets and subtypes identified from sequencing data. A previous study stratified patients based on enrichment of six gene sets associated with radioresistance, hypoxia, G2M Checkpoint, Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), UV Response Up, UV Response Down, and DNA Repair and performed a survival analysis across multiple cancer types, including cervical, head and neck, and breast cancers [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Interestingly, enrichment of a given gene set was variably associated with improved or worsened survival depending on the cancer type, highlighting the context dependent nature of these pathways and the need to validate the phenotype. In our patient-matched primary and recurrent GBM specimens, we observed enrichment of the Hypoxia and UV Response Down gene sets in recurrent GBM. Interestingly, our JX14P-RT TAM models were also significantly enriched for Hypoxia and UV Response Down gene sets, in the absence of radiation exposure, suggesting that this model captures key phenotypic differences between primary and recurrent GBM, and that tumor-intrinsic factors are sufficient to induce phenotypic changes in macrophages. These findings also raise the possibility that the xenoline JX14P-RT may prime macrophages to adopt a radiation-resistant phenotype. Future studies will investigate whether radiation-selected xenolines exert a radioprotective effect on TAMs, with the broader goal of better understanding how radiotherapy shapes the immune landscape of GBM.</p><p id="P48">As we continue to refine our understanding of TAM biology, establishing models that faithfully recapitulate the phenotypic and functional complexity of TAMs in the TME becomes increasingly important. This work underscores the limitations of IL-4/IL-13-stimulated macrophages and supports the adoption of xenoline-polarized macrophage models to improve the fidelity of preclinical GBM research. By more accurately modeling TAM biology, we can advance the development of innate immunomodulatory therapeutics in hopes of improving patient outcomes in GBM.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="S28"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p id="P51">We want to acknowledge Dr. Jann Sarkaria and Mayo Clinic for the JX PDX lines.Special thanks to Dr. Rati Chkheidze for helping with generating the tissue microarray, Drs.
