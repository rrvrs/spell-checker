However, to date, it is not clear how exposure to online misogyny might be influencing the behaviour and experiences of adolescents and children. As a first step towards answering this question, we gathered data on how such influences are perceived by surveying 200 teachers, 100 of whom were based in secondary schools (working with children aged 11 and above) and 100 of whom were based in primary schools (working with children aged 4&#x02013;11). 76% of secondary school teachers and 60% of primary school teachers reported that they were extremely concerned about the influence of online misogyny in their schools. When asked to describe an example of the ways in which online misogyny was influencing the behaviour and experiences of male pupils in their schools, teachers referenced cases in which male pupils praised misogynistic influencers, made misogynistic comments and engaged in discriminatory behaviour towards female peers and staff. When asked to describe an example of the ways in which online misogyny was influencing the behaviour and experiences of female pupils in their schools, teachers referenced cases in which female pupils were the victims of misogynistic behaviour and their well-being was adversely affected. 90% of secondary school teachers and 68% of primary school teachers felt that their school would benefit from dedicated teaching materials to address the impact of online misogynists within their schools. Implications of these data for interventions to combat the rise of online misogyny are discussed.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source>

The manosphere incorporates a variety of groups including self-styled pick-up artists, incels (short for involuntary celibates), MGTOW (short for &#x0201c;men going their own way&#x0201d;) and proponents of the red and black pill. Pick-up artists purport to teach men how to seduce women, often advocating the use of deceptive and even coercive tactics [<xref rid="pone.0299339.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Incels claim to be doomed to a life of singledom often expressing extreme resentment at the women who they imagine deny them sex [<xref rid="pone.0299339.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0299339.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. MGTOW claim that women, particularly White Western women, are so influenced by feminist ideologies that they should be avoided completely in favour of a life of solitude or a partner from a country with more conservative gender attitudes [<xref rid="pone.0299339.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Advocates of red and black pill ideologies draw on scenes from the Matrix film franchise in order to explain their relationship to contemporary society. In the Matrix, the protagonist is offered a choice between different coloured pills in order to understand reality or remain in the dark. These groups claim to have taken a pill which has allowed them to see the truth about gender politics, that society is fundamentally biased in favour of women [<xref rid="pone.0299339.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. While red pill and black pill ideologies are closely related, the black pill is typically understood as a more extreme and nihilistic perspective on gender politics [<xref rid="pone.0299339.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>What unites these different groups within the manosphere is a fundamental belief that women are inferior to men and ought to be subordinated to them. Women are often derogated as innately illogical, selfish, greedy and scheming. These attributions are used to justify harassment, coercive control, and discriminatory behaviour [<xref rid="pone.0299339.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0299339.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. For example, self-styled &#x02018;life coach&#x02019; Andrew Tate regularly suggests that women belong in the kitchen and owe their male partners service and gratitude [<xref rid="pone.0299339.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Other misogynistic influencers, such as Pearl Davis, campaign to restrict voting rights to men [<xref rid="pone.0299339.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Some influencers within the manosphere explicitly advocate violence against women and appear to have inspired real world attacks against them [<xref rid="pone.0299339.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. These communities are increasingly politicised and often advocate for far-right politicians [<xref rid="pone.0299339.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Until recently, this international movement has been a hidden problem. Although some influencers have gained widespread notoriety, many others do not engage with mainstream news channels. As a result, the scale of the manosphere may be underestimated by many adults unless they have regular contact with teenagers and young people. Teenagers and young people are regularly exposed to this content through social media and video sharing platforms including Reddit, TikTok and YouTube. While there is relatively little academic research on the extent of exposure, a poll commissioned by the charity Hope not Hate in 2023 found that 80% of 16- and 17-year-old British boys had consumed content created by Andrew Tate. In contrast, only 60% of boys in the same age group had heard of the British Prime Minister [<xref rid="pone.0299339.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. A recent poll by YouGov revealed that 27% of young men in the UK (aged between 18 and 29) hold a positive view of Andrew Tate, and 24% agree with his views about women [<xref rid="pone.0299339.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. A related poll conducted by Internet Matters (2023) suggested that 56% of fathers under the age of 35 approve of Andrew Tate [<xref rid="pone.0299339.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>The dynamics of social media create a context in which misogynistic views are able to flourish. Influencers compete for hits and shares within a limited marketplace of attention. Within this marketplace, controversial and extreme opinions are particularly likely to receive attention, leading to a radicalisation of viewpoints. Algorithms designed to offer users more of the content that they like, combined with systems for blocking unfavourable comments, create echo chambers in which individuals are presented with an increasingly homogenous and polarised world view [<xref rid="pone.0299339.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>To date, there is little evidence relating to how online influencers are affecting the behaviour and experiences of children. As a first step towards answering this question, we conducted a survey with 200 school teachers working in British schools. We surveyed 100 secondary school teachers (working with children aged 11+) and 100 primary school teachers (working with children aged 4&#x02013;11). We asked participants a series of questions about online misogyny in their schools. We asked them to rate how concerned they were about this problem and to describe the last time they 1) witnessed online misogyny influencing the behaviour or experiences of male pupils in their schools 2) witnessed online misogyny influencing the behaviour of or experiences female pupils in their schools 3) were personally affected by the influence of online misogyny over their pupils. We also asked them what their school was currently doing to tackle the influence of online misogyny and what they thought could be done to tackle this problem within schools. Finally, we asked them to what extent they felt their school would benefit from dedicated teaching materials to tackle the influence of online misogyny over their pupils.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Method</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Open science and ethical review</title><p>This study was pre-registered.

The survey itself was built with Qualtrics. All participants provided their written informed consent.</p><p>100 participants (61 female, 38 male, 1 non-binary, mean age 39.7, age range = 22&#x02013;64) worked at British secondary schools (accepting children aged 11&#x02013;16 or 11&#x02013;18). Of these teachers, 86 reported that they worked in state-sponsored schools and 14 reported that they worked in fee paying schools. 94 of these participants worked in schools with a mixed gender intake accepting male and female pupils, 2 worked in single-sex boys schools and 4 worked in single-sex girls schools. Participants reported that they taught a range of subjects including mathematics, science, English, computing, sport, history, geography and PSHE (personal, social, health, and economic education).</p><p>100 participants (80 female, 20 male, mean age = 38.5, age range = 21&#x02013;62) worked at British primary schools (reporting that they taught children aged 4&#x02013;11 years). Of these teachers, 91 reported that they worked in state-sponsored schools, 8 reported that they worked in fee paying schools and 1 did not specify. 99 of these teachers worked in schools with a mixed intake accepting male and female pupils, and 1 worked in a boys&#x02019; school.</p><p>A further 29 participants were tested but excluded because they worked in schools that taught primary and secondary school aged pupils (12). We excluded these participants because we could not be sure whether the examples they raised were drawn from primary-aged children or secondary-aged children. We also excluded teachers who reported that they worked in early years settings with children under the age of 4 (4) or because they worked in a further or higher education setting with children older than 16 (12). 1 participant was excluded because they did not specify what type of school they worked in.</p><p>Participants were reimbursed &#x000a3;2 for taking part. Participation took, on average, 8 minutes and 16 seconds (<italic toggle="yes">SD</italic> = 7 minutes and 36 seconds). Secondary school teachers typically took somewhat longer to complete the survey. On average, secondary school teachers took 10 mins 0 seconds over their answers (SD = 9 mins 28 seconds) and primary school teachers took 6 mins 33 seconds (SD = 4 mins 30 seconds) over their answers. Data collection took place between 3<sup>rd</sup> November 2023 and 8<sup>th</sup> November 2023.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Design</title><sec id="sec006"><title>Understanding the influence of misogyny in schools</title><p>Our principal goal was to understand the extent to which teachers felt that online misogyny was influencing pupils in their schools. In order to address this question, we asked teachers one overarching question and three more specific questions. As an overarching question, we asked them the extent to which they agreed with the following statement: &#x0201c;I am extremely concerned about the influence of online misogyny on pupils in my school&#x0201d;. Answers were collected on a four-point likert scale: 1 (not at all) 2 (a little bit) 3 (moderately) 4 (strongly).</p><p>In order to understand the ways in which online misogyny might be affecting male pupils, we asked teachers &#x0201c;Can you tell us about the last time that you observed online misogyny affecting the behaviour or experiences of a male pupil in your school?&#x0201d;. In order to understand the ways in which online misogyny might be affecting female pupils we asked &#x0201c;Can you tell us about the last time that you observed online misogyny affecting the behaviour or experiences of a female pupil in your school?&#x0201d;. Finally, in order to understand the extent to which teachers might be affected by the influence of online misogyny over their pupils, we asked &#x0201c;Can you tell us about the last time that you were personally affected by the influence of online misogyny on your pupils?&#x0201d;.</p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>Understanding current practice and what strategies might be effective in addressing misogyny in schools</title><p>As a first step towards understanding current practice in how schools address any issues raised by online misogyny we asked teachers &#x0201c;What, if anything, is your school currently doing to tackle the influence of online misogynists?&#x0201d;. In asking this question, we sought to understand whether there are gaps in the current provision that might usefully to be addressed in future research and practice.</p><p>In order to capture elements of best practice and consider possible avenues for future intervention, we also asked teachers &#x0201c;What sort of strategies do you think might be helpful in addressing the influence of online misogynists in schools?&#x0201d;</p><p>Finally, we asked teachers the extent to which they agreed with the following statement &#x0201c;My school would benefit from receiving dedicated teaching materials to tackle the influence of online misogyny&#x0201d;. Responses to this question were requested on a four-point likert scale: 1 (not at all) 2 (a little bit) 3 (moderately) 4 (strongly). We asked this question in order to understand whether there is an appetite for school-based interventions focused specifically on tackling online misogyny.</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Procedure</title><p>Participants were asked a small number of preliminary questions relating to themselves and the type of school they worked in. Following this, they were asked the questions outlined above in a fixed order. Finally, participants were asked if they would be interested in participating in further research on online misogyny and whether there was anything else they would like to share with us on this topic. Participants were thanked for their participation, debriefed, and redirected to Prolific for payment.</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Coding</title><p>The coding scheme was developed by the first author who read participants responses multiple times in order to derive relevant themes. Coding categories were not mutually exclusive and teachers&#x02019; responses could be coded into multiple categories. In order to examine the reliability of the coding we asked a second rater to independently code 25% of these responses. Agreement between the two coders ranged from .71 to .8 for the different questions. The average Kappa = .75. We adopted an iterative approach to developing a maximally reliable coding scheme. We clarified the coding scheme, increasing its specificity, and asked a third rater to code 25% of the data. Agreement between two coders using this improved coding scheme ranged between .815 and .898. The average Kappa = .862.</p><p>For the question &#x0201c;Can you tell us about the last time that you observed online misogyny affecting the behaviour or experiences of a male pupil in your school?&#x0201d;, the first rater coded responses into 6 categories. This rater assigned 59 codes in total. The two raters agreed in 91.4% of cases, Cohen&#x02019;s Kappa = .891. For the question &#x0201c;Can you tell us about the last time that you observed online misogyny affecting the behaviour or experiences of a female pupil in your school?&#x0201d;, the first rater coded responses into 5 categories and assigned 56 codes in total. The two raters agreed in 89% of cases, Cohen&#x02019;s Kappa = .845. For the question &#x0201c;Can you tell us about the last time that you were personally affected by the influence of online misogyny on your pupils?&#x0201d;, the first rater coded responses into 5 categories and assigned 58 codes in total. The two raters agreed in 89.7% of cases, Cohen&#x02019;s Kappa = .863. For the question relating to what schools are currently doing to combat the influence of online misogyny, the first rater coded responses into 11 categories and assigned 68 codes in total. The two raters agreed in 89.7% of cases, Cohen&#x02019;s Kappa = .898. Finally, for the question relating to what schools ought to do to combat the influence of online misogyny, the first rater coded responses into 13 categories and assigned 61 codes in total. The two raters agreed in 83.6% of cases, Cohen&#x02019;s Kappa = .815. The total number of codes varied between questions because any given answer from a participant could reference more than one idea or suggestion and so be assigned more than one code. The results reported below are based on the coding by the first rater.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec010"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec011"><title>Understanding the extent to which online misogyny is a problem in schools</title><sec id="sec012"><title>To what extent do you agree with the following statement? &#x0201c;I am extremely concerned about the influence of online misogyny on pupils in my school&#x0201d;</title><p>76% of secondary teachers moderately or strongly agreed that the influence of online misogyny over their pupils was extremely concerning (see <xref rid="pone.0299339.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>).

These results suggest that dialogues surrounding the influence of online misogyny need to incorporate discussions about primary-aged children as well as adolescents.</p><fig position="float" id="pone.0299339.g001"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0299339.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>The extent to which secondary school teachers (above) and primary school teachers (below) teachers agreed with the statement &#x0201c;I am extremely concerned about the influence of online misogyny on pupils in my school&#x0201d;.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0299339.g001" position="float"/></fig><p>In order to understand whether online misogyny is a greater concern among secondary school teachers than it is among primary school teachers, we converted participants&#x02019; agreement with the statement into numerical estimates (not at all: 1, a little bit: 2, moderately: 3, strongly: 4).

Polling data reveals that a substantial proportion of teenage boys have consumed content created by misogynistic influencers [<xref rid="pone.0299339.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, to date it is unclear how interaction with this toxic online environment might be influencing the behaviour and experiences of young people. As a first step towards answering this question, we conducted a survey with teachers.</p><sec id="sec024"><title>Contribution to knowledge</title><p>76% of secondary school teachers reported that they were extremely concerned about the influence of online misogynists over their pupils. When asked to give an example of how they felt online misogynists were influencing the behaviour and experiencing of pupils in their school, secondary school teachers referenced male pupils making misogynistic comments and engaging in discriminatory behaviour towards female staff and students. One teacher reported an incident in which a male pupil said &#x0201c;It wouldn&#x02019;t be rape if nobody found out&#x0201d;. Another teacher reported an incident in which a male pupil said that &#x0201c;women are too big for their boots&#x0201d; and that soon &#x0201c;women wouldn&#x02019;t be allowed outside&#x0201d;. Other teachers reported cases in which male pupils were abusive towards female partners or sought to physically intimidate them. Some teachers expanded on the negative impact this had on girls&#x02019; well-being, self-esteem and/or school engagement. This aligns with previous research suggesting that experiencing sexism has negative implications for women and girls&#x02019; well-being and mental health [<xref rid="pone.0299339.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>The majority of public discourse and academic debate, as well as polling data, has focused on the ways in which online misogyny might be influencing the behaviour and experiences of young adults and adolescents [<xref rid="pone.0299339.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0299339.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. This focus is understandable as children younger than 12 or 13 are not supposed to have social media accounts [<xref rid="pone.0299339.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Furthermore, influencers themselves appear to target adolescents. Iggy Semmelweis, a crucial organiser behind Andrew Tate&#x02019;s online platform The Real World, posted that the main demographic for their social media machine was 12- to 18-year-old boys [<xref rid="pone.0299339.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Nevertheless, it is important to consider the possibility that children younger than 11 may also be influenced by online misogynists. Many children younger than 12 have access to social media and video sharing platforms either directly or through interaction with older siblings, peers, or adults [<xref rid="pone.0299339.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>Our data suggest that online misogyny may be generating social problems among primary school-aged children as well as adolescents. 60% of the primary school teachers we sampled reported that they were extremely concerned about the influence of online misogyny over their pupils. While primary school teachers report being less concerned than do secondary school teachers, these results remain striking.</p><p>When asked how they felt online misogynists were influencing the behaviour and experiences of their pupils, primary school teachers also wrote about their male pupils making misogynistic comments and engaging in discriminatory behaviour towards female pupils and staff. For example, one primary school teacher reported an incident in which a male pupil said that it is &#x0201c;ok to hurt women because Andrew Tate does it&#x02019;&#x0201d;, while another reported a male primary school pupil telling a female pupil that &#x0201c;she belonged in the kitchen&#x0201d;. Another teacher reported that their male pupils &#x0201c;touch girls non-consensually&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;do not understand why this is inappropriate&#x0201d;. Some primary school teachers also expanded upon the impact this had on female pupils. For example, one teacher wrote that &#x0201c;the majority of the girls in my class have been worried about coming to school due to what the boys may say or do to them&#x0201d;. These results suggest that future intervention efforts need to consider action among primary school-aged children as well as secondary school-aged children.</p><p>In addition to asking about how online misogyny was influencing the behaviour and experiences of pupils, we also asked teachers what, if anything, their schools were currently doing to combat the influence of online misogyny and what they thought their schools ought to do. Approaches varied widely across schools. Among the secondary school teachers we surveyed, 30% reported that their school explicitly taught its pupils about online misogyny or discrimination more broadly. Among primary school teachers we surveyed, 14% reported that their school explicitly taught its pupils about online misogyny or discrimination. Other teachers reported that their school taught related content that could plausibly help pupils to critically engage with the manosphere, for example offering classes on online safety or teaching positive values such as empathy, respect and kindness. It would be valuable for future to research to systematically investigate the prevalence of sexist behaviours among school pupils and how it varies with the particular approach to teaching discrimination adopted by schools.</p><p>The teachers we surveyed suggested a range of possible approaches to tackling online misogyny. These included talking directly to children about misogyny and discrimination as well as focusing on related topics such as online safety and empathy. Other teachers referenced further strategies that could be incorporated into whole school approaches including limiting pupils&#x02019; access to smart phones/the internet, communicating with parents and creating an atmosphere in which children feel comfortable disclosing experiences of discrimination. While teachers&#x02019; responses to this question rarely contained extensive details, they may nevertheless help inform the development of interventions that can be empirically tested in future research.</p><p>Research on anti-bias education suggests that it is crucial to discuss discrimination and its negative consequences with children [<xref rid="pone.0299339.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Multiple interventions to tackle sexism in schools have been developed by researchers including programmes designed to ensure female representation across the curriculum and encourage girls into STEM subjects [<xref rid="pone.0299339.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0299339.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. It may be valuable to supplement the most effective among these approaches with a more specific focus on the discriminatory messaging of the manosphere. Indeed, 90% of secondary school teachers and 68% of primary school teachers reported that they felt their school would benefit from dedicated teaching materials on online misogyny.</p><p>Taken together, these data may help us to understand female experiences in school. There is growing recognition that poor behaviour in schools is disproportionately affecting female pupils and female teachers. Studies from regulatory bodies, charitable organisations, and academics suggest that sexist harassment of girls is on the rise and is becoming normalised among school-aged boys [<xref rid="pone.0299339.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In a 2021 Ofsted review of sexual abuse and harassment in schools and colleges in the UK, 92% of girls reported that they or their peers had been victims of sexist name-calling on a frequent basis. Nearly 90% reported that they had received unsolicited and unwanted explicit sexual images [<xref rid="pone.0299339.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec025"><title>Study limitations</title><p>It is important to acknowledge, however, that our data do not allow for strong causal inference. We asked teachers to tell us about the ways in which they felt online misogynists were influencing the behaviour and experiences of their pupils. However, the causal relationships between viewing online misogyny and holding misogynistic attitudes often remains opaque. Any given example of sexist behaviour, for example disrespecting a female teacher, may be the product of multiple influences including conversations with parents and peers. However, it is noteworthy that some teachers reported that pupils directly discuss misogynistic influencers and use the names of these influencers to justify harassment or derogation of women. For example, one teacher reported that they had &#x0201c;heard hero worship of Andrew Tate&#x0201d; and another reported that &#x0201c;there are regular mentions of figures such as Andrew Tate, and mimicking language and behaviour that students have seen online from influencers such as him&#x0201d;. Other pupils directly refer to social media sites and video sharing platforms when engaging in discriminatory and/or disrespectful behaviour. For example, one teacher described boys telling girls &#x0201c;You wouldn&#x02019;t make much money on Only Fans&#x0201d;. These responses strongly suggest that online misogyny is one important factor to consider when researching the causal origin of sexist beliefs and behaviours.</p><p>When seeking to conceptualise the causal relationship between viewing online misogyny and engaging in sexist behaviour, there are multiple possible pathways. One possibility is that the more online misogyny male pupils view, the more misogynistic their attitudes and behaviour become. This account accords with social learning views of prejudice more broadly [<xref rid="pone.0299339.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and with literature from computer science suggesting that individual engagement with the manosphere appears to become more extreme over time [<xref rid="pone.0299339.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0299339.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Another possibility is that individuals already inclined towards misogynistic viewpoints are drawn to the manosphere. Rather than leading to an increase in misogynistic attitudes, misogynistic influencers may offer young people a new means by which to express their discriminatory views. These proposed processes are not mutually exclusive and could, in principle, occur in parallel. Future longitudinal research, measuring changes in pupils&#x02019; sexist behaviours and engagement with online misogyny over time, could help shed light on the complex causal relationships in this domain. Both possible causal relationships are a cause of concern&#x02013;whether online misogyny is causing increases in sexism or licensing its expression, it is a problematic social trend.</p><p>It is important to acknowledge other limitations of our research. As we surveyed teachers rather than children themselves, our findings do not allow us to speak to the question of prevalence. We cannot conclude from our data how many children are engaging with misogynistic influencers nor can we ascertain how frequently they are doing so. Furthermore, we cannot infer the age at which, on average, misogynistic influencers first exert an influence over the behaviour and experiences of children, nor whether engagement is changing over time. While polling data has provided some insights into exposure across age, it is crucial to develop more sophisticated methods that allow us to directly assess what content young people are interacting with online over time.</p></sec><sec id="sec026"><title>Future research</title><p>In the responses teachers gave to our questions, they tended to focus on the ways in which male pupils who engage with online misogyny perpetrate harm against others. However, it will also be important for future research to consider the ways in which online misogyny may harm boys themselves. One rarely mentioned but important theme from the qualitative data we collected is the ways in which online misogyny might increase discrimination against members of the LGBT+ community, including against gay men and boys. For example, one male teacher reported that &#x0201c;as a gay person I am very aware of the language used&#x02014;the word "GAY" is often used to denote negative qualities. I also feel sometimes an underlying threat that if I discipline a boy at the school he could turn around and claim I had touched him inappropriately&#x0201d;. The impact of the manosphere on LGBT+ pupils and staff is a crucially important topic for future research.</p><p>Another important direction for future research is the extent to which online misogyny may be influencing educational attainment in boys. Our data suggest that male pupils who engage with misogyny sometimes question the authority of female teachers. More broadly, misogynistic influencers often seek to undermine support for traditional systems of authority and academic achievement, instead advocating get rich quick schemes sometimes involving sex trafficking, gambling and cryptocurrency [<xref rid="pone.0299339.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Previous research has demonstrated that girls outperform boys academically throughout the school years [<xref rid="pone.0299339.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. It is important for future research to assess whether engagement with the manosphere is exacerbating this trend over time.</p><p>Perhaps the most important direction for future research is to understand how to tackle the influence of online misogyny over children and young people. Clearly this social problem requires intervention at multiple levels. One aspect of this coordinated approach is lessons designed to help children critically engage with misogynistic information they hear online or from their peers. Broader forms of social change, including changes to how social media companies operate, are also crucial. In principle, social media companies and video sharing platforms have policies to discourage extremist content on their sites. For example, individual influencers can be demonetized or even banned [<xref rid="pone.0299339.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. While misogynistic influencers are sometimes censured in this way, enormous quantities of hateful content remains available online and the reach of this content is often increased through recommender algorithms [<xref rid="pone.0299339.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Stricter regulation is crucial.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec027"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Taken together, our data offer important insights into the ways in which engagement with the manosphere appears to be influencing the behaviour and experiences of children in schools. Teachers report that male pupils discuss misogynistic influencers with some regularly and that misogynistic influencers appear to motivate discriminatory behaviour towards female peers and female teachers. It is clear from this work, and from the broader literature, that the influence of the manosphere over young people needs to be a crucial priority for policy makers, educators and academics.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank Lily Smith for assistance with coding.
