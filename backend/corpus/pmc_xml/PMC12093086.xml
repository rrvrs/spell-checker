It typically occurs in children and adolescents, but it can also appear in adults. Sorting nexin 10 (SNX10) has recently been identified as a significant regulatory factor in various tumors, although its specific roles remain contested. However, its function in B-ALL has not been previously explored. The present study investigated the role of SNX10 in B-ALL pathogenesis. Bioinformatics analysis identified SNX10 as a Core Hub gene in the B-ALL signaling network, with significantly reduced expression in patients with B-ALL. These findings were corroborated through analysis of clinical bone marrow samples and B-ALL cell lines. Functional <italic>in vitro</italic> studies revealed that SNX10 knockdown markedly inhibited B-ALL cell proliferation, increased apoptosis, and arrested cells in the G0/G1 phase. By contrast, SNX10 overexpression enhanced cell proliferation, suppressed apoptosis and promoted G2/M phase progression. Proteomic analysis further implicated the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in mediating the effects of SNX10. Specifically, SNX10 overexpression increased the phosphorylation levels of PI3K and Akt, while SNX10 knockdown had the opposite effect. <italic>In vivo</italic> experiments demonstrated that elevated SNX10 expression accelerated leukemia progression in a mouse model. Collectively, these findings highlighted the pivotal role of SNX10 in promoting B-ALL cell proliferation via the PI3K pathway, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target for B-ALL and providing a foundation for future investigations.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia</kwd><kwd>sorting nexin 10</kwd><kwd>PI3K/Akt signaling pathway</kwd><kwd>proliferation</kwd><kwd>apoptosis</kwd><kwd>cell cycle</kwd><kwd>bioinformatics analysis</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>National Natural Science Foundation of China</funding-source><award-id>82260324</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>Science and Technology Program of Guizhou</funding-source><award-id>Qiankehe Fundamentals-ZK (2023) General (394, 398)</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>Key Lab for Chronic Disease Biomarkers of Guizhou Medical University</funding-source><award-id>2024fy004</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>Institutional Fund of Guizhou Medical University Affiliated Hospital</funding-source><award-id>gyfybsky-2022-40</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>The present study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant no. 82260324), the Science and Technology Program of Guizhou [grant no.

Treatment strategies for B-ALL include chemotherapy (<xref rid="b4-or-54-1-08911" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), targeted therapy (<xref rid="b5-or-54-1-08911" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>) and immunotherapy (<xref rid="b6-or-54-1-08911" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), which together improve remission rates and overall outcomes. Although &#x0003e;90% of patients achieve initial complete response through chemotherapy, up to 50% of patients with B-ALL experience a relapse, developing chemotherapy-resistant disease (<xref rid="b7-or-54-1-08911" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Immunotherapy has shown promise in reducing relapse by effectively targeting minimum residual disease, but its efficacy remains limited due to the intrinsically low immunogenicity of B-ALL cells (<xref rid="b7-or-54-1-08911" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Therefore, identifying novel therapeutic targets to enhance treatment response and improve long-term survival remains a critical priority in B-ALL research.</p><p>In 2023, Krali <italic>et al</italic> (<xref rid="b8-or-54-1-08911" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>) developed a machine learning algorithm to patients with subtype pediatric B-ALL based on a molecular profile, generating the GSE227832 dataset. This dataset includes gene expression profiles from 315 newly diagnosed cases, 8 relapse cases, 10 healthy donors, and 2 cases in remission. By analyzing the GSE227832 dataset in combination with the TARGET-ALL-P3 dataset [from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)] including clinical data from 79 patients, three core hub genes closely associated with the progression of B-ALL were identified: Glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor (GIPR), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and sorting nexin 10 (SNX10). These genes, all linked to disease progression, present promising targets for further investigation into the molecular mechanisms driving B-ALL. In the present study, a focus was placed on SNX10 due to its unique and previously unexplored role in hematologic malignancies, particularly in B-ALL.</p><p>SNX10 is a member of the phosphoinositide-binding protein family and contains a phox homology (PX) domain, facilitating intracellular protein transport through interaction with phosphoinositide-enriched membranes (<xref rid="b9-or-54-1-08911" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Known to be highly expressed in bones and intestines, SNX10 regulates various physiological processes, including osteoclast bone resorption (<xref rid="b10-or-54-1-08911" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), gastric acid secretion (<xref rid="b11-or-54-1-08911" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>) and glucose metabolism (<xref rid="b12-or-54-1-08911" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Increasing evidence suggests that SNX10 also plays complex roles in cancer. For example, SNX10 has demonstrated tumor-suppressive effects in colorectal cancer (<xref rid="b13-or-54-1-08911" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), driving inflammation-related colorectal cancer through a chaperone-mediated autophagy mechanism. By contrast, elevated SNX10 expression in cervical cancer has been associated with increased invasion and metastasis (<xref rid="b14-or-54-1-08911" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), and this is associated with a poor prognosis in patients with glioblastoma (<xref rid="b15-or-54-1-08911" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) suggesting that the role of SNX10 in cancer is context-dependent. These findings underscore the dual role that SNX10 may play in cancer biology, likely influenced by tissue type and cellular context. Despite mounting evidence linking SNX10 to various aspects of cancer, its role in B-ALL remains undetermined, to the best of our knowledge. Given the regulatory functions of SNX10 in intracellular transport and signaling, it is plausible that it could influence B-ALL pathophysiology by interacting with key signaling pathways.</p><p>The PI3K/Akt signaling pathway is a critical cell signaling pathway involved in various biological processes such as cell survival (<xref rid="b16-or-54-1-08911" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>), proliferation (<xref rid="b17-or-54-1-08911" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>), differentiation (<xref rid="b18-or-54-1-08911" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), migration (<xref rid="b19-or-54-1-08911" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) and metabolism (<xref rid="b20-or-54-1-08911" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), and is well-established to be implicated in various hematologic malignancies, including leukemia (<xref rid="b21-or-54-1-08911" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Typically activated by growth factors (<xref rid="b22-or-54-1-08911" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) or signaling molecules binding to cell membrane receptors, this pathway triggers a cascade leading to PI3K activation and subsequently Akt phosphorylation. p-Akt then regulates cell cycle progression through the mTOR pathway (<xref rid="b23-or-54-1-08911" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) and inhibits apoptosis by modulating Bcl-2 family proteins (<xref rid="b24-or-54-1-08911" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Additionally, the PI3K/Akt/PIKfyve/PtdIns(3,5)P2 signaling pathway is crucial for viral entry into cells (<xref rid="b25-or-54-1-08911" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>), with PIKfyve, which phosphorylates PI3P to PI(3,5)P2, colocalizing with Snx10 in early endosomes of osteoclasts to regulate endosome/lysosome homeostasis (<xref rid="b26-or-54-1-08911" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). However, the potential relationship between SNX10 and the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in B-ALL has not been previously examined.</p><p>In the present study, the role of SNX10 in B-ALL was examined. Using systematic <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments, it was revealed that SNX10 impacted B-ALL proliferation, apoptosis and migration by modulating the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. These findings provide novel insights into the involvement of SNX10 in B-ALL progression, addressing previously unexplored questions regarding its function in leukemia and highlighting potential therapeutic avenues for the management of B-ALL.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Screening of common differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in B-ALL</title><p>The GSE227832 dataset was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database (<uri xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/</uri>) for differential analysis.

Samples with gene expression levels above the mean were categorized into the high expression group (H), whereas those at or below the average were categorized into the low expression group (L). To identify survival-associated DEGs (Survdiffs), a log-rank test from the survival Package (<uri xlink:href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/survival/index.html">https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/survival/index.html</uri>) was performed to compare survival rates between the two groups in R.

The present study addressed this gap by investigating the role of SNX10 in B-ALL and its potential mechanisms. It was found that upregulated expression of SNX10 activated the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, thereby reducing apoptosis and increasing the proportion of cells in the G2/M phase, thus promoting the proliferation of B-ALL cells and accelerating disease progression. By contrast, SNX10 was generally downregulated in the samples of patients with B-ALL, as well as in B-ALL cell lines. Knockdown of SNX10 resulted in reduced PI3K-Akt signaling, an increased proportion of cells in the G0/G1 phase and increased apoptosis, thus reducing the proliferation of B-ALL cells. The <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments further supported these findings, illustrating that high SNX10 expression contributed to aggressive behaviors of B-ALL.</p><p>High expression of SNX10 and poorer prognosis in B-ALL is a trend also observed in cervical cancer (<xref rid="b14-or-54-1-08911" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) and glioblastoma (<xref rid="b15-or-54-1-08911" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). The expression levels of SNX10 differentially affect the progression and prognosis of various tumors. For example, in osteosarcoma tissues (<xref rid="b36-or-54-1-08911" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>), high expression of SNX10 inhibits the proliferation, migration and invasion of tumor cells. Additionally, low expression of SNX10 has been associated with a poor prognosis in patients with stomach adenocarcinoma (<xref rid="b37-or-54-1-08911" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>) and colorectal cancer (<xref rid="b13-or-54-1-08911" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). These observations suggest that SNX10 may act as a bifunctional gene, with its effects depending on tissue type and cellular context. The impact of SNX10 on B-ALL also appears to depend on its expression level within the context of the specific disease; however, the specific molecular mechanisms require further experimental exploration.</p><p>SNX10 has been demonstrated to be involved in several cellular processes, including intracellular transport (<xref rid="b38-or-54-1-08911" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>) and signal transduction (<xref rid="b15-or-54-1-08911" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), as well as in physiological processes such as cellular absorption and secretion (<xref rid="b10-or-54-1-08911" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="b11-or-54-1-08911" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), and intracellular glucose metabolism (<xref rid="b12-or-54-1-08911" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). In healthy populations, SNX10 is expressed at high levels, while its expression is reduced in patients with B-ALL, which may reflect specific metabolic or transcriptional regulatory changes in leukemia cells. This decrease in expression may be related to mechanisms that inhibit the proliferation, survival, or drug resistance of leukemia cells <italic>in vivo</italic>. Numerous studies have shown that not only tumor cells (<xref rid="b39-or-54-1-08911" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>) but also immune cells (<xref rid="b40-or-54-1-08911" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>) in the tumor microenvironment undergo metabolic reprogramming, which may directly affect the biological activity of tumor cells and is closely related to tumor drug resistance and malignant progression (<xref rid="b41-or-54-1-08911" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). In B-ALL, the expression of SNX10 may be influenced by the tumor microenvironment, leading to its reduced expression in tumor cells. Although certain patients with B-ALL exhibit relatively high levels of SNX10 expression, this high expression does not necessarily indicate a functionally &#x02018;healthy&#x02019; state. Conversely, aberrantly relatively upregulated SNX10 expression may be associated with cell proliferation, an anti-apoptotic effect, or treatment resistance, resulting in a poor prognosis. In the present study, both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments demonstrated that overexpression of SNX10 modified the cell cycle of leukemia cells, suppressed apoptosis, and promoted cell survival. Upregulated expression of SNX10 may signify a highly active state of tumor cells, associated with increased aggressiveness or a higher probability of recurrence. Therefore, despite the elevated expression levels of SNX10 observed in healthy individuals, its expression pattern and impact in leukemia may be associated with tumor progression, exhibiting a duality in its effects.</p><p>The present study is the first to demonstrate that SNX10 regulates the proliferation, apoptosis and cell cycle processes of B-ALL cells via the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, to the best of our knowledge. This finding suggests that SNX10 may play an important role in the development of B-ALL and could be associated with the onset of leukemia, resistance to treatment and a poorer prognosis. Consequently, SNX10 has the potential to serve as a biomarker for B-ALL and a therapeutic target for drug development. For example, by evaluating the expression levels of SNX10 across a range of populations of patients with B-ALL, high-risk groups can be identified, and subsequent personalized treatment plans can be formulated (<xref rid="b42-or-54-1-08911" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="b43-or-54-1-08911" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). Alternatively, by developing oral nanoparticles of SNX10-shRNA plasmids (<xref rid="b44-or-54-1-08911" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="b45-or-54-1-08911" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>) or through the use of an SNX10 protein-protein interaction inhibitor such as DC-SX029 (<xref rid="b46-or-54-1-08911" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>) in combination with existing treatment regimens, particularly targeted drugs such as PI3K/Akt inhibitors (<xref rid="b5-or-54-1-08911" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b14-or-54-1-08911" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="b32-or-54-1-08911" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>), it may be possible to overcome resistance and enhance therapeutic efficacy. Therefore, further research into the specific mechanisms of SNX10 in B-ALL cells is warranted. By exploring the interactions between SNX10 and the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in-depth, novel therapeutic targets may be uncovered. Additionally, it is also worth investigating whether the function of SNX10 is regulated by other cellular signaling pathways, which can aid in constructing a more comprehensive model of the pathogenesis of B-ALL and promote the implementation of personalized treatment.</p><p>B-ALL is a genetically heterogeneous disease (<xref rid="b47-or-54-1-08911" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). The limited variety of cell lines and clinical samples utilized in the present study may hinder the applicability and statistical relevance of the results. Future research should aim to enhance the sample size, especially in multicenter clinical trials, to confirm the role of SNX10 across patients from different demographic backgrounds. Furthermore, the effects of targeting SNX10 in normal cells were not evaluated, necessitating further studies to assess the selectivity of its therapeutic targets to reduce potential side effects. Additionally, the present study used a NOD-SCID mouse model (<xref rid="b48-or-54-1-08911" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>) to investigate the role of SNX10 <italic>in vivo</italic>. While this model is widely used in cancer research due to its lack of functional T and B cells (<xref rid="b49-or-54-1-08911" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>), allowing human cell transplantation, it may not fully recapitulate the human tumor microenvironment, especially in terms of immune interactions. B-ALL progression and treatment responses are complex processes influenced by the immune system, and the absence of immune cells in NOD-SCID mice limits the study of these interactions. Furthermore, the mouse microenvironment differs from the human setting, potentially affecting B-ALL cell behavior and limiting clinical relevance. Although the NOD-SCID model is valuable for drug screening and mechanistic research, future studies may benefit from employing more humanized models, such as humanized mice (<xref rid="b50-or-54-1-08911" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>) or transgenic models (<xref rid="b51-or-54-1-08911" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>), to simulate the immune interactions and microenvironmental conditions more accurately. Cross-validation with multiple models may enhance the reliability of these findings and facilitate their clinical translation.</p><p>In conclusion, the present study identified SNX10 as a core hub gene within the B-ALL-related signaling network and revealed its significant impact on B-ALL cell biology. Through both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments, it was found that SNX10 regulated the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, affecting B-ALL cell proliferation, apoptosis, cell cycle progression, and disease progression. These findings provide novel insights into the potential of SNX10 as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target for the management of B-ALL, supporting further research into SNX10-modulating therapies that could improve treatment outcomes for patients with B-ALL.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="SD1-or-54-1-08911" position="float" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Supporting Data</title></caption><media xlink:href="Supplementary_Data1.pdf" id="d67e727" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="SD2-or-54-1-08911" position="float" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Supporting Data</title></caption><media xlink:href="Supplementary_Data2.pdf" id="d67e731" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="SD3-or-54-1-08911" position="float" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Supporting Data</title></caption><media xlink:href="Supplementary_Data3.xlsx" id="d67e735" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="SD4-or-54-1-08911" position="float" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Supporting Data</title></caption><media xlink:href="Supplementary_Data4.xlsx" id="d67e739" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="SD5-or-54-1-08911" position="float" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Supporting Data</title></caption><media xlink:href="Supplementary_Data5.xlsx" id="d67e743" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Not applicable.</p></ack><sec sec-type="data-availability"><title>Availability of data and materials</title><p>The data generated in the present study may be found in the ProteomeXchange Consortium under accession number PXD061830 or at the following URL: <uri xlink:href="https://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD061830">http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD061830</uri>.
