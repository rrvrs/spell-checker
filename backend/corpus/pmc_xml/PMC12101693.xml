</self-uri><abstract><p>Elevated &#x003b2;-glucuronidase activity is associated with the production of toxic metabolites that contribute to tumor development and other diseases. Inhibiting this enzyme may offer therapeutic potential, including the prevention of colonic carcinogenesis. This study investigates the antidiabetic potential of metabolites derived from <italic toggle="yes">Fernandoa adenophylla</italic>, using &#x003b2;-glucuronidase as a model enzyme linked to hyperglycemia. Both <italic toggle="yes">Escherichia coli</italic> and human isoforms of &#x003b2;-glucuronidase were evaluated.

Introduction</title><p>&#x003b2;-glucuronidase is a lysosomal enzyme found in mammals, bacteria, and other organisms, where it plays a key role in the hydrolysis of &#x003b2;-d-glucuronides. In humans, this enzyme is present in various tissues, including the colon and human milk, and contributes to the reabsorption of substances like bilirubin and estrogens. Altered &#x003b2;-glucuronidase activity has been associated with several pathological conditions, including cancers (e.g., breast, colon), diabetes mellitus (DM), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and infections [<xref rid="pone.0324100.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0324100.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Its role in tumor development, inflammation, and metabolic disorders makes &#x003b2;-glucuronidase an attractive target for therapeutic interventions, particularly in cancer treatment, neonatal jaundice, diabetes management, and anti-inflammatory therapies.</p><p>Due to the broad properties of this enzyme, inhibition of its activity has become a target for diagnostic and therapeutic applications in (a) anticancer chemotherapy - due to the enzyme&#x02019;s role in tumor development and metastasis; (b) neonatal jaundice treatment - the enzyme is highly expressed in human milk and has been implicated in the hyperbilirubinemia development; (c) diabetes mellitus management, due to the demonstrated relationship between disease status and enzyme activity levels, as well as concomitant periodontitis [<xref rid="pone.0324100.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]; and (d) anti-inflammatory treatment, due to its pro-inflammatory role following extensive release from degranulated mast cells and neutrophils. Inhibition of &#x003b2;-glucuronidase alleviated these states and their side effects, thereby improving the efficacy of treatment regimens [<xref rid="pone.0324100.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>Some natural products and synthetic scaffolds have shown potential as &#x003b2;-glucuronidase inhibitors, with a few making their way into clinical use despite their moderate to weak pharmacokinetic profiles. Plants, long revered for their role in producing bioactive compounds, have been extensively studied for their medicinal properties throughout human history. Recently, these natural compounds are being explored as novel pharmaceutical scaffolds for developing modern drugs, a trend that has been well-documented [<xref rid="pone.0324100.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. With the increasing interest in plant-based substances and herbal remedies, they are emerging as a preferred alternative to synthetic pharmaceuticals, offering cost-effectiveness and a reduced likelihood of adverse effects. This shift is particularly significant given the high costs and undesirable side effects often associated with synthetic drugs and the growing concern about their role in developing antibiotic resistance in bacterial pathogens [<xref rid="pone.0324100.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Identifying novel therapeutic applications from medicinal plants remains a critical aspect of pharmaceutical research. Ethnobotanical studies have played an essential role in discovering and utilizing these plant species [<xref rid="pone.0324100.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The literature extensively covers the diverse range of plant-based medicines and isolated compounds investigated for their therapeutic potential [<xref rid="pone.0324100.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. It is also important to highlight that the indigenous knowledge held by local communities regarding the medicinal properties of plants has been instrumental in developing many pharmaceutical drugs [<xref rid="pone.0324100.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The pharmaceutical industry has greatly benefited from phytochemical, biological, and pharmacological studies [<xref rid="pone.0324100.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Numerous plant species with potential health benefits have already been scientifically investigated. However, many plants remain under-researched, leaving gaps in understanding their potential therapeutic applications. The primary objective of this study was to investigate and evaluate the medicinal properties of <italic toggle="yes">Fernandoa adenophylla</italic>, a species of the Bignoniaceae family that occurs in regions of Africa and Southeast Asia [<xref rid="pone.0324100.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Various phytochemicals in this plant have been well documented in scientific literature. Key compounds include tecomoquinone-I, &#x003b2;-amyrin, lapachol, &#x003b1;-lapachone, &#x003b2;-sitosterol, adenophylone, dehydro-&#x003b1;-lapachone, and dehydro-iso-&#x003b1;-lapachone [<xref rid="pone.0324100.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. These compounds are of particular interest due to their potential as &#x003b2;-glucuronidase inhibitors, which is the focus of our research.</p><p><italic toggle="yes">Fernandoa adenophylla</italic> has been traditionally used by local communities for various medical purposes, including managing amenorrhea, premature ejaculation, diabetes, night emissions, antiseptic treatments, antimicrobial effects, and skin diseases [<xref rid="pone.0324100.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. It is noteworthy that all species within the Bignoniaceae family are known to produce lapachol in significant quantities. The extensive literature on lapachol and its derivatives highlights their broad spectrum of biological activities. Compounds such as lapachol, lapachone, indanone derivatives, and peshawarquinone have been reported for their notable anti-inflammatory, analgesic, muscle relaxant, phosphodiesterase-1 inhibitory, and sedative properties [<xref rid="pone.0324100.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0324100.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>This study focuses on evaluating the &#x003b2;-glucuronidase inhibitory activity of five compounds isolated from <italic toggle="yes">Fernandoa adenophylla</italic>. The rationale for selecting this plant stems from its documented phytochemical profile and its traditional use in managing conditions linked to &#x003b2;-glucuronidase activity. Additionally, molecular docking studies were employed to further investigate the mechanism of inhibition, providing insights into the therapeutic potential of these compounds..</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>2.

A voucher specimen, labeled with the unique identifier UOP/Bot987, has been deposited in the herbarium for future reference and research purposes.</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>2.4. Isolation and extraction</title><p>The heartwood roots of <italic toggle="yes">Fernandoa adenophylla</italic> were subjected to a shade-drying process for approximately 40&#x02013;45 days. The dried material was pulverized into a fine powder and subsequently underwent extraction in a soxhlet apparatus using methanol as the solvent for 6 hours. The crude methanolic extract was subjected to sequential fractionation based on the increasing polarity of the solvents used. Following the process of fractionation and subsequent concentration on a rotary evaporator under reduced pressure, the fractions obtained from n-hexane, dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, and methanol resulted in extract yields of 8&#x02009;g, 15&#x02009;g, 25&#x02009;g, and 40&#x02009;g, respectively. Column chromatography (CC) was conducted on the methanol fraction (25&#x02009;g) utilizing silica gel (70&#x02013;230 mesh) as stationary phase and a chloroform: methanol (10:0&#x02009;&#x02192;&#x02009;0:10) mobile phase. The procedure yielded 114 fractions, which were subsequently consolidated into three main fractions based on TLC profiles: 1 (10.0&#x02009;&#x02192;&#x02009;8:2, 600&#x02009;mL, 6.2&#x02009;g), 2 (8:2&#x02009;&#x02192;&#x02009;7:3, 1500&#x02009;mL, 12&#x02009;g), and 3 (7:3&#x02009;&#x02192;&#x02009;3:7, 1500&#x02009;mL, 3.5&#x02009;g). Fraction 1 on loading to a column having silica as stationary phase and chloroform (10:0, 1000&#x02009;mL) yielded Compound (<bold>5</bold>) (30.42&#x02009;mg). Fraction 2 (3.5&#x02009;g) underwent further CC with chloroform and methanol (10:0&#x02009;&#x02192;&#x02009;6:4), resulting in two subfractions: 2.1 (10.0&#x02009;&#x02192;&#x02009;7:3, 600&#x02009;mL, 1.5&#x02009;g) and 2.2 (7:3&#x02009;&#x02192;&#x02009;6:4, 1500&#x02009;mL, 3&#x02009;g). The fraction 2.1 was loaded to the small column on silica and eluting solvent chloroform and methanol (10:0&#x02009;&#x02192;&#x02009;8:2, 400&#x02009;ml), yielding compound (<bold>4</bold>) (14.32&#x02009;mg). CC of fraction 2.2 using chloroform: methanol (6:4) produced compound (<bold>1</bold>) (12.56&#x02009;mg). Fraction 3 (3.5&#x02009;g) was subjected to CC on silica with chloroform: methanol (10.0&#x02009;&#x02192;&#x02009;7:3), generating three sub-fractions: 3.1 (10.0&#x02009;&#x02192;&#x02009;7:3, 300&#x02009;mL, 1.5&#x02009;g), 3.2 (7:3&#x02009;&#x02192;&#x02009;5:5, 700&#x02009;mL, 2.3&#x02009;g), and 3.3 (5:5&#x02009;&#x02192;&#x02009;2:8, 400&#x02009;mL, 0.5&#x02009;g). The sub-fraction 3.1 on separation through the column using a solvent in the ratio (8:2&#x02009;&#x02192;&#x02009;5:5, 800&#x02009;mL) yielded compound (<bold>3</bold>) (9.27&#x02009;mg). Subsequently, CC of sub-fraction 3.2 (2.3&#x02009;g) on silica gel using chloroform: methanol (7:3) yielded compound (<bold>2</bold>) (8.10&#x02009;mg).

The assessment of the inhibitory activity of compounds (<bold>1&#x02013;5</bold>) against &#x003b2;-glucuronidase was carried out by monitoring the absorbance of p-nitrophenol, which is generated from the hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl-b-D-glucuronide (N-1627), at a specific wavelength of 405&#x02009;nm utilizing a spectrophotometer. The experimental procedure involved the utilization of a reaction mixture consisting of 185 &#x000b5;L of a 0.1 M acetate buffer, 5 &#x000b5;L of a test compound solution (dissolved in 100% DMSO), and 10 &#x000b5;L of an enzyme solution (prepared using the buffer above at a concentration of 1 U/well or 1 U/250 &#x000b5;L). This reaction mixture was subjected to incubation at a temperature of 37 &#x000b0;C for thirty minutes. Subsequently, a volume of 50 &#x000b5;L of a solution containing p-nitrophenyl-&#x003b2;-D-glucuronide at a concentration of 0.4&#x02009;mM was meticulously introduced into each well. The plates were then analyzed using a multiple reader, specifically the SpectraMax plus 384 model manufactured by Molecular Devices, located in San Jose, CA, USA.

Discussion</title><p>Natural products continue to be valuable sources for drug discovery, especially for chronic diseases like diabetes mellitus (DM). These compounds have demonstrated various bioactivities, including anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antimicrobial properties, making them valuable candidates for treating chronic conditions. Among these, DM has garnered significant attention due to its increasing prevalence and the limitations of current synthetic therapies. In searching for safer and more effective treatments, natural products offer promising alternatives for managing DM and related metabolic disorders. DM and obesity stand as one of the most prevalent chronic health challenges worldwide [<xref rid="pone.0324100.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0324100.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The management of DM primarily relies on synthetic drugs, especially in developing countries, while monthly depot injections like semaglutide are available in more developed regions [<xref rid="pone.0324100.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. However, there remains an urgent need for safer, more effective, and cost-efficient antidiabetic treatments. The exploration of natural products [<xref rid="pone.0324100.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] and their isolated compounds [<xref rid="pone.0324100.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] continues to be a promising area of research in this quest. This study was undertaken to discover a potent and novel antidiabetic remedy.</p><p>Previous research has reported the antidiabetic potential of <italic toggle="yes">Fernandoa adenophylla</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0324100.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Given the promising results of the plant extract, we conducted a detailed investigation into its chemical constituents. &#x003b2;-glucuronidase, an enzyme essential for human metabolism, is critical in carbohydrate breakdown [<xref rid="pone.0324100.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. However, the excessive activity of this enzyme is linked to the release of free glucose, which can lead to hyperglycemia and, ultimately, type 2 diabetes mellitus. The pathological accumulation of glucosylceramide, resulting from &#x003b2;-glucuronidase deficiency, is also associated with Gaucher&#x02019;s disease [<xref rid="pone.0324100.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324100.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Therefore, inhibiting &#x003b2;-glucuronidase has become a key strategy in managing type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2).</p><p>In our study, the isolated compounds from <italic toggle="yes">Fernandoa adenophylla</italic> showed substantial inhibitory activity against &#x003b2;-glucosidase, supporting their potential antidiabetic properties. The compounds exhibited powerful binding behavior to the target enzyme through molecular docking tests together with substantial interface connections which supported their inhibitory mechanisms. Molecular dynamics simulations proved the stability of these interactions during a 100-nanosecond simulation run. Without extending enzyme kinetics analysis more certain confirmation about the specific binding site on &#x003b2;-glucuronidase cannot be achieved since multiple ligand-binding sites exist. Enzyme kinetics experiments represent the essential research step for future validation because they will confirm the specific binding site and substantiate the docking study findings. The top-performing compound showed significant structural stability and consistent binding, suggesting its potential as a promising lead molecule for further development. Our findings indicate that the antidiabetic effects of <italic toggle="yes">Fernandoa adenophylla</italic> may stem from its &#x003b2;-glucosidase inhibitory activity, which could effectively reduce glucose levels and mitigate hyperglycemia. The combined in vitro and in silico results support the therapeutic potential of these compounds and provide a foundation for future research aimed at developing natural, enzyme-targeting antidiabetic drugs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec020"><title>5.

According to this study, isolated chemical constituents (1-5) of Fernandoa adenophylla exhibited remarkable antidiabetic activity.

(Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)</p><p>Reviewer #1: The authors adequately responded to all comments and suggestions raised to improve their manuscript.</p><p>Response: Thank you.</p><p>Reviewer #2: In my opinion, the manuscript &#x0201c;Investigation of the inhibitory potential of secondary metabolites isolated from Fernandoa adenophylla against Beta-glucuronidase via molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation studies&#x0201d; is well written and presents interesting information. But I would like to point out some issues which can be revised:</p><p>Abstract: Revise the abstract to align with conventional standards of clarity, logical flow, and objectivity.</p><p>Response: Dear reviewer, thank you for your suggestion. We have revised the abstract to make it more concise and clear.</p><p>Introduction: The introduction section should be rewritten in a more focused manner, in concise paragraphs. The statement of the problem and the rationale of this study is unclear. Although the authors have included some studies, it is needed to include additional literature on this plant, and a justification of its choice for the current investigation. According to this study, isolated chemical constituents (1-5) of Fernandoa adenophylla exhibited remarkable antidiabetic activity. Additionally, what are all the major phytocompounds have been reported and so on can be added.</p><p>Response: Dear reviewer, thank you for your suggestion. The introduction has been revised as per the suggestions.</p><p>Result: Appropriate inferential statistics are missing, especially for results. This is particularly important in interpreting the results, appraising their validity, and drawing appropriate conclusions.</p><p>Response: We thank the reviewer for the comment. The results were presented as mean &#x000b1; SEM from triplicate experiments, analyzed using ANOVA to ensure consistency. Due to the limited sample size (n=3), further inferential statistics (e.g., p-values) were not applied to avoid overinterpretation. However, conclusions were supported through complementary molecular docking, MD simulations, and MM-GBSA analyses, providing robust validation of the findings.</p><p>Discussion : The discussion section should be revised and focused on interpretation, relationships with reports from other scholars in the field, and implication of the obtained results.</p><p>Response: Dear reviewer, we have revised the discussion as per the suggestions</p><p>Reviewer #3: I recommend the acceptance of the manuscript. One additional comment I just mention that author should write the unit of binding energy in the manuscript.</p><p>Response: We thank the reviewer for the suggestion. The unit of binding energy (kcal/mol) has been added in the text and Table 4.</p><p>________________________________________</p><p>7.
