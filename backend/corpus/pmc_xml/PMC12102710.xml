However, reduced mortality from the I-8 contributed to enormous improvements in sub-Saharan Africa, accounting for 21.4 (95% UB, 20.6-22.2) years of a 31-year gap in 2000 and 11.4 (95% UB, 10.9-11.8) years of a 22-year gap in 2019. India transitioned from having most of the gap accounted for by the I-8 in 2000, or 11.9 (95% UB, 11.0-13.0) years of a 19.6-year life expectancy gap, to having a larger share accounted for by the NCD-7 in 2019.</p></sec><sec id="ab-zoi250409-10"><title>Conclusions and Relevance</title><p>This cross-sectional study suggests that a limited number of causes account for most life expectancy disparities.

We focus on 2019 to avoid distortions due to COVID-19. We decomposed the difference in life expectancy at birth between the North Atlantic and other regions and countries into components (in terms of years) attributable to the 33 causes of death. The North Atlantic was chosen since it had the greatest life expectancy (82 years<sup><xref rid="zoi250409r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>) of the regions highlighted here, and has had high living standards and universal health coverage over a long period.</p><p>We used the Pollard decomposition method<sup><xref rid="zoi250409r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="zoi250409r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> to quantify the contribution of each cause to the total life expectancy gap and provide 95% uncertainty bounds (UB) obtained from 1000 Monte Carlo simulations (eAppendix 2 in <xref rid="note-ZOI250409-1-s" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplement 1</xref>). We present detailed results for the 6 other CIH regions and 3 most populous countries as well as a summary for 165 countries with at least 2 years&#x02019; lower life expectancy than the North Atlantic.

The North Atlantic in 2019 was also used as a benchmark when analyzing other years in the target locations to facilitate comparisons across time. We also show results after removing causes that contributed negatively to the life expectancy gap, which occurred when the target location had achieved lower cause-specific mortality rates than the North Atlantic (eTable 7 in <xref rid="note-ZOI250409-1-s" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>We performed 3 sensitivity analyses.

Negative contribution suggests that the gap in life expectancy would have been greater had it not been for lower mortality than in the North Atlantic. Therefore, the contribution of some causes or groups of causes can be greater than the total life expectancy gap.

Still, the contribution of tobacco-related NCDs to the life expectancy gap was similar for male and female individuals in China and greater for female individuals in India, which may suggest that other factors, such as outdoor<sup><xref rid="zoi250409r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> and indoor<sup><xref rid="zoi250409r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> air pollution, may play a role.</p><p>An expansion of maternal and child health interventions (especially prevention of diarrhea, neonatal conditions, and lower respiratory infections) and tuberculosis interventions remains essential in sub-Saharan Africa, India, Central Asia, and Western Pacific and Southeast Asia.

However, studies using amenable mortality remind us that further improvements can be achieved even in our benchmark&#x02014;the North Atlantic&#x02014;by reducing avoidable deaths.</p><sec id="H2-10-ZOI250409"><title>Limitations</title><p>Some limitations and caveats should be kept in mind when interpreting these results. First, there are caveats related to using life expectancy to identify current shortcomings in health. Mortality often results from repeated or extended periods of adverse exposures (eg, smoking, diet, and early life infections and undernutrition) involving many interlinked factors. Since (period) life expectancy gives a snapshot of current age-specific mortality, the decomposition will not capture recent changes in underlying risk factors that may impact mortality rates with delays. For example, recent dramatic declines in tobacco use in India are likely to reduce the impact of tobacco-related NCDs in the future.<sup><xref rid="zoi250409r45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup> Therefore, the results from this study should be viewed together with information on recent changes in underlying risk factors.</p><p>Second, there are limitations related to data quality (see further discussion in eAppendix 1 in <xref rid="note-ZOI250409-1-s" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplement 1</xref>). Data in countries without well-functioning vital registration systems relied on various methods and sources&#x02014;such as verbal autopsies and modeled estimates from Global Burden of Disease 2021.<sup><xref rid="zoi250409r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="zoi250409r46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup> For example, death registration data were completely unavailable or unusable for 74 countries, including large countries such as India and China and most of sub-Saharan Africa.<sup><xref rid="zoi250409r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> Cause of death coding practices may also vary across countries and over time.<sup><xref rid="zoi250409r47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="zoi250409r48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="zoi250409r49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup> However, data quality issues were unlikely to be an underlying factor behind our conclusions since the importance of the priority conditions was also apparent when only including countries deemed to have high or medium quality data.</p><p>Third, our grouping of causes of deaths according to important risk factors needs to consider local contexts. For example, in many countries, air pollution may contribute substantially to the groups of causes that are associated with smoking. Furthermore, categorization according to risk factors such as smoking and infections only included the major causes while other relevant causes of deaths were excluded: for example, smoking also increases the risk of esophageal, colon, and bladder cancers<sup><xref rid="zoi250409r50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="zoi250409r51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref></sup> and chronic salmonella also increases the risk of gall bladder cancer.<sup><xref rid="zoi250409r52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref></sup></p><p>Additionally, there are important considerations to keep in mind when combining mortality data from the UN WPP and the WHO. The total number of deaths by age from the 2 sources tend to be similar: the WHO tends to estimate fewer deaths than the UN for ages 1 to 50 years and more deaths at age 85 years and older. However, there are country specific differences that are worth noting, particularly concerning changes over time: countries in West Africa, particularly the Central African Republic, had large increases in the number of deaths in 2019 according to the UN WPP data while no such increase was observed in the WHO data. Therefore, the estimated impact of most causes on life expectancy will increase in absolute terms in 2019 when compared with earlier years in these countries, since we rely on fraction of deaths by cause from the WHO and all-cause mortality rates from the UN WPP. However, our main interest was comparing global regions and countries at a single point in time: We also provide estimates for several years, which all show the overwhelming importance of the priority conditions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="H1-5-ZOI250409"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This cross-sectional study underscores the significant contribution of 15 priority conditions to life expectancy disparities, with notable regional variations and transitions over time.
