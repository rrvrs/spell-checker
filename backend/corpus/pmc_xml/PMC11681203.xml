Therefore, clarifying the targets and molecular mechanisms of radiotherapy resistance in ESCC is of great theoretical and clinical significance to enhance the efficacy of radiotherapy. In this study, GPR37 was identified as a key factor facilitating ESCC radiosensitization. We found that GPR37 is lowly expressed in ESCC, especially in radioresistant ESCC tumors. And its insufficiency is related to the malignant characteristics and unfavorable prognosis in ESCC. Further investigation revealed that GPR37 level is inversely regulated by promoter methylation but positively regulated by ZNF750. Functionally, GPR37 could not only overcome radioresistance of ESCC, but also inhibit proliferation, migration, and invasion. Mechanistically, GPR37 interacts with the ATP1A1 protein, effectively promoting its ubiquitination-induced degradation, thereby limiting the activation of the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. Additionally, GPR37 can be transported to recipient cells via exosomes and inhibit the malignant behavior of recipient cells. Overall, these findings suggest that GPR37-ATP1A1 axis holds potential as a therapeutic target for the management of ESCC, especially for overcoming radiation resistance.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Cancer therapeutic resistance</kwd><kwd>Radiotherapy</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Hefei Science and Technology Bureau Fund (grant number J2020Y01)</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>the Wuxi Municipal Health Commission Translational Medicine Research Project (grant number ZH202106) Xishan People's Hospital of Wuxi city Innovation Cultivation Fund (grant number Y202105)</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (grant number WK9110000188)</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100003995</institution-id><institution>Natural Science Foundation of Anhui Province (Anhui Provincial Natural Science Foundation)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2208085MH249</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yi</surname><given-names>Qiyi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Associazione Differenziamento e Morte Cellulare ADMC 2024</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Esophageal cancer ranks sixth in terms of global cancer mortality and is among the most common types of gastrointestinal cancers worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. It is mainly primarily categorized into two types: esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), of which the latter constitutes approximately 90% of all cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Typically, locally advanced ESCC is treated with radiotherapy (RT), chemoradiation therapy (CRT) or neoadjuvant CRT followed by surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Thus, radiotherapy plays a central role in the treatment plan, especially for ESCC patients who are either unable or unwilling to proceed with surgical intervention. However, up to 80% of patients treated with radiotherapy experience treatment failure due to tumor recurrence or distant metastasis within the radiation field [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. This failure can be attributed in part to the presence of radiotherapy-resistant cells, whether intrinsic or induced by radiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Thus, the efficacy of radiotherapy in ESCC patients is crucial for their prognosis, highlighting the necessity for a more profound insight into the molecular underpinnings and targets involved in ESCC development and radioresistance.</p><p id="Par3">GPR37 belongs to the G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) family, also known as parkin-associated endothelin-like receptor (Pael-R) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. It is an orphan receptor that lacks an endogenous ligand for triggering GPCR signaling, which hinders the study of its function. Notably, GPR37 is a substrate for the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase parkin and a component of the proteasome pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Therefore, proteins that directly interact with it may be affected by proteasomal degradation. GPR37 is highly expressed within the central nervous system, with the majority of research to date focusing on its association with neurological disorders, including Parkinson&#x02019;s disease, inflammation, pain, autism, and brain tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In the field of oncology, evidence has emerged demonstrating that GPR37 serves a critical function in the malignant advancement of certain types of tumors. Notably, it has been observed to enhance the proliferation and metastasis of lung and colon cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Conversely, GPR37 exhibits reduced expression in hepatocellular carcinoma and multiple myeloma cell adhesion models, and its downregulation has been linked to tumor progression and an unfavorable prognosis of these tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Thus, the precise function of GPR37 contingent upon the tumor type. Notably, in one of our previous studies, we found that GPR37 was the most significantly down-regulated gene expressed in radiation resistance-derived ESCC cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. However, the expression of GPR37, along with its regulatory mechanisms, the exact biological function, and especially the role and mechanism of radiotherapy resistance in ESCC is still unclear.</p><p id="Par4">Exosomes are small vesicles with a diameter of 30-200 nm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. They contain a diverse array of molecules, such as proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. These nanovesicles serve as critical mediators in intercellular communication by shuttling their cargo to recipient cells, thereby influencing a wide spectrum of physiological and pathological processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Notably, there is compelling evidence linking exosomes to tumor progression in ESCC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Purbasha Bhattacharya et al. found that exosomes could exert their effects through GPR37 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. And Xingyu Du et al. showed that exosomes could confer radioresistance to ESCC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. However, the underlying mechanisms by which exosomes modulate ESCC radioresistance are still not fully understood.</p><p id="Par5">In this study, we elucidated GPR37 as a critical radiosensitive gene in ESCC. Our findings revealed that GPR37 is downregulated in ESCC and is inversely correlated with unfavorable clinical outcomes. Furthermore, we demonstrated that GPR37 impedes tumor progression and enhances sensitivity to radiation in ESCC. We further explored the regulatory mechanisms underlying GPR37 expression, focusing on the roles of DNA methylation and ZNF750. Our research established that GPR37 interacts with ATP1A1 to promote its ubiquitinated degradation, which in turn inhibits AKT phosphorylation and then suppresses ESCC proliferation, migration, and DNA damage repair processes. Furthermore, we identified the presence of GPR37 protein within exosomes, which has the potential to modulate the development and radioresistance of recipient tumor cells. These discoveries underscore the promise of GPR37 as a new therapeutic and radiotherapeutic target in ESCC, providing a possible treatment strategy and offering new insights for the clinical management of ESCC.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Tissue specimen collection from patients</title><p id="Par6">The samples of 97 ESCC patients included in this study were from patients who underwent surgery in Anhui Provincial Hospital from 2011 to 2013.

Therefore, we hypothesized that ZNF750 might regulate GPR37 expression.

We then used immunofluorescence staining to assess &#x003b3;-H2AX foci formation, a sensitive marker of DNA damage, following 8&#x02009;Gy radiation. The &#x003b3;-H2AX foci formed promptly and culminated at 30&#x02009;min after radiation treatment (RT), with a subsequent decline observed at 4&#x02009;hours in wild-type KYSE150 cells. However, in GPR37-overexpressing KYSE150 cells, the &#x003b3;-H2AX foci remained prominent at 4&#x02009;hours, indicating prolonged DNA damage (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4E</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4G</xref>). Consistently, &#x003b3;-H2AX fluorescence intensity was markedly reduced compared to that of the control cells at the 4-hour point post-irradiation (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4F</xref>). This suggested that GPR37 delayed DNA repair processes and thereby enhanced radiosensitivity of ESCC cells.

Therefore, it is crucial to discover new potential molecular targets to enhance radiosensitivity and improve the therapeutic efficacy of treatment for ESCC. In this study, we identified GPR37 as an important radiosensitive target.</p><p id="Par58">GPR37 plays an important role in various diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Previous studies have shown that GPR37 can interact with CDK6, influence the tumor progression of lung adenocarcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], and promote metastasis in colorectal cancer through the Hippo pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. However, research on GPR37 in esophageal cancer is currently lacking. Therefore, we investigated the biological roles of GPR37 in esophageal cancer. Our findings revealed that GPR37 was downregulated in ESCC tissues when compared to adjacent normal tissues, and its reduced expression was correlated with an unfavorable prognosis. Multiple reports have shown that GPR37 can promote tumor development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], while other studies have indicated its inhibitory effect on liver cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. These findings suggest that GPR37 may play different roles in different types of cancer. This differential gene function in various tumors may result from genetic heterogeneity, diverse epigenetic regulations, and distinct signaling pathway activations. Tumor-specific genetic backgrounds, epigenetic modifications (e.g., DNA methylation, histone modifications, non-coding RNA expression), and environmental influences contribute to the varied roles of a gene across tumor types. In our research, we were the first to showcase the anticancer properties of GPR37 in ESCC. Our data indicated that elevated GPR37 expression suppressed esophageal cancer cell proliferation, invasion, and migration, whereas decreased GPR37 expression conversely enhanced these cellular processes. Previous reports have shown that GPR37 is associated with resistance to certain drugs, such as cisplatin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], suggesting that GPR37 may affect DNA damage repair. In our research, we provided the first evidence that GPR37 enhances the radiosensitivity of ESCC through experiments involving colony formation assays, &#x003b3;-H2AX detection, and apoptosis analysis.</p><p id="Par59">To determine the reasons for the changes in GPR37 expression levels, we conducted extensive research and found that, in the study by Jianhong Chen et al., the gene expression of GPR37 in breast cancer was negatively correlated with DNA methylation levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. In the study by M Toyota et al., GPR37 exhibited high methylation in acute myeloid leukemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. The data imply that the reduced expression of GPR37 in tumors might be associated with DNA methylation. To explore this possibility, we analyzed the methylation status of GPR37 in six different ESCC cell lines. Our analysis revealed that KYSE150 cells, which characteristically display low GPR37 expression, had significantly higher levels of DNA methylation compared to the other cell lines examined. In a study by Pengzhou Kong et al., ZNF750 was identified as a transcription factor that inhibits tumor growth in ESCC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Additionally, there is ample evidence indicating that ZNF750 knockdown promotes proliferation, invasion, migration, and angiogenesis in ESCC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. Furthermore, in a study by Ryota Otsuka et al., high expression of ZNF750 was shown to enhance the radiosensitivity of ESCC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Therefore, we suspect that ZNF750 may be a transcription factor for GPR37. After comparing the sequences, we predicted the binding site of ZNF750 at position GPR37-378 and confirmed the accuracy of this site through ChIP and luciferase reporter experiments. These findings indicate that GPR37 is regulated by both DNA methylation and the transcription factor ZNF750.</p><p id="Par60">To investigate the mechanism of action of GPR37 in ESCC, we initially screened the TCGA dataset and found that GPR37 may be negatively correlated with the mTOR signaling pathway. However, current research suggests that GPR37 can promote the mTOR signaling pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. We examined the expression levels of proteins related to the mTOR signaling pathway and found that, in cells overexpressing GPR37, the protein expression of mTOR decreased, as did the phosphorylation level of AKT. These findings indicate that GPR37 inhibits the activation of the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway in ESCC cells. Next, we treated different ESCC cell lines with activators and inhibitors of AKT and mTOR and evaluated their behavioral characteristics and apoptosis after radiation. These findings confirmed that GPR37 inhibits the development and radioresistance of ESCC through the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. Using IP-MS, we screened for proteins directly associated with GPR37. Among the top-ranked proteins, ATP1A1 attracted our attention. There is ample evidence suggesting that ATP1A1 may be involved in the activation of AKT and mTOR across various cell type [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. In our research, we observed a decrease in the protein expression of ATP1A1 in cells where GPR37 was overexpressed. Therefore, we can speculate that GPR37 restricts the activation of the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway by facilitating the degradation of ATP1A1. Initially, we confirmed the precision of the Co-IP findings by co-transfecting cells with GPR37-Flag and ATP1A1-HA plasmids, thereby verifying the interaction between the two proteins. Since ATP1A1 is downregulated in cells overexpressing GPR37 but directly interacts with these two proteins, GPR37 is unlikely to regulate transcription and translation to suppress ATP1A1 expression. Therefore, we speculate that GPR37 may promote the degradation of ATP1A1. We treated cells with the proteasome inhibitor MG132, observing a subsequent recovery in the protein level of ATP1A1 in GPR37-overexpressing cells. Furthermore, after transfecting cells with plasmids that overexpress ATP1A1, we noticed an increase in AKT phosphorylation and mTOR protein levels in cells that overexpress GPR37. These findings support the hypothesis that GPR37 restricts the activation of the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway by inducing ATP1A1 degradation in ESCC.</p><p id="Par61">To identify effective ways to increase GPR37 levels in esophageal cancer, we investigated exosomes. Exosomes are small vesicles secreted by cells that encapsulate proteins, nucleic acids, and other substances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Furthermore, research has shown that exosomes can impact cellular functions through the GPR37 signaling pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], and it has also been suggested that exosomes can enhance the radiosensitivity of ESCC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Therefore, we propose a reasonable hypothesis: whether exosomal GPR37 protein levels in ESCC can be increased through exosomes. We extracted exosomes from the conditioned media of wild-type and GPR37-overexpressing ESCC cells and were found that the exosomes carried the GPR37 protein. Moreover, exosomes extracted from the conditioned media of cells with high GPR37 levels exhibited even greater GPR37 protein levels. In our experiments, after isolating exosomes, we reintroduced them into the culture medium of ESCC cells. Subsequently, we observed that the cells internalized the exosomes, which in turn led to alterations in the levels of the GPR37 protein. This also led to alterations in the tumor phenotype and radiosensitivity of the recipient cells. This discovery suggested that it may be possible to use exosomes to target GPR37 for the clinical treatment of ESCC. These findings provide a rationale for the suboptimal radiotherapy response in ESCC patients with low GPR37 expression, suggesting potential strategies to enhance radiotherapy sensitivity. In the future studies, we aim to amass a larger collection of post-radiotherapy human ESCC tissue samples, fabricate organoids, and generate genetically modified mouse models. This will provide a robust foundation for translating our laboratory findings into clinical research. Moreover, we propose to explore the encapsulation and modification of exosomes to enrich GPR37 protein content, target ESCC cells specifically, deliver chemotherapeutic agents, and mitigate side effects. Post-surgical immunohistochemical assessment of GPR37 expression in resected cancer tissue will enable the stratification of ESCC patients. Those with low GPR37 expression will be allocated to a group where we will investigate the efficacy of combining exosomes with radiotherapy, thereby seeking an innovative approach to augment therapeutic outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec34" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par62">This study demonstrated that GPR37 inhibits the proliferation, metastasis, and radioresistance of ESCC cells. The expression level of GPR37 is regulated by DNA methylation and ZNF750. It may exert its effects by inhibiting the activation of the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway by promoting ubiquitination of ATP1A1, and it can also mediate intercellular transfer through Exo-GPR37. In summary, GPR37 level could act as a biological indicator for the proliferation and metastatic behavior of ESCC, as well as a pivotal gene contributing to radioresistance. It is a promising candidate for a significant molecular target in the clinical management of ESCC.</p></sec><sec id="Sec35" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary information</title><p>
