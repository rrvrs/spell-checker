Intestinal tuberculosis is a rare form of the disease, posing a diagnostic challenge due to its similarity to other conditions, such as Crohn's disease and fungal infections, such as abdominal pain, chronic diarrhea, weight loss, fever, and inflammatory intestinal lesions that can lead to ulcerations and strictures [<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In this report, we discuss a case of intestinal tuberculosis that presented with multiple perianal fistulas and recurrent abscesses.</p><p>The identification of intestinal tuberculosis can be hindered by its nonspecific clinical presentation, which includes abdominal pain, weight loss, fever, and symptoms related to abscess and fistula formation [<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In some cases, as in the one reported here, the patient may develop complications mimicking inflammatory bowel diseases, which can lead to initial misdiagnosed approaches. Previous reports emphasize that diagnostic confirmation often relies on histopathological findings, such as the presence of caseating granulomas, and the exclusion of conditions like neoplasms and actinomycosis. These approaches are critical to avoid inappropriate treatments [<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>In this context, the present case report describes the clinical evolution, diagnostic methods, and treatment of a patient with intestinal tuberculosis complicated by perianal fistulas and recurrent abscesses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="cases"><title>Case presentation</title><p>The patient, a 45-year-old male, works as a gas station attendant and is married. He had no family history of tuberculosis. Among the main symptoms, he presented with a recurrent abscess in the left buttock, characterized by spontaneous purulent discharge, local pain, and frequent relapses. The patient had a history of four months of incarceration in 2021, which exposed him to living and working conditions that may have increased his risk of tuberculosis infection. Figure <xref rid="FIG1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> provides a detailed representation of the pathogenesis associated with the intestinal tuberculosis case.</p><fig position="anchor" fig-type="figure" id="FIG1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Pathophysiological progression of intestinal tuberculosis </title><p>Figure&#x000a0;created by authors with <ext-link xlink:href="https://mindthegraph.com" ext-link-type="uri">mindthegraph.com</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="cureus-0016-00000076456-i01" position="float"/></fig><p>Previous interventions included surgical drainage of the abscesses, empirical antibiotic therapy, and colonoscopies to investigate a possible inflammatory bowel disease. Physical examination revealed an ulcerated lesion in the gluteal region with signs of an active fistula and purulent discharge. No palpable peripheral lymphadenopathy was identified. However, the proctological exam revealed multiple perianal fistulas.</p><p>The patient underwent various diagnostic methods, including colonoscopy with intestinal biopsy, musculoskeletal ultrasound, and laboratory tests such as complete blood count and secretion culture. A significant diagnostic challenge was the clinical similarity to Crohn&#x02019;s disease, necessitating detailed histopathological evaluation and exclusion of other differential diagnoses such as actinomycosis and neoplasms. Complementary examinations confirmed the diagnosis of intestinal tuberculosis based on histopathological findings of caseating granulomas.</p><p>The patient&#x02019;s prognosis was guarded, requiring continuous follow-up to monitor treatment response and prevent potential complications, such as the emergence of new fistulas or abscesses. Therapeutic management involved a pharmacological approach with the administration of rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol, as well as surgical interventions for fistula drainage and local wound care. Antibiotics and antifungal agents were also administered to control secondary infections.</p><p>The treatment regimen included rifampin 150 mg, isoniazid 75 mg, pyrazinamide 400 mg, and ethambutol 275 mg, with a planned duration of six months. Additional antibiotics and antifungal agents were introduced due to secondary infections that did not respond adequately to the initial treatment. Clinical follow-up revealed significant improvement in the healing of perianal lesions and control of secondary infections, with the patient reporting symptomatic relief and reduced purulent discharge.</p><p>Follow-up tests, including complete blood counts and liver function tests, showed no significant abnormalities. The patient demonstrated good adherence to treatment and tolerance to the prescribed medications, and no relevant adverse events were observed during the course of therapy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Intestinal tuberculosis, while uncommon, constitutes a clinically significant extrapulmonary manifestation of <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis </italic>infection. Its nonspecific clinical presentation often results in delayed diagnosis and treatment, complicating disease management. In the present case, recurrent perianal abscesses and fistulas were the predominant manifestations, an atypical presentation rarely documented in the literature. This form of tuberculosis is frequently misinterpreted as other conditions, such as Crohn&#x02019;s disease, due to overlapping clinical and histopathological characteristics, which underscores the considerable diagnostic challenges associated with this condition [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>-<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>A key strength of this report was the correct identification of intestinal tuberculosis following the exclusion of complex differential diagnoses, such as inflammatory bowel diseases and neoplasms. Careful exclusion of other conditions was critical&#x000a0;as inappropriate treatments could have exacerbated the patient&#x02019;s complications. The finding of caseating granulomas in the intestinal biopsy was pivotal for the diagnosis. Additionally, differences in transmission pathways between gastrointestinal and pulmonary tuberculosis warrant attention. Pulmonary tuberculosis is primarily transmitted via airborne droplets, whereas intestinal tuberculosis typically arises from the ingestion of food or water contaminated with <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>&#x000a0;or the swallowing of infected pulmonary secretions in patients with active tuberculosis. Risk factors specific to intestinal tuberculosis include immunosuppressive conditions, such as HIV infection, chronic malnutrition, and prolonged exposure to high-risk environments, such as prisons or areas with poor sanitation.</p><p>These factors differ substantially from pulmonary tuberculosis, which relies more directly on aerosolized particle exposure. From a therapeutic perspective, the positive response to the antituberculous regimen, comprising rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol, was crucial for the patient&#x02019;s favorable outcome. The concomitant use of antibiotics and antifungal agents to manage secondary infections was an important component of successful treatment. The progressive healing of fistulas and the symptomatic relief reported by the patient indicate the efficacy of the chosen therapeutic approach.</p><p>However, a significant limitation was the initial delay in reaching the correct diagnosis, which postponed the start of antituberculous therapy. This delay likely contributed to the recurrence of abscesses and the progression of fistulas, further complicating the patient&#x02019;s clinical course.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This case report provides valuable lessons for clinical practice, especially in regions endemic for tuberculosis, highlighting the importance of considering extrapulmonary tuberculosis in the differential diagnosis of chronic abscesses and perianal fistulas. Prompt exclusion of differential diagnoses and the implementation of appropriate therapies can significantly improve the prognosis and reduce complications associated with this rare condition.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group content-type="conflict"><title>Disclosures</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Human subjects:</bold> Consent for treatment and open access publication was obtained or waived by all participants in this study.</p><p><bold>Conflicts of interest:</bold> In compliance with the ICMJE uniform disclosure form, all authors declare the following:</p><p><bold>Payment/services info:</bold> All authors have declared that no financial support was received from any organization for the submitted work.</p><p><bold>Financial relationships:</bold> All authors have declared that they have no financial relationships at present or within the previous three years with any organizations that might have an interest in the submitted work.</p><p><bold>Other relationships:</bold> All authors have declared that there are no other relationships or activities that could appear to have influenced the submitted work.</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="other"><title>Author Contributions</title><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Concept and design:</bold>&#x000a0; Anderson M.
