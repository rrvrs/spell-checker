It is, however, not curative. Response to treatment also varies and lung disease, although slowed, remains progressive. We have previously demonstrated inhibition of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) by selective furin inhibition to be an alternative, mutation-agnostic approach that can enhance airways hydration and restore mucociliary transport (MCT) in CF. Inhibition of furin therefore, offers a potential therapeutic strategy for those ineligible, intolerant or nonresponsive to ETI and may provide a further opportunity for clinical benefit for those currently treated with ETI. The aim of this study was to determine the impact of furin inhibition on ETI responses to assess its utility as an adjunct therapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Differentiated primary CF human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) were treated with the highly selective furin inhibitor BOS-318 and with ETI.

In CF lung disease, a reduction in both the quality and quantity of CFTR causes airways dehydration, impaired MCC and mucus obstruction. This predisposes individuals to chronic cycles of infection and inflammation, leading to lung injury and a progressive decline in pulmonary function [<xref rid="C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>The approval of CFTR modulator drugs by the European Union and United States, targeting the basic defect in CF has reduced treatment burden and transformed the clinical management of people with CF [<xref rid="C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Of note, triple CFTR modulator therapy, elexacaftor&#x02013;tezacaftor&#x02013;ivacaftor (Trikafta/Kaftrio&#x000ae;, Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Boston, MA, USA; ETI) has been shown to correct CFTR function to &#x0223c;62% of wild-type (WT) in nasal epithelial cells [<xref rid="C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and increases CFTR activity to &#x0223c;40&#x02013;45% of WT in F508del homozygous patients, as measured by nasal potential difference [<xref rid="C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Clinically, ETI shows improvements in lung function and a reduction in exacerbations, hospitalisations, treatment burden and lung transplant referrals [<xref rid="C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>For the majority of patients with chronic CF lung disease, the improvement in pulmonary function, however, does not typically reach the normal range [<xref rid="C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Therefore, exploring new treatment options to augment ETI-mediated airway hydration and MCC holds the promise of additional clinical benefit.</p><p>An alternative and long-standing treatment strategy is to target the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) [<xref rid="C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. ENaC-mediated Na<sup>+</sup> absorption causes the movement of water away from the apical surface of the airway epithelium, and in the absence of CFTR, contributes to airway surface dehydration, mucous stasis and the collapse of effective MCC, a key contributor to the pathogenesis of CF in the lungs [<xref rid="C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. ENaC has a trimeric structure consisting of &#x003b1;, &#x003b2; and &#x003b3; subunits that require proteolytic activation, without which the channel only exhibits low conductance for Na<sup>+</sup> [<xref rid="C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Furin, a cellular, ubiquitously expressed proprotein convertase cleaves two sites on the &#x003b1; subunit and one on the &#x003b3; subunit to prime a distinct pool of ENaC as it passes through the biosynthetic pathway [<xref rid="C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The activation of ENaC is completed at the cell surface by the action of other channel-activating proteases such as prostasin and neutrophil elastase [<xref rid="C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>We have previously demonstrated that BOS-318, a cell-permeable and highly selective potent inhibitor of furin robustly suppresses ENaC activity and improves airway surface hydration status and mucociliary transport (MCT) in a fully differentiated CF airway epithelial cell model [<xref rid="C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In the current study, our aim was to determine whether furin-mediated ENaC inhibition offers an opportunity to enhance ETI-driven airway hydration and MCT, which could provide additional benefits beyond those achieved with ETI alone.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Reagents</title><p>All chemicals were obtained from Merck (Rahway, NJ, USA) unless indicated otherwise.

ETI therapy, however, does not restore CFTR function to WT levels and is not curative [<xref rid="C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. There is, therefore, a rationale to pursue other treatments that may provide clinical benefit in CF when used as an adjunct to existing CFTR modulator regimens. We report that fully differentiated CF bronchial epithelial cells treated with ETI in combination with a highly selective furin inhibitor, BOS-318, showed improved CFTR-mediated Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> secretion and a concurrent reduction in ENaC-mediated Na<sup>+</sup> absorption. Together these changes in ion channel function resulted in significantly improved ASL height and MCT, above the levels achieved with ETI treatment alone.</p><p>The potential for ENaC inhibition to be used in combination with CFTR modulation to improve patient outcomes has been previously discussed [<xref rid="C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. It is well established that ENaC is a key regulator of airway hydration and that inhibition causes hyperpolarisation of the apical airway epithelial membrane, creating an increased electrical driving force and thereby inducing chloride secretion [<xref rid="C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The possibility of an additive effect between ENaC inhibition and CFTR modulation was also reported when ENaC inhibitor BI 1265162 was used alongside ivacaftor&#x02013;lumacaftor [<xref rid="C22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. To date, however, traditional small-molecule direct ENaC blockers such as amiloride, benzamil, GS-9411, BI 443651, BI 1265162 and VX-371 and the peptide analogue SPX-101, although generally well tolerated, have failed clinical development. Reasons have included lack of potency and/or short half-life, dosing issues, efficacy, induced hyperkalaemia, short study duration, and for those that made phase II, lack of end-point sensitivity [<xref rid="C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="C23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Lessons learnt have, however, led to the development of ETD001 (Enterprise Therapeutics, Brighton, UK), a novel inhaled, long-acting direct ENaC blocker that is expected to provide a superior efficacy and safety profile compared with the previous failed compounds. ETD001 has successfully completed phase I safety studies and is being progressed to phase IIa in 2024 [<xref rid="C24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. An alternative approach to ENaC inhibition is, however, offered by BOS-318 and other compounds within the patent family (<italic toggle="yes">e.g.</italic> BOS-857 and BOS-981) [<xref rid="C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="C25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. These compounds are first-in-class, highly selective and potent inhibitors of furin, which has been found to be elevated in CF airway epithelial cells and is the prime protease responsible for ENaC activation [<xref rid="C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="C26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In a follow-up to our previous report that discussed the development of BOS-318, protection against neutrophil elastase (NE)-mediated activation of the ENaC and the effect of its robust inhibition of ENaC on ASL height and MCT [<xref rid="C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], we now report that BOS-318 augments ETI treatment by further improving the hydration status of the airway epithelium leading to a significant increase in MCT. The ability of BOS-318 to further uplift these parameters in our <italic toggle="yes">ex vivo</italic> models has the potential to compensate for the inability of ETI to fully normalise CFTR activity to WT levels [<xref rid="C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In the future, benchmarking against MCT observed in non-CF cells and <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> investigations, potentially involving a direct comparison with the current best-in-class ENaC blocker, ETD001 will offer valuable insights into the utility of BOS compounds as clinical candidates.</p><p>The broader advantages of furin inhibition in CF lung disease compared with direct ENaC channel blockade are also being explored. Beyond its impact on ENaC, furin plays a pivotal role in activating numerous other cellular substrates (bacterial and viral, as well as mammalian), several of which are crucial to the pathogenesis of CF airways disease [<xref rid="C25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Examples include furin activation of <italic toggle="yes">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> exotoxin A (PEA), a toxic product of <italic toggle="yes">P.</italic>&#x02005;<italic toggle="yes">aeruginosa</italic> infection, which is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in people with CF [<xref rid="C27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Of note, treatment of CuFi cells with BOS-318 provided cytoprotection against toxicity induced by PEA (median effective concentration of 47.8&#x02005;nM) [<xref rid="C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. BOS inhibitors (BOS-318, BOS-857 and BOS-981) have also been able to effectively block the processing of the secretory type-I membrane-bound spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 in HeLa cells, and also completely prevented SARS-CoV-2 infection of lung-derived Calu-3 cells in combination with camostat, an inhibitor of the type II transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) [<xref rid="C28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Another substrate regulated by furin is transforming growth factor-&#x003b2; (TGF-&#x003b2;), which is found in elevated concentrations in bronchoalveolar lavage from CF patients [<xref rid="C29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and is associated with a reduction in pulmonary function [<xref rid="C30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. TGF-&#x003b2; has also been associated with reduced chloride secretion [<xref rid="C31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and reduced CFTR protein expression [<xref rid="C32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] and was also found to disrupt CFTR correction by VX-809 (lumacaftor) [<xref rid="C33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. These findings, therefore, suggest the possibility of potentially broader benefits, beyond that of improved airway hydration status and restored MCC, through the combined use of CFTR modulation and furin inhibition.</p><p>MCC in the airways can be influenced both by the rate of ciliary beating and the hydration status of the ASL layer, with increased mucus hydration translating to increased mucus velocity [<xref rid="C34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The substantive increase in ASL height observed when BOS-318 and ETI were added in combination was stark (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">figure 2</xref>). Interestingly, studies in individuals with systemic pseudo-hypoaldosteronism who have loss-of-function mutations in the genes for ENaC subunits and fail to absorb liquid from the airway surfaces exhibit high rates of MCC [<xref rid="C35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Moreover, <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> investigations have demonstrated that the introduction of fluid onto airway surfaces results in a selective penetration into the mucus layer. This induces a swelling effect, preserving the connection between the cilia and mucus. Consequently, the addition of liquid has been observed to enhance mucus transport rates [<xref rid="C36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p><p>TMEM16A-mediated Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> secretion has been investigated as a potential compensatory route for loss of CFTR activity in the airway epithelium [<xref rid="C37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], though there is some debate as to the potential benefits and drawbacks of such as approach [<xref rid="C38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. While not the focus of the current study, we did observe that UTP-stimulated TMEM16A activity was lost in the presence of ETI but not by BOS-318 (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1a</xref>). The phenomenon has been reported previously [<xref rid="C39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], though the underlying molecular mechanisms explaining this effect are unknown.</p><p>Overall, the data presented here demonstrate that furin inhibition by BOS-318 robustly inhibits ENaC activity and enhances ETI-mediated improvements in airways hydration status, as measured by both ASL height and MCT. Highly selective inhibition of furin may therefore, provide an alternative approach to treatment, which, when used with current CFTR modulator regimes, has the potential to deliver an increase in clinical benefit for people with CF.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supplementary material</title><supplementary-material id="supplementary" position="float" content-type="local-data"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1183/23120541.00445-2024.Supp1</object-id><p><bold>Please note:</bold> supplementary material is not edited by the Editorial Office, and is uploaded as it has been supplied by the author.</p><p>Supplementary material <inline-supplementary-material id="SS1" xlink:href="00445-2024.SUPPLEMENT.pdf" content-type="local-data">00445-2024.SUPPLEMENT</inline-supplementary-material></p><p>Video S1 <inline-supplementary-material id="SS2" xlink:href="00445-2024.SUPPLEMENT.mp4" content-type="local-data">00445-2024.SUPPLEMENT</inline-supplementary-material></p><p>Video S2 <inline-supplementary-material id="SS3" xlink:href="00445-2024.SUPPLEMENT2.mp4" content-type="local-data">00445-2024.SUPPLEMENT2</inline-supplementary-material></p><p>Video S3 <inline-supplementary-material id="SS4" xlink:href="00445-2024.SUPPLEMENT3.mp4" content-type="local-data">00445-2024.SUPPLEMENT3</inline-supplementary-material></p></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>BOS-318 used for experiments was kindly provided by Boston Pharmaceuticals (Boston, MA, USA).</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p>Provenance: Submitted article, peer reviewed.</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group><fn><p>Author contributions: All authors were involved in project conceptualisation and experimental design.
