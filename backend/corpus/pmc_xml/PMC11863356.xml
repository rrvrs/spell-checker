</xref> Supporting swallowing and eating&#x02010;related care needs becomes increasingly skill and time intensive as dementia progresses, including providing feeding support during mealtimes and introducing techniques to optimize swallowing function. Further, as highlighted in a recent qualitative study, health&#x02010;care providers and care partners often face significant challenges in making eating and hydration decisions for PLWD as the disease progresses.<xref rid="alz70028-bib-0007" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>7</sup>
</xref> These challenges arise from the need to navigate individual&#x02010;level factors, such as personal food preferences and cultural practices, and broader factors, including hospital policies, institutional values, and legal constraints.<xref rid="alz70028-bib-0007" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>7</sup>
</xref> If these factors are not adequately considered or act as barriers during the decision&#x02010;making process, they can hinder the delivery of optimal swallowing and eating care for PLWD.</p><p>Dementia care occurs in the context of care delivery systems with unevenly distributed resources, the impacts of which are well documented.<xref rid="alz70028-bib-0008" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>8</sup>
</xref>, <xref rid="alz70028-bib-0009" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>9</sup>
</xref> These disparities may be particularly relevant to eating and swallowing care, as supporting an optimal eating experience involves a complex, three&#x02010;phase process that imposes significant burdens at the individual, systems, and community levels. In the first phase, screening, swallowing concerns are identified by health&#x02010;care providers via patient report, questionnaires, or clinical screening tools. The second phase, diagnosis, involves evaluation by speech&#x02013;language pathologists (SLPs), who use clinical swallowing evaluations and/or instrumental methods to characterize swallowing function. The third phase, treatment, involves patients receiving recommendations to manage their swallowing issues within their care setting. Each phase is influenced by numerous multi&#x02010;level factors, such as health&#x02010;care access, transportation, social support, insurance coverage, and provider availability. PLWD and their care partners often shoulder the burden of navigating these barriers to achieve optimal care.</p><p>Initiating eating and swallowing care in the outpatient setting relies on having access to a primary care provider (PCP) or specialist who can screen for symptoms and make a referral to a SLP&#x02014;assuming the PLWD also has access to SLP services. Although instrumental approaches (e.g., videofluoroscopic swallow study) are considered advantageous during the diagnostic phase as they allow for direct visualization of swallowing function,<xref rid="alz70028-bib-0010" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>10</sup>
</xref> their accessibility depends on various factors, including the ability of the PLWD to attend and afford a radiology appointment and the availability of equipment and trained personnel. The treatment phase typically involves implementing standard&#x02010;guideline approaches such as environmental and dietary modifications. Dysphagia researchers and clinicians have given little attention to equitable dysphagia care in the clinical and research domains. Current guideline approaches operate as &#x0201c;one size fits all&#x0201d; models that typically overlook unique cultural, social, economic, and geographic needs associated with eating and swallowing care. PLWD who reside in resource&#x02010;poor environments or have social and/or cultural practices not reflected in existing guideline&#x02010;concordant swallowing treatments may struggle to adhere to long&#x02010;term swallowing recommendations.<xref rid="alz70028-bib-0011" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>11</sup>
</xref> This may be especially true for food intake modifications, which serve as a cornerstone of dysphagia treatment for PLWD<xref rid="alz70028-bib-0012" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>12</sup>
</xref> but currently lack person&#x02010;centered options. All PLWD deserve opportunities for high&#x02010;quality, standardized care. Therefore, new approaches are urgently needed to maintain high standards of eating and swallowing care while introducing socioculturally tailored strategies that meet the diverse needs of PLWD.</p><p>A first step toward more person&#x02010;centered eating and swallowing care for PLWD involves adopting a social exposome perspective. The social exposome quantifies lifetime exposures in the lived environment and their effects on health.<xref rid="alz70028-bib-0013" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>13</sup>
</xref> Within this framework, social determinants of health (SDOH) are viewed as the fundamental &#x0201c;causes of causes&#x0201d;&#x02014;upstream non&#x02010;medical health factors such as income, education, employment opportunities, and housing quality influencing health outcomes.<xref rid="alz70028-bib-0014" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>14</sup>
</xref> Over time, the concept of SDOH has expanded to include structural determinants of health (S/SDOH), which represent broader socioeconomic and political practices contributing to the unequal distribution of SDOH.<xref rid="alz70028-bib-0015" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>15</sup>
</xref> These concepts underscore that experiences within the social environment are inseparable from health, necessitating consideration to ensure that eating and swallowing care approaches meet the standard of care for all individuals. By applying S/SDOH to dysphagia research in PLWD, we can gain a comprehensive understanding of eating and swallowing care outcomes. This approach also opens opportunities to identify barriers that may pose challenges navigating the eating and swallowing care process, along with options for socially and culturally aligned care and intervention. Given that dysphagia is common in PLWD, the absence of such tailored approaches represents an important gap in the field.</p><p>Our multidisciplinary team, in collaboration with several national experts in health disparities, dementia, and dysphagia, developed an initial conceptual framework that highlights multilevel health disparities impacting the phases of eating and swallowing care (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="alz70028-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). We derived our framework from standard dysphagia care pathways for PLWD and the well&#x02010;established ecological systems<xref rid="alz70028-bib-0016" ref-type="bibr">

Drawing on their expertise and the literature, they applied these models to existing clinical processes in swallowing and eating care. Finally, we convened a multidisciplinary group with expertise in speech&#x02013;language pathology, otolaryngology, neurology, emergency medicine, dysphagia, dementia, and health disparities to review and provide feedback on the framework.

<sup>32</sup>
</xref> Misconceptions about the timing of dysphagia or lack of understanding of early swallowing and eating changes in PLWD may result in PLWD in the earlier stages receiving suboptimal eating and swallowing care, as symptoms are less apparent and, thus, screened or discussed less frequently. Consequently, eating and swallowing care and interventions are implemented reactively in the later stages of disease progression, when symptoms become more pronounced.</p><p>Still, providing eating and swallowing care to PLWD in advanced stages can also be challenging, as care complexities and resource demands increase with disease progression. PLWD at the more advanced stages of the disease often require palliative care approaches which may complicate decision making specific to swallowing and eating. In a recent paper discussing palliative care for patients with dementia, Malhi et&#x000a0;al. describe how the negative impacts of swallowing and eating changes in PLWD may be mitigated by initiating palliative care early.<xref rid="alz70028-bib-0034" ref-type="bibr">

During interactions with PLWD and their care partners, medical providers&#x02014;including primary care clinicians, geriatricians, nurses, nurse practitioners, neurologists, and other prescribing providers&#x02014;play a critical role by conducting simple swallowing screens, initiating referrals to SLPs, and overseeing care plans and treatments. SLPs, in turn, use their clinical encounters to further screen, diagnose, and manage swallowing difficulties. Given these roles, it is imperative that screenings for eating and swallowing impairments and discussions around these issues are included in clinical encounters with these providers. However, our recent work (Loy et&#x000a0;al., submitted) found the greatest barrier to dysphagia screening among health&#x02010;care providers in geriatric medicine was a lack of integration of dysphagia in the clinical workflow. Further compounding this, we also found many health&#x02010;care practitioners (74%) perceived their dysphagia&#x02010;related training and education to be insufficient.

From a broader community/public standpoint, PLWD residing in communities with increased socioeconomic disadvantage likely have fewer resources such as grocery stores and support programs, to manage their eating and swallowing care needs.</p></sec><sec id="alz70028-sec-0260"><label>3.4.2</label><title>Financial resources</title><p>Dysphagia management depends on many financial resources including personal income and medical insurance. Individual income is needed to cover the costs of food, copays, and out&#x02010;of&#x02010;pocket expenses for certain dysphagia treatments, such as blenders to puree food. Insurance coverage helps offset the costs of instrumental swallowing assessments (e.g., videofluoroscopy) to obtain a diagnosis. Insurance also helps cover health&#x02010;care costs including medical appointments, and inpatient and outpatient rehab. While most insurance plans will cover some or most of these costs, PLWD who are under&#x02010; or uninsured may be unable to receive adequate eating and swallowing care. Some PLWD may use public programs such as Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program to pay for food. The extent to which these types of programs cover the dietary needs of PLWD with dysphagia, for example by covering the costs of items like thickener, has not been sufficiently examined.</p></sec><sec id="alz70028-sec-0270"><label>3.4.3</label><title>Health literacy</title><p>Health literacy was found in a recent systematic review<xref rid="alz70028-bib-0051" ref-type="bibr">

</xref> to encompass three important constructs: (1) knowledge of health, (2) the ability to process information related to health in various formats, and (3) the management of health through individual actions and by working with health&#x02010;care providers. These constructs of health literacy are essential to the eating and swallowing care process, with initial awareness of swallowing changes dependent on PLWD having access to/been provided with this information. Without PLWD and care partners having education materials as they progress through the eating and swallowing care process, they are at risk of not understanding or fully benefiting from procedures and diagnostics. Swallowing treatment and follow&#x02010;up care will be largely managed by PLWD and their care partners in the home environment, necessitating they are properly equipped with education and resources to successfully address their eating and swallowing&#x02010;related care needs when they leave the clinical setting.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="alz70028-sec-0280"><label>4</label><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The failure to consider S/SDOH in eating and swallowing care of PLWD contributes to persistent health inequities, placing socially vulnerable PLWD at a disadvantage to adequately address their eating and swallowing care needs. While this work is a starting point and there will be many future avenues of exploration, for now, there are three critical areas that need addressing: (1) research studies to examine unmet needs existing within the individual, systems, and community levels; (2) improved resources and training at the systems and community levels to better support person&#x02010;centered eating and swallowing care; and (3) improved eating and swallowing treatments that enhance options for person&#x02010;centered care practices by integrating S/SDOH.</p><sec id="alz70028-sec-0290"><label>4.1</label><title>Research</title><p>More disparities&#x02010;focused research is crucial for understanding dysphagia in PLWD. Epidemiological studies can shed light on the extent of under&#x02010;detection of dysphagia, examining disparities that affect PLWD's access to screening and diagnosis. These studies can also reveal who participates in each stage of eating and swallowing care and whether S/SDOH contribute to eating and swallowing care delays or attrition. Qualitative research is needed to engage PLWD and their care partners directly, providing insights into their experiences with eating and swallowing care throughout disease progression.</p><p>As health disparities rarely occur in isolation, research must integrate analyses across individual, systemic, and community levels to understand their compounded impact on eating and swallowing care. This approach will help us systematically assess barriers and facilitators to navigating eating and swallowing care. This foundational research will pave the way for developing socially and culturally tailored, person&#x02010;centered interventions and practices to achieve equitable standards of care for all PLWD. By generating this critical knowledge, we can advocate for comprehensive system and policy changes necessary to address eating and swallowing care inequities effectively. We recognize that similar research efforts are likely needed for other patient populations affected by dysphagia. We encourage future work to adapt the constructs in the current framework to guide research aimed at examining and addressing eating and swallowing care disparities in these populations.</p></sec><sec id="alz70028-sec-0300"><label>4.2</label><title>Resources and training</title><p>Heightening expectations for socially responsive eating and swallowing care is only feasible if we implement increased resources and training at the system and community levels. These efforts will enable relevant stakeholders to effectively deliver and receive eating and swallowing care. Practitioners in various fields&#x02014;including SLP, medicine, nursing, and pharmacy&#x02014;can benefit significantly from enhanced dysphagia training during their education. Health&#x02010;care providers trained and encouraged to account for S/SDOH within their clinical practice may engage in more person&#x02010;centered care, by tailoring their approaches to their patients&#x02019; health literacy, culture, and living conditions. Educational, accessible initiatives specifically targeting health&#x02010;care providers involved in dysphagia management should be developed to enhance their capacity to deliver equitable swallowing services to PLWD.</p><p>Integrating health&#x02010;care systems with social resources will likely best facilitate person&#x02010;centered eating and swallowing care. Health&#x02010;care systems can use social resources including electronic health record templates embedded with relevant S/SDOH items, clinical toolkits that guide social and culturally responsive practices into workflows, and centralized and multidisciplinary resource hubs to help providers efficiently connect patients with the resources they need for eating and swallowing care. Broader health&#x02010;care policy changes can elevate the standards of clinical practice for PLWD with dysphagia. For instance, Medicare requires specific documentation elements, including objective measurements of patient performance and a certified plan of care, for reimbursement of SLP services.<xref rid="alz70028-bib-0052" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>52</sup>
</xref> Setting minimum documentation standards that incorporate S/SDOH characteristics when developing dysphagia care plans can enhance accountability for identifying and addressing patient social needs. However, we acknowledge that these additional responsibilities may be challenging under certain health&#x02010;care models, such as fee&#x02010;for&#x02010;service systems, in which providers face increasing burnout due to time constraints and productivity demands. Therefore, comprehensive systems and policy changes are essential to equip health&#x02010;care providers with the necessary time and resources to incorporate S/SDOH&#x02010;aligned dysphagia practices into their clinical routines.</p><p>Supporting the transition of PLWD with dysphagia and their care partners across settings will require the development of additional systems&#x02010; and community&#x02010;level resources. Interdisciplinary training models for care partners focused on food preparation and texture modification can help alleviate care partner burden. Further, patient care navigator programs, successfully implemented in fields like oncology,<xref rid="alz70028-bib-0053" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>53</sup>
</xref> can be specifically tailored for PLWD with dysphagia to guide patients through the complexities of eating and swallowing care and address individual&#x02010;, system&#x02010;, and community&#x02010;level barriers. Establishing such programs may be particularly beneficial for socioeconomically disadvantaged PLWD who often lack access to essential resources.</p></sec><sec id="alz70028-sec-0310"><label>4.3</label><title>Treatment</title><p>Enhancing the treatment of PLWD with dysphagia requires applying a social exposome lens to eating and swallowing care. First, health&#x02010;care providers and systems must acknowledge that health disparities operate at multiple levels throughout eating and swallowing care. Recognizing these disparities enables more personalized care with services tailored to the unique social, cultural, and economic conditions of PLWD and their care partners. Addressing disparities explicitly, rather than assuming a &#x0201c;one size fits all&#x0201d; approach, can lead to better health outcomes by ensuring that the specific needs of each individual are met.</p><p>Second, there is a critical need to develop culturally and socially responsible swallowing treatments. The treatment and follow&#x02010;up phases of eating and swallowing care are likely the longest, as eating and drinking are daily activities that require continuous management. Given PLWD and their care partners will primarily oversee these needs at home or in long&#x02010;term care settings, treatments must be socially and culturally aligned with their beliefs and values. Beyond cultural sensitivity, swallowing treatments must also be practical and feasible within the patient's environment to ensure long&#x02010;term adherence and successful outcomes. These types of tailored treatments will create a more effective and meaningful care process for PLWD.</p><p>These recommendations, while not exhaustive, aim to initiate further dialogue and research into the equity of swallowing treatments for PLWD&#x02014;an area that has been overlooked for too long. Our conceptual framework indicates that barriers to culturally concordant eating and swallowing care exist across multiple levels, from individual providers to broader systems. Therefore, interventions that engage stakeholders across these levels are most likely to yield favorable outcomes for PLWD with diverse cultural and social needs.</p></sec></sec><sec id="alz70028-sec-0320"><label>5</label><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Our conceptual framework offers a novel approach to understanding how health disparities arise and persist throughout the eating and swallowing care process for PLWD. Drawing from the social exposome concept, which examines S/SDOH surrounding an individual and their impact on health outcomes, our framework similarly explores S/SDOH across multiple levels to assess their effects on eating and swallowing care outcomes. By viewing eating and swallowing as a person&#x02010;centered activity influenced by S/SDOH, we can identify barriers and facilitators at various levels, gaining insight into how PLWD navigate the eating and swallowing care process and how disparities in their lived experiences can influence their care outcomes. Moreover, it is essential to understand the role of resources, institutional policies, and broader socioeconomic and political practices that shape the environments involved in eating and swallowing care. By doing so, we can uncover modifiable factors at these levels, creating opportunities for targeted interventions and informing broader policy changes to address eating and swallowing care disparities.</p></sec><sec sec-type="COI-statement" id="alz70028-sec-0340"><title>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT</title><p>Dr. Rogus&#x02010;Pulia is a VA employee and this work was partially supported by the William S.
