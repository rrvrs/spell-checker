Subsequent stimulus repetition retrieves the SR binding from memory, which facilitates (impedes) performance when the same (a different) response is required. We aimed to explore whether <italic>indirect</italic> retrieval of SR bindings by a newly learnt associated stimulus is possible. Participants first went through a learning task to acquire <italic>novel</italic> stimulus-stimulus associations. The same stimulus pairs were then presented in a prime-probe task to assess direct and indirect retrieval effects. Participants responded by classifying word color in prime and probe trials. Probe words were either identical to prime words (test for direct retrieval) or corresponded to the associated stimulus (test for indirect retrieval) or were unrelated words (baseline). Independently of word relation, response relation (repetition vs. change) across prime and probe trials was manipulated. In two highly powered preregistered studies (total <italic>N</italic> = 260) using different types of stimulus associations, we obtained evidence for direct retrieval due to identical word repetition in the probe. Crucially, evidence for indirect retrieval upon presentation of an associated probe word was absent. Controlling for memory of each stimulus-stimulus association did not alter the findings. Our results show that indirect retrieval through newly acquired associations does not occur at the level of SR bindings, at least not for recently acquired stimulus-stimulus associations. Our study illustrates the scope of binding principles and highlights boundary conditions for the stimulus properties that can elicit automatic response retrieval.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Stimulus-response bindings</kwd><kwd>Episodic retrieval</kwd><kwd>Event files</kwd><kwd>Stimulus-stimulus associations</kwd><kwd>Association formation</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GI 1295/2-1</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Friedrich-Schiller-Universit&#x000e4;t Jena (1010)</institution></funding-source></award-group><open-access><p>Open Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL.</p></open-access></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Psychonomic Society, Inc. 2024</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">When you respond to a particular stimulus, this is encoded as a memory episode, termed stimulus-response (SR) binding or <italic>event file</italic> (Hommel, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">1998</xref>). When the stimulus repeats, the previous SR binding is retrieved from memory, which affects your performance (Rothermund et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2005</xref>). If the retrieved SR binding is appropriate, performance typically benefits from the retrieval of SR bindings. Contrarily, if the retrieved SR binding does not match the currently required response, performance costs accrue. These behavioral phenomena show the extent to which SR bindings influence our actions and performance. Notably, even task-irrelevant stimuli that were presented along with the target stimuli can later retrieve the respective response (Frings et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2007</xref>). Generally, SR binding and retrieval (SRBR) effects are documented for various stimuli and responses, which attests that binding and retrieval are core mechanisms of action regulation (Frings et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2020</xref>; Kiesel et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2023</xref>).</p><p id="Par3">Several studies explored the scope of conditions that can trigger retrieval of SR bindings (Frings et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2013</xref>; Horner &#x00026; Henson, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2011</xref>; Laub &#x00026; Frings, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2020</xref>; Singh et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2016</xref>). Findings indicate that retrieval is not limited to the repetition of a perceptually identical stimulus (although this is by far the most potent condition to trigger retrieval processes; Hommel, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2005</xref>). Singh and colleagues (Singh et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2016</xref>; Sch&#x000f6;pper et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2020</xref>) varied stimulus similarity via the luminance of irrelevant shapes. Even for perceptually similar, yet non-identical stimuli, they obtained SRBR effects, which were diminished with increasing stimulus dissimilarity. However, here, perceptual similarity coincided with semantic overlap. Resolving this caveat, Laub and Frings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2020</xref>) provided evidence for retrieval of SR bindings that is due to perceptual similarities even in conditions where semantic meaning clearly differs between integration (i.e., creation of bindings) and later retrieval. Hence, retrieval can also be triggered by different stimuli that are perceptually similar and semantically dissimilar (e.g., <italic>star</italic> retrieves bindings with <italic>scar</italic>; Laub &#x00026; Frings, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2020</xref>).</p><p id="Par4">This research is complemented by evidence for SRBR effects for perceptually dissimilar but semantically related stimuli (Frings et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2013</xref>; Horner &#x00026; Henson, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2011</xref>). For instance, presenting the <italic>picture</italic> of a frog retrieved bindings between the <italic>sound</italic> of a frog and a previous response (or vice versa; Frings et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2013</xref>). This latter finding is of particular importance for our study, because it shows that retrieval effects can be conceptually mediated and can thus occur between <italic>different</italic> distractor stimuli that are linked via an overlearned association that is represented as a common concept. Importantly, activation of the concept does not depend on particular identical stimuli, but can result from activation by different stimuli (e.g., the concept &#x0201c;frog&#x0201d; can be activated by presenting pictures of a frog, hearing the sound of a frog, etc.). Overlearned associations are the result of a learning history of many past pairings of different stimuli sharing the same semantic meaning. These overlearned associations are typically part of semantic long-term memory that is easily accessible for automatic retrieval (Marron et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2020</xref>; see also Kumar et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2021</xref>). However, one may wonder whether it actually takes that many encounters with different stimuli (e.g., actual exposures to frogs and their sounds) to form an overlearned association between both types of stimulation. Possibly, rather few trials are already sufficient to create a common connection between two stimuli. Even though retrieval can be triggered by other associated conceptual representations (Frings et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2013</xref>, Horner &#x00026; Henson, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2011</xref>), it is yet to be explored whether automatic retrieval can be triggered via newly learnt stimulus associations. In the learning literature, a form of this is indicated in sensory preconditioning where newly established stimuli associations can indirectly activate a response that was only learnt with the associated stimulus (Brogden, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">1939</xref>).</p><p id="Par5">In the present study, we explore whether a stimulus can retrieve a response that was given to another, previously associated, stimulus. Thus, we studied indirect response retrieval that is mediated via stimulus-stimulus (S-S) associations that are newly learnt. Contrary to existing studies, we are not interested in overlearned associations or pre-existing concepts (Frings et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2013</xref>). Instead, we focus on <italic>newly acquired</italic> S-S associations that are characterized by a very recent learning history. Our research is motivated by a recent study on contingency learning, showing that a stimulus can indirectly activate learned responses that were contingently paired with another associated stimulus during a training phase within the same experiment (Arunkumar et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2024</xref>). In the first phase, participants learnt different S-S associations. In a second phase, participants then learnt a stimulus-response contingency for one stimulus of each S-S pair (e.g., S1). In a critical test phase, it was assessed whether the <italic>associated</italic> stimulus (S2) can also activate the response that was previously contingently paired with S1. Indeed, this was the case, as participants were more likely to respond to S2 with the response that was previously associated with S1. On a conceptual level, the described method is reminiscent of the sensory preconditioning procedure known from Pavlovian conditioning (e.g., Barr et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2003</xref>; Brogden, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">1939</xref>). This means that sensory preconditioning-like effects also emerge for arbitrary pairings between stimuli and voluntary responses in the contingency learning paradigm. As transient SR bindings are discussed as the cognitive basis of contingency learning effects (e.g., Giesen et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2020</xref>; Schmidt et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2020</xref>), one could speculate that indirect retrieval effects should not only emerge for learnt SR contingencies (as seen in Arunkumar et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2024</xref>), but could possibly also occur at the level of transient bindings. Note that transient SR bindings emerge non-contingently as a by-product of contiguous co-occurrence of stimuli and responses. Even though SRBR effects were found for perceptually dissimilar but conceptually related stimuli (Frings et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2013</xref>; Horner &#x00026; Henson, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2011</xref>), the novelty of this study lies in exploring whether newly learnt associated stimuli can retrieve responses that were never directly linked with them in an episodic rather than contingency-based fashion, as in Arunkumar et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2024</xref>). This research further extends the knowledge regarding the scope of conditions that can trigger retrieval processes and to which extent this is mediated by past (recent or overlearned) associations.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Method</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Experiments 1a and 1b</title><p id="Par6">We investigated two types of S-S associations in two independent studies, one with name-trait visual word pairs (Experiment <xref rid="Sec8" ref-type="sec">1</xref>a) and the other with audiovisual word &#x02013; pseudoword pairs that resemble a new language-learning scenario (Experiment <xref rid="Sec9" ref-type="sec">1</xref>b). Different S-S pairs were used in each experiment to explore the extent of indirect retrieval effects. In Experiment <xref rid="Sec8" ref-type="sec">1</xref>a, unimodal visual pairs that have a plausible connection were used in the form of name-trait pairs as these are commonly encountered while describing people. To further explore the indirect retrieval effects, multimodal pairs were used in Experiment <xref rid="Sec9" ref-type="sec">1</xref>b as they have shown stronger indirect response activation effects (Arunkumar et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2024</xref>). Moreover, these multimodal pairs were intended to resemble a language learning setup since we tend to pick up new words with both visual and audio input. Language learning literature has also shown that semantic properties from words can be transferred to other words or pseudowords (Staats et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">1959</xref>). Hence in Experiment <xref rid="Sec9" ref-type="sec">1</xref>b, word-pseudoword pairs were learned and were then used to test indirect retrieval effects.</p><p id="Par7">The general paradigm of both experiments was as follows: Participants learnt novel associations between stimuli in an <italic>S-S association formation phase</italic>. The same word stimuli were then presented in a prime-probe paradigm to assess direct and indirect retrieval of previous SR bindings. Probe words were either identical (test for direct retrieval) or associated (test for indirect retrieval) with previous prime words, or were unrelated words (baseline). The relation between prime and probe responses (repetition vs. change) was manipulated independently. This design allowed us to test whether presenting the associated stimulus can access and retrieve a SR binding from the previous prime trial. We hypothesized that SRBR effects (indicated by a Word Relation &#x000d7; Response Relation interaction) occur not only when the identical word appears, but also when the associated word appears in the probe.

The experiment duration was 25 min. Participants received &#x000a3;3.75 for participation. Explicit informed consent was collected electronically at the beginning of the study. Note that we had preregistered to exclude participants who showed an accuracy score of 0 in the cued recall test for the S-S association phase at the end of the study. This applied to <italic>N</italic> = 22 participants in Experiment <xref rid="Sec8" ref-type="sec">1</xref>a. Since we felt that a stimulus-wise evaluation of S-S association strength is a better indicator of associative strength among S-S pairs than the person-centered approach, we decided against eliminating data based on participants&#x02019; overall accuracy score.

In Experiment <xref rid="Sec8" ref-type="sec">1</xref>a, the stimulus pairs consisted of name-trait word pairs (e.g., <italic>Ron-calm; Max-neat</italic>), whereas in Experiment <xref rid="Sec9" ref-type="sec">1</xref>b, the stimulus pairs consisted of pairs of German words (<italic>Haus</italic> [house], <italic>Wald</italic> [forest]) and pseudowords (e.g., <italic>mank</italic><italic>, </italic><italic>dels</italic>). In Experiment <xref rid="Sec9" ref-type="sec">1</xref>b, the S-S pair mapping was counterbalanced across participants. Crucially, in Experiment <xref rid="Sec9" ref-type="sec">1</xref>b, the stimuli pairs were also presented auditorily in addition to the visual presentation of the word.&#x000a0;For the second experiment we&#x000a0;chose these stimuli and the&#x000a0;number of presentations because in&#x000a0;Arunkumar et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2024</xref>) where the same stimulus pairs&#x000a0;were used (but German words were presented only visually and pseudowords were presented only auditorily), robust S-S associations in a contingency learning paradigm&#x000a0;were established.</p><p id="Par14">In both experiments, we asked participants to observe the presentation of the two words, which appeared in succession, and to&#x000a0;say the words aloud. Participants were instructed that they had to say the word aloud as the voice responses were recorded. This was used to sustain participants&#x02019; focus throughout the association phase to help remember the S-S associations. However, we actually did not record their voices or use any input from their microphones. At the end of the study, we informed participants regarding this and told them that none of their voices were recorded or saved. Forty occurrences of each pair were presented out of which 20 occurrences were presented with the S1 first and 20 with the S2 appearing first, resulting in a total of 80 trials. This enabled bidirectional learning of the S-S associations. A trial in the association formation phase was as follows: A centrally presented fixation cross (500 ms) was followed by the S1 (e.g., <italic>Max</italic> in Experiment <xref rid="Sec8" ref-type="sec">1</xref>a or <italic>Haus</italic> in Experiment <xref rid="Sec9" ref-type="sec">1</xref>b) for 800 ms. Then, the S2 (e.g., <italic>neat</italic> in Experiment <xref rid="Sec8" ref-type="sec">1</xref>a or <italic>mank</italic> in Experiment <xref rid="Sec9" ref-type="sec">1</xref>b) was displayed for 800 ms, which was followed by the fixation cross for the next trial (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). In Experiment <xref rid="Sec9" ref-type="sec">1</xref>b, the visual presentation was also accompanied by the auditory presentation of the word/pseudoword for 800 ms.</p><p id="Par15">Then, the sequential prime-probe task followed. Participants classified the color of the word in prime and probe trials by pressing <italic>D</italic> for green or pink words and pressing <italic>L</italic> for blue or yellow words. Two colors were mapped onto each response key to avoid a confound between response repetition and color repetition (i.e., even in response repetition trials, stimulus color could change from prime to probe). Based on the word presented in the prime trial, the probe trial either displayed the exact same word (identical repetition, ID, 25%), the associated word (associated, AS, 25%), or a different word (baseline, B, 50%), which was one of the two words from the other stimulus pair. Half of all probe trials required the same response as the preceding prime trial (response repetition, RR), whereas the other half required a different response (response change, RC). The color in which the prime and probe words appeared was balanced (25% each of the four colors). Half of all RR sequences repeated the prime color in the probe (e.g., pink-pink), whereas the remaining RR sequences changed the color in the probe (e.g., pink-green). By definition, all the RC sequences presented probe words in a different color (assignment of colors to RC sequences was balanced, too, meaning that both colors assigned to a key were presented equally often in RC sequences). The prime-probe task consisted of 256 prime-probe trial sequences. In Experiment <xref rid="Sec3" ref-type="sec">1</xref>a, these prime-probe sequences began with a fixation cross (250 ms), followed by the prime trial in which a word appeared in white font (150&#x02013;300 ms in 50&#x000a0;ms steps randomly chosen in every trial) to prevent anticipatory responses, which then changed to one of four target colors: green, yellow, blue, and pink (until response). Then, another fixation cross appeared (150&#x02013;350 ms in 50&#x000a0;ms steps; <italic>M</italic> = 250 ms), followed by the probe trial: A word appeared in white font (150&#x02013;300 ms in 50-ms steps; randomly chosen), which then changed to one of four colors (until response). After a blank black screen (700 ms), the next prime-probe sequence started (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Due to the audiovisual nature of the stimuli in Experiment <xref rid="Sec9" ref-type="sec">1</xref>b, the trial sequence was slightly modified from Experiment <xref rid="Sec3" ref-type="sec">1</xref>a, where the fixation cross was displayed until a spacebar was pressed to indicate the beginning of the current prime-probe sequence. Then the prime trial started with visual presentation of the stimulus in white font (150&#x02013;300 ms in 50-ms steps randomly chosen in every trial) along with the auditory presentation of the stimulus. The visual stimulus then changed into one of four colors: green, yellow, blue and pink (until response).

Also in the probe trial, the visual presentation of the stimulus was first displayed in white (150&#x02013;300ms in 50-ms steps randomly chosen in every trial) along with the auditory presentation of the stimulus. The visual stimulus then changed into one of four colors: green, yellow, blue and pink (until response). Similar to Experiment <xref rid="Sec8" ref-type="sec">1</xref>a, the prime-probe sequence ended with a blank black screen for 700 ms following which the next sequence began. In both experiments, there were two self-paced breaks during this phase.</p><p id="Par16">At the end of the Experiment <xref rid="Sec8" ref-type="sec">1</xref>a, we presented a cued recall test to assess participants&#x02019; memory of the S-S associations. After a fixation cross (500 ms), each of the four words was presented (800 ms), followed by a &#x0201c;?&#x0201d; (800 ms). Following this, a screen appeared asking the participants to choose the word that should have appeared. Participants had to select the correct associated word from a list of options, including (1) the correct associated word, (2) a word from the other pair, and (3) a do not know option. The order of the options was randomly determined for every trial for each participant. Participants gave their response by pressing the corresponding numbers on their keyboard. In Experiment <xref rid="Sec9" ref-type="sec">1</xref>b, the cued recall test was replaced by a translation questionnaire, where participants were asked four questions one by one with a blank black screen as an inter-trial interval of 700 ms. Two questions asked what the German words translate to and the other two questions asked what the pseudowords mean, as the German word-pseudoword stimulus association that was built in the association phase resembled a language-learning scenario. Participants chose the response by pressing the corresponding number that displayed the options. (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The options were either the two German words or the two pseudowords depending on the question. The order of the response options was randomized for each trial.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Design and data analysis</title><p id="Par17">Both the experiments had a 2 Response Relation (RR vs. RC) &#x000d7; 3 Word Relation (ID vs. AS vs. B) within-subjects design.

In Experiment <xref rid="Sec8" ref-type="sec">1</xref>a, we specified two a priori orthogonal contrasts for the Word Relation factor to compare indirect retrieval for the associated word stimuli with direct retrieval for identical word repetitions. According to contrast 1, the two-way interaction (referring to the difference in the word relation effect between RR and RC conditions) should be significantly different from zero for both identical word repetitions and associated probe words, compared with baseline (contrast 1 1 -2). According to contrast 2, retrieval effects (i.e., differences between RR and RC conditions) should be of equal magnitude for identical word repetitions and associated probe words (contrast 1 -1 0, which should not differ from zero), thus expecting that indirect retrieval effects are comparable in size to direct retrieval effects. For Experiment <xref rid="Sec9" ref-type="sec">1</xref>b, we specified different a priori contrasts that were motivated by the findings of Experiment <xref rid="Sec8" ref-type="sec">1</xref>a and provided a direct measure of testing direct and indirect SRBR effects. The first contrast represents the direct SRBR effect by comparing the interaction for the identical probe words versus word change (1 0 -1) and the response relation factor. This contrast should be significantly different from zero (directional test) and should reflect standard SR binding and retrieval effects. The second contrast reflects the indirect retrieval effect by comparing whether there is also a significant interaction between associated probe word versus word changes (0 1 -1) and the response relation factor. If this test is significant, we can assume that indirect retrieval effects are present since the associated words are also exhibiting binding and retrieval effects like the identical stimulus relation condition.

The three-way interaction between item-specific S-S recall accuracy, word relation, and response relation missed significance (Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). So even in this experiment with multimodal stimulus associations, accurately recalling the associated word did not modulate the strength of the respective indirect prime-response retrieval effects.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>General discussion</title><p id="Par27">Previous research showed that (a) different stimuli that are semantically associated but perceptually dissimilar can also retrieve SR bindings, similar to when the exact stimulus repeats (Frings et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2013</xref>). Furthermore, (b) stimuli can access and indirectly activate learnt SR contingencies that involve a newly learnt associated stimulus (Arunkumar et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2024</xref>). Also, (c) transient bindings can form the basis of contingency learning (Giesen et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2020</xref>; Schmidt et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2020</xref>). Against this background, we investigated whether retrieval of transient bindings can also be mediated by <italic>newly acquired</italic> S-S associations. We conducted two experiments that used a similar paradigm with the difference being the type of S-S associations used. Participants first learnt novel associations between names and trait adjectives presented visually in Experiment <xref rid="Sec8" ref-type="sec">1</xref>a or learnt an association between German words and pseudowords presented audio-visually in Experiment <xref rid="Sec9" ref-type="sec">1</xref>b. To test for response retrieval effects, the words used in the prime and probe were either identical, associated, or different. Results are clear-cut and alike in both experiments irrespective of the difference in the type of S-S associations: First, we obtained robust SRBR effects for identical word repetitions in the probe that were in the effect size range that is comparable to other studies on SRBR effects for irrelevant words (e.g., Giesen &#x00026; Eder, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2022</xref>; Giesen &#x00026; Rothermund, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2016</xref>) in Experiment <xref rid="Sec8" ref-type="sec">1</xref>a and in Experiment <xref rid="Sec9" ref-type="sec">1</xref>b (the latter showed even larger SRBR effects). Second and more importantly, SRBR effects were absent for presentations of associated probe words. These results argue against indirect retrieval effects for recently acquired S-S associations. Note that this interpretation is based on null findings from two highly powered, preregistered experiments. Both experiments were sufficiently powered to detect even small effect sizes (<italic>d</italic><sub><italic>z</italic></sub> = 0.22); furthermore, Bayes factor analyses indicate that the null hypothesis (i.e., absence of SRBR effects for associated words) is 7.5 times more likely than the alternative hypothesis (moderate evidence according to van Doorn et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2021</xref>) in Experiment <xref rid="Sec8" ref-type="sec">1</xref>a and 3.6 times more likely in Experiment <xref rid="Sec9" ref-type="sec">1</xref>b. This shows that, in case of transient episodic retrieval, newly learnt associations cannot retrieve responses from associated stimuli.</p><p id="Par28">To support this claim further, we also tested the extent to which the strength of the S-S associations at the level of particular stimuli influenced the presence/absence of an indirect SRBR effect. One might argue that not all participants might have learnt the S-S associations very well. However, in Experiment <xref rid="Sec8" ref-type="sec">1</xref>a more than half of all participants had better than chance performance in the memory test (see Footnote 3). An even larger proportion of participants were aware of the S-S associations in Experiment <xref rid="Sec9" ref-type="sec">1</xref>b,&#x000a0; which resembled a language-learning scenario and thus possibly made it easier to encode the associations. Moreover, examining the indirect SRBR effects as a function of stimulus-specific recall of the associated stimulus revealed no influence of the memory of S-S association on the SRBR effects. Indirect SRBR effects did not even emerge for stimuli for which the S-S association was correctly recalled. Differences in memory strength for S-S associations alone therefore cannot explain the absence of SRBR effects for associated words.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Limitations</title><p id="Par29">Possibly, although participants knew which word pairs were presented in the learning phase and could report this knowledge in a later memory test, the words within a pair were not (yet) strongly associated with each other to an extent to which these associations are available for automatic retrieval. Thus, it did not lead to an automatic co-activation of the word that was paired with the retrieval cue. Associations between different stimuli are established in semantic memory over a long time period and due to many pairings, which allow them to be easily accessible to enable retrieval benefits (Chein &#x00026; Schneider, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2012</xref>). This might imply that 40 S1-S2 presentations per each pair as seen in both the studies are (a) sufficient to equip participants with explicit knowledge of which words go together (Arunkumar et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2024</xref>), but are (b) not sufficient to create new associations in semantic memory to enable for an automatic indirect SR retrieval. Even though language learning tends to store information in semantic long-term memory (Dijsktra &#x00026; Van Heuven, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2002</xref>), our attempt to replicate this with multimodal stimulus pairs containing a German word and pseudoword did not show any indirect retrieval effects. In line with this argument, memory research found that novel word associations need more consolidation, such as a 24-h time period, to show semantic priming effects and elicit automatic retrieval processes (e.g., Bakker et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2015</xref>). Knowledge of past pairings, then, is not the same as an association, because it cannot trigger episodic retrieval processes. Tentatively, this implies that conceptually mediated retrieval of SR bindings requires the existence of previously established overlearned associations (e.g., Frings et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2013</xref>). Examining whether participants had only knowledge of pairings but did not yet semantically associate words with each other would require a real test for associations (e.g., a semantic priming paradigm) and might represent a promising avenue for future research.</p><p id="Par30">The present experiments assessed direct and indirect retrieval effects in the same paradigm, yet via different prime-probe sequences: Whereas direct retrieval only operates on probe trials with identical repetition at the stimulus level, indirect retrieval (supposedly) operates on trials in which non-identical, associated stimuli are presented in prime and probe. Effects of direct or indirect retrieval are assessed against baseline trials in which non-identical, non-associated stimuli are presented in prime and probe. We concede that the strong perceptual similarity existing in the measure of direct retrieval (identical stimulus repetition from prime to probe) possibly inflates the size of the direct retrieval effect due to overlap at the semantic <italic>and</italic> perceptual level.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn4">4</xref> One could even argue that the possibility of retrieval via perceptual similarity might reduce the chances of more indirect retrieval processes (via semantic associations) to come to work. This could potentially be a reason why for the associated words, the indirect retrieval effects were absent. However, this is speculative, and needs to be tested in future studies with an altered design suited to tackle this caveat. Therefore, as an alternative design option for further research, after stimulus-stimulus association learning, the condition of identical stimuli repetition in the probe could be removed, thus presenting only the associated or different stimuli in the prime-probe task. Without identical probes and thus without any interfering retrieval by perceptual similarity, retrieval effects for the associated probes might in fact show. Alternatively, perceptually similar stimulus pairs could be used for both the associated and neutral conditions, in order to test whether indirect retrieval via associations might depend on perceptual similarity. By these modifications, future studies could further test whether newly learnt associations can lead to indirect retrieval.</p><p id="Par31">The present limitations notwithstanding, our study is clearly informative for binding research, because it sheds light on boundary conditions that limit the range of episodic binding and retrieval principles. In line with previous findings (Arunkumar et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2022</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2024</xref>), it appears that any form of knowledge about stimulus pairings or awareness of contingencies between stimuli and/or responses limits the applicability of episodic accounts like the Binding and Retrieval in Action Control framework (BRAC; Frings et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2020</xref>) to explain performance.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="Fn1"><label>1</label><p id="Par32">The pilot experiment (<italic>N</italic> = 71; preregistration can be found here: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/ZGDFV">https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/ZGDFV</ext-link>) was identical to Experiment <xref rid="Sec8" ref-type="sec">1a</xref>, but yielded unexpectedly small SRBR effects with effect sizes for identical stimulus repetitions of <italic>d</italic><sub><italic>z</italic></sub> = 0.22, which failed the conventional significance criterion (typically, effect sizes for identical word repetitions in color classification tasks produce effect sizes of <italic>d</italic><sub><italic>z</italic></sub>=.35 or higher, cf.

Since our study was the first to investigate the possibility of indirect retrieval effects, we settled on the effect size from the pilot study as a more conservative estimate. It was crucial to at least achieve a significant direct retrieval effect to begin with given the modified paradigm, hence the effect size for identical stimuli was used as a reference to determine sample size (Brysbaert, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2019</xref>).</p></fn><fn id="Fn2"><label>2</label><p id="Par33">RT values below 150 ms or higher than 1.5 interquartile range above the 75th percentile of the individual RT distribution were regarded as outliers (Tukey, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">1977</xref>).</p></fn><fn id="Fn3"><label>3</label><p id="Par34">In line with our pre-registration, we also looked at the influence of S-S association memory in a person-centered analysis, using participants&#x02019; overall accuracy score (aggregated across items).
