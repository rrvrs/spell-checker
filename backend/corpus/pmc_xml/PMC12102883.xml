However, post-intervention, their sales remained broadly constant (IRR 1.000, 95%CI 0.995&#x02013;1.006). Similarly, Chloramphenicol sales decreased by 0.6% in the first month, whereas sales increased by a trend of 0.4% per month (IRR 1.004, 95%CI 0.991&#x02013;1.017) post-intervention.

However, there was a modest increase in sales of Macrolides by 3.0%, Cephalosporins by 2.9% and broad-spectrum Penicillin by 0.2% in the first month.

As per the latest Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study 2016 estimates, diarrhoeal diseases and lower respiratory infections continue to remain among the top five leading causes of Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) in India [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. This high burden of infectious diseases in children is also reflected in antibiotic prescription patterns at the country level. Recent research indicates that in the private sector, the antibiotic prescription rates were highest for children aged 0&#x02013;4 years and the majority of the antibiotic prescriptions were dispensed for acute upper respiratory infections (20.4%), unspecified acute lower respiratory infections (12.5%), cough (4.7%); and acute nasopharyngitis (4.6%) which do not necessarily require antibiotics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. More recent estimates suggest that between 2011 and 2019, the annual antibiotic consumption rate in India decreased by 3.6% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. However, there were wide heterogeneities across the Indian States, and inappropriate antibiotic use among High Focus states (Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Northeastern states) increased during the same period. Koya et al. also reported a relative increase of 21.2% for oral liquid preparations that are used in the paediatric population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Though access to medicines is an important concern in India, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is an emerging threat. Klein et al. reported that in 2019, India had the highest Drug Resistance Index (DRI) rate, a composite index that combines antibiotic consumption rates and resistance across multiple pathogen combinations, and therefore the lowest relative effectiveness of antibiotic therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. </p><p id="Par6">Vaccines remain one of the most cost-effective interventions to reduce infectious disease burden at the individual and population levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Empirical evidence suggests that vaccines not only protect against primary and secondary infections from vaccine-preventable diseases they also reduce the demand for antibiotics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Theoretical [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], empirical [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and modelling studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] have demonstrated that vaccination against a target pathogen directly reduces disease incidence. This entails reduced antibiotic consumption and AMR for that pathogen, and at the same time, reduces the potential for AMR in other pathogens. Hence, estimating the potential impact of vaccination on the reduction of demand for antibiotics is an important policy question.</p><p id="Par7">India&#x02019;s Universal Immunisation Programme (UIP) offers twelve vaccines free of cost to a cohort of 27&#x000a0;million children and 30&#x000a0;million pregnant women through 12&#x000a0;million sessions annually [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. More recently, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MOHFW) launched Intensified Mission Indradhanush (IMI)&#x02013; a periodic intensification of routine immunisation strategy - between October 2017 and January 2018 to address socioeconomic inequalities in access to immunisation to achieve immunization coverage of 90% in districts and urban areas with previously low levels of coverage, across 24 states [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The implementation strategy included the identification of under-immunised children by conducting door-to-door surveys and appropriate locations for immunisation sites, with particular emphasis on urban slums and nomadic populations through district-level micro-plans. The increase in full immunization coverage (FIC) after IMI, compared with National Family Health Survey (NFHS-4) was highest for Assam (31% points), followed by Madhya Pradesh (26.4% points), North-Eastern states (23.9% points), Maharashtra (20.3% points), Bihar (15.3% points), Uttar Pradesh (15.2% points) and Rajasthan (11.6% points). The impact of IMI on the improvement of coverage rates of standard UIP vaccines in the implementation districts is well documented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. However, the impact of IMI on antibiotic usage isn&#x02019;t known.</p><p id="Par8">We hypothesized that an increase in immunisation coverage rates under the IMI program should lead to a decline in infection rate and consequently a reduction in antibiotic consumption at the population level. In this empirical analysis, we estimated the potential impact of the IMI on private-sector antibiotic utilisation using a quasi-experimental approach and population-level antibiotic consumption data.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Data</title><p id="Par9">We analysed the PharmaTrac dataset&#x02014;a nationally representative drug sales audit dataset. The PharmaTrac sample covers 60% of stockists (intermediaries between carrying and forwarding agents and retail pharmacy shops in the pharmaceutical supply chain), which corresponds to 18,000 distributors, 32,000 sub-stockists, and 500,000 retailers spread across 23 different regions in India [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The data is collected by a market research company, All-Indian Origin Chemists and Distributors Limited (AIOCD) and has been previously used to estimate antibiotic consumption in India [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], impact evaluation of Schedule H1 - antimicrobial sales regulation in India [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], and several other research studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The PharmaTrac Dataset uses the European Pharmaceutical Market Research Association (EphMRA) approach to arrange medicines into the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification. We employed this classification to identify systemic antibacterials (classified under J1), their dosage forms, and their utilisation in the private sector in terms of monetary value (Indian National Rupee) and volume for selected Indian states. The primary target population of the IMI was children under the age of 5 years; hence, we measured the potential impact of IMI on pediatric oral antibiotic use. We considered oral liquid antibiotic consumption as a proxy for paediatric oral antibiotic use and included only liquid dosage forms of systemic antibacterials in our analysis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Intervention under study</title><p id="Par10">The intervention - IMI - was implemented from October 2017 to January 2018. It was implemented in 121 districts (including 52 districts from the Northeastern states) and 17 urban areas across the country. We selected Bihar (16 districts), Madhya Pradesh (14 districts), Maharashtra (11 districts), Rajasthan (12 districts), Uttar Pradesh (60 districts) and the Northeastern (52 districts) States for this research as these states contributed the majority of districts selected for IMI implementation. The study period was from January 2015 to December 2019. The time period was selected to ensure a sufficient number of pre-intervention (33 months) and post-intervention (27 months) data points to compare antibiotic usage rates before and after the implementation of IMI.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Outcome</title><p id="Par11">The primary outcome measure was &#x02018;antibiotics sales volume per month&#x02019;&#x02013; a proxy for the utilisation of antibiotics in the private sector. We report the percentage change (increase or decrease) in the sales volume of oral liquid antibiotics after the implementation of IMI, measured in standard units (SUs), which is the smallest formulation dose (one bottle of oral liquid). We stratified the outcome data by selected Indian states (Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Maharashtra Uttar Pradesh-East, Uttar Pradesh-West and Northeastern States) and by antibiotic classes (Chloramphenicol and combinations (J1B), Broad spectrum penicillin (J1C), Cephalosporins (J1D), Trimethoprim and similar formulations (J1E), Macrolides and similar types (J1F), Fluoroquinolones (J1G)).</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Research design</title><p id="Par12">Interrupted time series (ITS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] - a quasi-experimental research design was used to estimate the potential impact of IMI on private-sector antibiotic utilisation in India.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="Par13">We conducted interrupted time series analyses by fitting a Poisson regression model with the Newey&#x02013;West standard errors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] to account for autocorrelation and heterogeneity of variance, i.e. heteroskedasticity. The model included a time variable, a dummy intervention variable indicating the pre-IMI period and post-IMI period, and an interaction term between time and the intervention variable. This approach takes account of pre-intervention trends and allows estimation of the effect of the intervention at various timepoints by centring time at that timepoint.</p><p id="Par14">Our regression equation was as follows:<disp-formula id="Equa"><alternatives><tex-math id="d33e335">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

</p><p id="Par26">Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> presents the potential impact of IMI on total antibiotic utilisation across Indian states. The segmented regression analysis showed weak evidence of a small decrease in antibiotic sales in the first month of IMI implementation (October 2017) in Northeastern States (IRR 0.977, 95% CI 0.861&#x02013;1.107) and Rajasthan (IRR 0.984, 95% CI 0.878&#x02013;1.102). Post-IMI implementation (after October 2017), antibiotic sales decreased by a trend of 0.6% per month (IRR 0.994, 95% CI 0.988-1.000) in Northeastern states and decreased by a rate of 0.1% per month (IRR 0.999, 95% CI 0.994&#x02013;1.004) in Rajasthan. However, in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh-West, antibiotic sales showed a decrease in the first month of IMI implementation (October 2017) by 4.1% (IRR 0.959, 95% CI 0.851&#x02013;1.081) and 0.5% (IRR 0.995, 95% CI 0.873&#x02013;1.134), respectively. Thereafter, in the post-intervention period, antibiotic sales increased by a trend of 1.2% per month (IRR 1.012, 95% CI 1.007&#x02013;1.018) in Bihar and by 0.9% per month (IRR 1.009, 95% CI 1.003&#x02013;1.015) in Uttar Pradesh-West.</p><p id="Par27">Furthermore, there was an increase in antibiotic sales in Madhya Pradesh by 16.1% (IRR 1.161 (0.999&#x02013;1.348), in Maharashtra by 9.5% (IRR 1.095, 95% CI 0.974&#x02013;1.233) and Uttar Pradesh-East by 2.2% (IRR 1.022 (0.887&#x02013;1.179) in the first month of the IMI implementation which persisted in post-intervention period, at a monthly rate of 0.5% (IRR 1.005, 95% CI 0.998&#x02013;1.011) in Madhya Pradesh, 0.3% per month (IRR 1.003, 95% CI 0.997&#x02013;1.010) in Uttar Pradesh -East increased but remained broadly constant (IRR 0.999, 95% CI 0.994&#x02013;1.005) in Maharashtra.</p><p id="Par28">There was heterogeneity in antibiotic utilisation by the antibiotic class type (Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4</xref>, Figures <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>-<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S5</xref> in Additional File <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>) across Indian states, which was driving the country-level IMI impact for each antibiotic class under consideration. For example, only Trimethoprim sales showed a decreasing post-intervention trend relative to the pre-intervention trend across all States. Broad-spectrum Penicillins, Cephalosporins and Fluoroquinolones had a decreasing post-intervention trend in Rajasthan, while Macrolides showed an increasing post-intervention trend across all States except the Northeastern states.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par29">We present the potential impact of periodic intensification of routine immunisation strategy - IMI - on private-sector antibiotic utilisation in India. Our results suggest a decrease in the monthly sales of Trimethoprim and broadly constant sales of Fluoroquinolones in the post-intervention period. However, there was a minor increase in monthly antibiotic sales (range 0.5&#x02009;&#x02212;&#x02009;0.9% per month) post-IMI implementation for broad-spectrum Penicillins, Cephalosporins, and Macrolides. Furthermore, there was heterogeneity in the impact of IMI on total antibiotic utilisation across Indian states. In the post-IMI implementation period, Rajasthan and Northeastern states had a decrease in antibiotic sales while Bihar, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh had an increase.</p><p id="Par30">Several studies have estimated the potential impact of IMI from different perspectives, some estimated the impact of IMI on full immunisation coverage while others on an increase in antigen-specific vaccine delivery rate. Gurnani et al. reported that full immunisation coverage in IMI districts increased by 18.5% from pre-IMI levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Similarly, using a controlled interrupted time series approach, Clarke-Deelder et al. analysed district-level data and reported that IMI resulted in increased delivery of traditional UIP vaccines, with a median effect of 10.6% (95% CI 5.1&#x02013;16.5%) during the implementation period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. However, none of these recently published studies analysed the relationship between immunisation and demand for antibiotics. Ours is the first and only study that has attempted to quantify the potential impact of IMI on antibiotic utilisation, particularly oral liquid antibiotic preparations, which are predominantly used in children. Private-sector antibiotic utilisation is a good proxy for actual antibiotic use at the community level in India since 85&#x02013;90% of medicine expenditure is incurred in the private sector [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. </p><p id="Par31">Recent research on the effects of vaccination on antibiotic consumption has also confirmed that the pneumococcal vaccine provides 19.7% (95% CI, 3.4&#x02013;43.4%) protection and the rotavirus vaccine confers 11.4% (4.0&#x02013;18.6%) protection against antibiotic-treated episodes of acute respiratory infection and diarrhoea, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. A meta-analysis also confirmed that pneumococcal vaccination (Ratio of Means 0.92, 95% CI 0.85&#x02013;1.00) and influenza vaccination (Ratio of Means 0.71, 95% CI 0.62&#x02013;0.83) results in a decrease in the number of antibiotic prescriptions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. However, there is a knowledge gap in the dynamic relationship between the intensification of routine immunisation activities and the demand for antibiotics at the population level. Our study attempts to answer this question. We observed heterogeneity in the trend of antibiotic utilisation in the post-IMI implementation period. One of the possible reasons for no significant decline in the post-intervention trend of broad-spectrum Penicillins, Cephalosporins and Macrolides is their broad spectrum of activity and indications. These antibiotics are widely prescribed for respiratory tract infections, the majority of which are viral in origin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Hence, the likelihood of overuse of these antibiotics is high along with classical respiratory antibiotics such as Macrolides. Increased use of these antibiotics may have influenced the reduction in Trimethoprim utilisation post-IMI implementation.</p><p id="Par32">Another possible explanation is the substitutability of antibiotics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] across indications which makes it easier for prescribers to use broad-spectrum antibiotics, especially in the private sector. Previous research has indicated that though the per-capita antibiotic consumption rate in India is relatively low compared to many countries, consumption of broad-spectrum antibiotics remains high [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. A reduction in fluoroquinolones may be a reflection of a reduction in diarrhoeal diseases at the population level because of the introduction of the rotavirus vaccine in the immunisation program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Another possible reason is their substitutability with cephalosporins for several indications resulting in lower prescriptions, as they are not recommended in children aged less than 5 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. </p><p id="Par33">We also observed wide heterogeneities for the impact of the IMI across states. The declining trend in state-level antibiotic utilisation per month post-IMI implementation in the Northeastern states is a reflection of the intensive nature of the IMI implementation in the Northeastern states. As per the operational guidelines, among the 190 districts selected for the IMI, 57 (30%) were from Northeastern states. Furthermore, most districts in the northeast recorded more than a 20% point increase in full immunisation coverage between the National Family Health Survey-4 and Intensive Mission Indradhanush round [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. They also reported more than 75% coverage for key antigens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Hence, the potential impact of IMI on reducing the demand for antibiotics is comparatively higher in Northeastern states compared to other states.</p><p id="Par34">Though several districts in Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar and Maharashtra had reported more than a 20% increase in full immunisation coverage there was no significant reduction in state-level antibiotic utilisation in the post-IMI implementation period. One of the reasons could be the easy availability of antibiotics over the counter at retail pharmacies which may have resulted in the overuse of antibiotics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] that might have blunted the impact of IMI. Another explanation may be heterogeneity in the intensity of IMI implementation and hence immunisation coverage rates&#x02013; the marginal impact of IMI on demand for antibiotics is conditional on the immunisation coverage rates. Clarke-Deelder et al. also reported that there was no evidence of a sustained effect of IMI in the intervention districts, 8-months post-IMI implementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Furthermore, though antibiotics are prescribed for all types of infections, some of them may not be vaccine-preventable. Hence, demand for antibiotics may or may not reduce at the population level. For example, vaccines that prevent pneumonia, such as Pentavalent and PCV, and diarrhoea, such as the rotavirus vaccine, may have a limited impact on demand for antibiotics, as viral infections and other causes of pneumonia and diarrhoea would still result in antibiotic prescriptions and overuse.</p><p id="Par35">For the states of Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, and Uttar Pradesh, one of the reasons for no significant reduction in antibiotic use could be high infection rates and hence higher rates of antibiotic prescription. Previous research has indicated these states have higher than the national mean all-age DALY rates for infectious disease conditions such as lower respiratory infections, tuberculosis, diarrhoeal diseases, and intestinal infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Furthermore, there is a delay in achieving a desired level of immunisation coverage that is commensurate with population-level herd immunity to protect non-vaccinated individuals. Recent research has also demonstrated that private antibiotic consumption was positively associated with private vaccine consumption when monthly lags were fewer than 18 months, but had a negative association when 32 or more months had elapsed after vaccine consumption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par36">The PharmaTrac data set has been used previously to conduct an impact evaluation of antimicrobial stewardship policies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. As per the national health accounts estimates for India [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], around 85&#x02013;90% of medicine expenditure is incurred in the private sector. Hence, our impact IMI estimates are likely to capture the true effect size. However, our study has some limitations. First, we could not estimate the potential impact of IMI on public-sector antibiotic use as PharmaTrac data does not capture public-sector antibiotic use. Second, since the PharmaTrac data is aggregated at the state level, we could not report district-level estimates and impact. Third, antibiotic sales data do not capture the actual antibiotic consumption by an individual; hence, age and gender-specific outcomes could not be estimated.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par37">We found heterogeneity in the impact of IMI implementation on private-sector antibiotic utilisation across antibiotic classes as well as the Indian states. Though we used nationally representative data, the estimated effect sizes were small. We recommend that the impact evaluation of immunisation on antibiotic utilisation should be carried out using population-based cohorts not only for new vaccine introductions but also for periodic intensification of routine immunisation strategies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.</p><p>
