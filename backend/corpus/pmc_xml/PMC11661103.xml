The terminal exhaustion phenotypes of effector T-cells and the accumulation of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) have been thoroughly characterized in established SCC. However, it is unclear what precancerous lesions harbor a bona fide high risk for malignant transformation and how precancerous epithelial dysplasia drives the immune system to the point of no return. Here we show that expression of SRY-box transcription factor 2 (SOX2) in precancerous lesions imparts an irreversible risk that recruits suppressive myeloid cells by promoting the release of CCL2. We developed a unique genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM) to recapitulate the malignant transformation of epithelial dysplasia to SCC in the oral mucosa with high histologic and phenotypic fidelity. Using a combination of longitudinal human specimens and the Sox2-GEMM, we found that the myeloid cells in precancerous epithelial dysplasia exhibit a distinctive dichotomous profile featuring high levels of IL-1&#x003b1;-SLC2A1 and low levels of type-I interferon (IFN-I) signatures, which occurs before SCC emerges histologically. Brief priming of myeloid cells with IL-1&#x003b1; desensitizes them to IFN-I agonists and makes myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) even more suppressive of T-cell activation. Mechanistically, IL-1 activation represses the expression of DHHC3/7 enzymes, which are responsible for the palmitoylation of stimulator of interferon genes (STING). Early blockade of IL1 signaling using pharmacologic and genetic approaches similarly reduces MDSC and SLC2A1<sup>high</sup> myeloid cells, suppresses epithelial dysplasia transformation, and extends survival. This work establishes a previously unrecognized SOX2-CCL2-IL1 pathway that leads to irreversible immune escape when precancerous epithelial lesions transform.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Head and Neck Cancer</kwd><kwd>Oral Epithelial Dysplasia</kwd><kwd>CCL7</kwd><kwd>SOX2</kwd><kwd>Interferon</kwd><kwd>IL1</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1"><title>Main</title><p id="P4">Extensive characterization of the microenvironment of established cancers has revealed complex compensatory immune suppressive mechanisms, such as the engagement of multiple immune checkpoint receptor pathways, massive recruitment of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC), and the expansion of regulatory T-cells and suppressive B-cell subsets. Thus, targeting a single pathway of immune suppression at late stages is often insufficient. Human papillomavirus (HPV)<sup>&#x02212;</sup> Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC) is such an example, which shows a modest response rate to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) despite high tumor mutational burden<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. HPV<sup>&#x02212;</sup> HNSCC is preceded by pre-cancerous lesions, coined as oral epithelial dysplasia (OED). However, it remains unclear how intra-lesional immune infiltrate reaches a point of no return to terminal exhaustion during malignant transformation. OED is among the most common mucosal lesions, affecting ~6% of the global population, with an estimated 12% transformation rate. Despite vigilant monitoring, a subset of OED transforms into HNSCC. Surgical excision cannot reverse field cancerization. The identification of the earliest events leading to immune tolerance at the transformation site offers promise to develop better immunoprevention strategies for high-risk lesions.</p><p id="P5">Whole exome sequencing of squamous cell carcinomas of the lung, esophagus, skin, and head and neck has revealed that the amplification of the 3q26.3 locus is a common hotspot driver event. Two genes at this locus, <italic toggle="yes">SOX2</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">PIK3CA</italic>, are amplified in about 20% of HNSCC<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. Patients with Fanconi anemia suffer from an extremely early onset of HNSCC with some cases seen in patients in the first to second decades of their lives, which provides an opportunity to identify high risk events for epithelial malignant transformation. The HNSCC cases associated with Fanconi anemia have much fewer point mutations but harbor <italic toggle="yes">SOX2</italic> amplification in 78% of the cases<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>, further highlighting the important role of this driver event. Previously, we found that SOX2-expressing tumors excluded cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTL) from the tumor microenvironment (TME) in an implantable syngeneic mouse model<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. However, how <italic toggle="yes">SOX2</italic> amplification in transforming epithelial cells establishes peripheral immune tolerance is largely unknown.</p><p id="P6">Here we developed a genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM) mimicking <italic toggle="yes">SOX2</italic> amplification in the oral epithelium and utilized matched longitudinal human specimens to identify early high-risk features, which potentiate the irreversible malignant transformation of OED. We have revealed unique early immunometabolic markers arising in the pre-cancerous lesions prior to the appearance of HNSCC histology. SOX2 promotes CCL2 to expand intra-lesional myeloid cells exhibiting high expression levels of IL-1 signatures, glycolysis signatures, and low expression levels of type-I interferon (IFN-I) signatures. As a mechanism, IL-1&#x003b1; priming desensitizes myeloid cells to cytoplasmic DNA-induced IFN-I activation by inhibiting the palmitoylation of the adaptor protein, Stimulator of interferon genes (STING). Early blockade of IL1 signaling through genetic or pharmacologic approaches delays the onset of SOX2-driven epithelial malignant transformation.</p><sec id="S2"><title>Oral epithelial cell expression of Sox2 drives HNSCC initiation.</title><p id="P7">To longitudinally monitor precancer transformation, we crossed <italic toggle="yes">K5-CreER</italic> with <italic toggle="yes">Rosa26-Sox2-Enhanced Green Fluorescence Protein (EGFP)</italic> and topically painted the oral mucosa with tamoxifen to produce the Sox2-GEMM, in which oral epithelial cells expressed Sox2-EGFP (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). We generated heterozygous and homozygous compound strains and noted a dose-dependent expression of <italic toggle="yes">Sox2</italic> in the oral epithelium (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Human HNSCC contains diagnostic features, including high-grade cytologic features, the transition between normal and dysplastic epithelium, the presence of invasive tumor islands, the formation of keratin pearls, and the establishment of stroma and immune-cell infiltration (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1D</xref>). However, the implantation-based models cannot recapitulate all key histologic features. For example, human patient-derived xenograft (PDX) retains many high-grade cytologic features and abundant keratin. However, these implantable tumors often grow like an epidermoid cyst in vivo with keratin being the most abundant content of the cyst-like structures (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1F</xref>). More importantly, PDX cannot model tumor-immune interactions. Multiple syngeneic HNSCC models have been established, which provide valuable tools to study the TME. However, due to the nature of these models, they cannot recapitulate the early epithelial transformation phase of the disease. Histologic examinations revealed spindle-cell or squamous-like high-grade tumor cells, with little stromal complexity and architectural resemblance to human HNSCC (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref> and <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1H</xref>).</p><p id="P8">We treated the Sox2-GEMM or <italic toggle="yes">K5-CreER</italic> control mice with a carcinogen, DMBA, or PBS. Buccal mucosa and tongue were subjected to histologic examination. We found that Sox2 expression was a potent driver of HNSCC. The homozygous compound strain developed HNSCC with or without additional DMBA painting. The histologic features of Sox2-GEMM show high-fidelity recapitulation of human HNSCC (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1I</xref> to <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1L</xref>). Importantly, longitudinal monitoring of the Sox2-GEMM revealed an early transitional phase where oral epithelium exhibited dysplastic features that were highly similar to human OED, such as architectural disturbance, cell crowding, nuclear hyperchromasia, and increased mitotic counts above the basal layer (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1M</xref> and <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1N</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Sox2-GEMM shows key immunophenotypic features of initiating HNSCC.</title><p id="P9">The <italic toggle="yes">K5-CreER</italic><sup>+</sup><italic toggle="yes">;Sox2</italic><sup>+/&#x02212;</sup> strain without DMBA showed about 60&#x02013;80% HNSCC penetrance 160 days post-induction, and the <italic toggle="yes">K5-CreER</italic><sup>+</sup><italic toggle="yes">;Sox2</italic><sup>+/+</sup> strain showed 100% spontaneous penetrance about four to six weeks post-induction (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). The majority of the lesions arose in the buccal mucosa. We did not observe cancers arising in the tongue without DMBA treatment. About 60% of the <italic toggle="yes">K5-CreER</italic><sup>+</sup><italic toggle="yes">;Sox2</italic><sup>+/+</sup> mice developed tongue cancer when co-treated with DMBA.

While the majority of the HNSCC in <italic toggle="yes">K5-CreER</italic><sup>+</sup><italic toggle="yes">;Sox2</italic><sup>+/+</sup> mice were microscopic due to their rapid onset, some tumors were seen grossly (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). We engineered an endomicroscope for direct laser confocal imaging and revealed EGFP-expressing Sox2<sup>+</sup> transformed oral epithelial cells in live animals (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). Then, we harvested buccal mucosa from <italic toggle="yes">K5-CreER</italic><sup>+</sup><italic toggle="yes">;Sox2</italic><sup>+/+</sup> mice and <italic toggle="yes">K5-CreER</italic> control mice five weeks after tamoxifen was painted in the oral mucosa. We stained the paraffin-embedded oral mucosa with immunohistochemical markers and found that the invasive squamous cell carcinoma islands showed diffuse strong nuclear staining of Sox2, as expected. These tumors showed a high Ki-67 index, with the staining patterns of p63 and p53 similar to those of human HNSCC (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>).</p><p id="P10">Hypoxia is a key feature of HNSCC, which shows a median partial pressure of oxygen (pO<sub>2</sub>) of 9 mmHg, in contrast with a pO<sub>2</sub> of 40&#x02013;60 mmHg in the paired normal tissue<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. To assess whether the Sox2-GEMM recapitulates this characteristic metabolic alteration, we first dissected buccal mucosa from homozygous Sox2-GEMM and K5-CreER control mice five weeks post-tamoxifen oral painting. We found that the expression levels of <italic toggle="yes">Hif1a</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Slc2a1</italic> were significantly increased in transformed buccal mucosa (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref> and <xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1A</xref>). Slc2a1 encodes a glucose transporter to support the high glycolysis demand in cancer cells and myeloid cells while T-cells express high levels of <italic toggle="yes">Slc2a3</italic>, another glucose transporter, in the TME<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. A meta-analysis of 37 studies involving 3,272 HNSCC patients showed that the expression levels of <italic toggle="yes">SLC2A1</italic> were inversely correlated with overall survival, disease-free survival, and recurrence-free survival<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. We stained normal mucosa, transforming OED two weeks post-induction and HNSCC five weeks post-induction with a Slc2a1-specific antibody. In normal mucosa, the Slc2a1 stain was either negative or showed a weak cytoplasmic staining pattern. However, in transforming OED, Slc2a1 assumed a conspicuous membranous staining pattern in the lesional areas, with a clear demarcation from the adjacent and relatively normal epithelium, which lacked the membrane staining pattern. HNSCC showed a diffuse, strong membranous staining pattern (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). Notably, the infiltrating lymphocytes were largely negative for Slc2a1 in both OED and HNSCC (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). This finding is consistent with a TCGA analysis, in which we found that HNSCC expressed significantly higher levels of SLC2A1 than control mucosa (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>).</p><p id="P11">To explore the functional impact of high SLC2A1 expression in HNSCC on the tumor immune infiltrate, we deconvolved the immune landscape of 520 TCGA HNSCC patients, using a robust tool, FARDEEP<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. We found that the expression levels of <italic toggle="yes">SLC2A1</italic> were significantly inversely correlated with the frequencies of CD8<sup>+</sup> CTL (&#x003c1;=&#x02212;0.16, ***p=0.00021), memory T-cells (&#x003c1;=&#x02212;0.13, **p=0.0029), follicular helper T-cells (&#x003c1;=&#x02212;0.098, *p=0.026), &#x003b3;&#x003b4; T-cells (&#x003c1;=&#x02212;0.28, ****p&#x0003c;0.0001), and M1-like macrophages (&#x003c1;=&#x02212;0.30, ****p&#x0003c;0.0001). The expression levels of <italic toggle="yes">SLC2A1</italic> were moderately positively correlated with the frequency of regulatory T-cells (Treg) (&#x003c1;=0.088, *p=0.046) (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>). Then, we separated the HPV<sup>&#x02212;</sup> and HPV<sup>+</sup> HNSCC and performed immune deconvolution. We found that the overall impact of high SLC2A1 expression in the tumor immune microenvironment is similar between HPV<sup>&#x02212;</sup> and HPV<sup>+</sup> HNSCC, with HPV<sup>&#x02212;</sup> tumors showing a more prominent correlation. We found that high levels of SLC2A1 were inversely correlated with CD8<sup>+</sup> CTL (&#x003c1;=&#x02212;0.13, **p=0.0091), &#x003b3;&#x003b4; T-cells (&#x003c1;=&#x02212;0.24, ****p&#x0003c;0.0001), and M1-like macrophages (&#x003c1;=&#x02212;0.31, ****p&#x0003c;0.0001) in HPV<sup>&#x02212;</sup> tumors (<xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S2A</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>SOX2-driven OED transformation remodels immune infiltrates in longitudinal human specimens.</title><p id="P12">To verify the TCGA analysis, we procured longitudinal specimens from patients with SOX2<sup>+</sup> OED that had progressed into invasive HNSCC after excision of the pre-cancerous lesion. In normal oral mucosa, SOX2 stains sporadic cells at the basal layer with notable spacing. In this group of specimens, SOX2 staining was noted above the basal epithelial layer in the OED specimens. Upon malignant transformation, SOX2 showed a diffuse and strong nuclear staining pattern (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). We performed multispectral immunofluorescence full-slide staining using a lymphoid cell panel and a myeloid cell panel. We selected 6&#x02013;13 fields of interest per slide based on the presence of dysplasia, tumors, or dense immune infiltrates. We examined the lymphoid cell markers, including CD8, CD4, GATA3, PD1, CXCR3, and TBET as well as myeloid cell markers CD33, CD68, CD11c, HLR-DR, and PD-L1 (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>).

Spectral unmixing and image analysis were performed using Akoya InForm software, which was employed to develop and train algorithms for tissue segmentation, cellular segmentation, and phenotyping of tissue slides, enabling the classification of cell phenotypes for all markers of interest. Tissue segmentation was achieved by distinguishing tumor from stroma using cytokeratin staining, as well as identifying other regions such as glass. For cell segmentation and phenotyping, the ROI image data was converted into objects by identifying single cells based on their nuclear stain (DAPI), cytoplasmic, and membrane markers. Annotated files were imported into Rstudio v4.2.1. Akoyas&#x02019; R package phenoptrReports, an open-source tool that enables the consolidation of cell segmentation files generated in inForm. These consolidated data files contained slide summaries, cell counts and percentages, cell densities, mean expressions, H-scores, and nearest neighbor results. These datasets were further interpreted by first collapsing the metric of interest across multiple ROIs by the sample ID and then conducted a two-sample Wilcoxon test for every marker of interest. Mean expression level was compared between clinical stage (oral epithelial dysplasia vs head and neck cancer) for each patient. The test results are significant if the p-value is smaller than 0.05.</p></sec><sec id="S15"><title>Gene expression qPCR and ELISA</title><p id="P28">RNA isolation for qPCR was achieved using the QIAshredder (79654, Qiagen) and RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (74134, Qiagen).

Through this cut, scissors were used to separate the skin and underlying muscle around the neck. The mandibular bone was separated by making a cut between the mandibular incisors using scissors. The mandibular incisors were pinned back to expose the entire oral cavity. A razor blade was used to separate the cheek skin from the buccal mucosal tissue. A cut along the maxillary teeth and the mandibular teeth was done to free the buccal mucosal tissue, which was then placed in 3 mL of incomplete RPMI media with L-glutamine. In a tissue culture hood, the tissue was macerated into small pieces using razor blades and then incubated with 5 mL of 0.25% Trypsin in a 37&#x000b0;C incubator for 5 minutes. To quench trypsinization of the tissue, 10 mL of complete RMPI (RPMI media with L-glutamine containing 20% heat-inactivated FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin). The RPMI media and the tissue were transferred into a 70 &#x003bc;m strainer and then mashed against the strainer using a syringe plunger. The flow through was collected and then centrifuged, where red blood cells were lysed using 5 mL of ACK lysis buffer for 5 minutes at room temperature. The lysis was stopped by adding 20 mL of sterile PBS buffer, and then the cell suspension was centrifuged. Cells were washed in sterile PBS and then seeded in a 96-U bottom plate at a density of approximately one million cells per well. The plate was centrifuged, and the pelletized cells were resuspended in 100 &#x003bc;L of Zombie Aqua viability dye (423101, BioLegend), at a 1:1000 dilution in sterile PBS, and incubated in the dark at room temperature for 30 minutes. Cells were washed in PBS once and then again in ice-cold FACS buffer (PBS with 2% FBS, 0.1% NaN<sub>3</sub>, and 1 mM of EDTA). To prevent non-specific binding, the cells were incubated with an Fc blocker (anti-CD16/32) (clone 93, BioLegend) for 10 minutes on ice and in the dark.

Buccal mucosal tissue from all groups was harvested at the same time, and a cell suspension was extracted as previously described. Immune cells were purified using FACS sorting for CD45<sup>+</sup> live cells. Considering the size of the buccal mucosa and the fact that one side of the mucosa was utilized to confirm OED/HNSCC diagnosis via histological evaluation, we pooled samples from 6&#x02013;8 mice per group to obtain a sufficient number of immune cells for single-cell analysis. The cells were submitted in 1X PBS with 0.08% BSA for 10X Genomics 3&#x02019;-single-cell processing and RNA-Seq at a depth of at least 50,000 reads per cell. To alleviate the dropout effect, we performed imputations using the R package SAVER. We then removed low-quality cells using the following metrics: the number of unique features is less than 200 or greater than 15,000 and the reads from mitochondria genes are greater than 25%. After filtering, we obtained a total of 8,603 high-quality cells, which were integrated using Seurat. To group cells into different clusters, we employed the Shared Nearest Neighbor method using the top 30 principal components (PCs) from the integrated data with a resolution value of 1. Clusters were annotated using the R package SingleR and manual review of the expression of immune marker genes and those that drove the clustering of cells. To estimate the cell development trajectory, we implemented the R package phateR with the following parameters: the number of k nearest neighbors was 5, the decay value was 40, and t was 10.</p></sec><sec id="S18"><title>Bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) isolation and differentiation</title><p id="P31">To investigate the impact of IL-1&#x003b1; priming on myeloid cell responsiveness to STING agonists, BMDMs were generated by harvesting bone marrow from the long bones of the hind limbs of male and female C57BL/6J mice aged 6&#x02013;8 weeks. Briefly, mice were euthanized and both femurs and tibiae were harvested using sterilized scissors and forceps before being placed in ice-cold PBS. In a biosafety cabinet, connective tissue and muscle were removed, and the marrow cavity was exposed by cutting off both ends of the bone. Bone marrow was flushed out using a prefilled syringe containing ice-cold sterile PBS and a 27 G &#x000bd; needle (305109, BD). The flow through was filtered through a 70-&#x003bc;m cell strainer to achieve a single-cell suspension. Cells were centrifuged and then 2 mL of ACK lysis buffer was added for two minutes at room temperature to lyse red blood cells. Sterile PBS was added to neutralize the ACK lysis buffer followed by centrifugation. The cell pellet was resuspended in 5 mL of BMDM differentiation media (RMPI-1640 with L-glutamine containing 20% heat inactivated FBS, 30% L-929 cell supernatant, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin).

The cells were cultured at 37&#x000b0;C in a humidified incubator with 5&#x02013;7% CO<sub>2</sub> for three days. On the third day, granulocytic and monocytic cells appeared as the main population by FACS analysis and were considered licensed-MDSCs, which require incubation with 100 U/mL IFN-&#x003b3; and 0.1 &#x003bc;g/mL LPS for 16 hours to become activated-MDSCs.</p></sec><sec id="S20"><title>MDSC T-cell Suppression Assay</title><p id="P33">To assess the impact of IL-1&#x003b1; priming on the suppressive function of MDSCs on CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell proliferation, MDSCs were cultured, following previously described methods, with CFSE-stained CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. The dilution of CFSE was then used to determine the level of proliferation. In brief, spleens were harvested from 6&#x02013;8 week-old male and female C57BL/6J mice and disrupted by pressing them against a 70 &#x003bc;m cell strainer. The resulting single-cell suspension was centrifuged and resuspended for further processing using the EasySep Mouse CD8+ T Cell Isolation Kit. The enriched cell suspension was then thoroughly resuspended in 1 mL of RPMI-1640 with L-glutamine and 10% heat-inactivated FBS, achieving a final cell concentration ranging from 0.5 &#x000d7; 10^6 to 10^7 cells/mL. To label the CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells with CFSE dye, the cell suspension was transferred to a fresh, non-wetted tube. To prevent premature mixing with the CFSE solution, the tube was laid horizontally while the CFSE dye was being prepared. One vial of CFSE dye (Invitrogen, C34554) was resuspended in 18 &#x003bc;L of DMSO. Next, 1.1 &#x003bc;L of the stock solution was added to a 110 &#x003bc;L droplet of PBS, which was then placed on the side of the tube.

The cells were washed in sterile PBS and subsequently cultured in a complete RMPI medium for four days without any additional IL-1&#x003b1; exposure. Following this incubation period, the cells were stimulated with a STING agonist, 10&#x003bc;g/mL of 2&#x02019;3&#x02019;-cGAMP (tlrl-nacga23-1, InvivoGen). The 2&#x02019;3&#x02019;-cGAMP was introduced into the culture medium for a duration of 30 minutes, along with human albumin as a carrier. The cells were then collected by centrifugation and then washed two times in sterile PBS before adding 150 &#x003bc;L of chilled lysis buffer which included the following: 50 mM triethanolamine, 4% SDS, 1&#x000d7; protease inhibitor cocktail (11836170001, Roche), 1500 U/mL benzonase (E1014, Sigma), and 5mM PMSF (P7626, Sigma). To inhibit the activity of the benzonase, 5 mM EDTA was added, and protein concentration was measured using a BCA protein assay (Cat. 23225, Thermo Scientific). Disulfide bonds were cleaved by treating samples with 200 mM TCEP for 30 minutes at room temperature. Then, exposed cysteine residues were capped by incubating the samples with 25 mM of NEM for 2 hours at room temperature. A methanol-chloroform-distilled water precipitation was repeated three times to isolate a protein pellet. The protein pellet was resuspended in TEA buffer supplemented with 4% SDS and 4 mM EDTA, then split into two aliquots to establish hydroxylamine (NH<sub>2</sub>OH) treatment conditions. One aliquot was treated with NH<sub>2</sub>OH and incubated for one hour at room temperature with constant rotation to facilitate the cleavage of thioester bonds between cysteine residues and fatty acids. The second aliquot, which did not receive NH2OH treatment, acted as the negative control and was incubated under identical conditions. To remove NH<sub>2</sub>OH, a methanol-chloroform precipitation step was performed on both the treated and control samples. The protein pellet was resuspended in TEA buffer containing 4% SDS and 4mM EDTA. The addition of a 5 kDa mass tag to the previously coupled cysteine residues was accomplished by incubating the protein solution with 1 mM mPEG-Mal for two hours at room temperature and under constant rotation. A final methanol-chloroform-distilled water precipitation was performed.

Cells were gated from single/Zombie Aqua&#x02212; live, CD45<sup>+</sup>, and then further gated on CD11B<sup>+</sup>CD206<sup>+</sup> Glut1<sup>+</sup> cells. Comparisons between the two groups were made using a two-tailed unpaired t-test (*p&#x0003c;0.05). (F) Buccal mucosal tissue from <italic toggle="yes">K5CreSox2</italic><sup>+/+</sup><italic toggle="yes">;IL1r1</italic><sup>+/+</sup> (n=5) and <italic toggle="yes">K5CreSox2</italic>+/+<italic toggle="yes">;IL1r1</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212; (n=5) were harvested and subjected to bulk RNA sequencing. A bar graph of top pathways altered between groups is shown.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="nihpp-2024.12.06.626475v1-f0007" position="float"/></fig></floats-group></article>
