It is the most common type of autoimmune encephalitis, and it is marked by behavioral abnormalities, psychosis, memory impairment, seizures, mobility difficulties, autonomic dysfunction, and even coma (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Immunotherapy is an effective treatment for this condition. However, relapse still occurs in ~20&#x02013;25% of patients (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Finding anti-NMDAR antibodies of the immunoglobin G class in the serum or/and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is necessary for a conclusive diagnosis. Considerable efforts have been made since its discovery in 2007 to explore the pathogenesis and develop biomarkers to better understand the immunological processes. Previous studies have suggested that tumors (mainly ovarian teratomas) or herpes infections may be potential triggering factors in anti NMDAR encephalitis, and pathogenic antibody mediated immune inflammatory responses may be involved in the progression of the disease. However, understanding of the etiology and pathogenesis of anti-NMDAR encephalitis is still limited (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Therefore, continued research of its pathogenesis is critical to understanding the disease causation and prognosis.</p><p>Transcriptomics is the study of transcripts of specific cells, tissues, and organs at specific growth and developmental stages or under certain physiological conditions (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). RNA is transcribed by all tissues or organ cells in the body, including protein-coding messenger RNA (mRNA) and non-coding RNA (ribosomal RNA, transfer RNA, and long noncoding RNA). Transcriptomics is significant for understanding the mechanisms of gene expression and disease development (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). The use of next-generation sequencing-based RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) technology in studies on the causes of disease and biomarkers has increased recently (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). The host genes of dysregulated circular RNAs (circRNAs) are mostly involved in receptor internalization, according to research on the circRNA profiles of juvenile patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Moreover, Liu et al. (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) investigated the clinical use of serum exosomal microRNAs for differentiating between viral encephalitis (VE) and anti-NMDAR encephalitis. They discovered that serum C3 in conjunction with serum exosomal miR-140-5p may be a useful diagnostic tool for distinguishing between VE and anti-NMDAR encephalitis. All of the preceding studies imply that the transcriptome is important in the pathogenesis of anti-NMDAR encephalitis; nevertheless, research on the pathophysiology of this disease's transcriptome is limited.</p><p>Thus, the current work employed RNA-seq technology to explore the transcriptome-wide landscape of mRNAs to explore the transcriptional pathophysiology and possible treatment targets of the illness.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>2 Methods</title><sec><title>2.1 Study design</title><p>Included were nine patients diagnosed between January 2021 and June 2022 for anti-NMDAR encephalitis and nine age- and sex-matched control subjects from The First Affiliated Hospital of Shandong First Medical University and Qilu Hospital of Shandong University. The diagnosis of anti-NMDAR encephalitis was made using Graus et al.'s (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>) criteria. The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) at least one clinical symptom, such as seizures, mental disorders, impaired mobility, cognitive dysfunction, or a lower state of consciousness, (2) anti-NMDAR antibody positivity in serum and CSF and (3) excluded those with coexisting autoimmune diseases or infectious encephalitis. Controls were age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers with no history of autoimmune diseases or recent infections. The mean age of patients was 27.9 &#x000b1; 5.9 years vs. 30.7 &#x000b1; 6.3 years for controls (<italic>p</italic> = 0.347). Loss to follow-up or missing data were excluded criteria. Prior to immunotherapy, all blood samples were taken from patients who were still experiencing symptoms. The control group's members were registered at health screening centers. Before being used for additional testing, all blood samples were quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at 80&#x000b0;C. Six pairs of samples were used for transcriptome sequencing, and another three pairs of samples were used for the validation set. All participants received abdominal and pelvic ultrasonography and computed tomography screening, and no participant had a teratoma.</p><p>As directed by the manufacturer (Euroimmun, Germany), autoantibodies against NMDAR, LGI1, contactin-associated protein-like 2, GABAB receptor, AMPA1, and AMPA2 were assessed using indirect immunofluorescence in both serum and CSF.</p></sec><sec><title>2.2 Total RNA extraction, library preparation and transcriptome sequencing</title><p>Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were treated with the Qiagen RNeasy Plus Small Kit (Qiagen) in order to extract total RNA from them. Utilizing spectra produced at 260 and 280 nm optical densities using the NanoDrop 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), the quality and quantity of RNA were evaluated. Total RNA was used to prepare RNA samples at 2 g each sample. Following the manufacturer's instructions, sequencing libraries were created using the NEBNext<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Ultra<sup>TM</sup> II RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina. After qualifying, the libraries were pooled by effective concentration (higher than that of 2nM) and machine data need and sequenced using the Illumina NovaSeq 6000. Image data from a high-throughput sequencer was converted to sequence data using CASAVA base recognition. Pair-end clean reads were aligned to the reference genome index produced by Hisat2 (v2.0.5).</p></sec><sec><title>2.3 Functional correlation analysis</title><p>To identify differentially expressed genes, this work used the Limma R package (<ext-link xlink:href="http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/limma.html" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/limma.html</ext-link>); additionally, a volcano plot was produced to illustrate DEGs. DEGs with a <italic>p</italic>-value &#x0003c; 0.05 and |fold change (FC)| &#x0003e;1.2 were considered statistically significant. The Benjamini&#x02013;Hochberg (BH) method was used to correct the <italic>p</italic>-value, and the adjusted <italic>p</italic>-value (<italic>p</italic>. Adjust) is the <italic>p</italic>-value corrected by BH. To get immunity-related genes, the ImmPort database (<ext-link xlink:href="https://immport.niaid.nih.gov" ext-link-type="uri">https://immport.niaid.nih.gov</ext-link>) was used. The &#x0201c;clusterProfiler&#x0201d; software was used for gene ontology (GO) enrichment (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment investigations (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) for biological process and pathway enrichment analysis.</p><p>The GO enrichment comprises biological processes, cellular components and molecular functions. For each enriched items, <italic>p</italic> value, enrichment score, Fold and ratio were calculated. The <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 was set as the cutoff criterion for significant enrichment. Using the &#x0201c;single-sample gene set enrichment analysis&#x0201d; (ssGSEA) function from the &#x0201c;GSVA&#x0201d; R package (version 4.1.0) (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>), we calculated immune-related scores for every sample and examined the relationship between the scores to obtain a visual representation of the significantly enriched functional pathways' gene expression levels. The statistical results of <italic>p</italic>-value were multiply corrected with Benjamini &#x00026; Hochberg methods, and the adjusted <italic>p</italic> value of FDR (false discovery rate) was provided.</p></sec><sec><title>2.4 Diagnostic markers screening and verification</title><p>Random forest (RF) (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) and support vector machine-recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE<sup>)</sup> (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) were employed to identify novel and critical biomarkers of anti-NMDAR encephalitis. For this investigation, the RF algorithm was implemented using the R package &#x0201c;randomForest,&#x0201d; while the RFE function within the caret package, coupled with 5-fold cross-validation, facilitated the selection of highlighted genes. Furthermore, 5-fold cross-validation and the R package e1071 were utilized in the construction of the SVM classifier. We next chose overlapped genes from the two previously described classification models for further investigation. The researchers used receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) to look for new and important biomarkers of anti-NMDAR encephalitis. ROC curves (pROC software, version 1.17.0.1) were applied to analyze the biomarkers, and the predictive power of the algorithms was tested by calculating the area under the curve (AUC). A two-sided <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 was utilized to indicate statistical significance.</p></sec><sec><title>2.5 Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) analysis</title><p>On an ABI PRISM 7900 Sequence Detection System, RT-qPCR was performed using Green Premix Ex Taq II (TaKaRa Bio) (Applied Biosystems). Forty cycles of 15 s at 95&#x000b0;C and 1 min at 60&#x000b0;C were conducted for the PCR. Furthermore, the 2<sup>&#x02212;&#x00394;&#x00394;Ct</sup> method was employed to calculate the data, with GAPDH acting as an endogenous control. The primers utilized in this work are listed in <xref rid="SM3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 1</xref>.</p></sec><sec><title>2.6 Assessment and correlation analysis of immune cells associated with infiltration</title><p>The CIBERSORT algorithm (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), a deconvolution algorithm that uses standard gene expression values (a signature with 547 genes) as a minimal representation for each cell type to calculate cell type proportions alongside mixed cell types using support vector regression, quantified the proportions of 22 immune cell types in samples. Cell types with <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 were deemed significant. Additionally, &#x0201c;ggplot2&#x0201d; was used for immune cell infiltration matrix PCA cluster analysis. A correlation heatmap was created using &#x0201c;corrplot&#x0201d; software to show the relationship between 22 kinds of immune cell subsets. The &#x0201c;ggstatsplot&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;ggplot2&#x0201d; packages were used to examine the Spearman correlation between diagnostic indicators and immune/inflammatory cells and display the results.</p></sec><sec><title>2.7 Statistical analysis</title><p>Software such as SPSS v.26.0 or GraphPad Prism 8.0 were used for statistical analysis. The mean &#x000b1; standard deviation (SD) represents the continuous variable data. The Fisher's exact test was used to evaluate the differences between the experimental groups. However, Spearman's correlation coefficients were used to assess between-variable correlations. Additionally, the Wilcoxon signed rank test was employed to examine the variation in immune cell ratings between various groups. At <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05, statistical significance was determined (two-sided).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>3 Result</title><sec><title>3.1 Identification of DEGs between anti-NMDAR encephalitis patients and controls</title><p>The DEGs between anti-NMDAR encephalitis individuals and controls were determined.

Therefore, we focused on immune-related DEGs to explore the potential pathogenesis of anti-NMDAR encephalitis. By overlapping the 1231 immune-related genes (IRGs) obtained from the ImmPort database, we obtained a total of 78 overlapping IRGs in the DEGs (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>), including but not limited to <italic>IL2RB</italic>, high mobility group box 1 (<italic>HMGB1</italic>), <italic>MMP9</italic>, S100 calcium binding protein A6, colony stimulating factor 3 receptor (<italic>CSF3R</italic>), interleukin 17A receptor, and tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily 1A (<xref rid="SM5" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>3.2 Functional enrichment analyses</title><p>We annotated the functions of the DEGs to further analyze their significance in anti-NMDAR encephalitis pathogenesis.

Anti-NMDAR encephalitis' pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment have been studied recently. Anti-NMDAR encephalitis accompanied by autonomic dysfunction and related complications may affect long-term prognosis. EEG is gradually becoming more useful for predicting the long-term prognosis of patients (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Nevertheless, the research on biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of anti-NMDAR encephalitis needs further exploration. Identifying this disease before auto-antibody detection results confirmed remains a challenge (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). We hypothesized in this study that immunoinflammation may be involved in the pathophysiology of anti-NMDAR encephalitis. Moreover, we identified two novel biomarkers candidates (<italic>INSL3</italic> and <italic>TPT1</italic>) that separated anti-NMDAR encephalitis patients from healthy controls.</p><p>Autoimmune encephalitis is most likely induced by antibodies attaching to neuronal surfaces; yet, the functions of additional immune effector pathways are mainly unknown (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Potential causes (such as tumors or infections) have been hypothesized as predictors of abnormal immune activation in anti-NMDAR encephalitis (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Autopsies of anti-NMDAR encephalitis patients demonstrated inflammatory cell infiltration into the brain's perivascular, interstitial, and Virchow-Robin areas (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). These findings showed that anti-NMDAR encephalitis is partly caused by immune system inflammation. Nevertheless, it is uncertain which specific immune effector pathways lead to anti-NMDAR encephalitis. Our findings reveal that DEGs are enriched in a variety of immunoregulatory processes, including leukocyte activation implicated in immunological response, Th17 cell differentiation, and Th1 and Th2 cell differentiation. Immunological cell infiltration also suggested that the immune landscapes of anti-NMDAR encephalitis differed from that of control participants. These results broaden the body of data supporting the hypothesis that anti-NMDAR encephalitis is partly caused by immune system inflammation.</p><p>Specifically, functional enrichment analysis revealed that DEGs were more likely to be involved in biological processes that involve neutrophils, including immune response activation, degranulation, and activation. Previous research (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>) indicates that immune system abnormalities mediated by B lymphocytes play a significant role in the pathogenesis of anti-NMDAR encephalitis. A large number of B cells and CD138+antibody secreting cells were observed infiltrating the brain tissue of patients with anti NMDAR encephalitis during autopsy. Wagnon et al. (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) found in an animal model of anti NMDAR encephalitis B-cell response can lead to an autoimmune reaction against NMDAR that drives encephalitis-like behavioral impairments. However, the involvement of neutrophils in this disease has not been thoroughly investigated. As the initial line of defense against pathogen invasion, neutrophils play a crucial role in the immune response (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Moreover, they have been found to be involved in a number of diseases of the neurological system, such as encephalitis (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>), Alzheimer's disease (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>), and venous sinus thrombosis (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Our new research (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>) indicates that neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) can be produced by peripheral blood neutrophils from patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis, suggesting a potential function for NETs in this pathological process. In this study, referring to 69 NET-related genes from previous studies (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>), we screened 15 NET-related genes among 899 DEGs, such as <italic>HMGB1, MMP9</italic>, and <italic>PADI4</italic> (data not shown). Functional enrichment analysis showed that inflammation related pathways such as neutrophil activation and leukocyte migration were significantly activated, suggesting that NETs may participate in disease progression through key genes such as HMGB1 and MMP9. This discovery provides a new research direction for the immunopathological mechanism of anti NMDAR encephalitis. This will offer insights into how neutrophils function in the immune system's control of the illness. To precisely grasp the underlying mechanism of action, additional study is necessary.</p><p>In order to better understand the immune systems that control the course of the illness and to establish predictors of long-term outcomes, considerable efforts have recently been made to find biomarkers. Most of these biomarkers, meanwhile, are still in the investigation phase. More research is needed to find and validate new biomarkers for clinical decision-making. In the present study, we also identified two potential biomarkers (<italic>INSL3</italic> and <italic>TPT1</italic>) candidates that distinguish anti-NMDAR encephalitis patients from controls. <italic>INSL3</italic> is a member of the relaxin family (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Previous research has suggested that it has an important function in cancers and reproductive system illnesses (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). However, research on its role in neuroimmune regulation is limited, and no research has suggested that it plays a role in anti-NMDAR encephalitis. Intriguingly, our finding of elevated INSL3 in anti-NMDAR encephalitis, indicating a role of INSL3 in the regulation of neuroinflammation. In addition, it also suggests potential cross-talk between reproductive hormones and neuroinflammation, which may provide clues for exploring its role in anti-NMDAR encephalitis. <italic>TPT1</italic> is the gene that encodes the translationally controlled tumor protein (TCTP) (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Many biological processes, including cell proliferation and differentiation, immunological control, and tumor development, have been demonstrated to require TCTP (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). A study suggested that diminution of <italic>TPT1</italic> up-regulates miR-200a to improve neurobehavior and oxidative stress injury in cerebral palsy rats (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). Another study showed that <italic>TPT1</italic> increased after spinal cord injury, and <italic>TPT1</italic> might play a crucial role in astrocyte proliferation and migration. regulation of apoptotic process, regulation of intracellular signal transduction (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). Our study's enrichment analysis results indicate that TPT1 primarily functions in biological processes, including internal signal transmission and apoptotic process control. We are now investigating the pathophysiology of anti-NMDAR encephalitis, which might offer new insights into the origins and course of the illness. Future studies should incorporate longitudinal sampling across distinct disease phases (acute, remission, and relapse) to determine whether INSL3 and TPT1 exhibit stage-specific expression patterns. Additionally, integrating single-cell sequencing to resolve time-dependent immune cell subset dynamics could elucidate the regulatory mechanisms underlying biomarker fluctuations.</p><p>This work characterized the immune cell infiltration features and the transcriptome-wide landscapes of mRNAs in anti-NMDAR encephalitis. However, it has certain limitations. This disease is uncommon, and the study's tiny sample size represents a constraint. Due to the limited sample size, this study may be subject to selection biases, including but not limited to age, gender, and geographical heterogeneity. Future multicenter studies with larger cohorts are warranted to evaluate the influence of age stratification, disease progression stages, and therapeutic regimens on biomarker expression profiles. As for the diagnostic performance shown with ROC curve, one should notice that the validation samples are from the same datasets. Considering that anti-NMDAR encephalitis shows high heterogeneities in clinical manifestations, the diagnostic performance of biomarkers screened in this study should be tested with more samples. Therefore, we will collect anti-NMDAR encephalitis samples, and test the diagnostic performance of potential biomarkers in the future. In addition, further verification using cellular and animal experiments may provide more evidence to clarify the functions of these two key genes in anti-NMDAR encephalitis.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>5 Conclusion</title><p>This study systematically elucidates the molecular characteristics and potential regulatory mechanisms of the peripheral immune microenvironment in anti-NMDAR encephalitis by integrating transcriptomic sequencing and immunoinformatic analyses.
