Subsequently, these factors are released into the renal interstitium where induces the transformation of fibroblasts to active fibroblasts (myofibroblasts).(<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">Lovisa et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">Sheng and Zhuang, 2020</xref>) Several signaling pathways such as transforming growth factor-b/Smad3 (TGF-b/Smad3), signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and some transcription factors such as Snail and Twist, have been identified to participate in the process of pEMT in the injured kidney.(<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">Lovisa et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">Pang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">Sheng and Zhuang, 2020</xref>) Recently, a number of post-translational modifications, including protein acetylation, have also been recognized to contribute to this process.</p><p id="P9">Protein acetylation is one of the post-translational modifications that occurs in both histone and non-histone proteins.(<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">Shen and Zhuang, 2022</xref>) Histone acetylation often occurs at positively charged lysine residues which weakens the DNA-histone interactions, thus opening the chromatin and facilitating transcription(<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">Shen and Zhuang, 2022</xref>). For example, acetylation of lysine 9 on histone 3 (H3K9ac) correlates with transcription activation.(<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">Nozaki and Kanai, 2021</xref>) Acetylation also involves in regulation of many non-histone proteins, including transcription factors, transcriptional coactivators and nuclear receptors(<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">Shvedunova and Akhtar, 2022</xref>). Acetylation is positively regulated by histone acetyltransferases and negatively by histone deacetylates.(<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">Shen and Zhuang, 2022</xref>; <xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2022</xref>) As such, either activation of histone acetyltransferases or inactivation of histone deacetylates is able to promote protein acetylation.(<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">Shen and Zhuang, 2022</xref>) To date, numerous histone acetyltransferases and histone deacetylates have been identified.

Smad3 is a key downstream factor of TGF-&#x003b2;1, and STAT3 acts downstream of many membrane receptors associated with renal fibrosis, including TGF-b receptors.(<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">Yuan et al., 2022</xref>) Immunoblot analysis showed increased expression levels of p-Smad3 and p-STAT3 in the kidney with UUO injury, which was abolished by administration of FT895.

In this study, we found that HDAC11 was expressed in renal epithelial cells but not in interstitial fibroblasts. Both pharmacological and genetic inhibition of HDAC11 attenuated the development of renal fibrosis and pEMT following UUO injury. Furthermore, HDAC11 inhibition reduced the arrest of renal epithelial cells at the G2/M phase and suppressed the activation of several signaling pathways associated with pEMT induction and proinflammatory factor production. These findings suggest that HDAC11 may contribute to renal fibrosis by facilitating the development of a profibrotic phenotype in renal tubular cells.</p><p id="P30">The process of pEMT involves renal tubular cells losing epithelial characteristics and acquiring a mesenchymal phenotype, marked by the re-expression of proteins typically found in embryonic kidneys (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">Grande et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">Lovisa et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">Sheng and Zhuang, 2020</xref>).

However, renal epithelial cells undergoing pEMT are often arrested at the G2/M phase of the cell cycle, leading to a profibrotic phenotype that produces significant amounts of profibrotic and proinflammatory factors (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">Grande et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">Lovisa et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">Sheng and Zhuang, 2020</xref>). These factors promote fibroblast conversion into myofibroblasts and trigger proinflammatory responses in the tubulointerstitium (<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">Sheng and Zhuang, 2020</xref>). Supporting this concept, our data indicated that inhibiting HDAC11 with FT895 or genetically deleting HDAC11 reduced fibronectin and collagen I expression while restoring E-cadherin levels in kidneys after fibrotic injury. Additionally, these treatments decreased the number of renal tubular cells expressing acetyl-histone H3pser10. Furthermore, HDAC11 inhibition suppressed UUO-induced upregulation of &#x003b1;-SMA, a marker for myofibroblasts (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">Humphreys et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">Sheng and Zhuang, 2020</xref>). Since HDAC11 is not expressed in renal fibroblasts and complete EMT with &#x003b1;-SMA expression does not occur based on gene tracing observations (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">Humphreys et al., 2010</xref>), our findings suggest that HDAC11 inhibition reduces myofibroblast activation due to its regulatory role on pEMT during kidney injury.</p><p id="P31">HDAC11 may contribute to pEMT by upregulating the transcription factors Snail and Twist. Previous studies have shown that E-cadherin is a fibrosis suppressor protein, and the loss of its expression in association with the epithelial mesenchymal transition occurs during renal fibrosis.(<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">Grande et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">Lovisa et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">Sheng and Zhuang, 2020</xref>) Since Snail and Twist are two transcription factors that mediates pEMT via suppression of E-cadherin expression,(<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">Kalluri and Weinberg, 2009</xref>) HDAC11 may recruit a repressor complex to the E-cadherin promoter, where it deacetylates histone H3 and H4 to create a repressive chromatin environment for Snail and Twist to exert their functional roles. In support of this hypothesis, it has been reported that treatment with a pan-histone deacetylase inhibitor Trichostatin A effectively abolishes the repressive effect of Snail, leading to increased dimethylation of histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9me2), a mark associated with transcriptional repression at the E-cadherin promoter region in epithelial cells.(<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">Peinado et al., 2004</xref>) Here, we also observed that inhibition of HDAC11 with FT895 was accompanied by increased expression of H3K9me2 in RPTCs undergoing TGF-b1-induced EMT, suggesting a similar mechanism may be at play. Further investigation is required to determine whether the repressor complexes containing HDAC11 activity are involved in the transcriptional processes related to EMT.</p><p id="P32">Smad3 and STAT3 may also play a role in mediating HDAC11-induced EMT of renal epithelial cells. Previous studies have shown that the activation of two intracellular signaling pathways promotes renal tubular EMT and renal fibrosis.(<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">Pang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2022</xref>) In the current study, we observed that inhibition of HDAC11 diminished the phosphorylation (activation) of both Smad3 and STAT3 in the kidney with UUO injury and cultured renal epithelial cells with TGF-b1 stimulation, indicating the importance of HDCA11 in regulating their phosphorylation. Presently, it remains unclear how HDAC11-mediated deacetylation regulates the phosphorylation of these two signaling molecules. As Smad7 t is an inhibitor of Smad3, it is possible that HDAC11 may induce activation of Smad3 via suppression of Smad7. In this regard, it has been reported that HDAC5 can prevent the transcriptional activity of myocyte enhancer factor 2A to repress the transcription of Smad7, leading to the activation of Smad3. (<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">Xiang et al., 2024</xref>) Our recent studies also showed that blocking class IIa HDACs with MC1568 increased expression of Smad7.(<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">Xiong et al., 2019</xref>) Unlike Smad3, STAT3 can be directly acetylated by p300 and deacetylated by class I HDAC members, and the acetylation status of STAT3 can change its phosphorylation levels.(<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">Ray et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">Zhuang, 2013</xref>) For example, HDAC3-mediated deacetylation actyl-STAT3 is essential for STAT3(Y705) phosphorylation.(<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">Lu et al., 2018</xref>) On this basis, we speculate that HDAC11 may also act as a molecular switch in the STAT3 signaling cascade that transmits HDAC11 activation to the development of EMT and renal fibrosis.</p><p id="P33">Moreover, HDAC11 may accelerate renal fibrosis by inducing renal inflammation. This is evident by our findings that (1) inhibition of HDAC11 blocked NF-kB phosphorylation, a post-translational modification that enhances transcriptional activity, and (2) reduced the expression of multiple proinflammatory cytokines (such as TNF-a, IL-1b<sup>,</sup> and IL-6) driven by NF-kB(<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">Jimi et al., 2019</xref>) and infiltration of macrophages. So far, although there are no reports on how HDAC11 regulates NF-kB phosphorylation, depletion of HDAC6 has been shown to up-regulate inhibitor of &#x003ba;B (I&#x003ba;B), which prevents the nuclear translocation of NF-&#x003ba;B subunits and down-regulates NF-&#x003ba;B reporter activation.(<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">Barter et al., 2022</xref>) In addition to its effect on NF-kB, HDAC11 may also mediate the expression of proinflammatory responses through suppression of IL-10. It has been reported that HDAC11 negatively regulated the expression of this cytokine in mouse and human in macrophages by interacting with the distal segment of the promoter region encoding IL-10.(<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">Villagra et al., 2009</xref>) Since IL-10 is a cytokine with potent anti-inflammatory properties and administration of IL-10 suppresses chemokines, inflammation, and fibrosis in a model of chronic renal disease,(<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">Mu et al., 2005</xref>) increased expression of IL-10 by HDAC11 inhibition may confer an anti-fibrotic effect via suppressing renal inflammation in the kidney following injury. Supporting this speculation, we observed that pharmacological inhibition of HDAC11 increased expression of IL-10 in UUO injured kidneys.</p><p id="P34">Finally, suppression of renoprotective molecules may constitute another mechanism by which HDAC11 promotes pEMT and renal fibrosis. In this context, some molecules, such as Klotho, BMP-7, and kruppel-like factor 15 (KLF15), have been shown to protect against renal fibrosis in the kidney following chronic injury.(<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">Castillo, 2023</xref>; <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2019</xref>) Among them, KLF15 is a transcription factor that suppresses renal fibrosis by inhibiting multiple signaling pathways such as the Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin and TGF-b1/Smad3.(<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">Gu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">Lu et al., 2019</xref>) Recently, Mao et al. demonstrated that KLF15 was down-regulated in UUO kidneys, and HDAC11 knockdown or inhibition largely normalized KLF15 expression in tubular epithelial cells or in the injured kidneys.(<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">Lu et al., 2019</xref>) This suggests that HDAC11 inhibition-mediated restoration of KLF15 may be required for protecting the kidney against development of EMT and fibrosis.
