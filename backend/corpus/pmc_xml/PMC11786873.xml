Therefore, protein-cargo delivery approaches, including cell-penetrating peptides and cytosol-penetrating antibodies, are being explored to overcome this limitation. In this context, we have developed a modular approach for cytosolic penetration of tumor cells based on bispecific antibodies containing a masked cytosol-penetrating Fab on one arm and a tumor-targeting scFv linked via an endosomal cleavable linker on the other arm. The relevance of the antigen-specific binding, internalization, and cytosolic cargo delivery was demonstrated in several <italic>in&#x000a0;vitro</italic> assays using different cell lines with anti-B7-H3 scFv, the well-characterized trastuzumab (HER2), and inotuzumab (CD22) as examples.

Tumor microenvironment-dependent as well as tumor-associated antigen-specific cytosol-penetrating antibodies of the type developed here have the potential to serve as a modular platform to deliver macromolecular cargoes for addressing intracellular targets in tumor cells.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical" id="abs0015"><title>Graphical abstract</title><fig id="undfig1" position="anchor"><graphic xlink:href="fx1"/></fig></abstract><abstract abstract-type="teaser" id="abs0020"><p>Harald Kolmar and colleagues report a novel and modular approach for conditionally activatable and TAA-specific internalization and cytosolic protein cargo delivery.

To date, few approaches have been established to enable tumor cell targeting in combination with cytosol penetration and cargo delivery. The implementation of these approaches requires several critical features, such as (1) implementation of a tumor cell-selective binding module, (2) conditional accessibility of the heparan sulfate proteoglycan to prevent non-specific HSPG-dependent internalization, and (3) release of the antibody or the cargo from any membrane-bound target molecules in the endosome to allow endosomal escape and release into the cytosol (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>C).</p><p id="p0030">In this study, we developed a modular approach to generate TAA-specific, cytosol-penetrating antibodies based on the masked S4-CPAb, with the objective of combining high binding affinity, efficient internalization, and endosomal escape. We envisioned a bispecific antibody with one arm responsible for tumor cell binding, while the other arm mediates cytosolic localization and cargo delivery (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>B). To this end, we generated various bispecific antibodies, wherein one arm contained the masked S4-CPAb Fab and the other arm a TAA-binding single-chain variable fragment (scFv) targeting HER2, CD22, and B7-H3, respectively. Endosomal proteolytic cleavage by furin enabled release from the membrane-bond receptor and eventually translocation of the truncated antibody together with its cargo into the cytosol. Two orthogonal assays confirmed both, the tumor cell-specific cell permeability of the constructs and their ability to deliver protein cargo. In addition, the relevance of the receptor-mediated internalization rate induced by antigen binding and the requirement for proteolytic release of the endosomal escape module from the target receptor was investigated.</p><p id="p0035">We demonstrate a modular approach for the generation of multifunctional antibodies with tumor-associated antigen-specific internalization via antibody fragments, combined with conditionally activatable (TME-depended) cytosol penetration, resulting in cytosolic cargo localization dependent on both tumor cell-specific binding and TME cleavage.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>Design of bispecific tumor cell-targeting cytosol-penetrating antibodies</title><p id="p0040">Building upon the previously published bivalent CPAb, which contains the masking unit S4 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>A<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref>) we have designed bispecific antibodies with an additional tumor-targeting domain.

To ascertain the impact of the HSPG-binding domain of the CPAb Fab on cell-specific binding, S4xTrastuzumab was unmasked via MMP-9 cleavage and tested on HeLa and SKBR-3 cells. In comparison to the masked constructs, a slight decrease in the maximum mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) and improved apparent K<sub>D</sub> (17&#x000a0;nM) was observed with SKBR-3 cells upon mask release. Conversely, an unmasked isotype control (CPAbx&#x003b1;B7-H3) only showed slight binding at the highest concentration on SKBR-3 cells.

Subsequent binding assays were conducted with the previously published bivalent CPAb and the masked S4-CPAb on the HSPG-positive HeLa and SKBR-3 cells and the HSPG-negative Ramos cells, which demonstrated the tumor cell non-specific binding of the bivalent constructs in comparison with the bispecifics (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure&#x000a0;S1</xref>C).<fig id="fig3"><label>Figure&#x000a0;3</label><caption><p>On-cell binding assay of the bispecific using SKBR-3, HeLa and Ramos cells</p><p>The cells were treated with concentrations of the compound ranging from 0.002&#x000a0;nM to 2000&#x000a0;nM.

The results of the binding assay of the bispecific constructs on SKBR-3 cells demonstrated, as anticipated, that the B cell receptor-targeting S4xInotuzumab exhibited no binding on the breast cancer cell line, while S4x&#x003b1;B7-H3 led only to a slight increase in MFI at the highest concentration (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref>B). This may be attributed to the general wide distribution of the target on different tumor cell lines. No on-cell-binding was observed for S4xInotuzumab on CD22-negative and HER2 low-expressing HeLa cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref>C). Furthermore, nonsignificant binding was detected for S4xTrastuzumab on HeLa cells, which are known to be HER2 low and B7-H3 high, while an effective concentration of 25&#x000a0;nM could be determined for S4x&#x003b1;B7-H3.

The bivalent CPAb served as the positive control, while the mutated variant, which lacks the HSPG-binding motif CPAb (118S-121S), served as the negative control. To investigate the internalization capabilities, the antibodies were coupled with a pH-sensitive fluorescent dye, which emits a minimal fluorescence signal at neutral pH values and an increased signal at acidic pH values (endosomes, lysosomes).<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr"><sup>36</sup></xref> The antibodies were incubated in a dilution series ranging from 0.2&#x000a0;nM to 500&#x000a0;nM for 24&#x000a0;h with the respective cell line. Efficient internalization of trastuzumab (half maximal effective concentration [EC<sub>50</sub>]: 1.9&#x000a0;nM) and native CPAb were confirmed on the HER2- and HSPG-positive SKBR-3 cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref>A). As anticipated, the non-binding negative control did not exhibit a notable increase in MFI. However, for the bispecific S4xTrastuzumab construct, a concentration-dependent increase in internalization was confirmed despite monovalency, resulting in an effective concentration of 28&#x000a0;nM, which is comparable to the K<sub>D</sub> of 38&#x000a0;nM. A comparison of the parent trastuzumab and S4xTrastuzumab indicates a 15-fold increase in the effective concentration and a reduction in the maximum MFI by 30%. In the comparative experiment on HeLa cells, neither the monovalent S4x&#x003b1;B7-H3 nor the native &#x003b1;B7-H3 antibody demonstrated a notable increase in MFI, and consequently internalization rate, in comparison to the negative control CPAb (118S-121S) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref>B). Internalization could only be detected in HeLa cells for the native CPAb, which served as a positive control, manifesting in a 20-fold and 10-fold increase in the area under the curve (AUC) compared with CPAb (118S-121S) and &#x003b1;B7-H3, respectively (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref>D). Finally, the TAA-associated internalization rates of CPAb, CPAb (118S-121S), and S4xInotuzumab were compared in the HSPG-negative Ramos cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref>C).<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr"><sup>37</sup></xref> No internalization was observed for CPAb and the mutated CPAb variant.
