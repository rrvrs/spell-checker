The paratesticular anatomy is defined as the structures surrounding the testis, including the epididymis, spermatic cord, and tunica vaginalis [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. These tumors arise in this region and may range from benign to locally invasive to metastatic. In this case report, a male patient presented with left-sided testicular pain and underwent a scrotal ultrasound, which revealed the presence of a possible paratesticular tumor. Upon surgical exploration and tissue examination, a myxoid spindle cell tumor with angiomyxoma features was noted.</p><p>Through this case report, we seek to add to the literature a better understanding of this specific form of rare paratesticular tumor.

A plan was set to move forward with surgical exploration to remove the supratesticular mass, as well as possible orchiectomy on the left side.&#x000a0;The scrotal ultrasound demonstrated the testicular mass to be 2.8 x 2.8 x 2.0 cm in dimension.&#x000a0;Figure <xref rid="FIG1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref> shows the sagittal mid-view of the left testicle.

The final result was a&#x000a0;myxoid spindle cell neoplasm, with features of angiomyxoma.</p><p>At a follow-up encounter with the patient, tissue type was disclosed, and no complications were reported.&#x000a0;A repeat scrotal ultrasound was ordered to be completed within three to six months of mass excision. Since the tissue was revealed to be presumptively benign, observation through ultrasound was determined to be the follow-up plan. This case was also reviewed with a Hematology-Oncology consultant.</p><p>However, four weeks post-procedure, the patient noted a possible new mass present below the initial incision from the scrotal surgery. An ultrasound was completed earlier than initially planned and revealed normal left and right testicles and epididymis. The test also revealed a complex cystic lesion present in the midline of the incision from the previous operation.

This space includes the epididymis, tunica vaginalis, and the spermatic cord [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. When assessing abnormalities within the testicle and paratesticular space, ultrasound is often used as the initial imaging modality; however, it may be nonspecific [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].&#x000a0;A majority of paratesticular tumors are benign, but about 30% are malignant, with sarcomas making up 90% of the malignant cases [<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. About 70% of paratesticular tumors are present in the spermatic cord, and the most common form of tumor is a benign lipoma. It is vital to consider the different possibilities when assessing a paratesticular lesion, including benign and malignant forms. Malignant entities are mostly sarcomas&#x000a0;since the spermatic cord is derived from the mesoderm, with rhabdomyosarcoma and liposarcoma being the most common [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Liposarcoma is more common in older adults (peak age of 56)&#x000a0;while rhabdomyosarcoma is more common in children (peak age of 5 years, and another peak at 16 years) [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Another important malignant entity to consider is lymphoma, which typically and primarily appears within and around the testicle, but it may also impact the epididymis and spermatic cord. Primary testicular lymphoma was vital to consider in the case of this patient, as he presented with an abnormal mass at the age of 53. Primary testicular cancer is more common in male patients in their early 30s, with an average age of 33 [<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However, after 50 years of age, cancer in the testicle region is more commonly due to secondary testicular cancer (primary testicular lymphoma) rather than primary testicular cancer [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Benign entities of paratesticular lesions to consider include hydroceles due to fluid accumulation within the tunica vaginalis, and inflammatory lesions such as epididymitis [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Inflammatory causes can differ depending on the age of the patient. For example, Chlamydia and Neisseria gonorrhoeae are more common causes of epididymitis in younger men, and Escherichia coli is the more common cause of epididymitis in older men [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Other causes of benign lesions in the paratesticular space include spermatic cord and epididymal cysts (presenting with serous fluid), lipoma (presenting with fat lobules), leiomyoma (presenting with smooth muscle), and hemangioma (different types including capillary, arteriovenous, and cavernous) [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Regarding this case and patient, when the initial ultrasound was completed, the possibility of the scrotal mass being an adenomatoid tumor was suggested. Adenomatoid tumors make up about 30% of paratesticular masses and are mesothelial tumors [<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Adenomatoid tumors are benign tumors of the genital tract, and more commonly occur in white males with an age range of 30-50 years [<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In males, these tumors are more likely to occur within the epididymis, prostate, spermatic cord, or ejaculatory duct. They appear on ultrasound as homogenous, hyper, or hypoechoic&#x000a0;and solid [<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Although the mass assessed on ultrasound was suspicious for an adenomatoid tumor, upon surgical excision and tissue exam results, it was determined that the mass was a myxoid spindle cell neoplasm with features of angiomyxoma.</p><p>Myxoid soft tissue tumors are uncommon, heterogeneous tumors composed of extracellular myxoid matrix. The matrix is made up largely of water, gelatinous glycosaminoglycans, and mucopolysaccharides [<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Myxoid tumors can be classified through features of MRI, with T1 showing a hypointense enhancing lesion, and T2 showing a bright enhancing lesion.&#x000a0;Myxoid soft tissue tumors can range in classification from benign to locally invasive to malignant. The benign classifications include but are not limited to intramuscular myxoma, angiomyxoma, myxolipoma, and fibromyxoma. Our patient presented with the pathological result of a myxoid spindle cell tumor with features of angiomyxoma, directing us to believe the mass is benign. The malignant classification of myxoid tumors includes&#x000a0;but is not limited to&#x000a0;liposarcoma, chondrosarcoma, and myxofibrosarcoma [<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The most common form of benign myxoid neoplasm is an intramuscular myxoma of the thigh. Myxoid neoplasms commonly affect the extremities over visceral organs [<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In this case, the patient presented with a myxoid mass characterized by the presence of spindle cells. Spindle cells refer to the shape of the tumor cells, being long and thin, with a cigar-shaped nucleus in the center [<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>The patient also presented with a feature of angiomyxoma. Angiomyxoma is further defined as a rare soft tissue mass (myxoma) with extensive blood vessels that grows slowly and does not spread [<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Angiomyxomas grow from myxoid cells found in connective tissue. Angiomyxomas can be further separated as superficial or aggressive. The superficial form is either on the skin or right below the surface. The superficial form may grow on the abdominopelvic, cervical, and extremity regions and are more common in older adults [<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The aggressive form of angiomyxoma grows deeper but is still unlikely to metastasize. The aggressive form grows more commonly in the perineum and pelvic region and is more common in women [<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In a study by Calonje et al., 39 cases of superficial angiomyxoma were assessed [<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In the study, the age range of patients was a median of 45.5 years, ranging from birth to 82 years. Most of the superficial angiomyxomas arose from the trunk, then the head/neck, and then the lower limbs. All 39 cases had excision of the mass as the primary treatment [<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Histologic features from cases included myxoid stroma, blood vessels, varied cellularity, and fibroblastic cells. Regarding aggressive angiomyxoma, Sutton et&#x000a0;al. noted that aggressive angiomyxomas are frequently initially misdiagnosed as lipomas, hernias, or cysts [<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The aggressive forms may be positive for estrogen and progesterone receptors. Surgical excision is the best form of treatment, but gonadotropic-releasing hormone agonist is another treatment of choice to consider [<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Based on our patient&#x02019;s histology report, the mass excised is better characterized as one with superficial angiomyxoma features.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This case depicts a 53-year-old male with a rare paratesticular tumor, further specified as a myxoid spindle cell neoplasm with angiomyxoma features. This case is unique because paratesticular tumors in general are very rare. This case was meant to reveal a greater level of understanding of this specific form of benign tumor and demonstrate an appropriate treatment plan. The main treatment for this patient was surgical resection.&#x000a0;The follow-up plan was to monitor the progression of the lesion post-removal of the mass with scrotal ultrasound. Imaging and follow-up with the patient at set months post-procedure are essential to detect possible recurrence or metastasis. In this case, we planned to reassess with a scrotal ultrasound within three to six months.&#x000a0;We would like to encourage more case reports with an emphasis on the timeline of paratesticular tumors regarding treatment/follow-up and possible recurrences. By increasing research in this area, we will be able to better determine the optimal form of treatment and create guidelines for these rare cases that arise.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group content-type="conflict"><title>Disclosures</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Human subjects:</bold> Consent for treatment and open access publication was obtained or waived by all participants in this study.</p><p><bold>Conflicts of interest:</bold> In compliance with the ICMJE uniform disclosure form, all authors declare the following:</p><p><bold>Payment/services info:</bold> All authors have declared that no financial support was received from any organization for the submitted work.</p><p><bold>Financial relationships:</bold> All authors have declared that they have no financial relationships at present or within the previous three years with any organizations that might have an interest in the submitted work.</p><p><bold>Other relationships:</bold> All authors have declared that there are no other relationships or activities that could appear to have influenced the submitted work.</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="other"><title>Author Contributions</title><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Concept and design:</bold>&#x000a0; Shani M.
