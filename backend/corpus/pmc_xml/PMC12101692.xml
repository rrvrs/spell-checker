Self-sampling for Human Papillomavirus (HPV) test for CC screening is increasingly used globally to accelerate wide coverage but some have reported barriers against its use. This scoping review explored published literature on the perception and attitude of women on the methods for collecting cervicovaginal samples for HPV testing for CC in SSA. This involves a review of electronic databases including Pubmed, Cochrane, Google Scholar, and African Journal Online. The review was limited to published English articles between 2013&#x02013;2023 using the Arksey and O&#x02019;Malley framework. Included studies were articles that used perception, attitude, perspective, or acceptability as primary or secondary outcome variables. Of the 137 articles, 131 articles were excluded due to duplicates and ineligibility. Six studies reported that women perceived self-sampling to provide better privacy and comfort, five studies reported that self-sampling was an easier procedure, five studies reported self-sampling was less painful, four reported that self-samples caused lesser embarrassment, three studies reported that women were willing to self-sample, and five studies reported it to be associated with better confidentiality than clinician sampling. Six studies reported that women perceived that the biological samples collected by the clinicians were more reliable compared to self-collected samples. Three studies showed that women preferred self-sampling in a private place in the hospital because they can seek reassurance from clinicians, and reduce the risk of financial burden associated with multiple visitations to the hospital. This shows that self-sampling is preferred relative to clinician-initiated collection of samples for HPV-based CC screening. It is important to emphasize increased sensitization on the reliability of self-sampling before asking the women to self-collect cervicovaginal samples.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source>

The latency period between the acquisition of high-risk HPV infections, its persistency, and the development of precancer and invasive cancer provides an opportunity for secondary prevention strategy including cytology and HPV-based testing [<xref rid="pgph.0004641.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Studies showed that the proportion of women who screen for CC is relatively low [<xref rid="pgph.0004641.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. For example, a study reported that only 3.5% of women aged 25&#x02013;65 years had ever screened for CC in the last three years [<xref rid="pgph.0004641.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Women in low-middle-income countries (LMICs) often face the challenges of poor access to screening services, lack of awareness and knowledge on cervical cancer (CC), screening, and sociocultural influences that prevent them from screening [<xref rid="pgph.0004641.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgph.0004641.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Some of the barriers associated with low CC screening using the clinician sample collection method include inadequately trained personnel, lack of functional referral and laboratory facilities, and lack of transport and follow-up systems [<xref rid="pgph.0004641.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pgph.0004641.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Other barriers include embarrassment/shyness, pain, and/or dislike associated with pelvic examination, and spousal disapproval [<xref rid="pgph.0004641.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends HPV testing and treatment for women at risk of developing CC as part of efforts to eliminate the disease globally [<xref rid="pgph.0004641.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Self-sampling (SS) of cervicovaginal samples presents a unique opportunity to mitigate the challenges of barriers associated with healthcare provider&#x02019;s collection of samples for HPV testing and cytological screening [<xref rid="pgph.0004641.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pgph.0004641.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. HPV testing presents women with the option of self-collection of cervicovaginal samples by removing the barriers associated with a third person&#x02019;s engagement to collect cytology samples.</p><p>Studies have demonstrated that the quality of biological samples collected and DNA extracted from SS are similar to those collected by healthcare providers (HCP) [<xref rid="pgph.0004641.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgph.0004641.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Despite the opportunities that SS presents, it is important to assess the perception of women within the African context as a preliminary step and its implication in integrating this method of sample collection for CC screening programs. The perception of women who had experienced SS in SSA is yet to be reviewed across different settings to fully understand their preferences and concerns. This scoping review explored published literature on perceptions and attitudes of women on the collection of cervicovaginal samples for HPV testing in SSA, and it also identified potential gaps with this method as a proxy for assessing the effectiveness of CC screening in SSA.</p><sec id="sec002"><title>Objective</title><p>The objective of this review is to explore published literature on the perception and attitude of women on the methods for collecting cervicovaginal samples for HPV testing for CC in SSA.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec003"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec004"><title>Protocol and registration</title><p>The protocol for this review has been published (<ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2024-085408" ext-link-type="uri">https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2024-085408)</ext-link> [<xref rid="pgph.0004641.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Eligibility criteria</title><p>The eligibility requirements were created using the PICO format (population, intervention, comparator, and outcome) (<xref rid="pgph.0004641.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).

Our results confirmed the paucity of research on the subject in SSA. All the six studies were hospital-based and they described perception and attitudes using the following themes: Privacy and comfortability; Willingness to SS; Pain; Anxiety; Embarrassment and Confidence [<xref rid="pgph.0004641.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pgph.0004641.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pgph.0004641.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pgph.0004641.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgph.0004641.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>Self-sampling method was generally reported to protect their privacy and provided a better comfort than HCP-initiated sampling of cervicovaginal samples [<xref rid="pgph.0004641.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pgph.0004641.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pgph.0004641.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgph.0004641.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Privacy protection and comfort are important drivers that motivate clients to consent for gynaecological procedures particularly when it involves exposure of genital areas [<xref rid="pgph.0004641.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pgph.0004641.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The presence of HCPs sometimes might create tension, anxiety, and feelings of intrusion when clients have not had any encounter or speak the same language with them [<xref rid="pgph.0004641.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pgph.0004641.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. It is also plausible that women could have mentioned privacy because of their feeling of being in control of themselves while collecting their samples. To mitigate this challenge, several strategies were employed including enforcement of using chaperons, counseling sessions before the procedure/examination, and use of audiovisual aids [<xref rid="pgph.0004641.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pgph.0004641.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].

Studies have shown that SS for HPV testing promises to increase screening rates because more women will be willing to self-sample compared to the HCP method [<xref rid="pgph.0004641.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgph.0004641.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. However, 23.1% of women in one of the studies were willing to undergo provider sampling [<xref rid="pgph.0004641.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. This could be a result of the confidence people/patients have in their HCPs [<xref rid="pgph.0004641.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p><p>Another important motivation for preferring SS is the perception by women that it is less painful than HCP-initiated sampling. Although none of the studies objectively assessed pain perception between SS and HCP-initiated sampling, the feeling of having lesser pain could be due to the general feeling of self-control during sample collection. It is also possible that the bleeding and pain experienced by participants could be suggestive that the screening instruction was not properly communicated to the study participants. Several other studies have reported similar findings regarding less pain during SS compared to more pain during provider sampling [<xref rid="pgph.0004641.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pgph.0004641.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="pgph.0004641.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="pgph.0004641.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. However, the bleeding experienced by WLWH could be attributed to the strong trust that exists between WLWH and their provider [<xref rid="pgph.0004641.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Hence, these women were nervous to self-collect samples. We recommend educational interventions tailored to providers to educate and encourage patients on the importance of SS options, especially providers working with WLWH.</p><p>Four studies reported that most of the participants believed that self-sampling made them feel less embarrassed compared to HCP sampling [<xref rid="pgph.0004641.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pgph.0004641.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgph.0004641.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].
