Standard treatments involve topical corticosteroids administered via mouthwashes, gels, or ointments, but these require frequent application, have limited retention, and may cause side effects. To address these limitations, this study aimed to develop an innovative dexamethasone delivery system targeting the oral cavity, based on poly(lactic acid) (PLA) fibers coated with chitosan (CS) and poly(lactic-<italic toggle="yes">co</italic>-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles. <bold>Methods:</bold> CS-coated PLA fibers were characterized for their mucoadhesive and cytocompatibility properties, while PLGA nanoparticles were analyzed for size, shape, encapsulation efficiency, cellular uptake, drug release efficiency, and cytocompatibility. <bold>Results:</bold> Both polymers demonstrated cytocompatibility, and chitosan-coated PLA fibers exhibited mucoadhesive properties.

Introduction</title><p>Oral potentially malignant disorders (OPMDs) are pathological conditions which may evolve into oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) [<xref rid="B1-pharmaceutics-17-00272" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Among OPMDs, oral lichen planus (OLP) shows a malignant transformation rate equal to 1.4&#x02013;2.28% [<xref rid="B2-pharmaceutics-17-00272" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-pharmaceutics-17-00272" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], even if this percentage is clearly underestimated due to restrictive diagnostic criteria and inadequate follow-up of patients [<xref rid="B2-pharmaceutics-17-00272" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. OLP is a chronic immunologically mediated mucocutaneous disease [<xref rid="B4-pharmaceutics-17-00272" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-pharmaceutics-17-00272" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], which may affect only the oral cavity. The main risk factors linked with malignant transformation include the atrophic&#x02013;erosive phenotype, tongue involvement, female gender, and advanced age, emphasizing the importance of regular oral cancer clinical&#x02013;histological screenings [<xref rid="B6-pharmaceutics-17-00272" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. It is evident that, despite the well-established risk of cancer development, there remains a significant gap in knowledge regarding the behavior, prognosis, and clinical characteristics of OSCC developing from OLP [<xref rid="B7-pharmaceutics-17-00272" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>The global pooled prevalence of OLP is about 1%, and it is more common in middle-aged people, with a prevalence that progressively increases [<xref rid="B5-pharmaceutics-17-00272" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and shows a preference for the female gender [<xref rid="B8-pharmaceutics-17-00272" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-pharmaceutics-17-00272" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Characteristic clinical features of OLP include symmetric, bilateral, or multiple distributions of looping white lines or striae that are usually located in the buccal, labial, and gingival mucosae; margins; and the back of the tongue. Two different groups of clinical patterns are recognized: erosive&#x02013;atrophic forms (including atrophic&#x02013;erosive and bullous forms) and non-erosive&#x02013;atrophic forms (including reticular, papular, and plaque-like forms) [<xref rid="B10-pharmaceutics-17-00272" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] (<xref rid="pharmaceutics-17-00272-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>The precise etiology of OLP is unknown but an important role seems to be played by cell-mediated immunity. According to this hypothesis, the first event of OLP could be keratinocyte antigen exposure causing a cytotoxic CD8<sup>+</sup> cell response [<xref rid="B11-pharmaceutics-17-00272" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Both CD4<sup>+</sup> helper cells and CD8<sup>+</sup> cytotoxic T cells are activated in OLP. Moreover, alterations in T lymphocyte autophagy, leading to the dysregulation of apoptosis in oral keratinocytes, have been reported in OLP patients [<xref rid="B12-pharmaceutics-17-00272" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Several OLP forms are asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic, requiring just periodic follow-up. On the other hand, atrophic&#x02013;erosive OLP can often cause symptoms, ranging from a mild burning sensation to severe pain, significantly compromising the patient&#x02019;s quality of life [<xref rid="B13-pharmaceutics-17-00272" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. This form often requires a pharmacological treatment, aimed at reducing local immune&#x02013;inflammatory reaction and thus the possible malignant transformation risk [<xref rid="B3-pharmaceutics-17-00272" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>The gold standard for OLP treatment is represented by the use of pharmaceutical formulations, based on topical corticosteroids, as well as calcineurin inhibitors (e.g., Tacrolimus and Cyclosporine [<xref rid="B14-pharmaceutics-17-00272" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]). The most-used corticosteroids are dexamethasone (DEX) and clobetasol propionate [<xref rid="B15-pharmaceutics-17-00272" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-pharmaceutics-17-00272" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], which exert an anti-inflammatory effect, reducing the number of immune cells and the production of cytokines at the inflammation site [<xref rid="B15-pharmaceutics-17-00272" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. However, the long-term use of topical corticosteroids may cause adverse effects. The systemic side effects include adrenal suppression, gastrointestinal upset, hypertension, and hyperglycemia, and the local ones embrace thinning of the oral mucosa, developing secondary candidiasis, and refractoriness [<xref rid="B17-pharmaceutics-17-00272" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-pharmaceutics-17-00272" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-pharmaceutics-17-00272" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. As of today, there are a few formulations specifically designed for the oral cavity, while most are derived from dermatological applications. This is because, despite the widespread use of the oral mucosa as a site for drug administration, it presents several challenges due to its specific anatomical and functional characteristics, such as constant movement (e.g., speaking and chewing), saliva secretion, and the swallowing reflex, which reduce the retention time of drug delivery systems. Additionally, the development of compounds tailored for oral mucosal delivery is limited by the lack of standardized in vivo and in vitro models capable of accurately predicting and quantifying drug effects and potential issues. This gap in predictive systems hinders the development and market availability of new formulations [<xref rid="B20-pharmaceutics-17-00272" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>To overcome these limitations, it is necessary to improve the adhesiveness of drug delivery systems to the oral mucosa, ensuring prolonged contact and increasing retention time within the oral cavity. These improvements would enhance drug bioavailability and optimize therapeutic outcomes, addressing current challenges in this field [<xref rid="B21-pharmaceutics-17-00272" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-pharmaceutics-17-00272" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-pharmaceutics-17-00272" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>For this reason, topical corticosteroids such as betamethasone valerate, clobetasol propionate, fluocinolone acetonide, fluocinonide, and triamcinolone acetonide have been incorporated into formulations of various adhesive pastes, which are characterized by good bioadhesive and delivery properties [<xref rid="B24-pharmaceutics-17-00272" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. However, thanks to the development of nanotechnologies, it is now possible to further improve the mucoadhesive properties and the duration of interaction with the mucosa by using selected drug delivery systems (DDSs), such as nanoparticles (NPs) and fibers (FBs) coated with mucoadhesive molecules (e.g., chitosan) [<xref rid="B25-pharmaceutics-17-00272" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-pharmaceutics-17-00272" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27-pharmaceutics-17-00272" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. For instance, innovative materials such as metal&#x02013;organic frameworks (MOFs) and graphene oxide-based nanoparticles have been explored for their potential in enhancing drug delivery, particularly in the context of oral cavity applications [<xref rid="B28-pharmaceutics-17-00272" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Recent advances in nanomaterials, including polythiophene-based systems, offer exciting possibilities for targeted therapy and improved biocompatibility in oral mucosal applications [<xref rid="B29-pharmaceutics-17-00272" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Nanofiber-based drug delivery systems, especially those incorporating core&#x02013;shell structures, have shown promise in controlled drug release, which could further enhance the effectiveness of treatments in the oral cavity [<xref rid="B30-pharmaceutics-17-00272" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Poly(lactic-<italic toggle="yes">co</italic>-glycolic acid) (PLGA) and poly(lactic acid) (PLA) are two of the most widely used and promising biopolymers for the development of drug delivery systems [<xref rid="B31-pharmaceutics-17-00272" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B32-pharmaceutics-17-00272" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Both PLGA and PLA are biodegradable, and their degradation products, lactic acid and glycolic acid, are metabolized in the body through pathways linked to the Krebs cycle [<xref rid="B33-pharmaceutics-17-00272" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Lactic acid is primarily converted back to pyruvate by the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase in muscles and other tissues. Pyruvate then enters the Krebs cycle to produce energy. Additionally, lactic acid can be transported to the liver, where it is converted into glucose via the Cori cycle, which is then reused by the body for energy. Glycolic acid, on the other hand, is oxidized to glycolate, which can be further converted to oxalate. Oxalate is excreted by the kidneys in the urine, although some glycolate can also be metabolized into compounds that enter the Krebs cycle for energy production. Consequently, the systemic toxicity of PLGA and PLA is negligible.</p><p>In this study, we aimed to address the challenges of drug delivery in the oral cavity by designing and developing an innovative drug delivery system tailored for oral lichen planus (OLP). The proposed system combines PLA fibers coated with chitosan and PLGA nanoparticles to enhance mucoadhesion and ensure prolonged drug retention in the oral cavity, respectively. To validate this system, we utilized a bioreactor simulating salivary flow and OLP biopsy-derived cells cultured on a PLA scaffold, recreating key aspects of the 3D structure of the oral mucosa. This approach seeks to bridge the gap between in vitro and in vivo models, providing a novel platform to improve therapeutic outcomes for OLP patients.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-pharmaceutics-17-00272"><title>2.

DEX Releasing Test and Quantification of Intracellular Concentration</title><p>Based on the cell proliferation results, the release test proceeded as follows: 25,000 HFs were seeded onto a 3D PLA scaffold in a multi-well plate and incubated for 96 h to promote cell growth and adhesion. After this incubation period, the scaffold was transferred to the LB2 chamber in the bioreactor, where a flow rate of 400 &#x003bc;L/min was maintained.

HPLC Analysis and Recovery Efficiency</title><p>Since the chromatographic methods used were developed by modifying existing methods in the literature [<xref rid="B38-pharmaceutics-17-00272" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], it was necessary to first determine the LOQ and LOD values of the modified method before conducting the experimental tests. Additionally, prior to evaluating the drug recovery efficiency, the calibration curve was generated (<xref rid="pharmaceutics-17-00272-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>), and the regression equation and r<sup>2</sup> value were determined.

PLA-FB, CS-PLA-FB, and PLGA-NP Characterization</title><p>Next, we analyzed the ultrastructure of the PLA-FBs. The morphology of PLA-FBs, uncoated and coated with CS, was observed using SEM (<xref rid="pharmaceutics-17-00272-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). No surface defects were revealed, and, in the case of fibers coated with CS, it was possible to observe a surface layer with small interruptions, ascribable to the chitosan deposition (<xref rid="pharmaceutics-17-00272-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>B). A histogram (<xref rid="pharmaceutics-17-00272-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>C) demonstrates that the PLA-FBs typically have an average diameter measure ranging between 0.2 and 1.2 &#x003bc;m. The successful CS deposition on PLA fibers was further demonstrated by FTIR/ATR measurements (<xref rid="pharmaceutics-17-00272-f007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). As evident from the comparison between the FTIR spectra of uncoated and CS-coated PLA fibers, in the case of coated ones, the co-presence of the PLA and chitosan typical vibrational modes was revealed, suggesting a physical adsorption.

These interactions strengthen the mucoadhesive properties of chitosan-coated systems, enabling prolonged contact with mucosal surfaces and improving drug delivery performance [<xref rid="B44-pharmaceutics-17-00272" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>].</p><p>The PAS assay results revealed a strong coloration in the CS-PLA-FBs incubated with mucin, with the intensity of the coloration increasing alongside higher mucin concentrations (<xref rid="pharmaceutics-17-00272-f012" ref-type="fig">Figure 12</xref>A,B).

Discussion</title><p>The oral cavity is a strategic site for drug administration, offering various advantages like bypassing the gastrointestinal tract and hepatic portal system, enhancing patient compliance, sustaining drug delivery, enabling rapid pharmacological action, and simplifying drug application and removal [<xref rid="B46-pharmaceutics-17-00272" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="B47-pharmaceutics-17-00272" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. However, the effectiveness of drug delivery in this region is significantly limited by the characteristics of the oral mucosa, which is protected by viscoelastic mucus layers.

Additional factors like salivary flow, swallowing, chewing, and phonation further reduce drug retention time and therapeutic efficacy [<xref rid="B49-pharmaceutics-17-00272" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. To counter these limitations, numerous drug delivery systems (DDSs) are being investigated to ensure prolonged and effective drug delivery to the mucosa [<xref rid="B20-pharmaceutics-17-00272" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B50-pharmaceutics-17-00272" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>].</p><p>The interaction time between a drug formulation and the oral mucosa can be enhanced using mucoadhesive materials, which is a focus of many research efforts aiming to improve the efficacy of various DDSs [<xref rid="B23-pharmaceutics-17-00272" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24-pharmaceutics-17-00272" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. However, despite significant research on oral mucosal drug delivery, only a few commercially available formulations are specifically designed for this route [<xref rid="B18-pharmaceutics-17-00272" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].

Patches, on the other hand, consist of multiple layers, including a waterproof backing, a drug reservoir, and a bioadhesive surface, while films are flexible and soft but require significant bioadhesive power. Although gels and ointments are easy to apply, they offer less precise drug dosing compared to other forms like tablets, patches, or films [<xref rid="B20-pharmaceutics-17-00272" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B54-pharmaceutics-17-00272" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Each delivery form has its own set of advantages and challenges that influence both efficacy and patient acceptance. However, recent advancements in nanotechnology are enabling the creation of carriers that can effectively address these challenges while minimizing the side effects associated with drugs.</p><p>In this study, a dual DDS was developed and characterized. It is composed of electrospun fibers made of PLA [<xref rid="B55-pharmaceutics-17-00272" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], coated with chitosan and enriched with PLGA-NPs loaded with DEX. Both the CS-PLA-FBs and PLGA-NPs were characterized using SEM. The acquired micrographs revealed that CS formed a homogeneous layer on the fibers, while the uncoated fibers exhibited a smooth surface with no imperfections. Additionally, the average fiber diameter was assessed.</p><p>The size of the PLGA-NPs was characterized using DLS and SEM.

The encapsulation efficiency was 50%, consistent with the literature, likely due to the lipophilic nature of the compound.</p><p>The drug release capability of nanoparticles was evaluated in ethanol, demonstrating that NPs release the drug with an initial burst of about 90% within the first hour, confirming the lack of strong bonds between the carriers and the drug.</p><p>Before assessing the drug release efficiency in cells, the cytocompatibility of the PLGA-NPs was first investigated. This was carried out using 3T3-Swiss fibroblasts and fibroblasts isolated from OLP patients (HFs) to ensure consistency in the results. Cytocompatibility assays were conducted with both empty and DEX-loaded PLGA-NPs, selecting a drug concentration of around 70 &#x000b5;g/mL. This concentration was selected because it mirrors therapeutic levels without showing toxicity effects. As expected, given the well-known biocompatibility of all the compounds used, no toxic effect was observed or, at most, a slight cytotoxicity of less than 30%.</p><p>At this point, the uptake of NPs and the release of DEX within cells were investigated. Specifically, to quantify the amount of drug released into the cytoplasm, an HPLC method was developed with a mobile phase consisting of water and CH<sub>3</sub>CN under isocratic conditions. The method was defined in terms of LOD (limit of detection) and LOQ (limit of quantification), which were, respectively, 0.3 &#x000b5;g/mL and 0.92 &#x000b5;g/mL. The recovery efficiency from the cell lysate was also evaluated, showing almost 100%.</p><p>Moreover, comparing the intracellular concentration of DEX, both when administered inside PLGA-NPs or as free DEX, it was possible to evidence that NPs are able to release an amount of drug inside the cells comparable to the amount of non-encapsulated DEX that enters by diffusion. However, it is important to note that, at the 4 h time point, no significant difference was observed in drug uptake between the NP-encapsulated DEX and the free DEX. This suggests that, under the experimental conditions, the NPs did not enhance the drug&#x02019;s penetration. The potential advantage of NPs in this drug delivery system may not lie in increasing the drug&#x02019;s penetration but rather in offering controlled release, improving drug stability, or enabling targeted delivery, which could be more apparent over longer incubation times or in other experimental conditions.</p><p>Both the SEM and the FTIR results relative to the combination of CS-PLA-FBs and PLGA-NPs supported a uniform distribution of the nanoparticles on the FB surfaces. Moreover, the fluorescence microscopy analysis of the CS-PLA-FBs combined with 6-coumarin-loaded PLGA-NPs demonstrated that the PLGA-NPs are able to detach from PLA-FBs and penetrate inside the cells. The mucoadhesive capacity of the system was confirmed by PAS staining and SEM. Fluorescence image analysis confirms that PLGA-NPs successfully enter OLP cells.</p><p>This delivery system was also characterized under dynamic conditions with the use of a bioreactor in order to simulate both salivary flow and the three-dimensionality of oral cavity tissue, as fibroblasts taken from a patient were grown on PLA scaffolds, printed by FDM. It is particularly interesting to observe that the particles&#x02019; ability to penetrate the cells is not altered by the flow. This result further confirms the validity of a DDS that synergically ensures better mucoadhesion through CS-coated fibers and increases drug penetration via NPs, even in the presence of a flow similar to saliva. Also, toxicity analysis under dynamic conditions did not reveal different results compared to static conditions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec5-pharmaceutics-17-00272"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>This study clearly demonstrates that the combination of PLGA-NPs with PLA-FBs coated with chitosan merges the benefits of mucoadhesion and effective drug penetration. The results highlight the potential of such systems for effective clinical application in the delivery of DEX, contributing to more targeted therapy for oral diseases. In fact, the developed DDS offers several innovative features and advantages. In particular, the coating of PLA-FBs with CS significantly enhances the system&#x02019;s ability to adhere to the oral mucosa, ensuring prolonged contact between the drug and the target site. This results in a more effective localized release of DEX, improving the therapeutic efficacy and reducing the need for frequent applications, thus increasing patient compliance. Another important advantage is that this DDS represents a versatile platform. The system, combining PLGA-NPs embedded in PLA-FBs with a CS coating, can be adapted for the delivery of various drugs. This adaptability allows for the creation of personalized treatments for different oral health conditions, offering a more targeted and customized approach to drug delivery. Furthermore, the soft and flexible nature of PLA-FBs is expected to provide a comfortable experience for patients. The softness of the fibers minimizes the risk of irritation or discomfort in the sensitive tissues of the oral cavity, making the system more acceptable and enhancing patient adherence to treatment regimens. These features underscore the innovation and patient-centric design of the developed delivery system, making it a promising solution for improving oral cavity treatments. To further enhance clinical application, it is crucial to optimize the system to achieve a balance between drug release and mucoadhesive properties. Future research will focus on improving this delivery system and providing a detailed analysis of its physicochemical characteristics, including drug release in cells. These actions are important to achieve optimal treatment effectiveness and improve patient compliance, ultimately contributing to the development of new effective approaches for treating oral diseases.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors would like to express their sincere gratitude to Alberto Augello from LABCEMI at UCSC for his support in obtaining the SEM images.
