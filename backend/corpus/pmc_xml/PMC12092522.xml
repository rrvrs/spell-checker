In contrast, correlational research points to the relevance of spatial working memory in mental rotation. Considering these somewhat conflicting results and the fact that a small sample was acquired in the study of Hyun and Luck, a replication of their study was conducted. Additionally, potential sex effects were explored. We collected (usable) data from 213 individuals across two experiments. All participants performed a mental-rotation task alone, a working-memory task alone, and both tasks concurrently. We expected greater rotation-dependent interference between tasks when the working memory task concerned object features (Experiment <xref rid="Sec8" ref-type="sec">1</xref>) than when it concerned spatial locations (Experiment <xref rid="Sec9" ref-type="sec">2</xref>). In Experiment <xref rid="Sec8" ref-type="sec">1</xref>, dual-task interference was observed in working-memory accuracy. In Experiment <xref rid="Sec9" ref-type="sec">2</xref>, there were interference effects in both mental rotation accuracy and working-memory accuracy. However, interference did not differ between experiments. Moreover, interference was not rotation dependent in either of the experiments. Thus, we could not replicate the findings of Hyun and Luck. No sex differences were found in exploratory analyses. The general interference effects found in this study may reflect the involvement of visual working memory in the processing and decision-making stages of the mental rotation of letters. This study underscores the need for further research to fully understand the role of visual working memory in mental rotation, especially with more complex stimuli.</p><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.3758/s13423-024-02602-4.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Mental rotation</kwd><kwd>Visual working memory</kwd><kwd>Human sex differences</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Marie Sk&#x00142;odowska-Curie Actions "SellSTEM" project </institution></funding-source><award-id>Grant agreement No. 956124</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Universit&#x000e4;t Regensburg (3161)</institution></funding-source></award-group><open-access><p>Open Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL.</p></open-access></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Psychonomic Society, Inc. 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><p id="Par2">Mental rotation is thought to entail several stages of processing: the perceptual stages (perceptual processing, identification and discrimination of stimuli, identification of orientation), stages of the rotation process itself (mental rotation, judgment of parity), and decision-processing stages (response selection, execution; Heil &#x00026; Rolke, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2002</xref>; Just &#x00026; Carpenter, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">1985</xref>; Shepard &#x00026; Cooper, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">1982</xref>). Especially in the later perceptual stages, visual working memory should play a crucial role because the object must be kept in mind and manipulated. Several studies provide empirical evidence to support this notion. For instance, electrophysiological evidence suggests the involvement of visual short-term memory in mental rotation (Prime &#x00026; Jolic&#x00153;ur, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2010</xref>). Focusing on an event-related potential component connected with the maintenance of information in visual short-term memory, Prime and Jolic&#x00153;ur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2010</xref>) found increased offset latencies with increased angular disparity during mental rotation, indicating more extended maintenance of targets that are more strongly rotated.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn1">1</xref></p><p id="Par3">There is also behavioral evidence regarding the role of visual working memory in mental rotation. Visual working memory is believed to have two subcomponents: object working memory (concerned with object features) and spatial working memory (concerned with object location). This idea is supported by neuroscientific and behavioral data (e.g., Wood, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2011</xref>). To investigate how these subcomponents may be involved in mental rotation, Hyun and Luck (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2007</xref>) used a dual-task paradigm. Specifically, they conducted two experiments where participants performed mental rotation of letters presented in canonical or mirrored form while completing a secondary visual working memory task. In their first experiment, Hyun and Luck used a secondary task concerned with object color. In the second experiment, the secondary task targeted spatial working memory. Both experiments used a concurrent articulatory suppression task to deter participants from verbally encoding to-be-remembered visual information (Besner et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">1981</xref>). Hyun and Luck reported a significant interference effect (i.e., larger secondary task cost) in Experiment <xref rid="Sec8" ref-type="sec">1</xref> (object working memory) but not Experiment <xref rid="Sec9" ref-type="sec">2</xref> (spatial working memory) on both response times and accuracy in the mental-rotation task, with accuracy showing a rotation-dependent interference effect. Accuracy in secondary task performance showed a significant interference effect in both experiments, although the effect was rotation-dependent only in Experiment <xref rid="Sec8" ref-type="sec">1</xref> (object working memory). Taken together, the studies of Prime and Jolic&#x00153;ur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2010</xref>) and Hyun and Luck highlight the role of visual working memory during mental rotation. However, the latter warrants the more specific claim that a representation of an object itself is maintained in memory rather than its spatial attributes.</p><p id="Par4">The findings reported by Hyun and Luck (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2007</xref>) have often been cited to support the particular importance of the visual information (i.e., representation of object) preserved in working memory during mental rotation (e.g., G&#x000f6;ksun et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2013</xref>; Hollingworth &#x00026; Rasmussen, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2010</xref>). A question in this context is whether spatial representations (stored in spatial working memory) are also relevant during the rotation process. Though Hyun and Luck acknowledge a spatial component to mental rotation, they claim that this component would be independent of the mechanism required to store object information during rotation.</p><p id="Par5">Although, experimentally, no interference of a concurrent spatial working memory task with mental rotation performance was found, correlational data suggest the relevance of this system in mental rotation and other spatial abilities (e.g., Kaufman, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2007</xref>; Lehmann et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2014</xref>). Kaufman (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2007</xref>) observed strong correlations between performance on spatial working memory tasks and a mental rotation test (Vandenberg &#x00026; Kuse, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">1978</xref>). Moreover, rotation block and verification block span entirely mediated sex differences in spatial test performance, although a unique contribution of sex to mental rotation performance remained. The author proposed that &#x0201c;spatial working memory capacity is the driving force determining the sex difference in mental rotation and spatial visualization ability&#x0201d; (Kaufman, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2007</xref>, p. 290). However, the approach used by Kaufman confounded visual and verbal processing, which weakens the conclusions that can be drawn from the findings. Nevertheless, there is mitigated support for the role of spatial working memory in mental rotation sex difference&#x02014;for example, from a 2017 meta-analysis (Voyer et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2017</xref>). Hence, it seems sensible to investigate the relationship between working memory and mental rotation and the role of working memory in mental rotation sex differences more thoroughly.</p><p id="Par6">In this context, a dual-task design, as used by Hyun and Luck (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2007</xref>), is appealing because object and spatial working memory can be considered individually and are isolated via an articulatory suppression task. This approach further enables causal conclusions about the role of working memory in mental rotation. Nevertheless, some issues with the study by Hyun and Luck may be worth addressing. Their experiment included many more women than men (12/15 participants per experiment were women), precluding tests of sex effects and raising the possibility that their results reflect how women (but not men) maintain representations during mental rotation. Moreover, their study was potentially underpowered, given the small sample size, which leaves open the possibility of a Type 2 error as an alternative explanation for the results of Experiment <xref rid="Sec9" ref-type="sec">2</xref>. We conducted the present study as a replication and extension of the experiments conducted by Hyun and Luck to address these issues and clarify the role of working memory subsystems in mental rotation.</p><p id="Par7">It should be noted that a previous attempt to replicate and extend the study of Hyun and Luck (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2007</xref>) by (some of) the authors of this article failed to replicate the findings. However, as the experimental methods in the former experiment differed from those of the original study, no exact replication was achieved, and the results were never published. Precisely, next to minor deviations from the original experiment (which are unlikely to have had a significant impact on the data), the display of the mental rotation stimuli was 500 ms shorter than in the study by Hyun and Luck. The shorter stimulus presentation could have affected mental rotation response times and mental rotation accuracy as well as accuracy on the working memory tasks. Nevertheless, the same interference of visual working memory subsystems with the mental rotation process should have been tested in this experiment. Thus, despite the acknowledged differences, it is at least interesting that these unpublished results conflict with the theory of separate involvement of object and spatial working memory proposed by Hyun and Luck.</p><p id="Par8">The current replication included a large number of men and women participants. In keeping with Hyun and Luck's (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2007</xref>) findings, our working hypotheses regarding working memory interference were as follows: (1) Mental rotation should be slower and/or less accurate under dual-task conditions when the secondary task targets object working memory (Experiment <xref rid="Sec8" ref-type="sec">1</xref>). This effect should become more pronounced with increasing rotation angles. Object working-memory accuracy should be affected in the same way. (2) Potential task condition by angle of rotation interactions should be less pronounced (compared with Experiment <xref rid="Sec8" ref-type="sec">1</xref>) or even absent when the secondary task targets spatial working memory (Experiment <xref rid="Sec9" ref-type="sec">2</xref>). (3) In the joint data analyses, significant three-way interactions between task condition, angle of rotation, and experiment would be expected. Due to concerns about the statistical power to detect such three-way interactions at the achieved sample size, the analyses pertaining to this hypothesis are deemed exploratory.</p><p id="Par9">Although our key focus is on a replication of the study by Hyun and Luck (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2007</xref>), an extension to their work that investigates potential sex effects would be both sensible and interesting. As hinted before, a meta-analysis by Voyer et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2017</xref>) suggests that visuospatial working memory capacity is lower in women than men. Lower working memory capacity could make it harder to deal with increasing demands placed on these working memory systems. Hence, dual-task interference effects would be more pronounced in women than men. To address this hypothesis, we tested for three-way interactions between sex, task condition, and angular disparity. These analyses are deemed exploratory (see also the previous paragraph).</p><p id="Par10">Moreover, it could be informative to look at potential sex effects per experiment and investigate whether they differ between experiments (i.e., test four-way interactions between sex, experiment, condition, and angular disparity). However, confirmatory analyses into such effects were not well powered in the context of this study. Therefore, we opted for an exploratory investigation of four-way interactions in this study.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Method</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Participants</title><p id="Par11">In reaction-time experiments, effect sizes are typically around <italic>d</italic> = 0.1 (Brysbaert &#x00026; Stevens, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2018</xref>) due to the considerable variance of reaction times. Effects of such small magnitude are not readily detected, but this issue can (to a certain degree) be remedied through repeated measurements. To detect within-subjects effects of <italic>d</italic> = 0.1, Brysbaert and Stevens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2018</xref>) recommend at least 1,600 usable observations per condition to achieve adequate power (i.e., 1 &#x02013; &#x000df; = .8). With an expected accuracy of 80% (on the mental-rotation task) and 16 trials per condition, this translates to 125 participants per experiment (i.e., object working memory vs. spatial working memory) or a total of 250 participants across both experiments. Concerning accuracy data, it appears reasonable to consider effect sizes typical in psychological experiments of practical relevance. According to Brysbaert (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2019</xref>), such effects are in the realm of <italic>d</italic> = 0.3&#x02013;0.4, and these values should thus be used as the minimal effect size of interest in power analyses. According to a power analysis using Superpower in R (Lakens &#x00026; Caldwell, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2021</xref>), a total sample size of 126 participants would be needed to detect two-way, within-subjects, within-experiment interactions (Angle &#x000d7; Condition) at <italic>d</italic> = 0.4, given a correlation of <italic>r</italic> =.66 between repeated measurements<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn2">2</xref> and a power of 1 &#x02212; &#x000df; = 0.8. Based on these considerations and attempting to account for possibly lower accuracy, the exclusion of outliers, and to aim for an overpowered design, we terminated data collection at 270 participants. Sixteen participants from Experiment <xref rid="Sec8" ref-type="sec">1</xref> were excluded because their accuracy in at least one of the single-task conditions was below 60%. Data from two participants in Experiment <xref rid="Sec9" ref-type="sec">2</xref> were missing entirely, either due to human error or technical problems. Additionally, 39 participants from Experiment <xref rid="Sec9" ref-type="sec">2</xref> were excluded with accuracy rates below 60% in at least one of the single-task conditions. Thus, our final sample comprised 213 adult participants between 18 and 38 (mean age = 22.25 years, <italic>SD</italic> = 2.76). Of the 119 participants in Experiment <xref rid="Sec8" ref-type="sec">1</xref>, 57 were men and 62 were women. Of the 94 participants in Experiment <xref rid="Sec9" ref-type="sec">2</xref>, 52 were men, 41 were women, and one did not disclose their sex. Data for both experiments were collected concurrently, and participants were randomly assigned to either Experiment <xref rid="Sec8" ref-type="sec">1</xref> or Experiment <xref rid="Sec9" ref-type="sec">2</xref>. The experiments took place in a laboratory room at the Department of Sports Science at the University of Regensburg. Participants were mainly recruited via an online newsletter. Individuals younger than 18 years, older than 40 years, diagnosed with mental illness, on medication known to affect cognitive performance, and/or those with impaired color vision were not eligible to participate in the study. Demographic data (age, sex, handedness) were registered. Participants chose to be compensated with course credit (only applicable for students at the University of Regensburg) or through participation in a lottery to win one of 20 shopping vouchers (worth 20&#x020ac; each).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Materials</title><p id="Par12">The experiments were run in OpenSesame (Math&#x000f4;t et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2012</xref>) with a gray background.

The block order was counterbalanced. In each trial, participants first saw the memory array for 500 ms followed by a single letter relevant to the mental-rotation task (i.e., the letter display) for 2,000 ms, followed by the test array for 1,500 ms that was either identical to or different from the initial memory array. A 500-ms delay preceded both the letter display and the test array, and there was a 1,500-ms intertrial interval. In the rotation-alone block, participants performed the letter rotation task and ignored the memory stimuli. In the memory-alone block, they performed the memory task but were instructed to ignore the mental rotation stimuli. In the dual-task block, they performed both tasks.</p><p id="Par18">Additionally, following the approach used by Hyun and Luck (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2007</xref>), participants performed an articulatory suppression task by continuously repeating out loud &#x0201c;one, two, three&#x0201d; (in German, &#x0201c;eins, zwei, drei&#x0201d;) throughout each trial of each condition. An experimenter was always present during task completion to ensure that participants were completing the task as requested.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Data analysis</title><p id="Par19">We analyzed data from each experiment in isolation (as did Hyun &#x00026; Luck, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2007</xref>) as a first step. We further analyzed combined data from Experiments <xref rid="Sec8" ref-type="sec">1</xref> and <xref rid="Sec9" ref-type="sec">2</xref>, although these analyses remained exploratory. Accuracy on the mental rotation and working memory tasks and mental rotation response time were used as dependent variables in separate mixed-model analyses. For the replication, block (single-task mental rotation, single-task working memory, dual task) and angular disparity (0&#x000b0;, 72&#x000b0;, 144&#x000b0;) were used as independent variables. Data for the rotation task was collapsed across canonical and mirror-reversed items. In all analyses, the variable block was treated as a factor. The single-task conditions were coded as &#x02212;0.5 and the dual-task condition as 0.5. The angular disparity was coded numerically (centered around 72&#x000b0; and scaled so that &#x02212;1 = 0&#x000b0;) and treated as a continuous variable. To extend the work of Hyun and Luck, we added sex (exploratory) as an independent variable. This variable was also treated as a factor. Since one participant did not disclose their sex, analyses including sex effects were conducted separately from the rest of our analyses. For the joint data analysis, experimental condition (Experiment <xref rid="Sec8" ref-type="sec">1</xref> vs. Experiment <xref rid="Sec9" ref-type="sec">2</xref>) was additionally entered as an independent variable and treated as a factor. Experiment <xref rid="Sec8" ref-type="sec">1</xref> was coded as 0.5 and Experiment <xref rid="Sec9" ref-type="sec">2</xref> was coded as &#x02212;0.5. All potential main and interaction effects were entered into our statistical models. However, our analyses focused on interaction effects that included the Block &#x000d7; Angular Disparity interaction, as these effects would imply process interference between working memory and mental-rotation tasks. To ensure ease of interpretation of main effects and lower-order interactions as part of higher-order interactions (this can be an issue in mixed-model approaches), all factors were sum coded (Levy, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2014</xref>). To ensure that the planned analyses were feasible, we simulated data and &#x0201c;analyzed&#x0201d; them using generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) for binomial, gamma, and inverse Gaussian distributions prior to data collection. We ran simulations following two distinct approaches (a detailed description of the simulations, including the simulated parameters and parameter estimates from the respective GLMMs, can be found in Supplement <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>).</p><p id="Par20">Following recommendations by Lo and Andrews (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2015</xref>), we analyzed reaction time data using generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs). There are several advantages of using linear mixed models compared with traditional analyses of variance.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn3">3</xref> Moreover, GLMMs allow for the analysis of reaction-time data without the need for transformation (e.g., inverse transformation), thereby precluding common issues linked to such transformation in the context of reaction times (see Lo &#x00026; Andrews, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2015</xref>). In line with their recommendations, we compared a Gaussian, an inverse Gaussian, and a gamma distribution on the most complex (converging) models. We chose the best-fitting distribution (in terms of deviance) for further analysis. If, for a given analysis, the random intercepts-only model did not converge, we discarded that distribution for the respective analysis. Accuracy data were analyzed using GLMMs based on the binomial distribution as recommended by Dixon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2008</xref>). The random factor participant/subject was included in all models. Additionally, mental rotation stimulus was included as a random factor in models concerning mental rotation performance to &#x0201c;(1) estimate the extent to which mean responses vary across units of the random factor(s); (2) allow inferences about whether fixed effects generalize beyond the units sampled in the random factor(s); (3) remove variability in responses that are associated with the random factor(s) rather than the conditions of experimental interest (i.e., reduce Type I error rate)&#x0201d; (Lo &#x00026; Andrews, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2015</xref>, p. 5).</p><p id="Par21">Following the approach Hyun and Luck (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2007</xref>) used, response times faster than 100 ms or slower than 3,000 ms were excluded from all analyses, and only correct mental rotation responses were considered in response-time analyses. However, no more trimming was applied, following the recommendations of Baayen and Milin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2010</xref>). In addition, participants with an accuracy of 60% or lower in the single-task conditions were removed to ensure that all included participants understood what was expected of them.</p><p id="Par22">For all effects of interest, we report both the unstandardized effect sizes (i.e., absolute mean difference) and confidence intervals calculated using parametric bootstrapping with 1,000 simulations, as recommended by Baguley (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2009</xref>) and Pek and Flora (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2018</xref>). Unfortunately, there is no agreement regarding the way to compute standardized effect sizes (e.g., Cohen&#x02019;s <italic>d</italic>) in linear mixed models (Feingold, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2009</xref>; Hedges, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2007</xref>; Rights &#x00026; Sterba, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2019</xref>).</p><p id="Par23">Model building was based on research by Barr et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2013</xref>), Bates et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2015</xref>), and Matuschek et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2017</xref>). Guided by their recommendations, we started with models including all relevant fixed effects, random intercepts, and slopes for every appropriate fixed effect. We then reduced the random effects structure using a backward selection approach. Using likelihood ratio tests (LRTs) with &#x003b1; = .2 (this alpha level places a lower penalty on model complexity than the Akaike information criterion and is a sensible criterion; Matuschek et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2017</xref>), we determined whether random correlations or random slopes could be excluded from a given model without a significant decrease in model fit (i.e., slopes for which <italic>p</italic> &#x0003e; .2 will be excluded). We started with the random slopes of the highest order effects and excluded those effects yielding the least significant decrease in model fit one by one until further exclusion of any random slope yielded a significantly worse model. We conducted significance tests for all fixed effects based on the resulting models. Specifically, we employed LRTs comparing the final models to models excluding the fixed effects in question.</p><sec id="Sec9"><title>Deviations from the registered plan</title><p id="Par24">Since bootstrapping confidence intervals could not be calculated for inverse Gaussian and gamma distributions, we report Wald confidence intervals where these distributions were used. Our registered plan was ambiguous regarding the random factor &#x0201c;stimulus.&#x0201d; We did not specify whether this referred to the mental rotation stimulus, the working memory stimulus, or both. In our analyses, only the letter participants saw for the mental-rotation task was included as the random factor stimulus. Moreover, this random factor was only included in analyses concerning mental rotation, contrary to our registered plan, which specified its inclusion in all analyses.

However, the findings of our replication study do not support this notion. Where we observed interference, there were no differences in the extent of interference between the group that memorized object colors and the group that memorized spatial locations. Moreover, visuospatial working memory does not seem to be relevant to the rotation process in the mental rotation of letters, as any dual-task interference found was independent of the degree of rotation. This pattern of results suggests that neither visuospatial working memory, in general, nor object working memory, specifically, are relevant to the mental rotation of letters in the way Hyun and Luck assumed.</p><p id="Par40">According to capacity-sharing models (and similar bottleneck models), dual-task interference results from two tasks or processes involved in these tasks, relying on the same mental resources or mechanisms (Pashler, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">1994</xref>). In the context of this study, this would mean that mental rotation involves cognitive resources that are also relevant to working-memory tasks. Here, we assume that visuospatial working memory itself is one of these shared resources.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn4">4</xref> The notion of visuospatial working memory involvement fits well with the discussed correlational findings (Kaufman, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2007</xref>; Lehmann et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2014</xref>), and neuroimaging studies that implicate frontal brain areas associated with visuospatial working memory and attention (e.g., Awh &#x00026; Jonides, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2001</xref>; Cohen et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">1996</xref>; Mayer et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2007</xref>) in mental rotation (Gogos et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2010</xref>). As Hyun and Luck (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2007</xref>) note, neuroimaging studies further suggest the involvement of the dorsal &#x0201c;where&#x0201d; pathway in the rotation process (see, e.g., Gogos et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2010</xref>). On the other hand, the ventral &#x0201c;what&#x0201d; stream is often implicated in object processing and recognition (Koshino et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2005</xref>). As Koshino et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2005</xref>) point out, the tasks are not carried out by these systems in isolation. Instead, areas of the dorsal and ventral streams play a part in multiple processes of mental rotation, albeit with distinct relative specializations. Interestingly, Koshino et al. observed different brain activation patterns depending on stimulus complexity. With simple stimuli, increased rotation was linked to increased parietal activation only. However, the rotation of more complex stimuli elicited higher activation in regions across the cortex, including regions linked to visuospatial working memory. Hence, visuospatial working memory may serve a relatively limited role in the mental rotation of simple stimuli (such as letters) but be crucial in cases of more complex stimuli. This explanation aligns with our results, indicating a general, rotation-independent involvement of visuospatial working memory in the mental rotation of letters. Here, visuospatial working memory appears relevant to stages other than the rotation process. That is, working memory may be employed during the perceptual and/or the decision-processing stages. As later perceptual stages of mental rotation involve keeping a stimulus in mind and manipulating it, the involvement of working memory appears likely. Following a similar line of thought, Podzebenko et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2002</xref>) argued that visuospatial working memory may be relevant for comparing a stimulus and a known target. The findings of Koshino et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2005</xref>) highlight that our conclusions may not apply to mental rotation in general but rather to the mental rotation of simple stimuli. Testing the involvement of visuospatial working memory in the mental rotation of complex stimuli (e.g., complex polygons or 3D block figures) using a dual-task approach would be informative.</p><p id="Par41">Our exploratory analyses did not reveal any sex differences. Further investigations into potential factors involved in mental rotation sex differences are warranted. However, it may be most sensible to focus on tests where sex differences are frequently observed (e.g., the Mental Rotations Test; Vandenberg &#x00026; Kuse, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">1978</xref>). As Jost and Jansen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2024</xref>) point out, sex differences (on psychometric tests) are typically smaller when simpler stimuli are used, which may also play a role in the context of this study. Examining differences between tests that produce sex differences and those that do not may provide guidance in identifying relevant factors (Jost &#x00026; Jansen, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2024</xref>).</p><p id="Par42">Two unexpected observations should be addressed. Firstly, it is surprising that rotation was slower in the single-task condition than in the dual-task condition across experiments. Unfortunately, standardized effect sizes are not available for context (see also the Method section). It should also be noted that the accuracy on both working-memory tasks was considerably lower than in the study by Hyun and Luck (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2007</xref>). This discrepancy may be rooted in differences between the samples. However, it may also have reasons that could explain our failure to replicate the dual-task interference observed by Hyun and Luck. For example, it is possible that participants in our study did not dedicate much effort to solving the working-memory tasks and, as a result, did not use their full working-memory capacity for these tasks. If that were the case, they could have used the spare working-memory capacity to solve the mental-rotation task in the dual-task condition. Nevertheless, this explanation does not align well with the observed dual-task interference in working-memory performance.</p><p id="Par43">In conclusion, we could not replicate the findings of Hyun and Luck (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2007</xref>). Our results suggest that visual and spatial working memory may be involved in processes other than rotation in simple mental-rotation tasks. This is in line with evidence from neuroimaging studies. The role of visuospatial working memory in mental-rotation tasks involving complex stimuli should be tested experimentally, for example, using a dual-task design.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.<supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM1"><media xlink:href="13423_2024_2602_MOESM1_ESM.pdf"><caption><p>Supplementary file1 (PDF 151 KB)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM2"><media xlink:href="13423_2024_2602_MOESM2_ESM.r"><caption><p>Supplementary file2 (R 4 KB)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM3"><media xlink:href="13423_2024_2602_MOESM3_ESM.r"><caption><p>Supplementary file3 (R 4 KB)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM4"><media xlink:href="13423_2024_2602_MOESM4_ESM.r"><caption><p>Supplementary file4 (R 7 KB)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="Fn1"><label>1</label><p id="Par49">Although this work focuses on the role of working memory systems, it should be noted that short-term memory and working memory are hard to disentangle.
