Latest estimates suggest that 56% and 69% (equivalent to 372 million preschool-aged children and 1.2 billion nonpregnant women of reproductive age, respectively) are deficient in &#x02265;1 of 3 micronutrients [<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Iron, iodine, folate, and vitamin A are among the micronutrients with the highest estimated prevalence of inadequate intake and their deficiencies are among those of major public health concern [<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>]. These deficiencies contribute to poor growth, lower educational attainment, and impaired economic productivity, and are major causes of morbidity and, in extreme conditions, even mortality [<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p id="p0015">Food fortification is the practice of adding vitamins and minerals to foods to improve their nutritional quality and provide public health benefits with minimal risk to health. It is considered a cost-effective approach to increase the intake of micronutrients due to its potential to reach the majority of people in a population [<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The efficacy of food fortification, as well as its effectiveness in improving micronutrient status, thus leading to a decline in the prevalence of corresponding deficiencies and functional health outcomes, is well established when programs are implemented with the appropriate conditions [<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>].</p><p id="p0020">When large-scale food fortification (LSFF) is made mandatory, manufacturers are legally required to add micronutrients to widely consumed foods, such as staple foods, according to a specified target [<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The success and public health impact of mandatory LSFF programs depend on high population coverage and compliance of fortified foods to standards. Compliance data are essential to inform fortification program improvements, such as identifying producers to target for improvements and understanding why gaps in micronutrient adequacy may still exist [<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Using compliance data to monitor progress allows decision-making to ensure that impact is attained and sustained. Ideally, compliance data are collected through regulatory monitoring, which is defined as the continuous collection and review of information at key delivery points (production sites, customs warehouses, or market) to ensure fortified foods meet national nutrient fortification standards (FS) [<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Unfortunately, external and commercial regulatory monitoring, which refers to monitoring by relevant government regulatory authorities, is often limited in countries due to various challenges, and even when implemented, inspection reports are not publicly available due to confidentiality reasons. Challenges to regulatory monitoring include inconsistent funding and capacity of regulatory agency (limited staff, e.g. inspectors and laboratory analysts, insufficient training, difficulties related to local availability/cost of equipment and reagents, etc.), as well as low priority for enforcement [<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>]. As a result, there are large gaps in compliance information. According to the Global Fortification Data Exchange, compliance data are only available for wheat flour (WF), oil, and salt in 10.9%, 5.7%, and 9.5% of countries with mandatory fortification programs, respectively [<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Given the limited availability of compliance data, many nongovernmental entities assess the fortification quality of foods by collecting foods available in the marketplace (referred to as &#x0201c;quality&#x0201d; data, under a market assessment) [<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Quality data are not formal compliance data that can be used to take enforcement action against the industry if FS are not met. However, it does provide additional information to identify where the gaps are. A few methodologies have been developed for this purpose [<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Market assessments have been implemented in Burkina Faso, Bangladesh, Mozambique, Pakistan, Mexico, Nigeria, Afghanistan, and Uganda to fill compliance gaps [<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>].</p><p id="p0025">As part of its nutrition policy and strategy [<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>], Senegal has a national fortification program that aims to reduce the most widespread micronutrient deficiencies by fortifying WF with iron and folic acid and refined edible oil with vitamin A [<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. These vehicles were identified on the basis of their extensive consumption in relatively high quantities in all Senegalese geographical and socioeconomic subgroups following a Fortification Rapid Assessment Tool survey [<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. An enabling environment for food fortification was established through: <italic>1</italic>) the creation of a national fortification alliance, <italic>Comit&#x000e9; S&#x000e9;n&#x000e9;galais pour la Fortification des Aliments en Micronutriments</italic> (COSFAM), in 2006 to coordinate food fortification, <italic>2</italic>) the adoption of national FS for vitamin A in refined edible oil and for iron and folic acid in WF through the <italic>Association S&#x000e9;n&#x000e9;galaise de Normalisation</italic> (ASN) in 2008, <italic>3</italic>) mandating the use of these standards through legislation in 2009. These efforts complemented the country's commitment to combating iodine deficiency disorders, which had already resulted in the mandatory iodization of salt, endorsed by a ministerial order in 1995 and then followed by a decree in 2000 [<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. National standards were subsequently aligned with Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) standards [<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>]. However, Senegal still faces the challenge of micronutrient deficiencies among the most vulnerable population groups [<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].</p><p id="p0030">A 2013 Fortification Assessment Coverage Toolkit (FACT) survey revealed that household coverage for WF and oil, fortified at any level with iron plus folic acid and vitamin A, respectively, was only 51.2%, and 34.1%, respectively. This is despite the consumption of WF and oil in a fortifiable form by 81.5% and 95.0% of households [<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Adequately iodized salt (&#x02265;15 ppm) only covered 37.2% of households (53.3% compared with 10.9% in urban and rural areas, respectively), whereas salt with any iodine was 81.3% [<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Data on industry-level fortification compliance are only available for WF intended for use in bread production (96.0%) [<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. At the distribution level, the latest available market assessment dates back a decade [<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>]. It indicates that 96.0% of WF and 76.1% of oil sold on the market were fortified to any level at the national level, but only 12.0% and 27.5% of these products met FS, respectively. An Industry Landscape Assessment in Senegal (through stakeholder interviews) estimated that refined oils are still likely to be inadequately fortified [USAID Advancing Food Fortification Opportunities to Reinforce Diets (USAID AFFORD) and Nicolas du Payrat (Altai Consulting), &#x0201c;Assessing Large-Scale Food Fortification Opportunities in Senegal: Industry feasibility of LSFF assessment,&#x0201d; 2023].</p><p id="p0035">Regulatory monitoring to ensure compliance with fortified foods at all levels (import, production, and distribution) is the responsibility of the Directorate of Internal Trade, Ministry of Industry and Trade [<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. There are external and import monitoring protocols for oil and WF. COSFAM&#x02019;s achievements under its first 2 strategic plans mention the quarterly implementation of regulatory monitoring by the above-mentioned entity, with the production of reports, including compliance rates for samples taken during inspections and quality control at distribution. However, details of this evidence are not publicly available [<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. In addition, consultations carried out as part of the third strategic plan preparation revealed persistent weaknesses in the quality control of fortified foods at the production level and an absence of control of the oil market at borders due to a lack of human resources for control throughout the country and insufficient training of control officers. The existing data landscape raises questions about the availability and quality of mandatorily fortified food vehicles. Despite investments made to enforce regulations and monitor the fortification process, it is unclear if the standards are being met. The objective of this market assessment of fortified foods was to assess, at the market level, the availability and amounts of iron, vitamin A, and iodine in fortified WF, refined edible oil, and salt, respectively, and how these align with the relevant FS.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>Study design and setting</title><p id="p0040">This study is designed as a cross-sectional market survey whose methodology was an adaptation of the Food Fortification Initiative&#x02019;s PULL strategy in Uganda and Malawi and the Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition&#x02019;s FACT methodologies while accounting for Senegal&#x02019;s food distribution and marketplace context [<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].

Therefore, the Dakar region and the neighboring city of Thi&#x000e8;s were targeted and the survey was conducted from 10 to 14 August, 2023. Dakar is the main food processing and distribution center and port in Senegal, where wheat mills and refined oil industries are located and where 90% of foreign commercial imports are concentrated.

The characteristics of the oil, salt, and WF samples found on the market, their respective concentrations of vitamin A, iodine, and iron, and their fortification quality according to Senegalese standards were determined using a descriptive analysis. For the purpose of this paper, the main producers of wheat flour, oil, and salt are anonymized as wheat flour producer (WFP), oil producer (OP), and salt producer (SP), respectively, and numbered (WFP1 to WFP6, OP1 to OP3, SP1, and SP2). However, it is important to note that in the case of wheat flour, WFP6 is not a miller, but a local producer of ready-to-use pastry mixes, and is therefore likely to be supplied by one of the local mills. The results are presented with and without his samples to better assess the compliance of the domestic mills involved in the LSFF. To estimate overall fortification quality, we assumed that each sample had the same content as the composite to which it had contributed, and we, therefore, applied the fortification status of composite samples to the individual samples from which they had been derived. Categorical variables were expressed as percentages and continuous variables were expressed as median with the IQR. The Wilcoxon rank-sum test or Kruskal&#x02013;Wallis&#x02019;s test was used to compare medians. Pearson's &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test or Fisher's exact test are used to compare percentages.

Such information is essential for determining the performance of these programs, and then informing national fortification efforts, targeting food vehicles and companies that should be prioritized for improvement. This could contribute to positive health impacts through increased availability and consumption of quality fortified foods. The findings of the present study indicate an availability of fortified foods with the majority of WF, oil, and salt samples found on the market fortified with iron, vitamin A, and iodine, respectively. However, the iron content of WF and that of vitamin A in oil were below the lower limits of the applicable standards. Only the iodine content of salt was within the recommended range. Consequently, only 17.1%, 28.4%, and 37.2% of the collected WF, oil, and salt samples, respectively, complied with the required FS.</p><p id="p0185">Over 70% of WF and 65.7% of salt samples collected from the marketplace in this study were domestically produced, but only a quarter (24.7%) of the oil. These figures significantly differ from those recently reported in a USAID AFFORD assessment of the fortified food industry in Senegal (USAID AFFORD and Nicolas du Payrat [Altai Consulting], &#x0201c;Assessing Large-Scale Food Fortification Opportunities in Senegal: Industry feasibility of LSFF assessment,&#x0201d; 2023), which reported as domestically produced 99%, 60%, and 99%, respectively, for WF, oil, and salt. This difference may stem from the different objectives and methodologies employed in both studies. The USAID AFFORD industry assessment utilized a desk review and key informant interviews to describe the industry landscape, whereas our study focused on a sample of food vehicles, which, although reasonably representative of their availability in the Senegalese market, does not offer market share data. Our study found samples from all major domestic mills, with the exception of 1 WF producer that holds 5% of the market share in Senegal. The study also revealed a wide variety of brands (27 for WF, 69 for oil, and 31 for salt).</p><sec id="sec4.1"><title>Wheat flour</title><p id="p0190">The median iron content in WF was 17.5 mg/kg (14.3&#x02013;26.8, as the IQR), which is significantly lower than the standard requirement of 54&#x02013;66 mg/kg using ferrous sulfate or fumarate, and 36&#x02013;44 mg/kg if using NaFeEDTA. In addition, only &#x0223c;1 of 4 (26.1%) WF samples from the mills were fortified to standards. These findings indicate that much work remains to improve fortification compliance and the quality of iron fortification in soft WF. The proportion of WF meeting the standards in our study was higher than the 30% reported in a FACT survey from C&#x000f4;te d&#x02019;Ivoire [<xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>].</p><p id="p0195">Although domestic wheat flour exhibited a significantly higher median iron content and was more likely to approach meeting the FS compared with imports, both showed median concentrations well below the standard minimum. Improving domestic WF compliance is crucial, as it could reduce nutrient inadequacy from 54% to 46% and from 38% to 33% among women of reproductive age and children, respectively [<xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. This is particularly important because 99% of the WF market in Senegal is domestically produced. However, only 1 domestic mill met satisfactory compliance, suggesting that local producers face challenges such as sourcing quality premixes, high costs, insufficient internal quality control, or not being equally or consistently monitored for compliance with FS by the responsible government agency. This may be due to a number of factors, including low priority and capacity (insufficient human resources and/or training of existing human resources or a lack of resources required to carry out and succeed in this control) for enforcement [<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p id="p0200">More specifically, our findings also suggest an increase in the share of nonfortified samples (from 4% to 13.3%) and a decrease in the iron content of bread flour from 44 mg/kg to 27.4 mg/kg, compared with the 2014 data [<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. This could be attributed to various factors, including the cessation of partners financial support to millers&#x02019; purchase of premixes, as usual in the early stages of the fortification program [<xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. However, it is important to note the methodological differences between the current and the past study (including sampling techniques and analytical methods). Specifically, the iron concentration in the earlier study was measured using an iCheck Iron photometer, which tends to yield systematically lower values compared with the AAS, the reference method we used, although both are concordant [<xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>].</p><p id="p0205">Furthermore, the quality of fortification differs according to the type of WF. For instance, almost 43.3% of bread flour is fortified to the standard (assuming that ferrous sulfate or fumarate is being used), compared with only 13.6% for nonbread flour. This discrepancy may be attributed to manufacturers&#x02019; continued adherence to the requirements of the previous version of the standard, which only covered bread flour, to the detriment of the ECOWAS standard that has been adopted as the Senegalese standard, which covers all types of WF, and currently in force. This hypothesis is consistent with USAID AFFORD&#x02019;s policy and industry assessments which found conflicting understanding of the term &#x0201c;<italic>farine de bl&#x000e9; tendre</italic>&#x0201d; (soft WF) as mentioned in the standard. Wheat flour millers interpreted the term as referring only to flour used in bread production, whereas policy stakeholders felt that the term included refined flour regardless of its intended use [USAID AFFORD and Nicolas du Payrat (Altai Consulting), &#x0201c;Assessing Large-Scale Food Fortification Opportunities in Senegal: Industry feasibility of LSFF assessment,&#x0201d; 2023; USAID AFFORD and Christophe Guyondet (Freelance Consultant), &#x0201c;Assessing Large-Scale Food Fortification Opportunities in Senegal: Policy enabling environment assessment,&#x0201d; 2023].</p></sec><sec id="sec4.2"><title>Oil</title><p id="p0210">In the case of oil, fortified samples had an average vitamin A content of 10.8 mg retinol equivalent (RE)/kg (5.8&#x02013;14.2), which is just around the minimum content specified by the standard (11&#x02013;24 mg/kg). This value is comparable to a previously reported level in Dakar (10.5 mg RE/kg oil), but higher than the national average of 7.6 mg RE/kg oil reported in the same study [<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The overall compliance with FS was low (28.4%), which is similar to the 27.5% compliance reported previously. Furthermore, the proportion of nonfortified oil samples nearly doubled from 23.9% in 2014 to 44.6% in this study. These findings suggest that, over the past decade, compliance of oil to vitamin A FS has not improved.</p><p id="p0215">One possible explanation for this could be that the oil industry is either not fortifying or is only fortifying with the minimum required amount of vitamin A. The high cost of premixes and their nontax-exempt status may contribute to this situation [<xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Additionally, vitamin A losses between oil production and distribution, estimated between 53% and 75% [<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], could play a significant role in reducing the final levels of fortification. According to the ASN, fortified edible oil should be packaged in opaque, hermetically sealed containers to ensure optimum vitamin A stability. Exposure to sunlight and excessive heat during storage, transport, and distribution can degrade vitamin A. However, our study found that over 95% of oil samples were packaged in transparent bottles and came from open markets, where storage conditions typically expose them to sunlight and heat. Notably, oils packaged in dark plastic bottles were all fortified, in contrast to &#x0003c;50% of those packaged in clear bottles. This suggests that producers who invest in dark plastic bottles are more likely to comply with FS and/or that packaging quality is a critical factor that should be considered in improving the quality of oil fortification.</p><p id="p0220">Furthermore, our results showed that the median vitamin A concentration in imported oil [9.3 mg/kg (5.8&#x02013;12.8 mg/kg)] was below the standard minimum, whereas locally produced oil had a median of 14.2 mg/kg (13.5&#x02013;17.4 mg/kg), which is within the standard range. As a result, imported oil had a higher proportion of samples that were fortified below the required minimum. This indicates that oil importers may not be ensuring their products meet Senegal's FS, or that regulatory monitoring at the borders is insufficient. Among the 3 major local producers, only 1 had satisfactory compliance, whereas the other 2 produced oils that were compliant when fortified but had a significant proportion of nonfortified samples (about two-thirds). In contrast, small producers seemed to make a greater effort to fortify their oil, although not enough to ensure full compliance across all samples.</p></sec><sec id="sec4.3"><title>Salt</title><p id="p0225">The mean content in iodized salt samples was 33.3 mg iodine/kg (18.5&#x02013;58.2), which reflects a relatively good level of compliance with the standard requirement of 20&#x02013;60 mg/kg. The median iodine content also falls within the specified range, irrespective of the origin of production. This value is higher than the 2.2 mg/kg reported in B&#x000e9;nin [<xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Additionally, the proportion of salt brands meeting the iodization standard (38.7%) was higher than that observed in Burkina Faso (27%) who is adhering to the same standards [<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p id="p0230">Our results revealed that most formal salt processing facilities iodized their salt production almost entirely, some even adding higher amounts of iodine than necessary. In contrast, small salt processors exhibited significantly lower compliance, with only 38.1% of samples meeting the standards. Inconsistent iodization by artisanal producers may be attributed to a lack of awareness regarding FS, insufficient adherence to proper iodization practices, or challenges related to storage in market conditions. Moreover, the obsolescence of iodization equipment, which entails additional maintenance costs, probably impacts producers&#x02019; profitability and could, therefore, have a negative impact on their fortification efforts.</p><p id="p0235">Despite these challenges, the Government of Senegal, with support from partners such as Nutrition International, UNICEF, and the World Food Programme, has made efforts to strengthen the Universal Salt Iodization program. These efforts included providing production units, capacity-building initiatives, and establishing a potassium iodate supply system [<xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>,<xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Nevertheless, the high cost of premixes and associated taxes (similar to WF and oil sectors) remain significant obstacles. In this respect, one of the main recommendations arising from the recent Forum des Affaires dans l&#x02019;Industrie du Sel au S&#x000e9;n&#x000e9;gal was that the cost of potassium iodate should be shared between manufacturers, producers, and public authorities [<xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. However, in our view, the solution may be to promote the industrialization of this portion of the salt sector. Poor fortification results from small-scale/artisanal producers highlight the difficulties in implementing fortification outside of large-scale fortification. Improving the fortification of this part of domestic salt, which accounts for 40%&#x02013;45% of the country's salt market, could potentially reduce iodine inadequacy.</p></sec><sec id="sec4.4"><title>Fortification labeling</title><p id="p0240">Regarding the presence of a fortification label, 79.6% of WF, 97.9% of oil, and 87.1% of salt were found to have one, indicating that despite the weakness of compliance with fortification requirements, producers are familiar with the labeling requirements. However, the presence of a fortification label does not guarantee compliance with regulations. Our findings revealed that 17.2% of WF, 44.8% of oils, and 15.6% of salts with a fortification label were not fortified.</p></sec><sec id="sec4.5"><title>Programmatic implications</title><p id="p0245">Our results imply several key actions to ensure effective fortification of soft WF and oil, as well as salt iodization.

In addition, a thorough review of the existing regulatory framework and related processes at production, import, and market levels would be beneficial. A feasible approach to these actions would be to proceed to an overall program impact pathway (PIP) analysis of the country's food fortification program, as implemented in Cameroon [<xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. A PIP analysis is an approach that uses the theory of change to identify key inputs, processes, and outputs in a program's causal chain. This will help identify and/or confirm existing gaps and understand barriers to compliance at all levels and uncover comprehensive and sustainable strategies to enhance the fortification quality of fortified food vehicles.</p><p id="p0255">In the meantime, the government should prioritize the recruitment and training of sufficient personnel while ensuring the continuous professional development of existing staff.

In regard to importers, it is incumbent upon them to ensure that the oil they introduce into the country meets the required standards by being stricter with their suppliers on fortification requirements (e.g. demand a CoA issued by an accredited laboratory).</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec4.6"><title>Study limitations</title><p id="p0285">Our findings have 2 major limitations. First, our sample did not allow us to obtain a nationally representative situation that accounts for potential differences in the quality of micronutrient fortification of food vehicles by residency (urban compared with rural), as in the 2014 FACT survey, which distinguished, for example, a higher concentration of vitamin A and a lower proportion of nonfortified oil in urban strata compared with rural ones. This may limit the generalization of our results at the national level. Second, we measured total iron in WF and compared it with the iron fortification standard, which refers to added iron. West Africa's food composition table estimates intrinsic iron in refined WF at 20 mg/kg [<xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>], whereas our results were suggestive of intrinsic iron levels &#x0223c;10 mg/kg. Considering the standard's very narrow range, the presence of intrinsic iron can have a significant impact on the classification of a sample. What is more, the total iron concentration we found, without deducting intrinsic iron, was already below the lower limit of the standard. Thus, our WF fortification results are actually an underestimate of noncompliance and consequently an overestimate of overall compliance, indicating that the situation is probably worse than described. This points to the need to have standards with a sufficiently wide compliance interval to take into account all types of variation that can occur during the production of a fortified food: mill production, laboratory analysis, and intrinsic values.</p><p id="p0290">In conclusion, this study provides an update on the fortification quality of refined vegetable oil with vitamin A, WF with iron, and salt with iodine in Senegal. It demonstrates that although fortification of these products is already taking place, and the programs count with standards and the awareness of authorities, the private sector, and the public, quality gaps and challenges still need to be addressed. Disparities in the extent of fortification and quality gaps by origin of production, among domestic producers, and sometimes, by type of food vehicle have implications for targeting improvements in fortification quality.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>Author contributions</title><p id="p0295">The authors&#x02019; responsibilities were as follows &#x02013; NID, AD, DP, BLT, PMN, MHF: conceptualized and designed the study; M-MAD: contributed to the design of the study; MHF, M-MAD: conducted the data collection and curation, conducted statistical analysis and interpretation, and wrote the manuscript; MADS: conducted food sample analysis; PMN: contributed to food sample analysis; DP, PMN, BLT: contributed to data analysis and interpretation; NID, DP, BLT, PMN, AD, AB, OMM: critically revised the manuscript; and all authors: read and approved the final manuscript.</p></sec><sec id="sec6"><title>Disclaimer</title><p id="p0300">The views expressed in this article are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of USAID or the U.S. Government.</p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="sec7"><title>Data availability</title><p id="p0305">The data used and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.</p></sec><sec id="sec8"><title>Funding</title><p id="p0310">This work was supported by the <funding-source id="gs1">U.S. Agency for International Development</funding-source> (USAID; cooperative agreement number 7200AA22LE00002; <funding-source id="gs2">USAID Advancing Food Fortification Opportunities to Reinforce Diets</funding-source>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="COI-statement" id="coi0010"><title>Conflict of interest</title><p id="p0315">The authors report no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="cebib0010"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Black</surname><given-names>R.E.</given-names></name><name><surname>Allen</surname><given-names>L.H.</given-names></name><name><surname>Bhutta</surname><given-names>Z.A.</given-names></name><name><surname>Caulfield</surname><given-names>L.E.</given-names></name><name><surname>de Onis</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name><name><surname>Ezzati</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Maternal and child undernutrition: global and regional exposures and health consequences</article-title><source>Lancet</source><volume>371</volume><issue>9608</issue><year>2008</year><fpage>243</fpage><lpage>260</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/S0140-6736(07)61690-0</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">18207566</pub-id>
