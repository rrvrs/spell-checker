Activating Transcription Factor 4 (ATF4) has been established to be involved in cardiovascular diseases, such as heart failure and calcific aortic valve disease. However, the role of ATF4 in the pathogenesis of AAA remains unclear. We found that ATF4 expression was significantly increased in patients with AAA and mouse models of AAA and was mainly confined to macrophages in arteries. ATF4 knockdown significantly attenuated aneurysm formation in experimental mouse model of AAA, while ATF4 overexpression promoted the development of AAA. RNA sequencing suggested that ATF4 was strongly related to the biological function of acute inflammatory response. Macrophages-specific ATF4 knockout significantly reduced the incidence and development of AAA, and decreased M1 polarization of macrophages in mice. Sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase 3 (SMPD3), a regulator of inflammatory responses in monocytes/macrophages, has been identified as a target gene of ATF4 through RNA sequencing, ChIP sequencing, and standard ChIP analyses. ATF4 induces M1 polarization of macrophages through the activation of SMPD3, thereby promoting inflammatory responses. Together, these results suggest that ATF4 mediated macrophage M1 polarization by regulating the expression of target genes SMPD3, leading to an increased inflammatory response, which further promotes the formation and development of AAA. These findings suggest ATF4 may be a new therapeutic target for AAA.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>abdominal aortic aneurysm</kwd><kwd>activating transcription factor 4</kwd><kwd>inflammation</kwd><kwd>macrophage polarization</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>The National Natural Science Foundation of China</funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source>National Natural Science Foundation of China</funding-source><award-id>91439127</award-id><award-id>81970224</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>National Key Research and Development Program of China</funding-source><award-id>2021YFC2500600</award-id><award-id>2021YFC2500603</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>Beijing Municipal Health Commission</funding-source><award-id>2021-7;2021-1854</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>The National Natural Science Foundation of China is gratefully acknowledged.

Once ruptured, the mortality rate for AAA significantly is up to more than 90% [<xref rid="b1-ad-16-3-1691" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. AAA usually occurs in the male elderly population and is associated with risk factors such as hypertension, smoking, atherosclerosis, and other vascular diseases [<xref rid="b2-ad-16-3-1691" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="b3-ad-16-3-1691" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Currently, endovascular aneurysm repair and open surgical repair are the main treatment for AAA, but effective pharmacological therapies to inhibit AAA expansion and prevent aneurysm rupture have not been established [<xref rid="b4-ad-16-3-1691" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. This is partially due to the incomplete understanding of the pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying the occurrence and development of AAA.</p><p>The main pathophysiological processes contributing to the formation of AAA include chronic inflammatory infiltration, smooth muscle cell apoptosis, oxidative stress, extracellular matrix degradation, and the upregulation of proteolytic pathways [<xref rid="b5-ad-16-3-1691" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. These factors act synergistically, leading to the persistent expansion of the abdominal aorta. Inflammation is the initiator of the formation of AAA and is involved in the entire progression of the AAA. Studies have shown that inflammation is the initiator of the formation and is involved through the whole progression of AAA. The roles of inflammation mediated by macrophages in the formation and progression of AAA up to rupture has been widely documented [<xref rid="b6-ad-16-3-1691" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Macrophages are classified into two subsets as classically activated macrophages (M1-like) and alternatively activated macrophages (M2-like), which play a crucial role in resolving the initial inflammatory phase. Typically, M1 cells exert a proinflammatory effect and promote matrix degeneration, whereas M2 cells contribute to the resolution of inflammation and alleviate tissue remodeling [<xref rid="b7-ad-16-3-1691" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Emerging evidence has indicated that the regulation of differently polarized macrophages in situ may be a potential approach to modulate inflammation and AAA formation [<xref rid="b8-ad-16-3-1691" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Macrophage polarization plays an important role in the progression of AAA, and would provide a potent therapeutic target for AAA treatment [<xref rid="b9-ad-16-3-1691" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Although macrophage polarization has been involved in the progression of AAA, the mechanisms of macrophage polarization have not been clearly defined.</p><p>Activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), a key factor in the unfolded protein response and the integrated stress response, belongs to the basic leucine zipper transcription factor family. As previously reported, ATF4 is a stress-inducible gene that is upregulated in a variety of diseases, including cardiac, pulmonary, and neoplastic diseases [<xref rid="b10-ad-16-3-1691" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>-<xref rid="b12-ad-16-3-1691" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], as well as acute vascular injury [<xref rid="b13-ad-16-3-1691" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. ATF4 has been reported to be associated with cardiovascular disease. ATF4 plays a critical role in the heart failure under conditions of hemodynamic stress by regulating the cytosolic and mitochondrial production of NADPH [<xref rid="b10-ad-16-3-1691" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. ATF4 plays a multifaceted role in the development of pathologies where ATF4 controls many cellular signaling pathways, such as autophagy, oxidative stress, and inflammatory response [<xref rid="b14-ad-16-3-1691" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. However, the function of ATF4 in AAA remains largely uncharacterized. We hypothesized that ATF4 may participate in AAA.</p><p>In the current study, we demonstrated the effect of ATF4 on the pathogenesis of AAA and explored its underlying molecular mechanisms using human pathological specimens, mice experimental AAA models and cellular models. Based on the experimental data, we identified the novel mechanism of ATF4-mediated macrophage polarization and inflammation in the pathogenesis of AAA development, which would provide a potential therapeutic target for the prevention and treatment of AAA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Human Aortic Tissue Samples</title><p>Aortic aneurysm surgical specimens were obtained from patients with AAA undergoing open surgical repair at Beijing Anzhen Hospital, Capital Medical University. Adjacent non-aneurysmal aortic segments were excised from the same patients as controls. According to the 2018 Society of Vascular Surgery Practice Guidelines, patients with low surgical risk or acceptable fusiform AAA &#x02265;5.5 cm accepted elective repair. All experiments using human samples in this study were approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of the Beijing Anzhen Hospital, Capital Medical University, and were conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki principles. All participants gave written informed consent [<xref rid="b15-ad-16-3-1691" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Human specimens were fixed in 10% formalin, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned at 5-&#x003bc;m thickness (n=6 per group).</p></sec><sec><title>Animal Model</title><p>Animal experiments were conducted following approval from the Ethics Committee of Capital Medical University and strictly adhering to the guidelines in the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. All experiments involving animals were carried out in the SPF Animal Laboratory of Beijing Anzhen Hospital. All mice used in the experiments were bred under specific pathogen-free conditions at the animal facilities of Beijing Anzhen Hospital. The mice were housed under standard conditions with a 12-hour light and 12-hour dark cycle.</p><p>In this study, only male mice were used because of the lower incidence of AAA in female mice compared to male mice, as reported in several mouse models [<xref rid="b16-ad-16-3-1691" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Male ApoE-/- mice were purchased from Beijing Huafukang Biotechnology (Beijing, China). ATF4 flox/flox (ATF4<sup>fl/fl</sup>) mice (C57BL/6J background) were acquired from Cyagen Biosciences (Cyagen Biosciences, Guangzhou, China). Macrophage-specific ATF4 knockout mice (ATF4<sup>Lyz2KO</sup>) were generated by crossing ATF4<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice with Lyz2 -Cre transgenic mice. Lyz2 -Cre mice were from the Viewsolid Biotech. Mousetail genomic DNA was amplified by PCR for genotyping. The in vivo experiment was divided into three parts.</p><p>In the first part of our study, ApoE -/-mice (male, aged 8-10 w) were randomly divided into the Saline (n = 6) group and Ang II (n = 6) group. The saline group received a continuous subcutaneous infusion of saline, whereas the Ang II group were administered a continuous subcutaneous infusion of Ang II (1000 ng/kg per min) through an osmotic pump (Alzet MODEL 1007D; DURECT, Cupertino, CA) for a period of 28 days. Mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of a 1% sodium pentobarbital, followed by the implantation of mini pumps. During the 28-day Ang II infusion, any dead mice that were autopsyied to determine if the cause of death was related to aneurysm complications. AAA tissue and healthy aorta tissue were collected to determine the expression of ATF4 and subsequent RNA-seq analysis.</p><p>In the second part of the study, to explore the role of ATF4 during the occurrence and development of AAAs. ATF4-knockdown mice were generated by injection with an adeno-associated virus serotype-9 (AAV-9) encoding a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) specifically targeting mouse ATF4. ATF4-overexpression mice were generated by injection with an AAV-9 encoding recombinant ATF4. The target sequence of mouse ATF4 shRNA was as follows: 5&#x02018;-GCTGCTTACATTACTCTAATC-3&#x02019;. AAV9 carrying this sequence (AAV-sh-ATF4), or the scramble control (AAV-control) was generated by Shanghai Genechem Co. Ltd. The mouse ATF4 complementary DNA (cDNA) (NM_009716.3) was cloned into the pAAV-C-FLAG-WPRE plasmid. AAV9 carrying the plasmid (AAV-ATF4) or the scramble control (AAV-control) was also generated by the Shanghai Genechem Co. Ltd. The recombinant AAV vectors were injected intravenously into mice via the mouse tail vein (2.14 &#x000d7; 10<sup>11</sup> vg/body).</p><p>Two weeks after AAV transfection, ApoE<sup>-/-</sup> male mice (8 weeks of age) were divided into four groups: Saline+AAV-control (n = 6), AngII+AAV-control (n = 20), AngII+AAV-sh-ATF4 (AngII+sh-ATF4, n = 15), and AngII+AAV-ATF4 (AngII+oe-ATF4, n = 15). As previously described, mice in all groups were injected with Saline or AngII pumps for 28 days.</p><p>In the third part of the study, 8-week-old male ATF4<sup>Lyz2KO</sup> mice and littermate controls (ATF4<sup>fl/fl</sup>) were used for the experiments. Mice divided into four groups: ATF4<sup>fl/fl</sup> +Saline (n=6), ATF4<sup>Lyz2KO</sup> +Saline (n=6), ATF4<sup>fl/fl</sup> +AngII (n=15) and ATF4<sup>Lyz2KO</sup>+AngII (n=15). AngII-induced AAA facilitated by transduction of an AAV (sero-type 8) carrying a gain-of-function mutation of the mouse PCSK9 (AAV-mPCSK9 D377Y, GeneChem) in mice was performed following previous studies [<xref rid="b17-ad-16-3-1691" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In brief, mice were intravenously injected with 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>11</sup> vector genomes of AAV-mPCSK9 D377Y and transitioned to a high-fat, high-cholesterol (HFHC) diet (Research Diets, D12108C) to induce hypercholesterolemia. Two weeks after AAV injection, the mice underwent subcutaneous injection of AngII and continued on the HFHC diet for an additional 4 weeks.</p><p>All mice were executed after intraperitoneal injection of 1% sodium pentobarbital, and their aortic tissues and plasm were collected for further analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)</title><p>The levels of mouse interleukin-1 (IL-1&#x003b2;), IL-6, and Tumor Necrosis Factor &#x003b1; (TNF-&#x003b1;) were measured via ELISA kits (RX203063M, RX203049M, RX202412M, Ruixin BIO, China). The tests were carried out according to the instructions for product use.</p></sec><sec><title>Measurement of Systolic Blood Pressure in Mice</title><p>Systolic blood pressure in awake mice was monitored weekly using a noninvasive tail-cuff system (BP-98A; Softron, Tokyo, Japan), starting 1 w before AngII infusion and continuing throughout the study. The measurements were performed once a week from 9 to 11 am in a quiet room. A preliminary cycle of 10 cycles was performed to allow the mice to adapt to the inflatable cuff before measurements were started. Three consecutive blood pressure measurements were taken in each mouse and averaged.</p></sec><sec><title>Quantification of AAA</title><p>Mice were anesthetized with 1% isoflurane and scanned by a high-resolution micro-ultrasound system (Vevo2100; Toronto, Canada) using M-mode with a 30 MHz sensor. The diameter of the artery was measured by color Doppler examination as described previously [<xref rid="b18-ad-16-3-1691" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Abdominal aortic aneurysm is defined as an increase in diameter to 1.5 times that of the normal aorta. In addition, in the AAA mouse model, any stripping resulting in intramural haematoma (even if the actual dilatation is only 1.1 times that of the normal aorta) should be taken into account [<xref rid="b19-ad-16-3-1691" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Histopathology and immunohistochemistry</title><p>Tissues were cut into 5-&#x003bc;m sections on a microtome.

After three washes using the same buffer, the sections were then incubated with Alexa Fluor 555-conjugated rat antibodies and Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated antigenically recovered and blocked antibodies aga for 2 hours at room temperature. Following the incubation period, the sections were washed, and fluorescent images were taken using a Nikon TS2-S-SM microscope equipped with a Nikon DS-Qi2 camera.</p></sec><sec><title>Western blot</title><p>Tissues and cells were homogenized in an ice-cold suspension buffer supplemented with a proteinase inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich). Protein extraction was carried out using a kit containing protease inhibitors and a protein phosphatase inhibitor cocktail. The protein concentrations were determined using a BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Subsequently, equal samples were loaded, separated, and transferred to a membrane (Pierce; Thermo Fisher Scientific). Following membrane transfer, the membranes were blocked, incubated overnight at 4&#x000b0;C with the primary antibodies: rabbit anti-ATF4 antibody (1:1000, CST), rabbit anti-SMPD3 antibody (1:1000, Santa), mouse anti-MMP-9 (1:1000, Proteintech), rabbit anti-iNOS (1:1000, Proteintech) or rabbit anti-CD38 (1:1000, Proteintech). GAPDH was the internal reference (1:1000; CST). Then, the membranes were washed with Tris-buffered saline containing Tween 20, and then incubated with secondary antibodies (1:10000 dilution; CST) for 1 hour at room temperature. Blots were then washed, incubated with SuperSignal&#x02122; WestFemto Maximum Sensitivity Substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and analyzed using a ChemiDoc&#x02122; Touch Imaging System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA).

Aortas were collected for RNA extraction. The total RNA of mouse aorta tissue was extracted by TRIzol method (Invitrogen). The mRNA was reverse transcribed into double strand cDNA fragments. Library construction was performed by Illumina's TruSeq RNA Library Prep Kit per manufacturer's protocol (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Final library quality control was performed by DNA High Sensitivity Qubit Kit (Invitrogen), the Bioanalyzer High Sensitivity Chip Kit (Agilent), and the qPCR machine (Agilent). qPCR was performed via Illumina Universal Library Quantification Kit (KAPA Biosystems). RNA libraries were then sequenced at 10pM on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 to generate 100 bp pair-end reads. After adaptor-removing and quality control filtering, the clean reads were mapped to mouse genome (Mm9) using Tophat2 (v2.0.9). Cufflink (v2.0.0) was used to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between samples. Significant DEGs of each pairwise comparison was selected (p value&#x0003c;0.05). Pathway analysis, predominantly based on the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database, was employed to determine the significant functions and pathways of DEGs.</p></sec><sec><title>Cell Culture conditions and treatments</title><p>RAW 264.7 cells were obtained from the Shanghai Xinyu Biotech co., Ltd.

Kaplan&#x003b1;Meier curves showed that Ang II infusion led to the decreased survival compared with the Saline+AAV-control group, whereas ATF4 knockdown increased survival compared with the AngII+AAV-control group, and ATF4 overexpression had no effect on survival (100%, 75%, 93% and 80%, <xref rid="F2-ad-16-3-1691" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>).

</p><p>AAA is considered as a chronic inflammatory vascular disease, as growing evidence suggests that a variety of inflammatory cells and factors play critical roles in the development of AAA [<xref rid="b24-ad-16-3-1691" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Macrophage recruitment and M1 polarization contribute to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokine, and are early events in the progression of AAA [<xref rid="b17-ad-16-3-1691" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Thus, blocking macrophage aggregation and M1 polarization may potentially reverse the vascular remodeling of AAA [<xref rid="b25-ad-16-3-1691" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Macrophage polarization is regulated by several transcriptional factors [<xref rid="b26-ad-16-3-1691" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF5) is thought to be involved in the polarization of macrophage in response to inflammation and high expression is associated with M1 macrophage [<xref rid="b27-ad-16-3-1691" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Our studies demonstrated that ATF4 aggravated the inflammatory response and promoted macrophage M1 polarization in mice with AAA. To further explore the role of ATF4 in macrophage of AAA, we constructed macrophage-specific ATF4 knockout mice using cre-loxP gene targeting. Our results suggested that macrophage-specific knockout of ATF4 attenuated the development of AAA. Macrophage-specific ATF4 knockout reduces macrophage M1 polarization and inflammation in AngII-induced AAA of mice. In RAW 264.7 cells, we found that overexpression of ATF4 polarized macrophage to M1.</p><p>ATF4 plays a crucial regulatory role in the inflammatory process, but there is no consensus on whether ATF4 promotes or inhibits inflammation. Recent studies have demonstrated that downregulation of ATF4 attenuates the endoplasmic reticulum stress-mediated neuroinflammation in mice model of Alzheimer's disease [<xref rid="b28-ad-16-3-1691" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Downregulation of ATF4 ameliorated retinal inflammation in a mouse model of diabetes [<xref rid="b29-ad-16-3-1691" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The ATF4-mediated histone deacetylase HDAC1 promotes the progression of acute pancreatitis [<xref rid="b14-ad-16-3-1691" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Although most studies show that ATF4 has a pro-inflammatory effect, some studies also found that ATF4 has anti-inflammatory properties, which may be related to the disease models. A study indicated that the expression of ATF4 was decreased in inflamed intestinal mucosa of patients with active inflammatory bowel diseases, and overexpression of ATF4 down-regulated inflammatory factors including IL-1&#x003b2; and IL-6, while deprivation of ATF4 promotes intestinal inflammation [<xref rid="b30-ad-16-3-1691" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In this study, we demonstrated that ATF4 aggravated inflammation and increased the expressions of pro-inflammatory factors IL-6, IL-1&#x003b2;, and MCP-1 in AngII-induced AAA of ApoE-/- mice.</p><p>Many transcription factors have been found to participate in aberrant genes modulation in AAA. Recent studies have shown that TCF7L1 (transcription factor 7-like 1) reduces the transcriptional activity of SRF and promotes the phenotypic transformation of VSMC, which aggravates the formation of abdominal aortic aneurysm [<xref rid="b31-ad-16-3-1691" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In aortic dissection, activation of HIF-1&#x003b1; promoted the proinflammatory response and disruption of elastic fibers by increasing the expression of the HIF-1&#x003b1; target gene Adam17 [<xref rid="b32-ad-16-3-1691" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. To better understand the crucial role of ATF4 in AAA formation, we elucidated mechanism by using the CHIP-seq, RNA-seq and CHIP assay. we demonstrated that ATF4 interacted with SMPD3 target gene. As an important factor involved in macrophage polarization and inflammatory response, SMPD3 plays important roles in cardiovascular diseases, such as atherosclerosis [<xref rid="b22-ad-16-3-1691" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="b23-ad-16-3-1691" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="b33-ad-16-3-1691" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], which is an important risk factor for AAA. Our results further revealed that ATF4 induced M1 polarization by regulating SMPD3 transcriptions through western blot analysis and rescue experiments. In RAW 264.7 cells, we found that overexpression of ATF4 polarized macrophage to M1. After SMPD3 inhibitor GW4869 treatment, the M1 macrophage polarization was reversed.</p><p>

</p><p>Current studies have shown the three classic methods for constructing AAA models are subcutaneous infusion of AngII, pancreatic elastase infusion and CaCl<sub>2</sub> incubation [<xref rid="b34-ad-16-3-1691" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In this study we choose AngII-induced AAA model, the most typical and generally accepted animal model of AAA, which could mimic most of the features of the human AAA [<xref rid="b35-ad-16-3-1691" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In the part of the study to observe the role of macrophage-specific knockout ATF4 in AAA, we used PCSK9 in combination with AngII to induce the ATF4<sup>flox/flox</sup> mice and the ATF4<sup>LyZ2KO</sup> to establish AAA model. Tail vein injection of PCSK9-D377Y AAV8 and western diet feeding induced hyperlipidaemia in C57 mice mimiced the hyperlipidaemic features of ApoE<sup>-/-</sup> [<xref rid="b36-ad-16-3-1691" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p><p>Our study has several limitations. First, we used only full ATF4 knockout and overexpression mice to characterize the role of ATF4 in promoting AAA, rather than mice from the global knockout model, which could provide clearer evidence of causality. Second, we used only male mice because of the high success and reproducibility of this model. However, certain cardiovascular characteristics, such as blood pressure, serum lipid and vascular endothelial function, are different in mice of different sexes. Third, the relationship between SMPD3 and ATF4 could have been further examined in vivo model.</p><p>Taken together, our study provides evidence to support that ATF4 mediates macrophage M1 polarization by regulating the expression of target gene SMPD3, leading to the increase inflammatory responses, which further promotes the formation and development of AAA. These findings suggest ATF4 could be an emerging and potential therapeutic target for AAA.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The National Natural Science Foundation of China is gratefully acknowledged.</p><p>This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 91439127 and 81970224), National Key Research and Development Program of China (Grant Nos. 2021YFC2500600 and 2021YFC2500603), Beijing Municipal Health Commission (2021-7;2021-1854)</p></ack><sec sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data Availability Statement</title><p>The data sets generated during and/or analysed during the current study are not publicly available for privacy reasons, but are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.</p></sec><sec sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflict of Interest</title><p>The authors declare no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Author contributions</title><p>HHY and YWQ performed study concept and design; HHY, XLJ, QWL, FL, YW, XQG, LJH and XCS carried out experiments, provided acquisition, analysis and interpretation the data, and statistical analysis; ZYD, LYL, CWH, YHD and DC provided technical and material support; HHY and YWQ drafted and revised the manuscript; YWQ provided review and revision of the paper.
