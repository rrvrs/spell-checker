Since little is known about the molecular characteristics of currently circulating FIPV strains in Long Island, New York, samples from two shelter cats submitted to the Pathology Diagnostic Services of the Long Island University College of Veterinary Medicine, with gross and microscopic lesions consistent with those of FIP were processed for virus isolation, molecular characterization and full-length genome decoding. The younger shelter cat, a 1-year-old male (A15) was found dead without previous signs of illness. Postmortem examination revealed gross and microscopic lesions characterized by vasculitis, necrosis, hemorrhage, and pyogranulomatous inflammation confined to the colon and associated lymph nodes. The second cat, a 7-year-old spayed female (A37) had an identical clinical history and similar but widespread lesions, including fibrinous peritoneal effusion, cecal, colonic, renal, and hepatic involvement. The gross and microscopic diagnosis of FIP in these cats was confirmed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) demonstration of feline coronavirus antigen using mouse anti-FIPV3-70 monoclonal antibody. Virus isolation from saved frozen kidney and colon tissue was performed through several subsequent blind passages in MDCK and Vero cell lines. Confirmation of the FIPV isolation was done through qRT-PCR, IFA, western blot using N protein antibodies, and NGS of the full-length genome sequencing. The full-length genome sequences of the virus isolate from the two cats were decoded using next-generation sequencing (NGS) and deposited in the GenBank as accession numbers PQ192636 and PQ202302. The genome size of these isolates was (29355 and 29321) nucleotides (nt) in length, respectively. While their genome organization was consistent with other FIPV genomes as follows (5&#x02019;UTR-ORF1ab-S-3abc-M-E-7b-3&#x02019;UTR-3&#x02019;), marked differential mutations were observed in the ORF1a/b, S, 3Abc, and 7b protein genes of the two FIPV isolates. One notable deletion of 34 nucleotides was observed in the 7b genes of one of these isolates but was absent in the other. We confirmed the potential recombination events during the evolution of those two FIPV field isolates with the potential parent virus as FECoV-US isolated in 1970 and the potential minor parent as the Canine coronavirus. Our results provide a comprehensive molecular analysis of two novel FIPV isolates causing fatal disease in shelter cats from Long Island. Diagnostic surveillance with molecular characterization and sequencing analysis of circulating FIPV strains within animal shelters may help early detect unique emerging clinical and pathological manifestations of the disease and develop more targeted prophylactic and therapeutic approaches to control it.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>feline coronavirus</kwd><kwd>FCoV</kwd><kwd>feline infectious peritonitis</kwd><kwd>FIPV</kwd><kwd>histopathology</kwd><kwd>IHC</kwd><kwd>isolation</kwd><kwd>qRT-PCR</kwd><kwd>IFA</kwd><kwd>next generation sequencing (NGS)</kwd><kwd>phylogenetic analysis</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>Long Island University</funding-source><award-id>36524</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>This study was funded by a seed grant (PI: MGH) from Long Island University (Grant no: 36524).</funding-statement></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-viruses-17-00209"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>The feline coronavirus (FCoV) belongs to the order <italic toggle="yes">Nidovirales</italic>, family <italic toggle="yes">coronaviridae</italic>, and genus Alphacoronavirus-1 [<xref rid="B1-viruses-17-00209" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The viral genome consists of a single molecule of single-strand RNA ranging from 29 to 30 kilobases in size. The viral genome has a typical coronavirus genome, including two untranslated regions flanking the entire genome at the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; end, respectively. The ORF1ab occupies the 5&#x02032; two-thirds of the genome with a ribosomal frameshifting in between. The viral protease further processes this long ORF1ab into several non-structural proteins (NSP-1-NSP16). The major structural proteins reside at the 3&#x02032; end of the genome and are interspersed by some non-structural proteins. There are five non-structural proteins (3a&#x02013;3c, 7a, and 7b). The FCoV is classified into two major serotypes (I and II) based on their spike glycoprotein sequences and serum neutralization assays [<xref rid="B2-viruses-17-00209" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The pathogenesis and emergence of the FIPV in cats is complex and still not yet well established. The currently accepted theory is that about 10 % of cats infected with FCoV may develop FIPV clinical diseases [<xref rid="B3-viruses-17-00209" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] when the virus is subjected to several mutations across the viral genome in the body of infected cats, particularly in some key regions of the spike glycoprotein and some other accessory proteins such as the 3C and 7b nonstructural proteins [<xref rid="B4-viruses-17-00209" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-viruses-17-00209" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>There are three possible outcomes of FCoV infection in cats. (1) Some cats can shed the virus for a very short time or never shed the virus. (2) Some cats may shed the virus in their body secretions and excretions for 2&#x02013;3 months, stop shedding it, or intermittently shed it (70&#x02013;80% of the affected cat population). (3) Some cats (10&#x02013;15%) become long-term shedders [<xref rid="B6-viruses-17-00209" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. FIPV mainly infects young cats less than two years old (55&#x02013;67%), and susceptibility to infection decreases progressively with age [<xref rid="B7-viruses-17-00209" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Kittens in highly dense populations are most likely to get infected with FCoV during their first two weeks, primarily by the fecal&#x02013;oral route [<xref rid="B2-viruses-17-00209" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. A more recent study reported cross-species transmission of the serotype-1 FCoV between the wild and domestic cat populations in the USA [<xref rid="B8-viruses-17-00209" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The main tissue tropism of FCoV is towards the cells of the enteric mucosa, infecting cells starting from the lower sections of the small intestine to the cecum [<xref rid="B9-viruses-17-00209" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-viruses-17-00209" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. This contrasts with FIPV, which mainly targets monocytes and macrophages, which are cells that replicate the virus and play an essential role in viral molecular pathogenesis and lesion development [<xref rid="B11-viruses-17-00209" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. With the exception of monocytes, leucocytes do not seem susceptible to FIPV infection. However, they have a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of endothelial damage in small veins, leading to phlebitis and peri-phlebitis, the hallmark microscopic lesions of FIPV infection [<xref rid="B6-viruses-17-00209" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B12-viruses-17-00209" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>FCoV infection usually flourishes in a crowded cat population, particularly in shelters. Although FCoV and FIPV are closely related in their genomic composition despite some reported mutations and recombination, they manifest in two different clinical syndromes in the affected cats. The FCoV serotype-I is the most prevalent among the cat population. Only 7&#x02013;14% of the FCoV-infected cats would develop the FIPV syndrome [<xref rid="B2-viruses-17-00209" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Some studies showed that 20&#x02013;60% of the tested domestic cats seroconverted to FIPV and that in shelter cats, the seroconversion rate can be as high as 90% [<xref rid="B10-viruses-17-00209" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. There are three possible outcomes of FCoV infection in cats. (1) Some cats can shed the virus for a very short time or never shed the virus. (2) Some cats may shed the virus in their body secretions and excretions for 2&#x02013;3 months, stop shedding it, or intermittently shed it (70&#x02013;80% of the affected cat population). (3) Some cats (10&#x02013;15%) become long-term shedders [<xref rid="B6-viruses-17-00209" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. FIPV mainly infects young cats less than two years old (55&#x02013;67%), and susceptibility to infection decreases progressively with age [<xref rid="B7-viruses-17-00209" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Kittens in highly dense populations are most likely to get infected with FCoV during their first two weeks, primarily by the fecal&#x02013;oral route [<xref rid="B2-viruses-17-00209" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. FCoV infection is often subclinical or associated with a mild transient intestinal infection. In contrast, FIPV is much more lethal due to the often-severe vasculitis leading to body cavity effusions and widespread fibrinous and pyogranulomatous serosal and parenchymal lesions in multiple organs [<xref rid="B13-viruses-17-00209" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, the definitive differential diagnosis of FIP from FCoV infection is challenging under field conditions since it requires careful assessment of the suspected cats&#x02019; history, clinical signs, and hematological and biochemistry profiles [<xref rid="B6-viruses-17-00209" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B12-viruses-17-00209" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. This situation makes FIPV disease surveillance, particularly serosurveillance studies, very difficult. One FIPV study in the USA in 2013 compared the viral genome sequence of one isolate after several blind passages in cell culture [<xref rid="B14-viruses-17-00209" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. This study showed that subsequent cell culture passages resulted in mutations in the viral genome, particularly involving the S, 3A, 3C, 7a, and 7b genes [<xref rid="B14-viruses-17-00209" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Little is known about the actual prevalence of FIPV in the USA&#x02019;s feline population or the possible clinical implications associated with spontaneous mutations of the virus. The main objectives of this study were to perform isolation and comprehensive characterization of some field isolates of FIPV currently circulating in the Long Island shelter-cat population, decode their full-length genome sequencing, and compare it with the USA and worldwide FIPV and FCoV sequences available in the GenBank.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-viruses-17-00209"><title>2.

Sample Collection from Some Suspected FIPV-Infected Feral Cats</title><p>During the period from January to April 2024, frozen tissue specimens from two deceased shelter feral cats (A15 and A37), necropsied at the Long Island University College of Veterinary Medicine and with gross and microscopic lesions highly suggestive of FIP, were processed for virus isolation. Frozen liver, kidney, and colon samples from each animal were divided into two: one was kept at (&#x02212;80 &#x000b0;C) for further molecular testing, and the other was kept in 10% buffered formalin for immunohistochemistry (IHC) examination, as described below. The FIPV reference strain (79-1146, accession No. AY994055) was obtained from BEI Resources (National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIH/NIAID) supported program managed by ATCC, Cat. No. NR-43287) and was used as a positive control throughout the study.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-viruses-17-00209"><title>2.2. Processing of the Collected Tissue Specimens for Histopathology and IHC Examination</title><p>At necropsy, selected tissue samples were preserved in 10% buffered formalin, later trimmed, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE), as previously described [<xref rid="B15-viruses-17-00209" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Deparaffinized tissue sections were processed for IHC using the CoV-N protein antibodies FCoV-nucleocapsid (FCoV-N) and mouse anti-FCoV monoclonal antibody (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA; Clone: FIPV3-70, Cat. # MA1-82189), as previously described [<xref rid="B16-viruses-17-00209" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].

Processing of the Collected Feline Specimens for Molecular Analysis</title><p>Tissue specimens from each cat were pooled as one sample, and a 10% tissue suspension was prepared from each tissue pool. Briefly, one gram of the pooled tissue specimens was finely chopped and homogenized using 1.5 mm beads (Merck, Kenilworth, New Jersey, USA; Lot. No. 3110) and PBS containing 1% penicillin/streptomycin cocktail (Gibco, Brooklyn, NY, USA; Lot. No. 2321161) with BeadBug6 microtube homogenizer (Benchmark, New York, NY, USA). The supernatants were centrifuged and passed through 0.45 um filters (Cytiva, Marlborough, MA, USA; Lot. No. 18008685). The purified filtered tissue suspensions were stored at (&#x02212;80 &#x000b0;C) for further analysis.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot4-viruses-17-00209"><title>2.4. In Vitro Propagation and Isolation of the New FIPV Field Isolates Using Cell Lines</title><p>Each purified filtered sample was incubated independently with the Thermo Scientific Pierce TPCK Trypsin (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA; Ref. No. 20233), diluted in plain DMEM medium, and then incubated at (37 &#x000b0;C) for 30 min with gentle rocking every 10 min. Three cell lines were used to isolate and propagate these two new FIPV field isolates. The Madine&#x02013;Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) and the Vero cells were inoculated with the purified samples, prepared as above, from the organs of each cat for 1 h at 37 &#x000b0;C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. The infected cells were incubated with a complete medium. The complete medium for MDCK and Vero cells is composed of EMEM (ATCC; 30-2003), supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) (Gibco; Lot. No. 2565838RP) and 1% streptomycin and penicillin antibiotics. Infected cells were observed daily under the inverted microscope for five days or until cytopathic effects (CPE) were observed. The FIPV-79-1146 reference strain was used to control the propagation and isolation of the FIPV field isolates using MDCK and Vero cell lines.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot5-viruses-17-00209"><title>2.5. Isolation of the FIP-RNAs and the Confirmation of the Viral Identity by the Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR)</title><p>The viral RNAs were extracted from the processed tissue specimens, as previously described [<xref rid="B17-viruses-17-00209" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The total RNAs were isolated using TRIzol LS Reagent (Invitrogen; Ref # 10296010), as per the kit&#x02019;s instructions. The extracted viral RNAs were converted into complementary DNA (cDNA) using the high-capacity reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA, Lot. No. 2902953s).

There were no clinical signs of illness; this cat was found dead in his cage. Significant gross and microscopic necropsy findings were confined to the descending colon and colonic and mesenteric lymph nodes. The affected colon was diffusely dilated, with a thickened (edematous) wall and a dark red (hemorrhagic) serosal surface (<xref rid="viruses-17-00209-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A). The affected colon contained only a small amount of pale tan pasty enteric contents and a few poorly defined areas of reddening throughout the mucosa. Colonic and mesenteric lymph nodes were mottled pale tan, moist, and moderately to markedly enlarged. Microscopically, lesions in the colon were characterized by prominent submucosal edema and multiple foci of hemorrhage and pyogranulomatous inflammatory cell infiltration, often centered around variably sized venules (<xref rid="viruses-17-00209-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>B). Fibrin deposition combined with variable amounts of cellular and nuclear debris, degenerate neutrophils, and macrophages were often present within and around the wall of venules at the center of the inflammatory foci (<xref rid="viruses-17-00209-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>C).

Fibrin deposition was scattered throughout the abdominal organs, omentum, mesentery, and parietal peritoneum. The liver was diffusely pale, and the quadrate, right medial, and right lateral liver lobes were fused by the presence of fibrin, entrapping the gall bladder (<xref rid="viruses-17-00209-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>A), which appeared distended and filled with partially inspissated bile. A few small, slightly elevated, pale tan foci, which extended into the underlying parenchyma, were observed along the superficial cortical blood vessels of the kidney (<xref rid="viruses-17-00209-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>B).

The full-length genome of the FIPV-A15 isolate was 29,355 nucleotides in length and had a GC content of 38.1%. The FIPV-A37 full-length genome was 29,320 nucleotides with a GC content of 38.1%. The Gene-1 predominantly resides at the 5&#x02032; region of the genome and comprises two large open reading frames (ORFs), ORF1a and ORF1b, flanked with a ribosomal frameshift in between (<xref rid="viruses-17-00209-f010" ref-type="fig">Figure 10</xref>A). This ORF1a/b encodes 16 non-structural proteins (NSPs) (<xref rid="viruses-17-00209-f010" ref-type="fig">Figure 10</xref>B). ORF1a encodes 11 NSPs, while ORF1b encodes 5 NSPs.

The type-I FCoV includes the FCoV from The Netherlands, USA, Taiwan, Thailand, Japan, Brazil, and Belgium, isolated between 1993 and 2021 (<xref rid="viruses-17-00209-f011" ref-type="fig">Figure 11</xref>D).

Results of the Pairwise Homology of Novel FIPV Isolates with Coronaviruses from the Alpha Group</title><p>Comparative pairwise nucleotide sequence alignment of the FIPV-A15 was performed against FIPV-A37 (from this study) reference strains from type-II and type-I FCoV groups, CCoV, PRCV, and TGEV. The FIPV-A15 complete genome exhibited 99.84% similarity with FIPV-A37. Therefore, the FIPV-A15 isolate was used as a reference for further comparisons. The complete genome of FIPV-A15 showed high similarity (97.1&#x02013;99.9%) with type-II FCoV reference isolates but significantly lower similarity (82.5&#x02013;85.8%) with type-I FCoV isolates (<xref rid="viruses-17-00209-f012" ref-type="fig">Figure 12</xref>). When compared with other coronaviruses, the complete genome of FIPV-A15 isolates shared 84.13% nucleotide identity with CCoV, 81.73% with PRCV, and 83.69% with TGEV (<xref rid="viruses-17-00209-f012" ref-type="fig">Figure 12</xref>). The spike gene analysis revealed that FIPV-A15 shared over 99% similarity with isolates from the type-II FCoV group, whereas it demonstrated a lower identity range of 56&#x02013;58% with isolates from the type-I FCoV group. The spike gene of FIPV-A15 also displayed 82.47% similarity with CCoV, 88.95% with PRCV, and 83.16% with TGEV (<xref rid="viruses-17-00209-f012" ref-type="fig">Figure 12</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot13-viruses-17-00209"><title>3.13.

Discussion</title><p>The multiple sequence alignment was conducted using the (PRCV ISU-1, TGEV-Purdue P115, CCoV NTU336/F/2008, FECoV, and 28 other FIPV and FCoV isolates), and included the A15 and A37 isolates reported in this study. Based on the phylogenetic analysis, these newly filed isolates were clustered with the FECoV type-I and type-II, respectively. The full-length genome sequences of the new FIPV-A15 isolated from a young cat with a severe but localized manifestation of FIPV infection clustered with the type-I FCoV. The FIPV-37, isolated from a middle-aged cat with multisystemic involvement, clustered with the type-II FCoV group.</p><p>The non-structural protein (NSP) 2 has hydrophobic residues that are predicted to help in binding the viral replication complex in the Golgi apparatus and inhibit the phosphorylation of eIF-2alpha, thereby inhibiting the host protein synthesis [<xref rid="B26-viruses-17-00209" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Therefore, any alteration in the NSP2 sequences may influence the pathogenicity of the FIPV isolates. Previous studies showed that the FIPV WSU 79-1146 isolate (passages 1, 8, and 50) showed minimal nucleotide variations across the viral genome sequences, but the NSP2 protein sequences showed three changes that are continuously showing up across these subsequent passages of the virus in cell culture [<xref rid="B14-viruses-17-00209" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In the current study, we reported two nucleotide mutations at positions 796 and 1918 in the NSP2 region of the FIPV-A15 and only one mutation at position 796 in the FIPV-A37 compared to the reference strain (FIPV 79-1146).</p><p>The marked alteration in virulence and tissue tropism between FECoV and FIPV is related to some acquired mutations within the C-terminal domains of the FIPV-spike glycoproteins [<xref rid="B11-viruses-17-00209" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Three distinct forms of FIPV infections were reported in the affected cats. The wet, the effusive (more prevalent), and the mixed forms [<xref rid="B27-viruses-17-00209" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The most notable difference between the FECoV and FIPV on the genomic level is the frequency of mutations across the spike glycoprotein and the structural proteins (3a&#x02013;c and 7a/b). Some studies reported frequent mutations in the 3C protein of the FIPV genome compared to that of the FECoV [<xref rid="B28-viruses-17-00209" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B29-viruses-17-00209" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Other studies suggested some potential roles of the 3C protein in enteric tissue tropism but which are not essential for the systemic spread of FECoV and FIPV infections [<xref rid="B30-viruses-17-00209" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Moreover, mutations that led to the frameshift in the 3C protein may impact the viral tissue tropism and virulence [<xref rid="B30-viruses-17-00209" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. It has been reported that the 3C protein of the FCoV is a membrane-spanning protein that shares a similar topology with the SARS-CoV-3A protein [<xref rid="B31-viruses-17-00209" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. A previous study showed that the mutation at F35L of FIPV 79-1146 of the NSP-3C was consistent in several passages, which resulted in the truncation of the NSP-3C protein with 165 aa short [<xref rid="B14-viruses-17-00209" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Our results showing the NSP-3C of the FIPV-A15 and the FIPV-A37 showed similarity with FIPV 79-1146, except for one nucleotide substitution of C to T at position 25795 (<xref rid="viruses-17-00209-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>The NSP-7a and NSP-7b are expressed and considered specific to the members of the Alphacoronavirus, while they are absent in Betacoronaviruses and Gammacoronavirus [<xref rid="B32-viruses-17-00209" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. One recent study correlated some mutations in the 7b protein with the development of FIPV in FECoV-infected Persian cats [<xref rid="B33-viruses-17-00209" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Some studies correlated deletions in the 7b gene with the FIPV adaptability to the cell culture and with the loss of virulence in vitro; however, other studies contradict this notion regarding the impacts of 7b mutations on the FCoV [<xref rid="B34-viruses-17-00209" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. A study reported truncation of the 7b protein in the FIPV WSU 79-1146 at tissue culture passage 50 and the subsequent passages [<xref rid="B14-viruses-17-00209" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Another study reported some reduction in the virulence of the FIPV-WSU 79-1146 at passage 100 and correlated this reduction with the adaptation to cell culture at higher passages [<xref rid="B35-viruses-17-00209" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. We identified only one substitution, A384G, in the FIPV-A15 7b compared to the FIPV 79-1146. Notably, FIPV-A37 sequences exhibited 34 nucleotide deletions spanning the region (351&#x02013;384) in the 7b gene, resulting in a truncated protein (<xref rid="viruses-17-00209-f013" ref-type="fig">Figure 13</xref>). A previous study found an absence of the NSP 7 of the TGEV, which shares 72% homology with FIPV-7a, enhanced apoptosis, and led to the translational shutdown [<xref rid="B36-viruses-17-00209" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. These results suggest that FIPV-37 may be an older isolate of 79-1146, which could explain the differential virulence pattern of the FIPV-A37 isolate compared to the FIPV-A15 and the FIPV 79-1146 reference strain, as observed in this study.</p><p>Interestingly, two notable mutations within the spike glycoprotein (M1058L and S1060A) were used to distinguish the FIPV from the FECoV infection in cats [<xref rid="B37-viruses-17-00209" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The same study suggests the potential involvement of these mutations in fine-tuning the FIPV tropism and its adaptability to the monocytes and macrophages to enhance viral virulence and pathology [<xref rid="B37-viruses-17-00209" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The potential role of the M1058L mutation as a genetic marker for systemic FCoV infection in cats has been proposed [<xref rid="B38-viruses-17-00209" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Another study concluded that the M1058L mutation in the spike glycoprotein sequences is a genetic marker that could distinguish between FCoV and FIPV infection in cats [<xref rid="B30-viruses-17-00209" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In contrast, the multiple sequence alignment of the S gene of the FIPV 79-1146 of the A15 and A37 sequences showed the presence of aspartic acid (D) at position 1058 instead of methionine (M) or leucine (L). Furthermore, we identified two substitutions in the S gene of the FIPV-A15 compared to the FIPV 79-1146. The first substitution, T2535C, is a synonymous mutation. The second substitution, T3998C, was observed in the S gene of both the FIPV-A15 and the FIPV-A37, resulting in a phenylalanine (F) to serine (S) change at position 1333 (F1333S). Furthermore, a G1923T substitution in the S gene of the FIPV-A37 changed lysine (K) to asparagine (N) at position 641 (K641N). Most coronaviruses continue to alter their genetic materials to evade the host immune response and counteract the effects of antiviral therapies or vaccines.</p><p>There are several biological significances of the ongoing mutations across the FIPV genome sequences. The impacts of these mutations mainly depend on the type of these mutations and the target protein. Mutations across the FIPV-S glycoprotein, particularly within the receptor binding domains, will impact the ability of the virus to bind to the target host receptors, such as the aminopeptidase N (APN) [<xref rid="B35-viruses-17-00209" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Meanwhile, alteration in the FIPV-S protein sequences may also contribute to the immune evasion of the affected host, which may affect the tissue tropism and virulence of the newly mutated viruses [<xref rid="B39-viruses-17-00209" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Furthermore, alteration in the FIPV-NSP3 may also contribute to the viral immune evasion and alteration in the tissue tropism and immune response of the affected cats [<xref rid="B13-viruses-17-00209" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. On the other hand, mutations in some key proteins, such as the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), may contribute to the viral resistance to some new antiviral therapies, such as the remdesivir or GS-441524 compound [<xref rid="B13-viruses-17-00209" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Further studies are required to understand the molecular evolution of the new FIPV isolates. Monitoring the FIPV at the genomic level is highly encouraged to monitor the emergence of any virulent strains that may result in new clinical and pathologic manifestations of the disease. This continuous molecular surveillance system will also help to update the currently used diagnostic assays and develop novel antiviral therapies and vaccines against FIPV infection in cats.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec5-viruses-17-00209"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>We reported the full-length genome sequences of two newly filed isolates of the FIPV from feral shelter cats in Long Island, NY. We established the genome structure and organization of these two isolates. The phylogenetic analysis based on the full-length genome sequencing of those two isolates and the sequences of the S and NSP-7b confirm the classification of these two isolates to be clustered with the group II-FCoV along with the other FIPV isolates. Our results confirm the dynamic changes in the FIPV on the genomic level; thus, continuous vigilant monitoring of the virus on the genomic level is highly encouraged.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The FIPV (Catalog No. NR-43287) was used as a positive control reference strain and the MDCK cell line (Catalog No. NR-2628) was obtained from the BEI resources.
