Then some people indicated that the latter should be interpreted more broadly. So far, jurisprudence has interpreted health threats only in relation to physical health, currently &#x02013; cases classified as mental health threats are included.</p></sec><sec id="sec6331"><title>Objectives</title><p>
The aim of this paper is first to analyze different aspects of this phenomenon: clinical, philosophical, including ethical and legal. The second goal is to point out the best actions for psychiatrists.</p></sec><sec id="sec6332"><title>Methods</title><p>The methodology of this paper corresponds to the pastoral paradigm: diagnosis, reflection, action. At first, the arguments of opponents and proponents of the concept of psychiatric premises for abortion were extracted. Then they were assessed from a logical and essential point of view. Finally, some conclusions and guides were included to enable psychiatrists to act appropriately, including ethical, clinical and legal aspects.</p></sec><sec id="sec6333"><title>Results</title><p>
Statements and letters from various institutions and societies were analyzed, including the Presidium of the Supreme Medical Council, Polish Pediatrics Society, the Expert Team on Bioethics of the Polish Bishops&#x02019; Conference, the Bioethics Committee of the Polish Academy of Sciences, Patient&#x02019;s Rights Ombudsman, Commissioner for Human Rights. The key arguments for psychiatric premises are presented in the Table 1.<table-wrap position="anchor" id="tab22"><label>

There would be a danger of associating psychiatry as a tool for performing abortions, which would perpetuate the phenomenon of stigmatization &#x02013; of both doctors and patients. Each of the arguments for this has been negated.</p></sec><sec id="sec6334"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This problem illustrates an attempt to replace the paradigm of traditional personalistic ethics with utilitarianism. The concept of psychiatric premises for abortion is contrary to the principles of double effect and proportionality.&#x000a0;It is also against the Polish Code of Medical Ethics: art. 39 and art. 54.</p></sec><sec id="sec6335"><title>Disclosure of Interest</title><p>None Declared</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="2"/></counts></article-meta></front></article>
