This study examines the seasonal variation in accelerometer-assessed PA among children and adolescents with VI during four distinct segments of the school day: physical education (PE) class, recess, lunchtime, and one-hour club time.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>Participants and methods</title><p>A total of 63 children and adolescents aged 7 to 17&#x0202f;years from a specialized VI school in eastern China participated in the study. PA was measured using ActiGraph&#x000ae; accelerometers during winter and summer in 2022&#x02013;2023 academic year. A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to compare the effects of seasonal variation on the time spent on moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) by children and adolescents with VI across the four segments of the school day. Additionally, linear mixed models were conducted to estimate seasonal variation in MVPA proportions.</p></sec><sec id="sec3"><title>Results</title><p>The results revealed that children and adolescents with VI engaged in a higher level of MVPA during winter compared to summer. Across both seasons, primary students exhibited significantly higher cumulative MVPA than secondary students during four school day segments. PE classes were found to constitute the highest percentage of MVPA. Furthermore, the proportion of time spent in MVPA during winter was higher than in summer during recess and lunchtime. Gender differences were also noted, with boys exhibiting higher levels of MVPA than girls during recess and PE time. Additionally, grade-level differences were identified during recess, PE, and lunchtime.</p></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The findings suggest that seasonal factors should be considered when designing physical activity programs for children and adolescents with VI. In particular, more PE classes should be provided and strategies should be adopted to increase MVPA levels during recess and lunchtime in both seasons, which may help children and adolescents with VI to meet the internationally recommended PA standards. Future research should explore the underlying factors influencing seasonal variations in PA among this population and develop targeted interventions to promote MVPA engagement.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>seasonal variations</kwd><kwd>children and adolescents</kwd><kwd>visual impairment</kwd><kwd>moderate-to-vigorous physical activity</kwd><kwd>school day</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>The author(s) declare that financial support was received for the research and/or publication of this article.

Due to its great importance for development and health, PA of children and adolescents has become a key issue in research over the last decade (<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). However, the continued decline in PA levels among children and adolescents has caused concerns in many countries, in particular among those with disabilities (<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). The World Health Organization (WHO)'s Global Action Plan on Physical Activity 2018&#x02013;2030 explicitly highlights that promoting PA among people with disabilities is a critical objective for achieving universal health coverage (<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>).</p><p>Participation in PA is crucial for the healthy development of physical fitness and the overall wellbeing of children and adolescents, including those with disabilities (<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). PA can provide multiple benefits for children with visual impairments (VI) (<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Unfortunately, Children and adolescents with VI have fewer opportunities to engage in PA compared to their peers without disabilities (<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Studies have reported that children and adolescents with VI are less physically active than those with typical vision (<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), and they are known to be at higher risk of an inactive lifestyle, which may lead to a higher prevalence of overweight and obesity compared to typically developing peers (<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). To enhance physical fitness and overall health in this group, WHO recommends all children and adolescents achieve at least 60&#x0202f;min of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) daily. However, research indicates that most children and adolescents with VI do not meet this recommendation (<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). As a country with a large population, China is confronted with a significant challenge regarding visual disabilities. According to the latest statistics from the China Disabled Persons&#x02019; Federation, there are approximately 17 million individuals with visual disabilities in China, among whom around 181,000 are children and adolescents (<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Therefore, increasing the PA levels and decreasing the sedentary time (ST) of youths with visual impairments is important and urgent (<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>).</p><p>MVPA is defined as activity with an intensity equivalent to 3&#x02013;8.7 metabolic equivalents (<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Children and adolescents who participate in MVPA are more likely to maintain these healthy habits into adulthood (<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). MVPA is an essential component of health interventions. Several studies have demonstrated that children and adolescents with VI tend to spend less time in MVPA and more time in sedentary behavior (<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20&#x02013;22</xref>), because various environmental barriers may prevent children and adolescents with disabilities from participating in adequate levels of MVPA (<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Recently, researchers have highlighted that surrounding environmental factors, for example, seasonal variation, which can play an important role in influencing PA and sedentary time of children (<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Seasonal factors including weather, temperature, and daylight hours, can significantly affecting PA levels of children and adolescents, particularly among children and adolescents with disabilities. For example, extreme temperatures, strong winds, rain, and snow are all likely to reduce children&#x02019;s PA levels. Some studies have reported the lowest PA levels in winter (<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>), while others have found the lowest PA intensity in summer and the highest in winter (<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). These inconsistent findings highlight the need for a comprehensive study of seasonal variations in PA among children and adolescents with VI. Because seasonal meteorological factors cannot be avoided, identifying the effects of seasonal characteristics on PA and sedentary behavior is crucial for developing public health interventions aimed at promoting PA and reducing sedentary time in schools (<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Unfortunately, limited studies have objectively measured PA among children and adolescents with VI. Specifically, there is a lack of data on seasonal variation in MVPA among children and adolescents with VI in China.</p><p>Socioecological models have clearly indicated that the PA of children and adolescents with VI is greatly affected by multiple factors, including individual, family, community, and cultural factors (<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Among these, schools are the major settings for children and adolescents with VI to accumulate their MVPA time, as they provide opportunities such as physical education (PE) class, lunchtime, recess, and extracurricular activities (<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). A further understanding of how children and adolescents with VI accumulate PA during the entire school day is essential for developing effective school-based PA promotion programs. Previous studies have primarily focused on assessing PA levels of children and adolescents with disabilities during different segments of the school day (<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). However, limited research has specifically examined the PA levels of children and adolescents with VI. Additionally, some demographic characteristics, such as gender and age, have been widely reported to affect the segmented PA participation of children and adolescents without disabilities (<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Whether these factors affect the segmented PA of children and adolescents with VI remains unknown. Further studies are needed to explore these factors of PA among children and adolescents with VI. Therefore, this present study examines the seasonal variation in accelerometer-assessed PA among children and adolescents with VI during four distinct segments of the school day, which is important for schools and education departments to create and implement effective comprehensive school PA promotion programs.</p></sec><sec id="sec6"><label>2</label><title>Participants and methods</title><sec id="sec7"><label>2.1</label><title>Participants</title><p>Participants were recruited in 2022&#x02013;2023 from a VI school in Jiangsu Province in east China.

If the data were normally distributed, a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to compare the time spent in MVPA during the entire school day and across four distinct segments, with season, gender, and grade included as factors. Additionally, linear mixed models were used to evaluate the impact of season, gender, and grade on MVPA proportions with participants as random effects. In these models, MVPA% during recess, PE lessons, lunchtime, and club time were each separately treated as dependent variable. The models were adjusted for potential confounding factors, including disability level, BMI and total wearing time. If the data were not normally distributed, the Friedman test was used to increase the robustness of the results. All statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> software version 25.0 (IBM Corp, Armonk, USA), and a significance level of 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec10"><label>3</label><title>Results</title><sec id="sec11"><label>3.1</label><title>MVPA% overall and during the four segments of the school day in both seasons</title><p>The participants wore the accelerometers at school from 08:00 to 17:30, thereby constituting a total of 570&#x0202f;min per day during winter and summer.

This is one of few investigations to examine the seasonal variation in the accelerometer-assessed MVPA among children and adolescents with VI. This study also described and compared the duration of MVPA of children and adolescents with VI during different segments of the school day in Chinese school in winter and summer. The findings provide valuable insights into how PE and recess can influence the MVPA of children with VI in special school settings.</p><p>Our study identified a distinct seasonal variation in the MVPA levels of children and adolescents with VI, with objectively measured MVPA being significantly lower during summer compared to winter across the four segments of the school day. This finding is consistent with previous research on typically developing children, which also reported reduced MVPA levels during summer (<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Similarly, a study of special schools in Hong Kong that included children and adolescents with VI demonstrated that children with various disabilities are generally more active at school in winter than in summer (<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). One reason for this may be related to the local hot and humid summer climate, as humid and sultry weather leads to the reduction of MVPA for children with VI. The school considered in the present study is located in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, and experiences a typical hot and humid summer climate in June.</p><p>It appears that hot and humid weather has a greater influence on the MVPA of children with VI, as high temperatures and humidity can exacerbate physiological strain and discomfort, making physical activities less appealing. This explanation is supported by the findings of Wallenber et al. (<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>), who revealed that hot weather conditions could have negative impacts on the thermal comfort and physical activity of vulnerable groups such as children. Another possible reason is that children and adolescents with VI wear more clothing to make them feel safer when engaging in PA during winter, because additional layers can offer better protection from falls or collisions due to limited vision from a logical perspective. Regardless of the season, PE class was identified as the highest percentage of MVPA, followed by one-hour club time, while recess time constituted the lowest percentage of MVPA. This finding is not consistent with the results of some previous studies, which found that children engaged in a greater proportion of MVPA during recess than during PE lessons (<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). This discrepancy may be attributed to variations in the organization and structure of PE and recess activities across different countries and educational settings. However, a recent survey of schools for the blind in western China further supported that structured PE classes had a higher percentage of MVPA time than recess, lunchtime, and after-school periods during the school day (<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). In that study, the participants with VI were found to engage in significantly more MVPA time on PE days than on non-PE days. During PE time, children and adolescents were closely supervised by teachers who provided guidance and skills on how to engage in exercises safely, which probably made children and adolescents feel comfortable and thereby increased their time spent in MVPA. These findings underline the critical role of teacher in structured PE classes in promoting MVPA among children and adolescents with VI. Given the importance of PE classes as a primary opportunity for MVPA, targeted interventions during structured PE classes are highly recommended, and well-trained adapted PE teachers are essentially indispensable. Therefore, it is both necessary and crucial to add PE classes in schools for children and adolescents with VI. Future efforts should focus on increasing the quantity and quality of PE classes to enhance their MVPA levels.</p><p>The present study reveal no significant seasonal differences in the percentage of MVPA during PE classes. This finding may be attributed to the structured nature of adapted physical education programs in primary and secondary schools. These programs were characterized by a formalized teaching syllabus and prescribed content, as well as specific intensity requirements for in-class exercises. The consistency in MVPA% across seasons was a result of these structured lesson elements, which ensured that PA levels remain stable regardless of seasonal variations. In contrast, seasonal differences were found in MVPA% during recess and lunchtime. Specifically, we observed the higher MVPA levels during lunchtime and recess in winter compared to summer. This may be attributed to the low temperature in winter, and children and adolescents may engage in more PA to keep warm. Conversely, the temperature during lunchtime is higher in summer, and children and adolescents are more willing to do light activities or rest quietly, which may lead to reduced MVPA%. In addition, activities during lunchtime and class breaks are independent activities, making them highly susceptible to external influences such as weather conditions and personal preferences. Although there are 100&#x0202f;min of school break time and 80&#x0202f;min of school lunchtime, the accumulated MVPA during these periods is relatively low, particularly in summer. Interestingly, a previous study reported that children with VI accumulated more MVPA during recess, and this resulted from teachers in the VI school having organized many orientation and mobility activities focused on developing the functional skills and gross motor tasks of children and adolescents, including walking (<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). These findings suggest that programs should be actively developed to promote PA during breaks, and more opportunities should be provided for children and adolescents with VI to improve their MVPA.</p><p>To date, limited studies have examined seasonal variation in PA of children and adolescents across different age subgroups. Overall, the PA levels of children and adolescents generally decline with age (<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). Consistent with this trend, in the present study found MVPA levels decline as children and adolescents progressed from primary to secondary school, with primary school students exhibiting significantly higher MVPA% compared to secondary school students during recess, PE classes and lunchtime. In contrast, older adolescents may be less influenced by seasonal changes, possibly due to greater independence and more varied activity preferences. In an addition, the transition to secondary school is often accompanied by increased academic demands and longer school hours in China, which can reduce the time available for MVPA. In both seasons, gender difference was observed in the MVPA% during recess and PE class, and this finding is similar to a previous systematic review (<xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>), which found that boys spent significantly more time in MVPA compared to girls. These findings highlight the need for targeted interventions to promote MVPA among girls, particularly in school settings. Additionally, the results demonstrate that the PA of primary school students, especially boys, are more easily influenced by seasonal factors (such as temperature and humidity). This highlights the necessity for schools to incorporate seasonal considerations into their PA arrangements, especially during recess and lunchtime. Seasonal sports can be appropriately arranged to improve the MVPA level of primary school students in summer. Previous studies have reported students with VI can achieve comparable PA levels to their sighted peers when provided with equal opportunities for regular physical activity (<xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). Therefore, VI schools should not only provide a curriculum with high expectations but also create opportunities and incentives to engage in PA via physical education and seasonal extracurricular sports. This intervention has the potential not only to enhance physical health outcomes but also to improve holistic well-being among children and adolescents with VI.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec15"><label>5</label><title>Conclusion</title><p>The present research on the seasonal variation of MVPA among children and adolescents with VI in China revealed that the levels of MVPA were higher during winter than in summer, particularly during recess and lunchtime. The MVPA of boys and primary school students was found to be more susceptible to seasonal influences. The seasonality of MVPA among children and adolescents with VI can be influenced by relevant background factors, such as gender, time segments, PE curriculum, weather, and temperature. Collectively, these factors offer insights for developing targeted interventions to promote MVPA among children and adolescents with VI across different seasons.</p></sec><sec id="sec16"><label>6</label><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>The strengths of the study included the use of objective measures to assess PA. Linear mixed models were employed to account for addressing potential within-group correlations among disability level, gender, grade, BMI and total wearing time during different school segments. However, some limitations should be noted. Firstly, assessments were completed only during two seasons, and future studies should include multiple seasons to provide a more comprehensive understanding. Secondly, the children and adolescents who volunteered for this study may have been those who were more physically active than the nonparticipating counterparts. Thirdly, participants were recruited from only one school in east China, and it is possible that these findings are not representative of schools located throughout China. Further studies are needed from other areas of China to identify potential variable differences due to geographical, climatic, or cultural disparities. Furthermore, more research investigating the associations between contextual factors and PA in children and adolescents with VI is needed. Future studies should determine how such variables may influence activity levels in different seasons, thereby providing valuable insights into the development of targeted, season-specific interventions to promote MVPA among children and adolescents with VI.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank all children and adolescents with VI and teachers for their participation.</p></ack><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="sec17"><title>Data availability statement</title><p>The raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will be made available by the authors, without undue reservation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="ethics-statement" id="sec18"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>The studies involving humans were approved by the Human Medical Ethics Committee of Nanjing Sport Institute.
