This research aimed to identify new therapeutic targets to combat anthrax. We performed assays to assess cell viability, apoptosis, glycogen consumption, and compound uptake and release in hepatocytes and cardiomyocytes responding to anthrax toxins. Microarray analysis was carried out to identify the genes potentially involved in toxin-induced toxicity. Knockdown experiments were performed to validate the contributions of the identified genes. Our study showed that anthrax edema toxin (EdTx) and lethal toxin (LeTx) induced lethal damage in mouse liver and heart, respectively. Microarray assays showed that 218 genes were potentially involved in EdTx-mediated toxicity, and 18 genes were potentially associated with LeTx-mediated toxicity. Among these genes, the knockdown of <italic toggle="yes">Rgs1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Hcar2</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Fosl2</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Hcar2</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Cxcl2</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">Cxcl3</italic> protected primary hepatocytes from EdTx-induced cytotoxicity. Plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1)-encoding <italic toggle="yes">Serpine1</italic> constituted the most significantly upregulated gene in response to LeTx treatment in mouse liver. PAI-1 knockout mouse models had a higher tolerance to LeTx compared with wild-type counterparts, suggesting that PAI-1 is essential for LeTx-induced toxicity and might represent a therapeutic target in LeTx-induced tissue damage.

Introduction</title><p>Anthrax represents a disease resulting from infection by <italic toggle="yes">Bacillus anthracis</italic>, posing a serious threat to human life [<xref rid="B1-toxins-17-00054" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-toxins-17-00054" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-toxins-17-00054" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. <italic toggle="yes">B. anthracis</italic>, or its spore, is a potential bioterrorism agent [<xref rid="B4-toxins-17-00054" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-toxins-17-00054" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Anthrax foci can infect animals and humans with adequate quantities of virulent spores in the soil even after a long time [<xref rid="B6-toxins-17-00054" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Although some antibiotics have been used to treat patients with anthrax by directly killing <italic toggle="yes">B. anthracis</italic>, the outcomes remain poor, because anthrax toxins alter the functions of multiple organs and cause septic shock and death in the host [<xref rid="B7-toxins-17-00054" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Furthermore, the estimated mortalities of cutaneous, gastrointestinal, inhalational, and injectional anthrax are 1%, from 25 to 60%, 46%, and 33%, respectively, according to the outbreaks of <italic toggle="yes">Bacillus anthracis</italic> infection [<xref rid="B8-toxins-17-00054" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Therefore, it is urgently required to identify new therapeutic targets to combat anthrax-toxin-induced organ damage.</p><p><italic toggle="yes">B. anthracis</italic> gains virulence through a three-component protein exotoxin comprising protective antigen (PA), edema factor (EF), and lethal factor (LF) [<xref rid="B7-toxins-17-00054" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B9-toxins-17-00054" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. EF and LF are individually non-toxic, but are toxic in combination with PA to form two A/B toxins, edema toxin (EdTx, EF + PA) and lethal toxin (LeTx, LF + PA), causing different pathogenic responses in cultured cells and animals. In these two toxins, the A components, EF and LF, have enzymatic activities. EF in EdTx constitutes a calmodulin-dependent adenylate cyclase elevating intracellular cAMP levels, leading to subcutaneous edema and fluid accumulation in organs [<xref rid="B7-toxins-17-00054" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B10-toxins-17-00054" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. LF in LeTx represents a zinc-dependent metalloprotease that specifically cleaves the N-terminal end of many mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases such as MAPKK or MEK [<xref rid="B11-toxins-17-00054" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-toxins-17-00054" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-toxins-17-00054" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-toxins-17-00054" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. These disrupted pathways are critical for cell proliferation, cell cycle regulation, and immune function. The B component, PA, binds to anthrax toxin receptors on cells, including tumor endothelium marker 8 (TEM8) and capillary morphogenesis protein 2 (CMG2) [<xref rid="B15-toxins-17-00054" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Therefore, anthrax toxins exert a wide range of toxic effects by increasing intracellular cAMP and/or the cleavage of MEKs. Although the signaling pathways involved in anthrax-toxin-induced organ damage have been extensively investigated [<xref rid="B16-toxins-17-00054" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-toxins-17-00054" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-toxins-17-00054" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], its underlying mechanisms and downstream targets are poorly understood.</p><p>Liu et al. reported that anthrax toxins selectively induce damage in distinct cell types. EdTx mainly targets the liver and induces unique liver edema that does not occur in other organs. Meanwhile, LeTx targets cardiomyocytes and vascular smooth muscle cells, leading to LeTx-induced mortality [<xref rid="B19-toxins-17-00054" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In this study, we focused on the effects of anthrax toxins on the cellular functions and signaling pathways in mouse liver and heart, using cell culture and animal experiments. Potential target genes involved in anthrax-toxin-induced cell and organ damage were identified using bioinformatics methods. Small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated gene silencing and a knockout mouse model were utilized to investigate potential protective strategies against anthrax toxins.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec2-toxins-17-00054"><title>2. Results</title><sec id="sec2dot1-toxins-17-00054"><title>2.1. EdTx Rapidly Impairs Liver Function in A/J Mice</title><p>The A/J strain of mice is widely used in anthrax vaccine research due to its immune response to recombinant protective antigens [<xref rid="B20-toxins-17-00054" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. To examine the impact of EdTx on liver function in vivo, A/J mice were administered with 20 or 40 &#x003bc;g EdTx, and blood and tissue samples were collected at different time points (<xref rid="toxins-17-00054-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A). We found that the A/J mice were extremely vulnerable to EdTx and showed symptoms starting 30&#x02013;60 min after injection. Mice receiving 20 or 40 &#x003bc;g EdTx started to die within 40 h and 30 h after injection, respectively (<xref rid="toxins-17-00054-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>B). Considering the relatively long survival time in response to 20 &#x003bc;g EdTx versus 40 &#x003bc;g EdTx, we used 20 &#x003bc;g EdTx in the following experiments.</p><p>To evaluate the liver function of A/J mice challenged with EdTx, we monitored their circulating and hepatic cAMP levels. As shown in <xref rid="toxins-17-00054-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>C, compared with those in PBS-injected mice, the cAMP levels in the EdTx-injected mice rapidly increased after injection, peaked at 6 h (3636.8 pmol/mL vs. 3.2 pmol/mL in serum, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01; 780.8 pmol/mL vs. 52.7 pmol/mL in the liver, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01), and gradually decreased after that, but still remained significantly higher than those in the control mice until death. Similarly, the level of blood glucose rapidly increased after EdTx injection, peaked at 3 h (419.4 mg/dL vs. 89.4 mg/dL in control, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01), quickly declined to control values (85.7 mg/dL) at nearly 9 h, and further declined until death (<xref rid="toxins-17-00054-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>D).</p><p>To further evaluate the effects of EdTx on liver function, we analyzed blood chemistry at 18 h after the EdTx challenge. As shown in <xref rid="app1-toxins-17-00054" ref-type="app">Supplementary Table S1</xref>, the blood levels of liver function indicators, including aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and creatine kinase (CK), were significantly higher in the EdTx-challenged mice than those in the control mice. Albumin (ALB), globulin (GLB), and total protein (TP), which are mainly synthesized in the liver, were markedly lower in the EdTx-challenged mice than those in the control mice. Moreover, the renal function indexes, e.g., blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine (CREA), phosphorous, and potassium, were significantly elevated, whereas blood calcium was notably reduced in the EdTx-treated mice. Taken together, these results suggest that EdTx challenge leads to the acute deterioration of liver function in A/J mice.</p><p>We further evaluated whether EdTx induces hepatic damage in A/J mice by performing H&#x00026;E staining in the liver tissue collected from the mice at 18 h after the challenge with 20 &#x003bc;g EdTx. As shown in <xref rid="toxins-17-00054-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>E (upper panel), the livers of the EdTx-treated mice demonstrated characteristic signs of hepatocellular necrosis, such as &#x0201c;geographic shape&#x0201d;, eosinophilia, islands around the central hepatic veins, and a thin rim of surviving hepatocytes close to the vein wall. Many of these lesions were asymmetrically distributed around the circumference of the vein. PAS staining showed dramatically decreased fuchsia staining within the livers of the EdTx-treated mice compared with those of the control mice (<xref rid="toxins-17-00054-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>E, lower panel), suggesting a decrease in liver glycogen storage in response to the EdTx challenge. This was further confirmed by glycogen assay (<xref rid="toxins-17-00054-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>F). Collectively, these results suggest that EdTx induces acute hepatic damage in vivo, leading to a deterioration in liver function in A/J mice.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-toxins-17-00054"><title>2.2. Anthrax Toxin Receptors Are Expressed in Mouse Liver and Primary Hepatocytes</title><p>Since anthrax toxin receptors are required for the entry of anthrax toxin into cells, we assessed the expression levels of the anthrax toxin receptor-encoding genes <italic toggle="yes">Tem8</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Cmg2</italic> in primary hepatocytes and mouse liver. As shown in <xref rid="app1-toxins-17-00054" ref-type="app">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>, transcripts of both <italic toggle="yes">Tem8</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Cmg2</italic> were detectable in the primary hepatocytes and liver tissue of the A/J mice. Consistently, the results of flow cytometry showed the presence of TEM8 and CMG2 proteins on the surface of primary hepatocytes (<xref rid="toxins-17-00054-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>A). These results indicate the presence of anthrax toxin receptors on hepatocytes, which provides the necessary mechanism for anthrax toxin delivery into hepatocytes.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3-toxins-17-00054"><title>2.3. EdTx Inhibits Cell Viability, Promotes Cell Apoptosis, and Induces Cytotoxicity in Primary Hepatocytes</title><p>To examine the effects of EdTx on primary hepatocytes, we determined the intracellular cAMP levels at different time points within 24 h after treatment with 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, or 4 &#x000b5;g/mL of EdTx. PBS was used as a negative control. As shown in <xref rid="toxins-17-00054-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>B, compared with that observed in control cells, the level of cAMP was dramatically increased in response to EdTx, dose-dependently, peaking at 6 h after EdTx treatment and rapidly decreasing to baseline at 24 h after EdTx treatment, regardless of the dose. An abnormal cell morphology, granulation of the cytoplasm, contraction, disconnection, and cellular debris were observed at 6 h after treatment with 4 &#x000b5;g/mL of EdTx (<xref rid="toxins-17-00054-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>C). Consistently, the MTT assay revealed that cell viability in primary hepatocytes administered with 4 &#x000b5;g/mL of EdTx for 6 h was remarkably reduced by 29% compared with those treated with PBS (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01; <xref rid="toxins-17-00054-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>D). These results indicate that EdTx quickly induces cytotoxicity in hepatocytes.</p><p>To assess whether this reduced primary hepatocyte viability was related to enhanced cell apoptosis, the mitochondrial membrane potential assay was carried out. As shown in <xref rid="toxins-17-00054-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>E, EdTx reduced red fluorescence (J-aggregates) and increased green fluorescence (J-monomers) due to the selective entry of J-monomers into the mitochondria, indicating a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential in response to EdTx treatment (<xref rid="toxins-17-00054-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>E). These results suggest that EdTx induces cell apoptosis in primary hepatocytes, resulting in the suppression of cell survival.</p><p>Hepatocytes are critical for the metabolism of numerous compounds. To further examine the effect of EdTx on liver function, we performed an indocyanine green (ICG) uptake-and-release assay. As shown in the middle panel of <xref rid="toxins-17-00054-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>F, at 2 h after treatment with PBS or 4 &#x000b5;g/mL of EdTx, approximately 84.00% of the PBS-treated cells absorbed ICG and exhibited a green-stained nucleus, whereas only 38.94% of the EdTx-treated cells had the ability to take up ICG (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01). At 24 h after treatment, the amounts of ICG-positive cells were dramatically reduced in both groups. However, the green color was more intense in the EdTx-treated cells compared with the PBS-treated cells (<xref rid="toxins-17-00054-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>F, lower panel), suggesting an impaired ability of the EdTx-treated hepatocytes to take up and release ICG. We further examined the glycogen storage capacity of the primary hepatocytes using PAS staining. As shown in <xref rid="toxins-17-00054-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>G,H, the EdTx-treated cells exhibited less storage of glycogen than the PBS-treated cells (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01). Jointly, these findings suggest that EdTx rapidly induces cytotoxicity in primary hepatocytes, leading to an impaired uptake, release, and storage of compounds.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot4-toxins-17-00054"><title>2.4. Identification of EdTx Cytotoxicity-Related Genes</title><p>To investigate the mechanism underlying EdTx-induced cytotoxicity in hepatocytes, we conducted a microarray assay to identify differentially expressed genes in response to EdTx treatment.

Discussion</title><p>Here, the effects of EdTx and LeTx on mouse liver and heart functions were examined, and we identified differentially expressed genes that are associated with the toxicity of EdTx and LeTx, providing potential therapeutic targets for anthrax treatment.</p><p>Previous studies suggested that the effect of LeTx on cardiac function remains controversial. Lawrence et al. demonstrated that LeTx administration results in a reduced heart rate, decreased mean arterial pressure, and myodegeneration/necrosis and cardiac inflammation using the rabbit model [<xref rid="B22-toxins-17-00054" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. On the other hand, Li et al. showed that EdTx, but not LeTx challenge, in Sprague-Dawley rats is associated with an impaired myocardial function [<xref rid="B23-toxins-17-00054" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Hicks et al. found that EdTx at doses of &#x02264;80% lethality rate (LD80) impairs heart function in isolated perfused rat hearts. In contrast, LeTx at a 10-fold greater LD80 dose could achieve comparable effects to EdTx [<xref rid="B24-toxins-17-00054" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Additionally, Watson et al. showed that EdTx, but not LeTx challenge, resulted in significantly increased heart rates in rats, and LeTx decreased left ventricular systolic function while EdTx decreased preload [<xref rid="B25-toxins-17-00054" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. These data indicate LeTx and EdTx may cause cardiac dysfunction through different mechanisms. However, our results showed that LeTx significantly inhibited the cell viability of primary cardiomyocytes, suggesting that LeTx may impair cardiac functions. Our results also revealed that EdTx and LeTx challenge significantly elevated the serum ALT and AST levels in rats, suggesting that EdTx and LeTx impair liver function. In addition, we observed significant renal function indicators in response to EdTx challenge, including BUN, CREA, and phosphorous, consistent with previous reports that EdTx causes kidney lesions [<xref rid="B26-toxins-17-00054" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and kidney function deterioration [<xref rid="B21-toxins-17-00054" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B27-toxins-17-00054" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>Moreover, Comer et al. identified numerous differentially expressed genes in EdTx- and LeTx-treated RAW 264.7 mouse macrophage-like cells, which are involved in inflammation, cell adhesion, immune cell activation, and transcription regulation [<xref rid="B28-toxins-17-00054" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B29-toxins-17-00054" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. This study performed microarray and protein&#x02013;protein network analyses using RNA samples isolated from anthrax=toxin-treated mouse livers to identify potential therapeutic targets against anthrax toxins. A panel of genes associated with anthrax-toxin-induced organ damage was identified and confirmed by qRT-PCR (<xref rid="toxins-17-00054-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> and <xref rid="toxins-17-00054-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). LeTx cleaves endogenous MEKs [<xref rid="B30-toxins-17-00054" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], consistent with our findings (<xref rid="app1-toxins-17-00054" ref-type="app">Figure S2</xref>). On the other hand, Chauncey et al. identified that the MAPKK signaling pathway is the most drastically affected by LeTx [<xref rid="B30-toxins-17-00054" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Our study findings suggest that the MAPK pathway plays a critical role in LeTx toxicity.</p><p>Anthrax is known to elevate the concentration of blood glucose [<xref rid="B31-toxins-17-00054" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. However, the mechanism of this is undefined. The current work showed that in EdTx-treated, but not LeTx-treated A/J mice, the blood glucose level rose immediately after EdTx treatment, peaked at 3 h, and declined after that, but remained higher than that of the control group until 9 h after EdTx treatment (<xref rid="toxins-17-00054-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). These findings suggest that the liver breaks down glycogen quickly when exposed to EdTx, as the liver is the major site of endogenous glucose production [<xref rid="B32-toxins-17-00054" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] and glycogen storage [<xref rid="B33-toxins-17-00054" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Intriguingly, the expressions of G6pc, Pck1, and Sik1 were upregulated in primary hepatocytes and livers. G6pc belongs to the glucose-6-phosphatase system. Pck1 plays an important role in gluconeogenesis and stimulates hepatic glucose production [<xref rid="B34-toxins-17-00054" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="B35-toxins-17-00054" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Both genes are involved in the LKB1&#x02013;SIK pathway regulating hepatic gluconeogenesis [<xref rid="B36-toxins-17-00054" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Therefore, EdTx may enhance gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis via the LKB1&#x02013;SIK pathway in the early stages of anthrax disease, leading to a prompt rise in blood glucose levels (<xref rid="toxins-17-00054-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p>It has been reported that EdTx causes an increase in the demand for intracellular calcium, leading to a decrease in calcium within the peripheral circulation [<xref rid="B37-toxins-17-00054" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The expression of Ramp3, which responds to altered extracellular calcium levels and contributes to calcium homeostasis, is upregulated in this process [<xref rid="B38-toxins-17-00054" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. This is consistent with our finding that Ramp3 was upregulated in EdTx-treated mouse liver (<xref rid="toxins-17-00054-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). On the other hand, EdTx consists of edema factor (EF)/adenylate cyclase, an 89-kDa protein secreted by <italic toggle="yes">B. anthracis</italic>, the Gram-positive bacterium responsible for causing anthrax. It is part of a family of bacterial toxins that increase intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels [<xref rid="B7-toxins-17-00054" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], which can potently influence the conversion of ATP to cAMP in the presence of calmodulin. Therefore, when EF is translocated into the cytosol, EF/calmodulin can increase cAMP in a dose-dependent manner. The regulators of G protein signaling (RGSs) are important regulatory proteins affecting the nucleotide-bound state of G&#x003b1; subunits, with GTPase-activating functions [<xref rid="B39-toxins-17-00054" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].

In this work, <italic toggle="yes">Rgs1</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Rgs2</italic> levels were both significantly increased by EdTx in primary hepatocytes and liver tissues (<xref rid="toxins-17-00054-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>), resulting in a dramatic increase in the cAMP level, as observed in the animal model (<xref rid="toxins-17-00054-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> and <xref rid="toxins-17-00054-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). In addition, an increased level of cAMP is associated with clinical situations that predispose to infections, and the disruption of cAMP generation is a promising therapeutic strategy against these diseases [<xref rid="B41-toxins-17-00054" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="B42-toxins-17-00054" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].

Although the knockdown of these genes showed a reduced cAMP level, extensive studies in vivo are required to evaluate these genes as gene therapy targets and develop anti-EdTx-based drugs or vaccines. We have also previously reported that the knockdown of the anthrax toxin receptor Cmg2 protects against the increase in intracellular cAMP induced by EdTx [<xref rid="B15-toxins-17-00054" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Moreover, in the present study, we found that the mechanism by which LeTx damages liver function differs from that of EdTx. High levels of PAI-1 in the liver and serum were highly implicated in LeTx-associated damage. PAI-1 represents a serine protease inhibitor (serpin) with major inhibitory effects on tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and urokinase (uPA). PAI-1 is a risk factor for thrombosis and atherosclerosis [<xref rid="B43-toxins-17-00054" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], and decreased PAI-1 amounts resulted in a reduced suppression of fibrinolysis and, conversely, enhanced fibrin degradation [<xref rid="B44-toxins-17-00054" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Previous studies have reported that PAI-1 deficiency is characterized by mild-to-moderate bleeding [<xref rid="B45-toxins-17-00054" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] and that PAI-1 deficiency starkly reduces lung fibrin accumulation and highly suppresses inflammatory events and injury, with no impact on upstream coagulation [<xref rid="B46-toxins-17-00054" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Our results showed that PAI-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice are more tolerant to LeTx than WT mice in the early stages of LeTx challenge. High hepatic PAI-1 amounts indicate that PAI-1 plays a crucial role in liver injury. Thus, PAI-1-encoding Serpine1 is a potential therapeutic target against LeTx in the early stage of infection.</p><p>There are still some limitations of our study. We elucidated that PAI-1 was one essential target in liver. However, the regulatory mechanisms of PAI-1 should be further revealed. Furthermore, PAI-1 inhibitors, including tiplaxtinin (PAI-039) and three generations of TM-related drugs (TM5001, TM5009, TM5275, TM5441, TM5509, and TM5614), have been used in clinical trials. These inhibitors have been used to study cancer, cardiovascular disease, pulmonary fibrosis renal diseases, liver diseases, and others [<xref rid="B47-toxins-17-00054" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].

EdTx consists of EF, a calmodulin-dependent adenylate cyclase that is activated by a GTP-bound G&#x003b1; subunit. The regulators of G protein signaling (RGSs) are crucial regulatory molecules that influence the nucleotide-bound state of G&#x003b1; subunits and act as GTPase-activating proteins. The G&#x003b1;&#x02013;RGS complex increases the rates of intrinsic GTP hydrolysis to GDP, then EdTx can be activated to convert intracellular ATP to cAMP, resulting in a dramatic increase in cAMP level. On the other hand, G6pc and Pck1 participate in the regulation of hepatic gluconeogenesis and the liver breaks down glycogen to produce blood glucose in a short period of time when exposed to EdTx. A high level of PAI-1 (a serpin protein), a risk factor for thrombosis and atherosclerosis in the liver and serum, is highly implicated in LeTx-induced cytotoxicity by our study.
