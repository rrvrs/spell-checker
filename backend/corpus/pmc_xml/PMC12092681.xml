Our study identifies NUSAP1, a nucleolar and spindle-associated protein, as a key driver of 5-FU resistance in gastric cancer. Proteomic analyses of 5-FU-resistant gastric cancer cell lines revealed that NUSAP1 is significantly upregulated, and functional studies demonstrated its essential role in promoting resistance, proliferation, migration, invasion, and tumor growth. Mechanistic investigations revealed that NUSAP1 undergoes asymmetric dimethylation (ADMA) at R418 and R422, mediated by PRMT1, with the R422 site being critical for its function. NUSAP1 interacts with the PEST domain of Notch2 through its R422 site, inhibiting Notch2 ubiquitination and stabilizing its expression, thereby activating the Notch2 signaling pathway. This pathway is closely linked to gastric cancer progression and chemoresistance. Inhibition of PRMT1 or mutation of the R422 site abrogated NUSAP1&#x02019;s ability to stabilize Notch2 and regulate downstream signaling. These findings unveil a novel mechanism by which NUSAP1 promotes 5-FU resistance in gastric cancer and highlight the therapeutic potential of targeting the NUSAP1-Notch2 axis or PRMT1 in overcoming chemoresistance.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Gastric cancer</kwd><kwd>Oncogenes</kwd><kwd>Predictive markers</kwd><kwd>Oncogenes</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China (National Science Foundation of China)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>82203339</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Feng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Natural Science Foundation Project of Chongqing, China (Grant No.CSTB2024NSCQ-MSX0678) Science and Technology Research Program of Chongqing Municipal Education Commission(Grant No.KJQN202402705) Wanzhou District Science and Technology Bureau, Chongqing (Grant No.wzstc-20240028)</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Natural Science Foundation Project of Chongqing, China (Grant No.CSTB2024NSCQ-MSX1201) and the Science and Technology Research Program of Chongqing Municipal Education Commission(Grant No.KJQN202402705).

The extensive plasticity of gene expression and epigenetic alterations in cancer cells contribute to the development of resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Therefore, identifying genes differentially expressed in drug-resistant cells and understanding the proteins and epigenetic modifications supporting resistance are critical steps toward developing effective strategies for preventing and targeting resistance.</p><p id="Par3">5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) is a primary chemotherapeutic agent used to treat various solid malignancies, including colorectal, gastric, pancreatic, bladder, and breast cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. 5-FU exerts its cytotoxic effects primarily by inhibiting thymidylate synthase (TS), disrupting essential biosynthetic processes, or incorporating its metabolites into RNA and DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Clinically, 5-FU is often combined with leucovorin and capecitabine to enhance therapeutic efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. However, since 5-FU primarily targets highly proliferative cancer cells, quiescent and poorly differentiated cancer stem cells (CSCs) within the tumor microenvironment (TME) can evade its effects and survive. Studies suggest that these CSCs significantly contribute to 5-FU resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Furthermore, tumor cells resistant to 5-FU exhibit upregulated expression of stem cell markers (e.g., Notch, CD44, ALDHA1, Oct4, and Sox2) and demonstrate enhanced migratory, invasive, and colony-forming capabilities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], further supporting this conclusion. Elucidating the underlying mechanisms of 5-FU resistance is therefore critical for improving clinical treatment.</p><p id="Par4">NUSAP1 (nucleolar and spindle-associated protein 1) is a nucleolar-spindle-associated protein involved in spindle microtubule organization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Subsequent studies have revealed that NUSAP1 is associated with tumor cell proliferation and metastasis. Silencing NUSAP1 expression inhibits the proliferation, migration, and invasion of colorectal and glioblastoma cells by downregulating DNMT1 or TOP2A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Additionally, NUSAP1 has been shown to regulate the BTG2/PI3K/Akt signaling pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Research has demonstrated that NUSAP1 stabilizes ATR protein expression, promoting glioblastoma proliferation and resistance to temozolomide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Furthermore, NUSAP1 suppresses ubiquitin-mediated degradation of YAP1 and ANXA2, driving gastric cancer progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Lactate-driven nuclear localization of NUSAP1 is critical for its function, as nuclear NUSAP1 recruits the JUNB-FRA1-FRA2 transcriptional complex to the DESMIN promoter, activating DESMIN transcription and promoting cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. NUSAP1 also forms a transcriptional regulatory complex with C-Myc and HIF-1&#x003b1; at the LDHA promoter, enhancing its expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. These findings underscore NUSAP1&#x02019;s dual role in gene transcription regulation and protein stability, highlighting its robust biological functions.</p><p id="Par5">In this study, we identified NUSAP1 upregulation in 5-FU-resistant cells using proteomics. Inhibition of NUSAP1 expression enhanced tumor cell sensitivity to 5-FU. We further identified multiple arginine methylation sites on NUSAP1 and demonstrated that PRMT1-mediated R422me2 modification facilitates its interaction with Notch2, stabilizing Notch2 protein expression and promoting 5-FU resistance in gastric cancer cells. Our findings provide preliminary evidence supporting NUSAP1 and its R422 methylation as potential biomarkers for predicting poor prognosis and resistance to 5-FU therapy in gastric cancer patients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Cell culture</title><p id="Par6">Gastric cancer (GC) cell lines (BGC-823 and SGC-7901) and human embryonic renal cell line HEK293FT were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Beijing, China), 5-FU-resistant GC cell lines (BGC-823-5-FU-R and SGC-7901-5-FU-R) were obtained from Meixuan Biotechnology (Shanghai, China).

Purified N2ICD protein (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6D</xref>) was used in GST pull-down assays. Surprisingly, we found that N2ICD does not directly interact with NUSAP1 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6E</xref>). N2ICD consists of four domains: the RBPj&#x003ba; association module (RAM), ankyrin repeat domain (AR), transactivation domain (TAD), and proline/glutamic acid/serine/threonine-rich motifs (PEST). Determining the specific domain involved in the NUSAP1-N2ICD interaction is crucial for understanding its functional impact. To identify the binding domain, we constructed Flag-tagged vectors for each domain (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6F</xref>). Co-IP experiments revealed that NUSAP1 specifically binds to the PEST domain of N2ICD (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6G</xref>), a finding further validated by PLA analysis (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6H</xref>).</p><p id="Par45">These results demonstrate that NUSAP1 binds to the PEST domain of N2ICD in the cytoplasm, suggesting that this interaction may mediate NUSAP1&#x02019;s involvement in the regulation of the Notch2 signaling pathway.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>NUSAP1 stabilizes Notch2 expression by binding to N2ICD through the R422 site</title><p id="Par46">Since the PEST domain stabilizes N2ICD expression, we hypothesized that NUSAP1 might regulate the stability of Notch2 protein.

To address this, we expressed NUSAP1-WT, NUSAP1-R418K, and NUSAP1-R422K in NUSAP1-silenced cells. Mutation at the R422 site failed to rescue the suppression of Notch2 signaling caused by NUSAP1 knockdown, whereas R418 mutation had no such effect (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7D</xref>). Additionally, analysis using the GEPIA2.0 database revealed a significant positive correlation between Notch2 signaling pathway activity and PRMT1 expression (Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3C</xref>). Moreover, silencing or inhibiting PRMT1, which catalyzes R422 methylation, also suppressed Notch2 signaling (Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3D</xref>). Ubiquitination assays showed that in cells expressing NUSAP1-R422K, the ubiquitination level of N2ICD remained unchanged compared to NUSAP1-silenced cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7E</xref>). Furthermore, while overexpression of NUSAP1-WT or NUSAP1-R418K extended the half-life of Notch2, NUSAP1-R422K did not (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7F, G</xref>), indicating the importance of the R422 site for NUSAP1&#x02019;s function.</p><p id="Par48">Arginine methylation influences various physiological activities, such as protein localization, stability, transcriptional activity, and binding capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. To investigate the effect of the R422 site on NUSAP1 function, we performed immunofluorescence (IF) and half-life assays.

After immunoprecipitation with anti-Flag antibody, the methylation level of NUSAP1 (R422me2) was detected in the cell lysate (supernatant) and the immunoprecipitated complex (precipitate). As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7I</xref>, the R422me2 level was significantly higher in the Flag-IP precipitate than in the supernatant, indicating that N2ICD preferentially binds R422-methylated NUSAP1. Additionally, PRMT1 knockdown or inhibition significantly reduced the interaction between N2ICD and NUSAP1 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7J</xref>). This indicates that only NUSAP1 methylated by PRMT1 can interact with proteins such as Notch2. This also explains why the interactions between NUSAP1, PRMT5, and Notch2 can be detected through IP and PLA, but not through GST pull-down assays. We also attempted to directly use the NUSAP1 R422me2-specific antibody for IP experiments. Unfortunately, while the antibody performed well in Western blotting (WB) assays, it was not effective in IP experiments (Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3I</xref>).</p><p id="Par50">In conclusion, NUSAP1 binds to N2ICD through its R422 site, inhibiting N2ICD ubiquitination and degradation, thereby stabilizing Notch2 expression.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec22" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par51">5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) has been utilized as a clinical chemotherapy agent for over 60 years, showing efficacy in treating various cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. However, the emergence of 5-FU resistance in many patients significantly diminishes its therapeutic effectiveness. Understanding the mechanisms underlying 5-FU resistance to enhance its efficacy and counteract resistance has become a major challenge in clinical oncology. Several mechanisms have been reported to contribute to 5-FU resistance, such as tumor stem cells within the tumor microenvironment (TME), which reduce the sensitivity of cancer cells to 5-FU [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].

In the cytoplasm, it interacts with substrate proteins to regulate their stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In the nucleus, NUSAP1 forms transcriptional complexes with factors such as HIF1&#x003b1; and C-Myc to regulate downstream gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. To explore the functional mechanism of NUSAP1, we identified its interacting proteins, including PRMT1, PRMT5, and Notch2 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Both PRMT1 and PRMT5, members of the protein arginine methyltransferase (PRMT) family, play crucial roles in tumor development. In the nucleus, they form transcriptional complexes with various factors, regulating gene expression. For instance, PRMT1-mediated H4R3 methylation enhances protein synthesis, promoting leukemia cell self-renewal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] and activating the EGFR signaling pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. PRMT5 also methylates H4R3, contributing to chromatin regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].

Instead, NUSAP1 may regulate the stability of PRMT1 and PRMT5, or conversely, PRMT1 and PRMT5 may methylate NUSAP1. Mass spectrometry analysis revealed arginine methylation at R418 and R422 of NUSAP1, both catalyzed by PRMT1 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Functional assays demonstrated that R422 methylation, but not R418, is critical for 5-FU resistance and cell proliferation (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>).
