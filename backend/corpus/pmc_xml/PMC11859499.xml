Statistical analysis was performed.</p></sec><sec id="sec3279"><title>Results</title><p>In the manifest group of patients, depressive episodes predominated (42.9%), including psychotic episodes (9.5%). In 28.6% of cases, organic disorders were diagnosed in the form of emotional lability, organic depression, mild cognitive impairment and delirium. In 23.8% of patients, neurotic disorders were observed in the form of depressive reactions, panic and generalized anxiety disorder. In one case (4.8%), acute polymorphic psychosis with symptoms of schizophrenia was diagnosed. The PHMD group includes affective disorders - 45.7%; organic disorders, including dementia 26.1%; schizophrenic spectrum disorders -19.6% and neurotic somatoform disorders - 8.7%. In the acute and subacute periods of COVID-19, acute psychotic states (APS) developed in both groups of patients (in 23.3% and 30.4%, respectively) in the form of delirium, psychotic depression, or polymorphic psychosis. APS were more common in PHMD patients with organic (50%) and schizophrenic spectrum disorders (33.3%) with a predominance of delirium. In the long-term period of COVID-19, PHMD patients more often than non-PHMD (60.9% and 38.1%) developed cognitive impairment (CI), especially in schizophrenia-like (77.8%) and organic (83.3%) disorders. CI developed twice as often after APS (89.5% and 39.6%, p&#x0003c;0.001), reaching the degree of dementia in 15.8% of cases. APS were significantly associated (p&#x0003c;0.05) with the development of CI (0.567733), the age of patients (0.410696) and the presence of previous cerebrovascular insufficiency (0.404916).</p></sec><sec id="sec3280"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The age-related features of the mental consequences of COVID-19 are the occurrence of APS in the acute period of infection and the deterioration of cognitive activity at a remote stage. The PHMD patients, especially with disorders of organic and schizophrenic spectrum, were found to be more vulnerable to the effects of COVID-19. In them, the occurrence of APS was a risk factor for the development of dementia, while in primary diseased, and patients with affective and neurotic&#x000a0;disorders, CI was reversible or had the character of a mild cognitive disorder.</p></sec><sec id="sec3281"><title>Disclosure of Interest</title><p>None Declared</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="2"/></counts></article-meta></front></article>
