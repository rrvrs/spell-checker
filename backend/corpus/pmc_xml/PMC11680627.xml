In decision making, the diffusion decision model (DDM) is by far the most commonly used cognitive psychometric tool. One concern when using this model is that more recent theoretical accounts of decision-making place more emphasis on neural plausibility, and thus incorporate many assumptions not found in the DDM. One such model is the Ising Decision Maker (IDM), which builds from the assumption that two pools of neurons with self-excitation and mutual inhibition receive perceptual input from external excitatory fields. In this study, we investigate whether the lack of such mechanisms in the DDM compromises its ability to measure the processes it does purport to measure. We cross-fit the DDM and IDM, and find that the conclusions of DDM would be mostly consistent with those from an analysis using a more neurally plausible model. We also show that the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Model (OUM) model, a variant of the DDM that includes the potential for leakage (or self-excitation), reaches similar conclusions to the DDM regarding the assumptions they share, while also sharing an interpretation with the IDM in terms of self-excitation (but not leakage). Since the OUM is relatively easy to fit to data, while being able to capture more neurally plausible mechanisms, we propose that it be considered an alternative cognitive psychometric tool to the DDM.</p><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.3758/s13423-024-02520-5.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Response time models</kwd><kwd>Decision making</kwd><kwd>Mathematical modelling</kwd><kwd>Model mimicry</kwd><kwd>Cognitive psychometrics</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit&#x000e4;t M&#x000fc;nchen (1024)</institution></funding-source></award-group><open-access><p>Open Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL.</p></open-access></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Psychonomic Society, Inc. 2024</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">In the field of cognition, the study of decision-making processes has been a topic of great importance. For relatively fast decisions during simple tasks, we typically use reaction time (RT) and accuracy (the probability of making a correct decision as measures of performance). Most successful models of such choice RTs and accuracy rates fall into the framework of evidence accumulation.</p><p id="Par3">Many of the models within the evidence accumulation framework are variations of the diffusion decision model (DDM; Ratcliff, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">1978</xref>; Ratcliff et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2016</xref>; Ratcliff &#x00026; Rouder, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">1998</xref>). The DDM explains the decision-making process as one of accumulating evidence over time until a decision threshold is reached and a response is made. Over the years, DDMs have been used to understand choices made across a range of paradigms, tasks, and conditions (Ratcliff, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2006</xref>; Ratcliff et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2010</xref>; Ratcliff &#x00026; McKoon, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2008</xref>; Ratcliff &#x00026; Smith, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2004</xref>).</p><p id="Par4">One of the most common uses of the DDM is that called <italic>Cognitive Psychometrics</italic>, which refers to using cognitive process models as measurement tools to analyze the cognitive processes underlying behavior (Batchelder, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1998</xref>). The parameters of most cognitive models are assumed to have some meaning or interpretation, and in cognitive psychometrics they are used as measures of such things, replacing the more standard indicators of performance like mean accuracy or mean RT. The DDM has seen extensive use as a cognitive psychometric tool because it has parameters with clear interpretations. For example, in perceptual discrimination tasks, the drift rate has been used to measure differences in sensitivity to visual stimuli among individuals (Batchelder, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1998</xref>). In tasks involving speed-accuracy manipulation, the decision threshold parameter has been employed to study the caution in the decision-making process (Ratcliff &#x00026; Rouder, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">1998</xref>). The DDM has also been applied in studies on aging and clinical populations, helping to identify cognitive changes or impairments in decision-making (Ratcliff et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2003</xref>; Wiecki et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2015</xref>). It is worth noting here that one of the main reasons for the widespread use of the DDM is that it is relatively easy to fit to behavioral data (a requirement for getting parameter estimates).</p><p id="Par5">As the years have progressed, more complex variants of the basic DDM have been proposed, such as the Racing Diffusion Model, Urgency-Gating Models, DDM with collapsing boundaries, and models that also capture confidence responses (Bogacz et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2006</xref>; Cisek et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2009</xref>; Ditterich, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2006</xref>, 2006; Drugowitsch et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2012</xref>; Ratcliff et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2016</xref>; Tillman et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2020</xref>; Van Den Berg et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2016</xref>). Many of these more complex models were introduced to account for patterns of choices and response times that are reliably seen in experiments. For example, Ratcliff and Rouder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">1998</xref>) proposed that the start-point of evidence accumulation changes from trial-to-trial to explain the observation that incorrect responses are faster than correct responses when trying to answer quickly, and vice versa when trying to be accurate.</p><p id="Par6">Our focus here is on another major reason for making decision-making models more complex, which is to introduce assumptions that are consistent with the neural and biological processes that are thought to underlie decision making. It can make sense to include such assumptions, since a complete explanation of decision making should be consistent with what we have learned from other decision-making research, even though it is sometimes unclear whether such processes have implications for the behavioral data observed in decision-making experiments. Some of the earliest decision models to focus on being neurally plausible are the spiking neural network model (Wong &#x00026; Wang, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2006</xref>) and the Leaky Competing accumulator model (Usher &#x00026; McClelland, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2001</xref>). While the spiking neural network model was built on the basis of realistic neural circuits, the Leaky Competing Accumulator model adds neurally plausible assumptions, like evidence decay and mutual inhibition, to a typical evidence-accumulation model framework.</p><p id="Par7">In what follows we will explore the Ising Decision Maker (IDM), which is a more recently proposed neurobiologically inspired model of decision-making that draws from principles in statistical physics (Verdonck &#x00026; Tuerlinckx, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2014</xref>). Verdonck and Tuerlinckx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2014</xref>) show that a biologically plausible decision process, built on self-excitative and mutually inhibitive neural populations, can be represented as a system state in a decision field, with responses being triggered when that state crosses into one of the available detection boxes. Broadly speaking, the decision process involves minimizing energy until the state of the decision system corresponds to one of the final choices. These authors approximate such a system within a more typical diffusion-like process, and show how it is related to the neurally plausible models mentioned earlier (i.e., the models in Usher &#x00026; McClelland, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2001</xref>, and Wong &#x00026; Wang, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2006</xref>).</p><p id="Par8">From a Cognitive Psychomterics perspective, there are two downsides to making our models more complex. The first is that the models can become very computationally costly, and so cannot be easily fit to data using convenient optimization algorithms (e.g., Wong &#x00026; Wang, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2006</xref>). The second issue is that in any given Cognitive Psychometrics analysis, the data will often not contain the kind of information that is necessary to constrain the estimation of the parameters of the model (Umakantha et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2022</xref>). This is especially true for something like neural plausibility, where the reasons for certain assumptions (e.g., the physical properties of neurons) may have only subtle and indirect consequences on the dependent variables that will be used to estimate the model parameters (e.g., response times and choices). These issues make such models inappropriate for Cognitive Psychometric applications, where we care about being able to estimate parameters robustly and with relative ease.</p><p id="Par9">Having to rely on easy-to-use and simple models for Cognitive Psychometrics raises a potential problem, since models that can explain the relevant neural and biological data are likely more accurate reflections of the decision-making process than those that ignore such factors. In other words, in an ideal world, our Cognitive Psychometric models would be equivalent to our best-known explanations of all the relevant phenomena (i.e., behavioral data patterns, neural plausibility, etc.). With sufficient data to constrain the parameters of our most complete models, we could be confident that we were drawing the best available inferences from a model-based analysis.</p><p id="Par10">As it is, we are faced with a tradeoff, since more neurally plausible assumptions in decision-making models will presumably make them more accurate but will often render such models useless as Cognitive Psychometric tools. This problem is a special case of the bias-variance tradeoff, and it leaves us preferring relatively simple models like the DDM when the goal is to estimate the parameters of our cognitive models (van Ravenzwaaij et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2017</xref>). However, if we are going to settle for using the simpler models, we should worry whether we might make substantially different conclusions than had we used more complex models.</p><p id="Par11">The aim of this paper was to address this issue by providing a systematic comparison between the IDM and the DDM. We seek to determine whether the increased neural plausibility in the IDM results can lead to significantly different conclusions about decision processes compared to the simplest DDM, which is just an unbiased Wiener diffusion model. To strike a balance between biological plausibility and practicality, we also consider the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Model (OUM) as a compromise (Busemeyer &#x00026; Townsend, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">1993</xref>). The OUM incorporates some neurally inspired assumptions while remaining applicable to data and readily usable for cognitive psychometrics. Through this investigation, we aim to shed light on the trade-offs between model complexity, biological plausibility, and the capacity to explain decision-making behaviors.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par12">We use the cross-fitting method using in Matzke and Wagenmakers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2009</xref>; see also Donkin et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2011</xref>) to investigate whether there is one-to-one correspondence between the core parameters of IDM and DDM and between that of IDM and OUM. Specifically, we will first simulate RT and accuracy data from one model, while allowing its core parameters to change freely, and fit those data with the other model, observing how the parameters of interest capture those manipulations. If the change of one core parameter in one model only has effect on the analogous parameter in the other model and not on the non-analogous parameters, we can conclude that there is convergent validity between the corresponding parameters in each model. However, if changes in one parameter are reflected in multiple parameters, then we may have caused to question the validity of certain analyses.

The model has an unbiased start point and assumes that none of its parameters varies across trials, unlike more complete DDM models (i.e., Ratcliff, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">1978</xref>; Ratcliff &#x00026; Rouder, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">1998</xref>; Ratcliff &#x00026; Tuerlinckx, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2002</xref>). This simple DDM has three core parameters: drift rate (v), boundary separation (a), and non-decision time (<italic>T</italic><sub><italic>er</italic></sub>). It can be represented by this stochastic differential equation: <italic>dy = v*dt + c*dW</italic>, in which <italic>y</italic> is the current value of evidence accumulation, <italic>c</italic> is the diffusion constant and <italic>W</italic> is a Wiener process (i.e., the addition of Gaussian noise). The process begins at <italic>0.5*a</italic> and terminates when <italic>y</italic> reaches either <italic>a</italic> or <italic>0</italic>, and the RT from the model is obtained by adding the non-decision time <italic>T</italic><sub><italic>er</italic></sub> to this first-passage time (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b for an example of the predicted RT distributions from the model). The evidence obtained by the DDM accumulator at each time step is proportional to the log likelihood ratio of the evidence, which corresponds to the drift rate. It can be thought of as an optimal decision maker because it implements the Neyman-Pearson procedure for the free-response paradigm (Bogacz et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2006</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Illustrations of one decision trial in each of the three decision-making models we consider.

(<bold>c</bold>) Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Model (OUM): All three parameters are the same as those in DDM, but there is another parameter called effective leakage (or self-excitation). Unlike the constant drift rate in DDM, evidence accumulation in the OUM changes according to the state of the evidence accumulation. The drift rate (<italic>v</italic>) and the effective leakage (<italic>k</italic>) are combined into the effective drift rate (<italic>v-kx</italic>), which also depends on the evidence accumulated at that time step. The arrow (in brown) showing of the effect of effective leakage in the figure only serves for illustration purpose.

The value of 0.2 indicates the proportion of correct (and incorrect) evidence that has been collected thus far, related to the proportion of neurons activated in the underlying network. The choice of value is based on previous applications of the model (Verdonck &#x00026; Tuerlinckx, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2014</xref>).

Any data set in which the choice proportion of a response was 1 was excluded, because we do not expect any individuals to exhibit perfect performance in 1,000 trials. In a similar attempt to restrict our analysis to data sets that are like what is usually done in practice, any simulated RTs greater than 3 s were excluded before any fitting was performed.

Looking first at the &#x0201c;core&#x0201d; parameters of drift rate, boundary separation, and non-decision time, we see that there is a selective and linear relationship between stimulus distinctness in IDM and drift rate in OUM, as well as for non-decision time in both models. The relationship between detection box size in the IDM and boundary separation in the OUM is mostly linear, and it is reassuring that changes in box size do not clearly map onto any other parameter of the OUM.</p><p id="Par44">In terms of the more &#x0201c;complex&#x0201d; assumptions, we also see a relationship between self-excitation in the IDM and leakage in the OUM. We see that for values of self-excitation above the internal threshold value of 51450 (see Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>), the effective leakage parameter <italic>k</italic> in OUM is negative. This result makes sense, since self-excitation values above threshold (<italic>W</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup><italic> &#x0003e; &#x00398;</italic>) and negative effective leakage (<italic>k</italic> &#x0003c; 0) both ambiguously correspond to the idea of self-excitation. It is also worth noting that for this part of the simulated data (and fits), the relationship between the IDM and OUM parameters is clear, linear, and strong (<italic>r</italic>(54) = -.89, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; .001, if we focus on only the data where <italic>k</italic> &#x0003c; 0). If we now look at values of self-excitation below threshold, we see that values of <italic>k</italic> are now positive, since both parameters now reflect effective leakage of activation. However, surprisingly, we see that the relationship between the IDM and OUM parameters practically disappears. For example, the correlation between the two parameters shrinks to -0.29 (<italic>r</italic>(46) = -.29, <italic>p</italic> = .048) if we look at simulations where k &#x0003e; 0, and what relationship there is likely carried by one unusual data point. Indeed, if we instead split the data based on whether the self-excitation parameter is above or below the internal threshold, then the correlation between parameters is only -0.01 (r(39) = -.01, p = .951) when we focus on the &#x0201c;leakage&#x0201d; simulations (i.e., where <italic>W</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup><italic> &#x0003c; &#x00398;</italic> ).</p><p id="Par45">To sum up, we find that the OUM leakage parameter corresponds to the IDM self-excitation parameter only when it reflects a self-excitation process. We return to the implications of this for cognitive psychometric applications of the OUM in the <italic>Discussion</italic> below. Finally, we see no noticeable relationship between mutual inhibition in the IDM and any of the parameters in the OUM.</p><p id="Par46">In summary, the corresponding parameters related to stimulus strength, non-decision time, and self-excitation/leakage have linear relationships between IDM and OUM. Interestingly, the relationship between boundary separation and detection box size appeared to be much clearer for the OUM and IDM than it was for the DDM. One possible reason could be that the nonlinear relationship between detection box size in the IDM and boundary separation in the DDM was due to the influence of the mutual inhibition and self-excitation parameters in the IDM. Because the OUM could account for any effect of these parameters with its own leakage (self-excitation) parameter, it seemed more selectively influenced by detection box size.</p><p id="Par47">It was perhaps surprising to see no influence of the mutual inhibition parameter on any of the parameters of the OUM. However, we found in parameter recovery studies that the IDM was unable to recover its mutual inhibition parameter (see OSM Fig. 4). As such, it may not be a property of the role of mutual inhibition in the IDM theoretical framework, but more that this parameter has no systematic influence on RT and accuracy rates.</p><p id="Par48">Finally, it is worth noting that OSM Fig. 8 shows the fit of IDM to OUM data. The IDM has six free parameters, and so the parameters are estimated rather noisily. We see a similar pattern of results that we saw when fitting IDM to DDM data, including the fact that both the diffusion coefficient and detection box size are influenced by changes in boundary separation. We also see those changes in the leakage parameter of the OUM is captured by changes in the self-excitation parameter of the IDM, but also by the diffusion coefficient. However, we again emphasize that the relationships between parameters are rather noisy, and we encourage that any attempt to use IDM in a cognitive psychometric exercise be accompanied by rigorous parameter recovery studies.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par49">This study provides preliminary evidence that the simplifying assumptions of models like the DDM and OUM do not compromise their ability to estimate their core parameters. We see the parameters in IDM that share interpretations with those in the DDM also have a similar impact on their predictions for data. More specifically, the drift rate and non-decision-time parameters in the DDM can be readily interpreted like stimulus distinctiveness and non-decision-time in the IDM. The results are a little less clear for boundary separation in the DDM and detection box size in the IDM. Though detection box size has no obvious relationship with the other DDM parameters, it has a non-linear relationship with boundary separation, and suggests that perhaps the latter is a less sensitive measure to changes in caution (for want of a better term).</p><p id="Par50">Interestingly, we found that the correspondence between OUM and IDM parameters was slightly better than between the DDM and IDM parameters. We see that the boundary separation parameter in the OUM has a more obviously linear relationship with detection box size in the IDM, and thus seems to offer a more sensitive measure of caution than in the DDM. One interesting conclusion of these results seems to be, therefore, that the OUM could be a better cognitive psychometric tool than the DDM &#x02013; at least if we assume that more neurally plausible models such as the IDM are also more accurate models of decision-making.</p><p id="Par51">Furthermore, we also see that the more complex assumption of self-excitation also shares a kind of &#x0201c;convergent validity&#x0201d; across the OUM and IDM, with the effective leakage parameter of the OUM and self-excitation parameter of the IDM having a similar influence on choices and RTs (indeed, this is foreshadowed in Figs. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b, 1d, and 1f, comparing the shapes of RT distributions across the three models). This correspondence between self-excitation and effective leakage may have an implication for how we interpret this parameter. Throughout, we have referred to the <italic>k</italic> parameter in the OUM as effective leakage, in line with its typical role as a parameter that reduces the effective drift rate, so that the RT distribution will have a longer tail (Busemeyer &#x00026; Townsend, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">1993</xref>). We have shown, however, that the effective leakage parameter in OUM has better correspondence to the self-excitation in IDM when the &#x0201c;leakage&#x0201d; parameter is negative, resulting in a &#x0201c;self-excitation&#x0201d; effect. This means that instead of a longer tail, OUM with self-excitation can accelerate the evidence accumulation, leading to an RT distribution with a shorter tail. Our results suggest a revised interpretation of the OUM&#x02019;s leakage parameter in cognitive psychometric applications of the model.</p><p id="Par52">One might worry about the fact that we used different methods for fitting the IDM (MNLE) and the DDM and OUM models (likelihood-based methods). We could have used MNLE for the DDM and OUM, but this yields noisier parameter estimates than the likelihood-based method we were able to use, because DDM and OUM have known approximations for their likelihood functions. Since we would use the best available fitting method in any cognitive psychometric analysis, we thought it more important to reflect that aspect of reality than to control for fitting method and thus worsen our ability to measure DDM and OUM parameters. Similarly, it is likely possible to improve parameter estimation for the IDM by expending more computational resources. For example, perhaps mutual inhibition could be recovered better with a better trained neural network. However, it is important to note that in any evaluation of a model for use in Cognitive Psychometrics, the model and the fitting methods be evaluated together, since one of the reasons for using the simpler models in cognitive psychometrics is the fact that the more complex models require less efficient and less ideal fitting methods.</p><p id="Par53">Our results also suggest that more work is needed to understand the impact of the more complex assumptions made by more neurally plausible decision-making models. For example, the mutual inhibition parameter in IDM is hard to recover, just like the self-excitation and inhibition parameters in the LCA (Mileti&#x00107; et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2017</xref>). Mutual inhibition can be recovered if it is the only parameter that varies, as shown in OSM Fig. 1. However, when both mutual inhibition and self-excitation are varied, then the ability to recover the parameter vanishes (see OSM Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>), suggesting that self-excitation masks the effect of mutual inhibition. Further investigation is needed to disentangle the two theoretical concepts.</p><p id="Par54">Finally, it is worth noting that the results here also only speak to just two of the ways in which decision-making models have become more neurally plausible (i.e., self-excitation and inhibition). Other work has looked at the relationship between other neurally plausible models, such as the spiking neural network model (Umakantha et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2022</xref>). Others still have proposed other theoretical mechanisms of decision making, such as urgency signals and collapsing bounds (Smith &#x00026; Ratcliff, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2022</xref>). More work is needed to determine whether such factors can impact the appropriateness of the DDM or OUM as cognitive psychometric models.</p><p id="Par55">In conclusion, this paper explores a critical issue in the realm of decision-making research, which is the balance between biological plausibility and practicality. The IDM, as a neurobiologically inspired model, aims for greater biological plausibility but as a result faces pragmatic computational challenges. The OUM is offered as a compromise between biological plausibility and practicality, seeming to offer a valid cognitive psychometric tool while also capturing one of the more neurally plausible assumptions. That said, the equivalence between the parameters of the DDM and the IDM is rather impressive given their relatively large differences in theoretical assumptions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.<supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM1"><media xlink:href="13423_2024_2520_MOESM1_ESM.docx"><caption><p>Supplementary file1 (DOCX 2.75 MB)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher's Note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Open practices statement</bold></p><p>Data are not available.
