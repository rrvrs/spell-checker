In this study, we further reveal an unrecognized characteristic of tubulin within the PSD. First, using electron microscopy, we identified an interaction between postsynaptic structures (PSDL and PSD) and polymerizing microtubules, which led to the binding of polymerizing microtubules to PSDL and PSD. In turn, this interaction induced changes in the microtubule morphology. These results support earlier findings suggesting that microtubules transiently intruding into the spine head can associate with PSDs, inducing structural changes in the PSD. Next, we observed that the structural integrity of both PSD and PSDL was compromised upon exposure to GTP and microtubule&#x02010;affecting reagents. These findings reinforce the idea that tubulin is a crucial building block of the PSD architecture. Moreover, we found that PSD aggregation was enhanced following interactions with polymerizing tubulin and was disintegrated upon treatment with GTP and microtubule&#x02010;affecting reagents. These results indicate that microtubules also play a key role in PSD aggregation in&#x000a0;vitro. Collectively, our study highlights the involvement of tubulin in the construction, function (specifically its interaction with polymerizing microtubules), and aggregation of the PSD, which may impact both physiological and pathological conditions. Furthermore, our in&#x000a0;vitro findings suggest that GTP can either destroy or induce the enlargement and reorganization of PSD structures, depending on its interaction with growing microtubules.<boxed-text position="anchor" content-type="graphic" id="jnc70085-blkfxd-0101"><graphic xlink:href="JNC-169-0-g018.jpg" position="anchor" id="jats-graphic-1"/></boxed-text>
</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical"><p>As illustrated in the graphical abstract, postsynaptic structures were incubated with GTP either in the presence or absence of polymerizing tubulin. These conditions led to distinct outcomes: structural destruction in the absence of tubulin, and enlargement or reorganization in its presence. These findings suggest that the postsynaptic density (PSD) is inherently dynamic, constantly balancing between disassembly and reconstruction. This balance appears to be modulated by the presence of polymerizing microtubules (MTs) and GTP. We propose a model in which GTP plays a central role in the maintenance and remodeling of PSD normal structure and aggregation.<boxed-text position="anchor" content-type="graphic" id="jnc70085-blkfxd-0001"><graphic xlink:href="JNC-169-0-g009.jpg" position="anchor" id="jats-graphic-3"/></boxed-text>

The molecular mechanisms underlying actin dynamics in spine changes have been well&#x02010;established (Bosch et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="jnc70085-bib-0003" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Sekino et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="jnc70085-bib-0032" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Spence and Soderling&#x000a0;<xref rid="jnc70085-bib-0035" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>); however, the mechanisms underlying changes in PSD structure have not been clearly elucidated until recently.</p><p>The presence of tubulin in and around the PSD has long been a point of debate, despite the identification of tubulin immunoreactivity in the PSD as early as 1975 (Suzuki et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="jnc70085-bib-0042" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>). In 2008, tubulin present in the PSD was brought to the limelight again due to the transient appearance of MTs in dendritic spines during synaptic plasticity expression (Gu et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="jnc70085-bib-0010" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Hu et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="jnc70085-bib-0013" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Jaworski et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="jnc70085-bib-0017" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). More recently, the localization of tau, a microtubule&#x02010;associated protein (MAP), to the postsynaptic region has become apparent (Frandemiche et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="jnc70085-bib-0008" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Ittner and Ittner&#x000a0;<xref rid="jnc70085-bib-0014" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>; Ittner et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="jnc70085-bib-0015" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>), sparking a growing interest in the roles of both tau and tubulin at this site. Furthermore, there is increasing recognition of the importance of microtubule (MT) modulation in the regulation of various brain functions and dysfunctions, particularly in relation to synapses and dendritic spines (Pena&#x02010;Ortega et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="jnc70085-bib-0024" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>; Verstraelen et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="jnc70085-bib-0045" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Tubulin has been demonstrated to be present in the PSD in&#x000a0;vivo through immuno&#x02010;gold labeling (Suzuki et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="jnc70085-bib-0042" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>), and its presence in purified PSD preparations does not appear to be merely due to contamination (Ratner and Mahler&#x000a0;<xref rid="jnc70085-bib-0027" ref-type="bibr">1983</xref>; Somerville et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="jnc70085-bib-0034" ref-type="bibr">1984</xref>). The accumulated body of research on tubulin now provides a solid basis for renewed investigation into the role of tubulin in the PSD.</p><p>We recently proposed a model for PSD architecture based on the purification and characterization of the PSD lattice (PSDL), a backbone structure for the PSD in brain synapses (Suzuki et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="jnc70085-bib-0042" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>). We proposed a model in which tubulin&#x02010;based PSDL structures may play important roles as platforms to which PSD scaffold/adaptor proteins and various PSD&#x02010;functioning molecules become associated while synapses mature and reorganize (it is referred to here as the PSDL platform model). We also referred to the possibility that tubulin in its non&#x02010;MT form is a major core in the fundamental PSDL skeleton, which we defined as an essential skeletal structure for PSDs.</p><p>In this article, we report further information on tubulin in the PSD and PSDL, that is, (1) the interaction of the PSD and PSDL with polymerizing MTs, (2) GTP&#x02010; and MT&#x02010;affective reagent&#x02010;induced modifications in PSD/PSDL structure and integrity, and (3) the involvement of tubulin in the formation of PSD aggregates and their destruction in the presence of GTP and MT&#x02010;affective reagents. These findings may provide new insights into the role of tubulin in the postsynaptic region.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials-and-methods" id="jnc70085-sec-0002"><label>2</label><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec sec-type="materials" id="jnc70085-sec-0003"><label>2.1</label><title>Materials</title><p>The chemicals and antibodies used in this study are listed in Tables&#x000a0;<xref rid="jnc70085-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref> and <xref rid="jnc70085-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref>.

Samples without reagents were incubated in parallel as control specimens. GTP, GMP&#x02010;PNP, GDP, and ATP were used at a concentration of 10&#x02009;mM; nocodazole was used at 10&#x02009;&#x003bc;M, and paclitaxel at 1&#x02009;&#x003bc;M. The 10&#x02009;mM concentration for GTP, GMP&#x02010;PNP, GDP, and ATP was chosen to enable clear detection of morphological changes in the ultrastructure. The effects of treatment with 1&#x02009;mM GTP were also confirmed (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="jnc70085-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5</xref>). DMSO (0.1%) was also used as the control treatment for experiments involving nocodazole and paclitaxel, as stock solutions of both reagents (10 and 1&#x02009;mM, respectively) were prepared using DMSO, with both treatments containing 0.1% DMSO. The other reagents used in this study were water&#x02010;soluble, and their stock solutions did not contain organic solvents. The presence of the protease inhibitor mix had only a negligible effect on the morphology of the structures tested after incubation at 0&#x000b0;C for 90&#x02009;min.</p><p>Two types of PSD preparations were used depending on the aim of the experiment. To evaluate changes in non&#x02010;aggregated PSD structures, OG12 was used because its purification from stored SPM is relatively easier than that of conventional PSD. Thus, OG12 can be easily prepared and stored unfrozen at &#x02212;30&#x000b0;C in the presence of 50% glycerol for a relatively short period. Based on EM observations, the structure of OG12 was not altered for at least 1&#x02009;year. OG12 under 6&#x02009;months of storage was used for the core experiments in this study. To observe changes in PSD aggregation, TX&#x02010;PSD stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C was used. The protein profile of the TX&#x02010;PSD was similar to that observed immediately after purification, suggesting that no significant proteolysis occurred during storage.</p><p>To quantify the extent of damage caused by the reagents, we assessed the degree of structural changes in the remaining PSDL or PSD posttreatment, despite the limitation that extremely damaged fragmented into small, widely dispersed pieces were excluded from being counted. The evaluation of reagent effectiveness against PSDL and non&#x02010;aggregated PSD involved scrutinizing the specimens at both low (&#x0003c;&#x02009;10&#x02009;000&#x02010;fold) and high (&#x0003e;&#x02009;15&#x02009;000&#x02010;fold) magnifications. The primary objective of examination at low magnification was to know the vastness of the damage, and to identify the pervasive structural deteriorations that led to the almost complete obliteration of the original configurations, causing the dispersion of smaller fragments. A high magnification examination was necessary to determine whether the remaining original structures were damaged, thereby strengthening the identification of the damage observed at low magnification. EM images of PSDL and OG12 structures posttreatment with diameters ranging from 150 to 1500&#x02009;nm were taken at high magnifications (typically greater than 25&#x02009;000&#x000d7;). Structures less than 100 or 150&#x02009;nm in diameter may include fragments that were produced during purification and present before the treatments. Structures larger than 1000&#x02009;nm, in particular PSDs, may be aggregated ones. Thus, structures with a diameter of 150&#x02013;1500&#x02009;nm were counted. The morphologies of the remaining PSDL structures posttreatment were categorized into three groups: normal to nearly normal (N), moderately damaged (M), and severely damaged (S). For the remaining PSDs posttreatment, the morphologies were classified into two groups: normal to moderately damaged (NM) and severely damaged (S), as distinguishing &#x0201c;M&#x0201d; from the others was more challenging in PSDs compared to PSDLs. Severely damaged structures included those with many dispersed fragments and an extremely broken overall shape, as well as those that maintained their overall shape but contained extensively modified internal components. Structures judged to be &#x0201c;M&#x0201d; maintained their overall shape. For quantification of the effects on the aggregated PSDs, EM images were captured randomly at a 200&#x000d7; magnification, and particle sizes and numbers in a single square field of a 400 mesh EM grid were determined through particle analysis using the ImageJ 1.53k software (for details, see experimental design).</p></sec><sec id="jnc70085-sec-0011"><label>2.9</label><title>Immuno&#x02010;Gold Negative Staining</title><p>Negative staining coupled with the immuno&#x02010;gold technique using 10&#x02010;nm gold particles was carried out as previously described (Suzuki et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="jnc70085-bib-0040" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>; Suzuki et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="jnc70085-bib-0042" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>).

To identify the possible interactions, we used an in&#x000a0;vitro system in which tubulin polymerization was induced in the presence of PSDLs and searched for interaction sites through EM observation. Isolated PSDLs were immobilized on a Formvar membrane attached to an EM grid. The PSDL&#x02010;loaded membrane was then blocked with albumin and NGS to minimize nonspecific protein binding, followed by exposure to a tubulin&#x02010;containing droplet and incubation at 37&#x000b0;C to promote MT polymerization (see Methods and Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="jnc70085-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1A</xref>). To assess potential changes in the PSDL structure during and after incubation with polymerizing MTs, the MTs were depolymerized at 0&#x000b0;C for 30&#x02009;min. This system is advantageous in the situation where the PSDL protein concentration cannot be increased to that of tubulin due to the low yield of PSDL protein.</p><p>An overview of the interaction between PSDLs and polymerizing MTs, along with a control experiment in the absence of PSDLs conducted under the same conditions but using an unblocked EM grid membrane instead of a blocked one, is shown in low&#x02010;magnification images (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="jnc70085-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1A,B</xref>). Electron microscopy of negatively stained PSDL preparation, prior to mixing with tubulin, revealed a dispersion of electron&#x02010;dense particles of various sizes (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="jnc70085-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1A&#x02010;a</xref>), which were presumed to represent different sizes of PSDLs. The tubulin preparation used for the interaction also displayed dispersed small particles (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="jnc70085-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1B&#x02010;a</xref>), most of which were clearly structurally distinct from the PSDL, as confirmed by enlarged views. Low levels of MTs were observed to be trapped in the membrane 5&#x02009;min after the initiation of polymerization, while a higher abundance of MTs was trapped at 30&#x02009;min (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="jnc70085-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1A&#x02010;b,c</xref>, respectively). These MTs were primarily associated with PSDLs immobilized on the membrane. In contrast, MTs observed on the control unblocked grid membrane (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="jnc70085-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1B&#x02010;b,c</xref>) resulted from nonspecific interactions with the membrane. Following depolymerization for 30&#x02009;min, the trapped MTs were lost from the Formvar membrane as expected (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="jnc70085-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1A&#x02010;d</xref>).</p><p>The size and number of PSDLs remained unchanged after incubation with polymerizing and subsequently depolymerized tubulin (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="jnc70085-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>), as did the particles in the tubulin preparation (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="jnc70085-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1D</xref>). Most of the amorphous fragments derived from depolymerized MTs (indicated by thin and thick arrows in Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="jnc70085-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1C</xref>) disappeared after 30&#x02009;min of cooling on ice, leaving only a few residual amorphous structures (open arrows in Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="jnc70085-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1D</xref>), which differed from the PSDLs. PSDL structures maintained their characteristic meshwork&#x02010;like configuration after interaction with polymerizing MTs (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="jnc70085-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1E,F</xref>). Thus, changes to PSDL structures were minimal. The subtle alterations observed may be attributed to protease&#x02010;induced damage during long&#x02010;term incubation at 37&#x000b0;C, despite the presence of a protease inhibitor cocktail in the blocking solution.</p><p>The presence of MTs on the PSDL&#x02010;loaded grid membrane suggests an interaction between PSDLs and polymerizing MTs. We then investigated to determine the presence or absence of an association between PSDLs and polymerizing MTs through EM during the early phase of polymerization (a few to several minutes after initiating MT polymerization). The extent of MT polymerization varied, even for samples on the same Formvar membrane. Particularly, during the early stages, there were sparse areas with shorter MTs and relatively dense areas with longer MTs on the same Formvar membrane. The former may have occurred during the very early stages of MT polymerization. The observation of such early stage areas revealed a significant association between short nascent MTs and PSDLs (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="jnc70085-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2A&#x02010;a</xref>). Thereafter, the number and length of MTs increased, with the maintenance of their association with PSDLs (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="jnc70085-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2A&#x02010;b</xref>). These results suggest an interaction between PSDLs and polymerizing MTs.</p><fig position="float" fig-type="FIGURE" id="jnc70085-fig-0002"><label>FIGURE 2</label><caption><p>Interaction of PSDLs with MT ends.

We investigated the two types of tubulin preparations, MAP&#x02010;rich tubulin (ML116) and pure tubulin (T240), &#x0003e;&#x02009;99% pure in SDS&#x02010;PAGE, according to the manufacturer's datasheet (see also Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="jnc70085-fig-0010" ref-type="fig">10A</xref> [both from Cytoskeleton Inc., Denver, CO, USA]). This examination is necessary because the M116 tubulin preparation contained small particles (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="jnc70085-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1B&#x02010;a,D</xref>). The particles in the ML116 tubulin were amorphous, with some forming a mesh&#x02010;like configuration, and mostly smaller than 200&#x02009;nm (Figures&#x000a0;<xref rid="jnc70085-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1D</xref> and <xref rid="jnc70085-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>). Structures with fine meshworks were present before and after the induction of MT formation (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="jnc70085-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3B,C</xref>). The T240 tubulin preparation also contained structures composed of fine molecules (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="jnc70085-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3E,F</xref>). It contained a slightly higher proportion of 200 to 300&#x02009;nm&#x02010;sized structures compared to the M116 tubulin preparation (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="jnc70085-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3D&#x02010;d</xref>). These fine meshwork structures resemble PSDLs in overall appearance (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="jnc70085-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3E</xref>). However, importantly, their internal structures differ (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="jnc70085-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>; Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="jnc70085-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref>). Apparent PSDL&#x02010;like structures were more frequently observed in pure tubulin preparations and were typically larger than those found in MAP&#x02010;rich tubulin. The structures present in T240 tubulin before polymerization were retained during MT formation, along with additional structures (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="jnc70085-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) associated with the MTs.

We encountered difficulty in distinguishing genuine PSDLs from PSDL&#x02010;like structures derived from the tubulin preparation after mixing, in the observation using negative EM staining. This was although the number of PSDL&#x02010;like structures with a size similar to that of genuine PSDLs is low in the ML116 tubulin preparation used for the interaction study (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="jnc70085-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1D</xref>), and therefore, the likelihood of transferring these structures to the observed specimen is very low. Some PSDL structure may have changed during MT polymerization.

The result suggests the induction of the formation of these structures on the MT ends by the addition of PSDLs. The MT region close to the ends sometimes form an incompletely closed tubular structure but dilated or tapered in this group (small multiple arrows in Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="jnc70085-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5E&#x02010;c</xref>&#x02010;e&#x000a0;as well as Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="jnc70085-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5A&#x02010;b</xref>).

It is difficult to determine the identity of these PSDL&#x02010;like structures&#x02014;whether they are genuine PSDLs or structures formed during tubulin preparation&#x02014;because they are present on polymerizing MTs even in the absence of PSDL. These structures are typically small (less than 200&#x02009;nm) in the absence of PSDLs; however, larger ones, such as those shown in Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="jnc70085-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5F&#x02010;a,c</xref>, are observed during MT polymerization in the presence of PSDLs, and their origin remains unclear.

These associations were not observed prior to the mixing and incubation of the tubulin and PSDL preparations. Some of the MT&#x02010;associated structures correspond to PSDLs, while others appear to be structures formed on the polymerized MTs, like the structures shown in Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="jnc70085-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5E</xref>.

A maximum diameter below 100&#x02009;nm is smaller than that of intact mature PSDs; however, structural similarities, indicated by the open arrow in Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="jnc70085-fig-0006" ref-type="fig">6C&#x02010;a</xref>, suggest that most, if not all, PSDs were fragmented or they were very early structures in their infancy.

Drastic changes in PSD aggregation were observed following incubation with 10&#x02009;mM GTP. There was a decrease in the size of PSD aggregates, as stated above, and many short fibers, either single or bundled, were widely distributed (arrowheads in Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="jnc70085-fig-0013" ref-type="fig">13B</xref>). The average diameter of the individual fibers was approximately 20.8&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.7&#x02009;nm, indicating MT derivatives. As concerns large PSD aggregates, which were relatively few after the treatment, loosening of structures was observed, and short fibers were associated with PSD aggregates (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="jnc70085-fig-0013" ref-type="fig">13B&#x02010;</xref>d,e). After incubation with GTP, these short fibers were observed in PSD aggregates, but not in non&#x02010;aggregated PSDs. This finding suggests that large PSD aggregates unfolded through the peeling off of thin fibers, which may have been the bundling elements of the PSD aggregates. This robust destruction of PSD aggregates, particularly the shedding of short fibers, was not observed in PSD aggregates following treatments with the other reagents. The destruction of PSD aggregates was also observed following incubation with 1&#x02009;mM GTP (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="jnc70085-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5H</xref>).</p><p>Individual PSDs, possibly released from the aggregates, were also severely damaged (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="jnc70085-fig-0013" ref-type="fig">13G&#x02010;c</xref>). Fiber bundles, possibly twining around PSDs before nocodazole treatment, were loosened in the remaining PSD aggregates (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="jnc70085-fig-0013" ref-type="fig">13G&#x02010;d</xref>), suggesting the destruction of the aggregates. The fiber structures associated with the remaining PSD aggregates following nocodazole treatment were different from those observed following GTP treatment. Paclitaxel treatment also appeared to cause widespread severe damage to some aggregated PSDs (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="jnc70085-fig-0013" ref-type="fig">13H</xref>).

In addition, these bead&#x02010;like structures sometimes appeared like ladders depending on the viewing conditions (e.g., Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="jnc70085-fig-0015" ref-type="fig">15B&#x02010;b,c</xref>). As of now, these bead&#x02010;like structures have not been observed in the TX&#x02010;PSD without 10&#x02009;mM GTP treatment, although their visibility might have depended on the staining conditions. Therefore, the bead&#x02010;like structures may be specific to the type of PSD aggregates we are dealing with.</p><p>Tubulin immuno&#x02010;gold particles were also widely distributed on other types of fiber bundles associated with PSD aggregates (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="jnc70085-fig-0015" ref-type="fig">15B&#x02010;e&#x02013;g</xref>).

These findings suggested that all these fiber bundles were related to tubulin/MTs; in addition, they suggested that short fibers, as well as those associated with PSD aggregates produced after GTP treatment, may be related to MTs, and that treatment with GTP may induce the release of short fibers from PSD aggregates. Fiber bundles not consisting of bead&#x02010;like structures may also be derived from MTs.</p><p>Finally, the bead&#x02010;like structures were not observed in the TX&#x02010;PSD following treatment with nocodazole (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="jnc70085-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7</xref>), in which TX&#x02010;PSD structures were disorganized and loosened, as shown in Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="jnc70085-fig-0013" ref-type="fig">13G&#x02010;d</xref>.

This study is the first to report on agents that directly cause PSD deterioration, other than broad&#x02010;spectrum proteases and urea (Blomberg et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="jnc70085-bib-0002" ref-type="bibr">1977</xref>; Jan et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="jnc70085-bib-0016" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). These findings strongly imply tubulin's fundamental role in the formation and maintenance of PSD.</p><p>We also found that PSDL&#x02010;like structures are present in purified tubulin preparations (both MAP&#x02010;rich tubulin/ML116 and &#x0003e;&#x02009;99% pure tubulin/T240 preparations). In addition to the overall similarity in morphology, despite variations in specific details (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="jnc70085-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>; Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="jnc70085-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref>), associability with polymerizing MTs was also similar to that of PSDLs (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="jnc70085-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3F</xref>). A structure similar to the PSDL has been identified during purified tubulin polymerization through cryo&#x02010;EM (Chr&#x000e9;tien et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="jnc70085-bib-0005" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>). However, such PSDL&#x02010;like structures have not been further investigated. While the meshwork structures found in pure tubulin preparations and PSDLs are not identical, they may share certain properties. T240 tubulin has been shown to self&#x02010;assemble into a large structure that is distinct from PSDL&#x02010;like structures (Samson et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="jnc70085-bib-0028" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). This finding is noteworthy, as it suggests the potential of tubulin to form structures other than the well&#x02010;characterized MTs. The finding supports the idea that, depending on the conditions, PSDL&#x02010;like meshwork structures or bona fide PSDLs can appear in highly purified tubulin or in the brain postsynaptic area, respectively.</p><p>The effect of MT&#x02010;affective agents on PSDs and the importance of tubulin or MTs suggested by our in&#x000a0;vitro study agree with the studies carried out under more physiological conditions. Nocodazole treatment of hippocampal slices reduced the number of dendritic spines, concomitantly increased filopodia, and suppressed long&#x02010;term potentiation induced by high&#x02010;frequency stimulation. These changes are caused by an interference in the maturation of the dendritic spine via MTs intruding into spines from the dendritic shaft (Jaworski et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="jnc70085-bib-0017" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). A similar effect was confirmed in hippocampal neuronal cultures (Jaworski et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="jnc70085-bib-0017" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Penazzi et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="jnc70085-bib-0025" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). In addition, another study indicates that colchicine stereotaxically injected into the rat hippocampus reduces the expression of tubulin in the PSD, which is related to synaptic loss (Wu et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="jnc70085-bib-0051" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Similar spine loss was also observed in cultures of the hippocampus from APP transgenic mice, and epothilone, an MT&#x02010;stabilizing agent, reverses this type of spine loss (Penazzi et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="jnc70085-bib-0025" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Thus, accumulating publications suggest that events involving PSD&#x02010;tubulin also play an important role in synaptic function in&#x000a0;vivo.</p><p>Mechanistically, the destructive effects of GTP on the structural changes in PSDL and PSD appear to be GTP&#x02010;specific and require GTP hydrolysis based on the weakened activities with GTP analogues and an unhydrolyzable analog, GMP&#x02010;PNP (Figures&#x000a0;<xref rid="jnc70085-fig-0011" ref-type="fig">11</xref>, <xref rid="jnc70085-fig-0012" ref-type="fig">12</xref>, and <xref rid="jnc70085-fig-0014" ref-type="fig">14</xref>). This property suggests the involvement of molecules with GTPase activity, such as heterotrimeric G proteins, small G proteins, dynamin, tubulin, initiation factors, and elongation factors. Not a few of these molecules are present in the purified PSDL used in this study (see Tables&#x000a0;<xref rid="jnc70085-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3</xref> and <xref rid="jnc70085-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4</xref> in (Suzuki et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="jnc70085-bib-0042" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>)). Among these molecules, tubulin is likely the primary contributor to the phenomenon, as it is the most abundant component of PSDL and the disruption of PSDL and PSD is induced by nocodazole and paclitaxel, although other molecules cannot be entirely ruled out. GTP&#x02010;induced PSD disassembly may likely occur in&#x000a0;vivo, as PSDL and non&#x02010;aggregated PSD degradation were observed following treatment with 1&#x02009;mM GTP (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="jnc70085-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5</xref>), which is close to the physiological concentration of GTP in cells (Sumita et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="jnc70085-bib-0037" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Traut&#x000a0;<xref rid="jnc70085-bib-0044" ref-type="bibr">1994</xref>). It is also possible that the deteriorating effect of GTP on the PSDL and PSD is part of the system to reorganize PSD because GTP is one type of second messenger, a regulator of various kinds of cell function. Further studies are needed.</p></sec><sec id="jnc70085-sec-0028"><label>4.2</label><title>A Possible Linkage Between <styled-content style="fixed-case" toggle="no">PSD</styled-content>&#x02010;<styled-content style="fixed-case" toggle="no">MT</styled-content> Interaction and Synaptic Plasticity</title><p>In this study, the interaction of PSDL and non&#x02010;aggregated PSD structures with polymerizing MTs was identified through EM observations. This interaction appears to be specific, as indicated by the characteristic changes in the structures after the interaction between PSDL and MTs (Figures&#x000a0;<xref rid="jnc70085-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref> and <xref rid="jnc70085-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>), as well as the binding of tubulin to the purified PSDs shown in co&#x02010;sedimentation analysis (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="jnc70085-fig-0010" ref-type="fig">10A</xref>) and the distinct binding characteristics compared to latex beads (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="jnc70085-fig-0010" ref-type="fig">10B&#x02013;D</xref>). Our data imply that MTs have the capacity to associate with PSDs during the expression of synaptic plasticity as they transiently intrude into the spine head, as suggested before based on the experiments carried out using live image confocal microscopy or total internal reflectance microscopy (Gu et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="jnc70085-bib-0010" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Hu et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="jnc70085-bib-0012" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Hu et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="jnc70085-bib-0013" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Jaworski et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="jnc70085-bib-0017" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Merriam et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="jnc70085-bib-0023" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Sch&#x000e4;tzle et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="jnc70085-bib-0030" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Our findings on the interaction of PSDLs and non&#x02010;aggregated PSDs with polymerizing MTs were corroborated by EM examinations conducted on brain sections (Gray et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="jnc70085-bib-0009" ref-type="bibr">1982</xref>; Westrum and Gray&#x000a0;<xref rid="jnc70085-bib-0047" ref-type="bibr">1976</xref>; Westrum and Gray&#x000a0;<xref rid="jnc70085-bib-0048" ref-type="bibr">1977</xref>; Westrum et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="jnc70085-bib-0049" ref-type="bibr">1980</xref>), because the morphological features of MTs associating with PSD are similar to those observed in our study. Therefore, these data suggest that the interaction between PSDLs/PSDs and polymerizing MTs occurs in&#x000a0;vivo.</p><p>The end region morphology of MTs connected to PSDLs/PSDs, including dilatation, distortion, and tapering of the MT cylindrical structure (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="jnc70085-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>; Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="jnc70085-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3</xref>), was similar to those observed in the polymerization of purified tubulin (Akhmanova and Steinmetz&#x000a0;<xref rid="jnc70085-bib-0001" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Gudimchuk and McIntosh&#x000a0;<xref rid="jnc70085-bib-0011" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>). Thus, the interaction between PSDLs/PSDs and MT may be similar to that observed when tubulin dimers are incorporated into elongating MT ends. This suggests that the interaction between PSDLs/PSDs and MTs occurs via their tubulin moieties.</p><p>PSDLs/PSDs may not function as nucleation sites from where MTs extend as purified PSDLs do not possess &#x003b3;&#x02010;tubulin (Suzuki et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="jnc70085-bib-0042" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>), which is an essential component for MT nucleation (L&#x000fc;ders and Stearns&#x000a0;<xref rid="jnc70085-bib-0021" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Sanchez and Feldman&#x000a0;<xref rid="jnc70085-bib-0029" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Tubulin may start polymerization spontaneously with a sufficient concentration of tubulin, elongate, and contact PSDLs/PSDs. When one MT end gets in contact with PSDLs/PSDs, elongation occurs at the other end, and the MT reaches and connects with another PSDL/PSD. The binding of PSDLs/PSDs to both MT ends and interactions occurring through the non&#x02010;end MT region and multiple associations between MTs and PSDLs/PSDs allow the enlargement of the PSD area.</p><p>The interaction between polymerizing MTs and PSDs seemed to induce the formation or growth of PSDs or PSD&#x02010;like structures as suggested in Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="jnc70085-fig-0006" ref-type="fig">6B</xref>. This alteration in PSD characteristics may be accompanied by a restructuring of the PSD morphology, given the diverse range of morphologies observed in non&#x02010;aggregated PSDs (Figures&#x000a0;<xref rid="jnc70085-fig-0006" ref-type="fig">6C</xref> and <xref rid="jnc70085-fig-0009" ref-type="fig">9A,B</xref>). These diverse PSD morphologies include segmentation, segregation, perforation, and a horseshoe shape, all of which are deemed essential for inducing multiple innervation and increasing synaptic input into a single spine during the development of synaptic plasticity (Sun et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="jnc70085-bib-0038" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>). Furthermore, the protrusions and interconnections observed in non&#x02010;aggregated PSDs (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="jnc70085-fig-0009" ref-type="fig">9A,B</xref>) could potentially be remnants of interactions with polymerizing MTs, as well as tubulin&#x02010;positive fiber bundles present in the PSD aggregates (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="jnc70085-fig-0009" ref-type="fig">9C</xref>; Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="jnc70085-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4</xref>). The heterogeneity observed in isolated non&#x02010;aggregated PSDs not subjected to in&#x000a0;vitro incubation with polymerizing MTs suggests that a similar interaction with polymerizing MTs occurs in&#x000a0;vivo. These changes in PSDs may help in the expression of synaptic plasticity, together with increased material supply from outside the spine head to the PSD region through a new connection between the PSD and invading MTs (Hu et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="jnc70085-bib-0013" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>).</p><p>This study also observed changes possibly occurring on the MT side (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="jnc70085-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5E,G</xref>) following the mixing of PSDLs and tubulin and the induction of MT formation, suggesting an influence from PSDLs on MTs. Thus, the effects may be mutual, which could be favorable for the expression of synaptic plasticity. Although further experiments have not been conducted, the mechanism underlying this phenomenon should be explored in future studies.</p><p>In summary, tubulin in the PSD may be involved in triggering synaptic plasticity at activated synapses. The absence of effects on the PSDLs after the interaction with polymerizing MTs and subsequent depolymerization may be due to a lack of certain protein(s) within PSDLs.</p></sec><sec id="jnc70085-sec-0029"><label>4.3</label><title>Tubulin and <styled-content style="fixed-case" toggle="no">MTs</styled-content> Are Also Involved in <styled-content style="fixed-case" toggle="no">PSD</styled-content> Aggregation and Disaggregation</title><p>While examining PSDs through EM, we encountered instances of aggregated PSDs. This occurrence was due to the fact that isolated PSD samples inherently contain a certain degree of aggregated PSDs. It has been shown that conventional PSDs easily aggregate after purification, particularly after freezing in the absence of glycerol at a high concentration (Cohen et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="jnc70085-bib-0006" ref-type="bibr">1977</xref>; Suzuki et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="jnc70085-bib-0041" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). We expanded our research focus to include PSD aggregation because our study suggested that postsynaptic tubulin or MT is a key molecule in its formation and rearrangement.</p><p>Aggregated PSDs interacted with MTs upon incubation with tubulin under polymerization conditions (Figures&#x000a0;<xref rid="jnc70085-fig-0007" ref-type="fig">7</xref> and <xref rid="jnc70085-fig-0008" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). MTs were connected to aggregated PSDs at selected positions on the aggregates, and the number of connected MTs increased, leading to the consequent enlargement of the PSD aggregates (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="jnc70085-fig-0007" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). These enlarged PSD aggregates persisted even after MT depolymerization at 0&#x000b0;C, indicating the establishment of stable structures. PSD aggregates present in the TX&#x02010;PSD sample underwent substantial breakdown upon exposure to GTP, being transformed into smaller structures and shedding many tubulin&#x02010;containing short filaments, potentially originating from fragmented unbundled PSD aggregates (Figures&#x000a0;<xref rid="jnc70085-fig-0013" ref-type="fig">13</xref> and <xref rid="jnc70085-fig-0015" ref-type="fig">15</xref>). This deteriorating effect appeared to be related to MT assembly/disassembly because, among the nucleotides examined, the effect was specific to GTP and required GTP hydrolysis (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="jnc70085-fig-0014" ref-type="fig">14C</xref>) (Wade&#x000a0;<xref rid="jnc70085-bib-0046" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>), and nocodazole and paclitaxel also deconstructed the aggregates (Figures&#x000a0;<xref rid="jnc70085-fig-0013" ref-type="fig">13</xref> and <xref rid="jnc70085-fig-0014" ref-type="fig">14</xref>). This study suggests that PSD aggregation is induced by the intermingling of PSDs with polymerizing MTs. In addition, there was a change in the morphological properties of MTs, particularly MT bundles, as evidenced by the protrusions and fiber bundles in Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="jnc70085-fig-0009" ref-type="fig">9C</xref>, shown in more detail in Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="jnc70085-fig-0015" ref-type="fig">15</xref>. Thus, the MT bundles became stabilized upon interaction with aggregated PSDs, whereas unchanged MTs located far outside of aggregated PSDs were depolymerized at 0<sup>o</sup>C. Apparently, the interacting PSDs are stabilized and increase in size because of this mechanism. Such MT&#x02010;mediated interactions were predominantly manifested within aggregated PSDs. If an identical or analogous mechanism is potentially applicable to non&#x02010;aggregated PSDs, even to a small degree, PSDs could undergo the morphological alterations necessary for synaptic plasticity.</p><p>The accumulation of tubulin in PSDs before the homogenization of the dissected and minced brain has been reported (Carlin et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="jnc70085-bib-0004" ref-type="bibr">1982</xref>). Thus, an abnormal association occurs between tubulin or MTs and PSDs under ex&#x000a0;vivo conditions. To our knowledge, however, there are no reports on PSD aggregation as observed in this study occurring in&#x000a0;vivo. Abnormal aggregation of PSDs might also occur in&#x000a0;vivo, but it might not be easy to find. Alternately, large&#x02010;scale PSD aggregation like those observed under in&#x000a0;vitro conditions is not likely to occur because a single or small number of PSDs, in particular excitatory ones, are usually compartmentalized in dendritic spines. Therefore, the intermingling of many PSDs with massive polymerizing MTs is not likely to occur under in&#x000a0;vivo conditions, as far as spine membrane is intact. Instead, small&#x02010;scale enlargement of a single or a few to several PSDs might be possible. Under certain pathological conditions, PSDs may aggregate in&#x000a0;vivo. Given that PSD aggregation implies a loss of its normal function, exploring such brain pathologies could be valuable.</p></sec><sec id="jnc70085-sec-0030"><label>4.4</label><title>Effect of <styled-content style="fixed-case" toggle="no">GTP</styled-content> on the <styled-content style="fixed-case" toggle="no">PSD</styled-content> Integrity</title><p>We integrate findings from two types of in&#x000a0;vitro experiments conducted in this study: analyses of the interaction between PSDL/PSD and polymerizing tubulin, and the effects of GTP on the structure of PSDL/PSD.

All necessary elements&#x02014;GTP, soluble tubulin, and MTs&#x02014;may be present or can be supplied in the postsynaptic sub&#x02010;compartment, the dendritic spine, although the changes in GTP concentration within the spine are currently unknown. Therefore, the scheme illustrated in Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="jnc70085-fig-0016" ref-type="fig">16</xref> may also be relevant to the in&#x000a0;vivo postsynaptic region. Future experiments conducted under in&#x000a0;vivo conditions are anticipated.</p><fig position="float" fig-type="FIGURE" id="jnc70085-fig-0016"><label>FIGURE 16</label><caption><p>Summary of the GTP effects on the PSDL/PSD/PSD aggregation. Results of the experiments carried out in this study (interaction of postsynaptic structures with polymerizing tubulin, and effects of MT&#x02010;affective reagents on postsynaptic structures) are integrated. Postsynaptic structures were incubated with GTP either in the presence or absence of polymerizing tubulin, resulting differentially in the structures' destruction and enlargement/reorganization, respectively. Thus, GTP appears to be a key molecule for PSD structure maintenance and change.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JNC-169-0-g007" position="anchor" id="jats-graphic-35"/></fig><p>Tubulin is a pivotal molecular component that influences both the physiological and pathological facets of PSD. Given that the MT cytoskeleton, like the actin cytoskeleton, is fundamental to synaptic function and that dysregulation of this cytoskeleton is critical in many neuronal diseases (Pena&#x02010;Ortega et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="jnc70085-bib-0024" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>; Verstraelen et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="jnc70085-bib-0045" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>), further investigation into the relationship between PSD and tubulin or MTs is highly required.</p></sec></sec><sec id="jnc70085-sec-0035"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>
