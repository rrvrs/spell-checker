</self-uri><abstract><sec id="sec001"><title>Background</title><p>Mobile health (mHealth) is reshaping healthcare delivery, especially in HIV management. The World Health Organization advocates for mHealth to provide healthcare workers (HCWs) with real-time data, enhancing client care. However, in Malawi&#x02019;s Lighthouse Trust antiretroviral therapy (ART) clinic, the nurse-led community-based ART (NCAP) program faces hurdles with data management due to lack of access to electronic medical records systems (EMRS) in the community setting. EMRS are not typically available in differentiated service delivery settings where reliable power and internet are often unavailable. We used human-centered design (HCD) processes to create a mobile EMRS prototype, the Community-based ART Retention and Suppression (CARES) app. CARES aims to simplify workflow for HCWs and improve client care. As part of prototype testing, we explore CARES&#x02019; feasibility and acceptability from the perspective of NCAP HCWs.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><p>We conducted in-depth interviews among 15 NCAP HCWs. We used a rapid qualitative analysis approach guided by the Technology Acceptance Models (TAM1 and TAM2). The study complied with the Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research (COREQ).</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Results</title><p>HCWs demonstrated high perceived usefulness for the CARES app to improve healthcare delivery and data management, both of which could facilitate continued and effective use. However, challenges such as app performance, data integration, and system navigation were significant barriers to ease of use, reducing acceptance and current feasibility of scale-up. Despite challenges, HCWs remained optimistic about CARES&#x02019; potential to enhance NCAP clinical decision-making and data flow in future, likely reflecting organizational expectations for CARES optimization. Beyond the TAM framework, additional themes of consistent staff engagement and considerations for sustainability were identified as critical factors for long-term success. HCWs emphasized the need for continuous training and stakeholder engagement, improved infrastructure, data security protections, and establishing the CARES app and EMRS integration to facilitate CARES&#x02019; sustained expansion.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The study findings underscore the importance of HCD for mHealth buy-in. As HCWs were invested in CARES success, they remained optimistic that the app could enhance NCAP services if user experience and app performance improved. Incorporation of HCW feedback could help deliver the promise of CARES, current and future.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source>

Recognizing the potential of technological advancements, the World Health Organization (WHO) emphasizes using innovative mHealth technologies to optimize person-centered service delivery. These technologies ensure that healthcare workers (HCWs) have the necessary data at the point of care [<xref rid="pone.0303416.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In low-resource settings, mHealth innovations have been shown to improve HIV treatment outcomes. These include enhanced antiretroviral treatment (ART) adherence, retention, and viral load suppression [<xref rid="pone.0303416.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0303416.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>HIV remains a pervasive global issue, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, with countries like Malawi experiencing some of the world&#x02019;s highest HIV prevalence rates. The WHO advocates the adoption of differentiated service delivery (DSD) models in HIV care. A DSD model is a client-centered approach providing tailored care to people living with HIV often based on specific client characteristics including age, socioeconomic status, background, viral load levels, and stability on ART. DSD approaches often include outreach activities to lower the burden on both clients and the health system [<xref rid="pone.0303416.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Community-based DSD models shift stable ART clients from crowded clinics to care provided in the community for enhanced accessibility and convenience for clients [<xref rid="pone.0303416.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0303416.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Lighthouse Trust is the largest ART provider in Malawi that cares for over 65,000 clients alive on ART as part of Malawi Ministry of Health (MoH) public service delivery [<xref rid="pone.0303416.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0303416.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In 2016, the nurse-led community ART program (NCAP) was piloted at the Lighthouse Trust ART clinic in Malawi; NCAP has been growing successfully with client, clinician and MoH support [<xref rid="pone.0303416.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Distributing ART in the community enables clients to refill ART closer to their homes through mobile clinics or community meeting points. This approach reduces travel times for the client and decongests healthcare facilities [<xref rid="pone.0303416.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Providing quality care requires a robust, comprehensive monitoring and evaluation (M&#x00026;E) system [<xref rid="pone.0303416.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0303416.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. This is often more complex, but critical in a community ART setting, where ART is distributed within the community. In community-based DSD, HCWs typically rely on paper-based reporting, which can increase the risk of loss-to-follow-up and impede viral load (VL) monitoring [<xref rid="pone.0303416.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0303416.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. After NCAP was piloted, workers and clients responded favorably, and clients preferred receiving ART in the community-based DSD model rather than in a facility. However, workers found NCAP M&#x00026;E challenges due to the lack of an electronic medical record system (EMRS), which eases HCW workload and streamlines reporting [<xref rid="pone.0303416.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In Malawi, the EMRS was developed to overcome the lack of reliable data and inadequate use of data in healthcare planning [<xref rid="pone.0303416.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. To date, EMRS is only available in static hospitals or health facilities with stable connectivity. Community settings lack such infrastructure [<xref rid="pone.0303416.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. This poses a critical challenge to EMRS expansion in Malawi. mHealth can be used to fill this gap by connecting with the EMRS system to strengthen ART client care and management. Interoperating mHealth with EMRS holds promise to expand EMRS reach, thereby streamlining data capture, management, and analytics to enhance efficiency [<xref rid="pone.0303416.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0303416.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Interoperability may also help ensure continuous client monitoring and support, regardless of location, leading to more informed decision-making and improved care outcomes.</p><p>Lighthouse Trust, the International Training and Education Centre for Health, and Medic collaborated to develop a tablet-based, offline-first, mHealth app to mirror the EMRS that could operate in NCAP settings: the Community-based ART Retention and Suppression (CARES) app. CARES emulates the functionality and features of the EMRS with built-in prompts and alerts, ensuring compliance with national ART guidelines and enhancing the quality of client care. We used participatory human-centered design (HCD) processes to design the CARES app, working iteratively with NCAP workers to launch the CARES prototype [<xref rid="pone.0303416.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. For Lighthouse clients, CARES operates like EMRS, mimicking the flow and content of routine visits for clients in the clinic setting. The CARES app and the HCD process utilized for its development were detailed previously [<xref rid="pone.0303416.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>The aim of this study was to qualitatively explore the acceptability and feasibility of the CARES prototype among Lighthouse Trust ART HCWs who routinely interact with the CARES app or its data. This study took place during the CARES prototype testing and optimization phase. In-depth interviews (IDIs) with key HCWs involved in CARES aimed to identify facilitators and barriers to the use of the CARES prototype from the perspective of healthcare services delivery. Data collection and analysis were informed by the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) information systems theory [<xref rid="pone.0303416.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The TAM framework aims to explain user behavior regarding technology acceptance, focusing on perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use as fundamental determinants of technology adoption. Understanding the perspectives of HCW users on the CARES prototype app is essential for understanding the intervention&#x02019;s challenges, opportunities, and potential feasibility to enhance ART care delivery and, ultimately, client outcomes at scale. Overall, we hope our research will inform both CARES improvements and the development and implementation of other future mobile mHealth interventions for community ART programs in Malawi and beyond. We also aim to assess the applicability of TAM, and its extensions, to developing an app for improved community-based mHealth services, hoping to inform future TAM adaptation in LMIC mHealth contexts.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Methodology</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Design</title><p>A qualitative design, using IDIs to ascertain HCW perspectives and experience in using the CARES app. We applied the Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Studies (COREQ) guidelines (see <xref rid="pone.0303416.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Appendix</xref>). [<xref rid="pone.0303416.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Setting</title><p>Lighthouse Trust operates five centers of excellence clinics across Malawi. In urban Lilongwe, Lighthouse Trust operates two flagship clinics, with a combined &#x0003e;37,000 ART clients [<xref rid="pone.0303416.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0303416.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0303416.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In addition, Lighthouse Trust also supports care at seven peri-urban satellite sites in Lilongwe District. Lighthouse Trust uses the MoH real-time, point-of-care EMRS to guarantee compliance with national ART guidelines, enhance client care and program outcomes, and simplify reporting across all facilities. As with other MoH clinics, the EMRS at each Lighthouse facility operates independently and does not share client data across different clinics. The NCAP services are offered to clients from Lighthouse Trust flagship clinics, Lighthouse Clinic (LH) and Martin Preuss Centre (MPC), and seven satellite health facilities in Lilongwe. To date, the CARES prototype has been utilized only for clients at LH and MPC clinics.</p><p>Since 2016, Lighthouse Trust&#x02019;s NCAP community DSD has provided ART in the community to stable ART clients over 18 who have been on first or second-line treatment for at least six months and are virally suppressed within Lighthouse Trust&#x02019;s catchment area [<xref rid="pone.0303416.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0303416.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. NCAP offers monthly support group services, supplying 3&#x02013;6-month ART refills and facilitating specialist referrals when necessary. Previously managed with an Open Data Kit (ODK)-based tool, data for NCAP visits were manually transferred to EMRS, a process CARES aims to streamline. CARES prototype addresses several ODK limitations, including decision support, integrated care, lab management, and reducing clerical workload.</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Study population</title><p>We conducted in-depth interviews (IDIs) of 1) HCWs who used the CARES prototype for LH and MPC clients while providing care in the community, and 2) those who worked on the technical side, managing, and processing the CARES app&#x02019;s data. The IDIs were conducted from September 11 to October 25, 2023. All HCWs involved with NCAP were approached to participate in the interviews, and all agreed to participate in the study. The HCWs interviewed included NCAP nurses, their managers, and all M&#x00026;E staff involved in NCAP data management, IT, and research. All the nurses provide direct services to NCAP clients in the community. The community health services (CHS) manager and deputy manager oversee the NCAP program and supervise the nurses. The data officer is responsible for manually entering NCAP data into the EMRS and downloading a list of NCAP clients who missed their appointments. The IT manager is responsible for hosting the electronic data collection tools for NCAP, designing them, and managing the data as needed. The data manager supports data extraction and reporting for the CHS team and develops NCAP data collection tools. The research intern and research manager support the implementation of the CARES project. By interviewing all NCAP-related HCWs involved in the CARES project, including both clinical supervisors and data managers, we anticipated reaching a natural point of data saturation.</p><sec id="sec010"><title>Developing CARES using a human-centered design (HCD) approach.</title><p>Medic, I-TECH, and Lighthouse Trust collaborated as a multidisciplinary team to co-create the CARES prototype app. CARES app was created utilizing the Community Health Toolkit (CHT) [<xref rid="pone.0303416.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], an open-source project developed by Medic. HCD was used to engage HCWs consistently, incorporate iterative feedback, and create contextually relevant technology. CARES design, development and core functionality, including the intended workload reduction impact [<xref rid="pone.0303416.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], was described in detail previously [<xref rid="pone.0303416.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In brief, CARES is a client management application for ART that prioritizes offline functionality and is designed for use in areas with limited internet connectivity &#x02013; like NCAP. CARES aims to extend the reach of the Malawi MoH EMRS. In the static facility setting, CARES was designed to assist HCWs in gathering ARV drugs for all clients they expect to encounter in the community. In the NCAP setting, CARES aimed to benefit HCWs by offering them a mobile EMRS-like app, facilitating comprehensive client reviews, and aiding decision-making with alerts for various concerns. It also allows for the enrollment of new clients in the NCAP program. After each visit, CARES automatically syncs data to point-of-care EMRS, eliminating the need for manual data entry and ensuring efficient record-keeping.</p><p>The CARES prototype was designed using the HCD approach, with Medic developers having routine discussions with NCAP providers over 12 months to increase the CARES app&#x02019;s acceptability and feasibility in the NCAP setting. This lengthy but highly participatory approach prioritized understanding of diverse end-user needs, minimizing wasted resources on irrelevant features. Users included clinicians, nurses, M&#x00026;E teams, data managers, and NCAP leadership. The feedback sessions, occurring weekly or twice a week, with both theory and hands-on activities, involved developers engaging providers and collaborating closely with a diverse team to tailor CARES system requirements to the local context, with iterative improvements guided by analyzing user feedback and system usage patterns [<xref rid="pone.0303416.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Theoretical model</title><p>Analysis of IDIs was guided by the extended Technology Acceptance Model (TAM 2) [<xref rid="pone.0303416.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].

We identified important factors facilitating HCWs&#x02019; acceptance of mHealth technologies&#x02014;healthcare delivery improvement, meeting organizational expectations, collaborative development using HCD, and sustainability initiatives. We also documented formidable barriers to CARES success, including app performance issues, data quality discrepancies, navigation challenges, data security concerns, infrastructure, and resource limitations. We framed our results based on the extended TAM2 [<xref rid="pone.0303416.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] theoretical framework that explores perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use while providing insights into a CARES optimization pathway for effective and continued use. We added the additional themes - stakeholder engagement and sustainability &#x02013; that might support future adoption efforts if other optimization is achieved. We discuss how these results informed additional CARES iterations, improvements, and plans for future adaptations.</p><p>First, applying the TAM2 framework helped underscore the influence of perceived usefulness, output quality, social process influences, and ease of use in CARES technology acceptance. HCWs anticipated the CARES prototype would enhance efficiency, aligning with TAM2&#x02019;s cognitive instrumental process [<xref rid="pone.0303416.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. We noted user expectations and experiences with technological improvements as a key factor shaping HCWs&#x02019; perceptions of CARES. Their prior experiences with ODK and EMRS influenced how they assessed CARES&#x02019; potential benefits and shortcomings. They praised the ability of the CARES app to streamline tasks such as community visit preparations and drug management, indicating high perceived usefulness.</p><p>However, while HCWs expected improvements in efficiency, deficiencies in output quality, a key TAM2 construct reflecting technology performance [<xref rid="pone.0303416.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], hampered usability and reduced its intended benefits due to the app&#x02019;s slow speed, system resets, and data discrepancies. Additionally, the concept of subjective norm within TAM2 [<xref rid="pone.0303416.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] reflects the societal influences on an individual&#x02019;s decision to use a technology. Providers continued using CARES amidst greater workloads, showing their commitment during its prototype phase and underscoring the role of stakeholder expectations in technology adoption decisions. It suggests that when HCWs believe in the importance of the specific technology to their supervisor&#x02019;s or the organization&#x02019;s goals, they may be more willing to adapt their work practices to incorporate the technology at the development stage.</p><p>While TAM2 provided a strong foundation for analyzing technology adoption, newer extensions such as TAM3 [<xref rid="pone.0303416.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] introduce additional determinants, including experience as a moderator and intervention-based influences. Though our study was guided by TAM2, the evolving nature of TAM models suggests the importance of continued adaptations to reflect the complexities and rapidly-evolving landscape of mHealth implementation in low-resource settings.</p><p>Beyond the TAM frameworks, we identified user optimism, continuous engagement, and sustainability as crucial aspects of CARES feasibility for continued and effective use, confirming past research that links HCW attitudes and stakeholder commitment to mHealth success [<xref rid="pone.0303416.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0303416.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. On the positive side, providers accepted many of the current CARES weaknesses and remained optimistic about continuing to use CARES if improvements were attained. Nurse users emphasized the potential for a positive impact on client care, while M&#x00026;E respondents focused on technical and programmatic considerations. These improvements could increase healthcare quality as a result of the mHealth tool, a facilitator of mHealth implementation success, as seen previously [<xref rid="pone.0303416.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0303416.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. However, similar to the findings from a systematic review of HCW acceptability of mHealth interventions, we found that continued issues in CARES technical failures and resulting increased workload were significant barriers to CARES, curbing enthusiasm [<xref rid="pone.0303416.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. HCWs reported frustration about the CARES prototype&#x02019;s slow performance and difficulties with EMRS synchronization, again decreasing engagement and buy-in. HCW users cited the unfilled promise of improved workflow, streamlined data management, and overall efficiency for NCAP service delivery but also suggested that overcoming these issues would further positive attitudes toward future CARES interactions. Lastly, sustainability, which centered around critical improvements in infrastructure, connectivity, data security, and technical support, emerged as essential to scaling up and sustaining mHealth intervention. Sustainability appeared tied to a strong commitment by both HCWs and relevant stakeholders, as seen elsewhere in mHealth expansion success regionally [<xref rid="pone.0303416.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0303416.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].</p><p>The HCD process appeared crucial for HCWs&#x02019; acceptance and buy-in. Their involvement in the design phase, sustained through an 18-month engagement alongside their duties, reflects an enormous dedication to NCAP clients and the improvement of care delivery. Moreover, their consistent inputs for iterative testing helped increase CARES&#x02018;prototype tailoring to the Malawian context and the unique needs of NCAP and the EMRS at Lighthouse. This approach also secured organizational backing, addressing a common barrier in mHealth implementation [<xref rid="pone.0303416.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0303416.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. These issues necessitated supplementary documentation methods, raising questions about the app&#x02019;s practicality and, thus, the usefulness of the app, even if they recognize its theoretical benefits [<xref rid="pone.0303416.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0303416.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Technological challenges, which are common barriers to implementing and adopting mHealth interventions [<xref rid="pone.0303416.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0303416.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0303416.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] were among the factors contributing to the delays in addressing CARES issues.</p><p>Our research underscores that while TAM2 provides a robust framework for understanding the key determinants of technology acceptance, it must be adapted and contextualized within healthcare professionals&#x02019; specific operational workflows and user experiences. We excluded behavioral intention from our model because, in our study, participants were interviewed after already experiencing the intervention, describing perceptions of actual usage rather than intentions. Also, previous research on technology acceptance showed that behavioral intention becomes a less significant predictor of actual use when the likelihood of use is initially high [<xref rid="pone.0303416.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. However, we also included the continued use of CARES in our model to explain if and how HCWs will continue using CARES in the future.</p><p>Our findings highlight the importance of user-centered design in healthcare app adoption and efficacy where HCW and stakeholders are involved in every step&#x02014;from design to iterative testing&#x02014;to tailor the app to their actual needs and preferences. Additionally, securing organizational support and aligning the app with institutional objectives encourages healthcare workers to seamlessly incorporate new technology into their daily workflow.</p><p>HCWs are optimistic about CARES&#x02019; potential to reduce their workload if output quality is improved. If implemented effectively, CARES could also shorten client visit time spent on data collection, enhancing the benefits of NCAP for clients. Integrating CARES with the EMRS is critical to maximizing its impact on reducing workload. However, further development is needed to implement this function, requiring continued collaboration with HCWs to ensure it is effective and does not inadvertently increase workload.</p><p>The study has several strengths and limitations. Among strengths, we show that consistent involvement of HCWs who will use an mHealth platform should be central to the design, development, implementation, and evaluation of that mHealth tool. This HCD approach should be required for mHealth to ensure right fit technology for its intended purpose. Second, we demonstrate that application of behavioral theory can help guide understanding and provide insights into mHealth implementation, synthesizing user insights for further optimization. For limitations, the sample size was small but included all NCAP providers who used CARES, an actuality that should be acknowledged. Secondly, the evaluation occurred while the app was still undergoing testing and enhancements; interviews were not repeated after further improvements in technology and usability. Third, the interviewers&#x02019; affiliation with Lighthouse Trust and familiarity with NCAP may have influenced participant responses, a social desirability bias that may have influenced participants&#x02019; responses in either positive or negative directions towards CARES.</p><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec038"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Overall, HCWs largely embraced the promise of the CARES prototype even while recognizing that the reality of current CARES falls short. High levels of HCW involvement in the app&#x02019;s development likely facilitated their commitment to CARES success. The insights obtained from these interviews offered guidance for refining the CARES app, and these recommendations are being systematically addressed through iterative CARES improvements. If incorporated successfully, continued user optimism for the impact of the CARES app to streamline their work and improve client care will be rewarded. In contrast, if the CARES prototype is not enhanced for a smoother user experience in the community and clinic, and integration with the EMRS is not achieved to streamline the data delivery workload, there is a high risk of discontinuation. Continued collaboration among developers, NCAP providers, and other stakeholders, paired with sufficient financial investment in CARES improvement, is the essential next step. Such efforts will facilitate longitudinal assessments to evaluate CARES&#x02019; efficiency in reducing HCW workload, its impact on client outcomes, and its role in strengthening NCAP. With that support, CARES can realize its potential to extend the reach of the EMRS into community settings, ensuring that clients in clinic and community settings receive high-quality, integrated care.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec039" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material id="pone.0303416.s001" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S1 Appendix</label><caption><title>COREQ (COnsolidated criteria for REporting Qualitative research) checklist.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0303416.s001.docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pone.0303416.s002" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S2 Appendix</label><caption><title>Interview Guide.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0303416.s002.docx"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank all the healthcare workers who shared their opinions and experiences in the interviews, the Lighthouse Trust community health services program, and the research department for their partnership in implementing the CARES application.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0303416.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Adebayo</surname><given-names>ES</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Olaniyan</surname><given-names>HO</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Olumide</surname><given-names>AO</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Ogunniyi</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Fawzi</surname><given-names>W</given-names></name>. <article-title>Scalability of mobile technology interventions in the prevention and management of HIV among adolescents in low-income and middle-income countries: protocol for a systematic review</article-title>. <source>BMJ Open</source>. <year>2023</year>;<volume>13</volume>(<issue>7</issue>):e069362. <comment>doi: </comment><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1136/bmjopen-2022-069362</pub-id>
