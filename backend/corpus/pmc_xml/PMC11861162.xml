In the current study, we sought to establish a proof of concept that HIV vaccines using identical designs elicit Tier 2 nAbs in arhesus macaque (RM) model. DNA and MVA vaccines expressing SIV Gag and HIV-1 Env antigens were constructed, and in vitro expression was confirmed. A soluble envelope protein (gp140 Env) was expressed from a stable HEK293 cell line and purified using lectin affinity and size exclusion chromatography. The expression and secretion of SIV Gag and HIV-1 Env by the DNA and MVA vaccines was verified in vitro. Five RMs were inoculated with two DNA, followed by two MVA, and finally with two gp140 Env vaccines at weeks 0, 4, 8, 12, 20 and 28. Vaccine-induced T cell immunity was measured by IFN-&#x003b3; ELISpot while nAbs were evaluated against MW965 (Tier 1A), 6644 (Tier 1B), autologous ZM109.5A and a closely-related ZM109.B4 (Tier 2) pseudovirions. Vaccinated RMs were challenged intrarectally with simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV), four weeks after the final vaccination, as was an unvaccinated control group (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 4). Following vaccination, all the animals developed moderate IFN-&#x003b3; ELISpot responses after the DNA vaccinations which were boosted by the MVA vaccine. After the gp140 Env boost, all animals developed nAbs with peak median titres at 762 (MW965) and 263 (ZM109.5A). The vaccinated animals became infected after a similar number of challenges to the unvaccinated controls, and the resultant number of viral copies in the blood and the lymphoid tissues were similar. However, the duration of detectable viraemia in the vaccinated animals (median: 2 weeks) was shorter than the controls (median: 8.5 weeks). These data show that the vaccines elicited robust cellular and functional humoral immune responses that resulted in a quicker control of viraemia.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>immunogenicity</kwd><kwd>DNA vaccine</kwd><kwd>MVA vaccine</kwd><kwd>gp140 Env</kwd><kwd>SHIV</kwd><kwd>neutralization</kwd><kwd>Chinese rhesus macaques</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>South African Medical Research Council</funding-source><funding-source>South African Department of Science and Innovation</funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source>South African Research Chairs Initiative of the Department of Science and Innovation and the National Research Foundation</funding-source><award-id>98341</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>This research was funded by the South African Medical Research Council with funds received from the South African Department of Science and Innovation.

Introduction</title><p>A heterologous prime-boost strategy comprising DNA&#x02013;MVA&#x02013;Protein remains highly relevant in HIV vaccine research due to the induction of complementary immune responses and the potential of boosting the responses generated by the priming vaccine. A DNA vaccine primarily induces cellular immunity which can be boosted by the MVA vaccine while the protein vaccine component is crucial in generating antibody responses. Previously, our group developed two candidate HIV-1 vaccines (SAAVI DNA-C2 and SAAVI MVA-C) which were then tested in preclinical studies [<xref rid="B1-viruses-17-00277" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-viruses-17-00277" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and early-phase clinical trials (HVTN 073/SAAVI-102; 073E/SAAVI-102E and 086/SAAVI 103) [<xref rid="B3-viruses-17-00277" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-viruses-17-00277" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-viruses-17-00277" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Although these vaccines induced gp140 Env-binding antibodies and Tier 1A virus-neutralizing responses, no Tier 2 or broadly neutralizing antibody activity was observed [<xref rid="B3-viruses-17-00277" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-viruses-17-00277" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In subsequent studies, the SAAVI MVA-C vaccine design was improved by the use of different promoters for the Gag and Env genes and replacing the native Gag gene with an in silico designed subtype C mosaic Gag antigen, resulting in the formation of Gag virus-like particles (VLPs) and much improvement in the induction of Gag-specific cellular responses [<xref rid="B6-viruses-17-00277" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-viruses-17-00277" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Recent research efforts have maintained the inclusion of Gag while focusing on the modification of Env by sequence changes to improve the stability of Env trimers and their transport to the cell surface to generate better cellular and antibody responses to Tier 2 viruses [<xref rid="B8-viruses-17-00277" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-viruses-17-00277" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Our recent research has made improvements to our vaccine candidates which have now been evaluated in the mouse and rabbit animal models [<xref rid="B6-viruses-17-00277" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B10-viruses-17-00277" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-viruses-17-00277" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-viruses-17-00277" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-viruses-17-00277" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-viruses-17-00277" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Briefly, the improvements targeted the polyprotein, consisting of Gag, RT, Tat, Nef (<italic toggle="yes">Grttn</italic>), and Env, which were expressed by the DNA and MVA vectors in our previous SAAVI vaccines. The <italic toggle="yes">Grttn</italic> polyprotein was replaced with a subtype C mosaic Gag that is able to form virus-like particles and the Env was replaced with a modified Env which was derived from an individual in the South African CAPRISA acute infection cohort who developed broadly neutralizing antibodies [<xref rid="B15-viruses-17-00277" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The Env was truncated to gp150; the native leader sequence was replaced with the tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) leader peptide; the Furin cleavage site was replaced with a flexible Gly-rich linker sequence (GGGGSGGGGSG); a stabilizing I559P mutation was introduced into the gp41 region [<xref rid="B10-viruses-17-00277" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-viruses-17-00277" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-viruses-17-00277" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-viruses-17-00277" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-viruses-17-00277" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. This Env, in conjunction with the mosaic Gag, was tested in rabbits in a DNA&#x02013;MVA&#x02013;Protein regimen, with two doses of each vaccine (DDMMPP) and was shown to induce high levels of Tier 1B and low levels of Tier 2 autologous neutralizing antibodies in rabbits [<xref rid="B13-viruses-17-00277" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Based on the DNA, MVA and gp140 protein vaccines used in these rabbit studies, we designed prototype vaccines to be tested in our Chinese rhesus macaque model with the SIV Gag and an HIV-1 subtype C Env corresponding to consensus sequence of the SHIVC109P7 [<xref rid="B16-viruses-17-00277" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], a virus derived from three in vivo serial passages of SHIVC109P4 [<xref rid="B17-viruses-17-00277" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] in Chinese rhesus macaques [<xref rid="B16-viruses-17-00277" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].

The vaccinated animals and a control group comprising of four unvaccinated macaques were challenged with SHIVC109P7.

These responses did not confer protection against the SHIV challenge, but vaccination resulted in a shorter length of viraemia compared with the unvaccinated controls, suggesting that the vaccines enhanced the capacity the immune responses to control viraemia more rapidly.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-viruses-17-00277"><title>2.

Surprisingly, neutralization activities against 6644, a Tier 1B pseudovirus, and against ZM109.B4, a Tier 2 pseudovirus containing the Env sequences derived from the Zambian isolate from which the initial SHIVC109F.PB4 was constructed, were within the background (titer of 96).

Two of five animals (P52 and P4) reached peak titers of 1119 and 595 against ZM109.5A at DDMMP and re-challenge timepoints, respectively.

These vaccines matched the Gag and Env amino acid sequences of the challenge virus, SHIVC109P7, which contained an HIV subtype C transmitted/founder (T/F) Env ZM109F.PB4 envelope protein [<xref rid="B16-viruses-17-00277" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-viruses-17-00277" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-viruses-17-00277" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-viruses-17-00277" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-viruses-17-00277" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. We have previously reported a similar strategy in utilizing DNA and MVA vaccines expressing a subtype C mosaic HIV-1 Gag and HIV-1 CAP256SU envelope, which were tested in a rabbit model [<xref rid="B10-viruses-17-00277" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-viruses-17-00277" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-viruses-17-00277" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-viruses-17-00277" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-viruses-17-00277" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In the current study, DNA and recombinant MVA vaccines were constructed, which stably expressed SIV Gag and HIV-1 Env (<xref rid="viruses-17-00277-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>) and formed SIV Gag VLPs (<xref rid="viruses-17-00277-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>F). These DNA and MVA vaccines incorporating SIV Gag and Env from SHIVC109P7 as well as the soluble gp140 Env were similar to those expressing the mosaic Gag and Env from the HIV-1 CAP256SU and soluble gp140 Env that we tested in rabbit studies [<xref rid="B10-viruses-17-00277" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-viruses-17-00277" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-viruses-17-00277" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-viruses-17-00277" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-viruses-17-00277" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The recent establishment of a SHIV/RM challenge model by our group [<xref rid="B16-viruses-17-00277" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], the only such endeavor in Africa to date, afforded us an opportunity to further evaluate these candidate vaccines in a NHP model where we could assess the potential efficacy of the vaccines.</p><p>We tested the immunogenicity of these vaccines using a similar experimental strategy to our rabbit experiments by evaluating the Env antibody mediated as well as the T cell immune responses after two DNA and later two MVA vaccines, the first and the second Env protein vaccines, and at the point of SHIV challenge (pre-challenge). Using an IFN-&#x003b3; ELISpot method, we observed detectable T cell responses in all the vaccinated animals after the DNA primes and before they received their first MVA booster. This is a noteworthy immunogenicity improvement on the SAAVI DNA-C2 vaccine, which could be attributed to the mammalian expression plasmid pTHPcapR [<xref rid="B22-viruses-17-00277" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] that was used to construct the DNA vaccines. Our SAAVI DNA-C2 vaccine did not elicit detectable IFN-&#x003b3; ELISpot responses even after 3 DNA immunizations (unpublished). As we had observed before, these responses were significantly boosted by the MVA vaccinations. The capacity of the DNA and MVA to form VLPs might also have improved the observed IFN-&#x003b3; ELISpot responses as no further boosting effect, in terms of magnitudes, was achieved by subsequent gp140 Env vaccines. In general, each vaccinated animal responded to each vaccine immunogen but at variable magnitudes, possibly reflecting the immunological effect of diverse host factors, such as the major histocompatibility complex alleles [<xref rid="B48-viruses-17-00277" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="B49-viruses-17-00277" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], as we were unable to characterize them in these monkeys. Although the magnitudes declined steadily during the protein vaccinations, all animals had responses by the time of being challenged with SHIV. Gag-specific T cell responses have previously been associated with better viral control in people with HIV and thus, a T cell response to Gag is a desirable outcome for candidate HIV vaccines. We also saw moderate nAb responses against Tier 1A (MW965) and to the autologous Tier 2 (ZM109.5A). No neutralization responses were generated against 6644 (Tier 1B) and ZM109.B4 (Tier 2) pseudoviruses, indicating that induction of vaccine-specific nAbs was limited against these viruses. In contrast, high-level gp140 Env-binding antibodies were elicited after the first protein boost and maintained at similar levels as those elicited by SHIV infection of the unvaccinated animals. However, these high-level binding antibody responses did not correlate with the nAb activity. Due to lack of resources, this study did not implement assays to examine additional T cell and antibody-mediated vaccine-generated immune responses. Thus, future work will explore T cell multi-functionalities beyond IFN-&#x003b3; ELISpot responses, such as dual IFN-&#x003b3;/IL-2-producing T cells and their memory subsets. For example, the potential role of vaccine-induced mucosal responses has been attributed to SIV-specific CD4<sup>+</sup>/IL2<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup>/IFN-&#x003b3;<sup>+</sup> T cells [<xref rid="B50-viruses-17-00277" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="B51-viruses-17-00277" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Future work should also evaluate vaccine-induced antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and phagocytosis (ADCP) responses to assess the Fc effector functions [<xref rid="B52-viruses-17-00277" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="B53-viruses-17-00277" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>].</p><p>SHIV challenge models have been widely used in HIV vaccine studies (reviewed in: [<xref rid="B54-viruses-17-00277" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] with repetitive intrarectal doses ranging from as low as 10 TCID<sub>50</sub> up to as high as 10,000 TCID<sub>50</sub> (reviewed in [<xref rid="B55-viruses-17-00277" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,<xref rid="B56-viruses-17-00277" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]). In our previous study [<xref rid="B16-viruses-17-00277" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], eight RMs that received i.r. inoculations with undiluted (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 2), a 1:10 (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 2) or a 1:100 (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 4) dilution of the SHIVC109P7 stock were productively infected with a single (undiluted), two (1:10), or 2&#x02013;3 (1:100) challenges. Thus, we had demonstrated that a low dose of 1:100 dilution of our SHIV stock, corresponding to 6000 TCID<sub>50</sub>, was an optimal low-dose for repetitive i.r. challenges in the current study. Furthermore, Ren et al. [<xref rid="B17-viruses-17-00277" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] had used a similar low dose (5000 TCID<sub>50</sub>) of a related parental virus (SHIVC109P4) stock for intrarectal transmission in Indian-origin RMs. Following repeated i.r. challenges with a 1:100 dilution of SHIVC109P7 in the current study, all vaccinated animals acquired the infection within 1&#x02013;4 challenges, similar to the unvaccinated controls. The peak median viraemia and the survival rate with respect to the number of challenges resulting in infection were also similar in both groups, indicating that the vaccines did not provide protection against rectal transmission. These parameters were similar to those we obtained in the SHIVC109P7 infection study. However, we observed in the previous study [<xref rid="B16-viruses-17-00277" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] that all the infected animals rapidly controlled the viraemia to undetectable levels within eight weeks. Therefore, we evaluated if the vaccines had an impact on the rapidity of viraemia control and, surprisingly, the length of detectable viraemia in the vaccinated group was significantly shorter than that of the unvaccinated controls. Among the vaccinated animals, 60% of them had viraemia lasting less than 3 weeks compared with 75% of the unvaccinated controls which had viraemia for more than 3 weeks (<xref rid="viruses-17-00277-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>E). Conceivably, the anticipated rapidity in boosting anti-SHIV memory immune responses in the vaccinated animals could have resulted in more potent anti-SHIV Gag and Env immune responses than in the controls. This was supported by the data showing that vaccination resulted in enhancement of SIV Gag and HIV-1 Env IFN-&#x003b3; ELISpot responses (<xref rid="viruses-17-00277-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>C,D) with the absence of these responses in the control animals coinciding with the time of i.r. challenges. This would have resulted in a lengthy time lag between the start of infection and the onset of effective viral control, reflecting as a longer duration of viraemia. However, the relatively shorter viraemia in the vaccinated animals did not confer any apparent vaccine benefits in terms of less dissemination of SHIV into the crucial viral reservoirs (lymph nodes and spleen) as no statistical difference in the levels of proviral DNA and SIV gag RNA copies could be demonstrated between the vaccinated and unvaccinated groups (<xref rid="viruses-17-00277-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>F,G). It would have been insightful to determine the levels of replication competent viruses in these reservoirs. However, we were unable to do so due to limited resources. Bruner et al. [<xref rid="B57-viruses-17-00277" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] have shown that the majority (&#x0003e;97%) of viral reservoirs had defective viruses during acute HIV-1 infection. Nevertheless, it would have been valuable to evaluate the size of competent proviruses between the vaccinated and unvaccinated animals in our study to understand how vaccine-induced immune responses may have impacted the viral reservoir, albeit the vaccination being non-protective. Future studies could aim to analyze the transcriptional response pre- and post-challenge by applying novel assays such as that described by Bruner et al. [<xref rid="B57-viruses-17-00277" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], which can separately quantify intact and defective proviruses. Recent evidence shows that host immunity exerts selective pressure on reservoir viruses thereby resulting in faster decline of the intact proviral reservoir than defective viruses [<xref rid="B58-viruses-17-00277" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>], suggesting a potential beneficial effect of vaccine-enhanced immune responses. However, the elucidation of the exact mechanism responsible for such an effect was beyond the scope of this study. Recent reports of vaccine efficacy against intrarectal SHIV [<xref rid="B59-viruses-17-00277" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>,<xref rid="B60-viruses-17-00277" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>] have suggested possible mechanisms involving trained innate mucosal immunity such as the stimulation of myeloid cells and expression of platelet factor 4, acting together with antigen-specific T cells. Those studies [<xref rid="B59-viruses-17-00277" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>,<xref rid="B60-viruses-17-00277" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>] postulated that vaccines can cause alteration of the gut microbiome, which in turn can affect resistance to infection or possibly quicker viral clearance via a rapid production of TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-6, and MIP1&#x003b1; by the innate cells [<xref rid="B61-viruses-17-00277" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. The antigen-specific T cells may also confer the necessary specificity to guide the trained innate immune cells to the relevant targets.</p><p>The sequence analysis data of envelope genes of viruses recovered from the PBMCs and inguinal LMNCs at the experimental endpoint showed similar percentages of amino acid changes in the vaccinated (98.14&#x02013;100% identity; 0&#x02013;16 number of amino acids) and unvaccinated (98.37&#x02013;100% identity; 0&#x02013;14 number of amino acids) animals compared with the challenge virus (SHIVC109P7). These data, also demonstrated by the phylogenetic trees (<xref rid="viruses-17-00277-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>), confirmed that only modest changes in the envelope sequence occurred after the virus challenge and subsequent infection phase. Except for a few losses of PNGS (mostly the vaccinated animals) and shifting patterns in PNGS in the V1, C3, and V4 (mostly unvaccinated animals) that were noted (<xref rid="viruses-17-00277-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>, <xref rid="app1-viruses-17-00277" ref-type="app">Supplementary Figure S3A,B</xref>), no gains in PNGS were identified. Taken together, these sequence data suggest that the transmission of challenge virus was not hindered by neutralizing antibodies elicited by the vaccination and the post-infection immune pressure was insufficient to allow the virus to acquire more neutralization resistance. The lack of significant evolution in the env gene during the infection phase could also explain the lack of increased viral replication capacity and depletion of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell that were observed (<xref rid="app1-viruses-17-00277" ref-type="app">Supplementary Figure S4</xref>), which was expected as we had observed in a previous infection study [<xref rid="B16-viruses-17-00277" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Env evolution is associated with increased replication and depletion of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells [<xref rid="B62-viruses-17-00277" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>,<xref rid="B63-viruses-17-00277" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec5-viruses-17-00277"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>In this study, we demonstrated successful generation of a DNA and an MVA vaccine expressing the SIV Gag and HIV-1 gp150, with the capacity to form SIV Gag VLPs in a similar manner to our candidate HIV-1 vaccines expressing mosaic Gag and CAP256SU Env [<xref rid="B10-viruses-17-00277" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B12-viruses-17-00277" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-viruses-17-00277" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Utilizing our recently established nonhuman primate virus challenge model, we showed that these vaccines elicited strong IFN-&#x003b3; ELISpot responses, durable gp140 binding antibodies, and moderate autologous Tier 2 antibody responses when used in a heterologous prime-boost combination with soluble gp140 Env in a proof-of-concept study. Although these responses were not protective against a SHIV challenge, they resulted in a shorter length of viraemia, suggesting a potential role of the vaccination in providing enhanced immune capacity to rapidly control viraemia following breakthrough infections. This vaccine may be a candidate therapeutic vaccine for the control of viraemia.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The original SHIVC109P4 seed stock from which the SHIVC109P was generated was a kind donation by Cecilia Cheng-Mayer of the Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center, New York, USA.
