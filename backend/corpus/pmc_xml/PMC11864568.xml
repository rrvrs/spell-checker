to catalyze hydroformylation,
or the oxo reaction (<xref rid="sch1" ref-type="scheme">Scheme <xref rid="sch1" ref-type="scheme">1</xref></xref>), by Otto Roelen in 1938 while studying Fischer&#x02013;Tropsch
catalysis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref></sup> Heck proposed in 1960 that
HCo(CO)<sub>4</sub> was the catalyst species responsible for hydroformylation,
along with the currently accepted catalytic mechanism.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref></sup> Although HCo(CO)<sub>4</sub> is highly active, one significant problem
is that it readily decomposes to cobalt metal as the temperature is
increased unless enough CO partial pressure is present. Industrial
processes based on HCo(CO)<sub>4</sub> typically run around 180 &#x000b0;C
and use H<sub>2</sub>/CO pressures over 200 bar, which is considered
a high-pressure process.</p><fig id="sch1" position="float"><label>Scheme 1</label><caption><title>Hydroformylation.</title></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ja3c04866_0012" id="gr11" position="float"/></fig><p>Slaugh and Mullineaux at Shell Chemical discovered
in the late
1960s that adding an electron-donating, sterically bulky, alkylated
phosphine ligand to the cobalt(I) center generated the phosphine-modified
catalyst system, HCo(CO)<sub>3</sub>(PR<sub>3</sub>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref></sup> This catalyst had two significant advantages over the unmodified
HCo(CO)<sub>4</sub> catalyst: (1) increased stability toward decomposition
to cobalt metal that allowed considerably lower CO partial pressures
(typically 25&#x02013;30 bar) even at higher temperatures and (2) significantly
increased aldehyde linear/branched (L/B) ratios, typically around
8:1 L/B. The increased L/B aldehyde ratio was particularly important
to Shell because they hydroformylate internal linear alkenes generated
from the Shell higher olefin process (i.e., oligomerization of ethylene).
The phosphine-modified HCo(CO)<sub>3</sub>(PR<sub>3</sub>) catalyst
had high alkene isomerization properties, similar to HCo(CO)<sub>4</sub>, but could be run under medium pressure industrial conditions.</p><p>There are, however, several downsides to the phosphine-modified
cobalt catalyst system. The increased stability toward decomposition
to cobalt metal is due to the &#x003c3;-donation of the phosphine ligand,
which increased the electron-density of the cobalt center, resulting
in stronger &#x003c0;-backbonding to the carbonyl ligands. This dramatically
lowered the activity of the catalyst that is dependent on CO dissociation
for reaction with alkenes and H<sub>2</sub>. Higher temperatures (typically
around 190 &#x000b0;C) and increased catalyst loadings were needed to
compensate for the lower catalyst activity. The increased phosphine
ligand &#x003c3;-donation also increases the hydricity of the catalyst,
which enhances its hydrogenation activity. This hydrogenates the aldehyde
to produce alcohol (desired), but also hydrogenates the alkene reactant
to make alkane (highly undesired). The final problem for the phosphine-modified
cobalt catalyst is that there is some phosphine ligand dissociation,
especially at the higher temperatures used industrially. This generates
the HCo(CO)<sub>4</sub> catalyst that can decompose to cobalt metal.</p><p>Beller and coworkers recently reported that Co(I) hydroformylation
could operate under milder conditions (20&#x02013;40 bar, 60&#x02013;120
&#x000b0;C) through the use of phosphine-oxide promoters.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref></sup> This system basically behaves like a HCo(CO)<sub>4</sub>-stabilized catalyst, but is quite slow with limited turnovers. They
ran their experiments with a 3:1 H<sub>2</sub>/CO gas ratio, which
favors higher initial turnover frequencies, but in a batch autoclave
experiment, it will lead to CO depletion for extended catalytic runs.</p><p>These neutral Co(I) catalyst systems were the only ones known until
2020 when we, in conjunction with researchers at ExxonMobil, reported
a cationic Co(II) chelating bisphosphine catalyst system, [HCo(CO)<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>(bisphosphine)](BF<sub>4</sub>), <italic>x</italic> = 1&#x02013;3, which is active to highly active under a
wide range of temperatures and pressures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></sup> The activity, for example, is only about 20 times slower than the
best rhodium&#x02013;phosphine catalysts for a nonisomerizable alkene
such as <italic>t</italic>-butylethylene. This cationic Co(II) catalyst
behaves in many ways similar to HCo(CO)<sub>4</sub> but with considerably
higher catalyst stability, allowing it to access temperatures and
pressures at which HCo(CO)<sub>4</sub> is unstable. The cationic Co(II)
catalyst also has high alkene isomerization ability analogous to the
neutral Co(I) catalysts. The proposed hydroformylation mechanism is
shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></sup></p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Proposed hydroformylation mechanism for the cationic Co(II)

it appears to
have somewhat higher hydricity compared to HCo(CO)<sub>4</sub> due
to the donating bisphosphine ligand that allows it to hydrogenate
aldehyde to alcohol when the aldehyde concentration builds up enough,
but not hydridic enough to do much hydrogenation of alkene.</p><p>The other significant difference versus the phosphine-modified
cobalt(I) catalyst system is that the cationic Co(II) system generally
has low L/B aldehyde regioselectivity (1:1 to 2:1 L/B) when dealing
with 1-alkenes like 1-hexene, at least with the limited number of
chelating phosphines studied by our research group.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></sup> The reason for this was proposed to be that the primary
alkene coordination site is trans to the chelating bisphosphine (cis
to the hydride), as shown in <xref rid="sch2" ref-type="scheme">Scheme <xref rid="sch2" ref-type="scheme">2</xref></xref>, where it is least affected by the bisphosphine R-groups
that are oriented away from the equatorial region. The axial coordination
sites are too crowded to allow coordination of sterically hindered
alkenes.</p><fig id="sch2" position="float"><label>Scheme 2</label><caption><title>Alkene coordination to equatorial site.</title></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ja3c04866_0013" id="gr12" position="float"/></fig><p>The equatorial CO coordination site, however,
has the strongest
Co&#x02013;CO bond and is thus least likely to dissociate. The 19e<sup>&#x02013;</sup> tricarbonyl was proposed to play an important role,
along with the localized cationic charge on the cobalt center, in
helping labilize the equatorial carbonyl and allowing coordination
of the alkene to initiate hydroformylation. Evidence for the 19e<sup>&#x02013;</sup> tricarbonyl catalyst came from in situ FT-IR studies
that show a high frequency carbonyl band at 2086 cm<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> for the [HCo(CO)<sub>3</sub>(DPPBz)](BF<sub>4</sub>) catalyst (DPPBz
= (Ph<sub>2</sub>P)<sub>2</sub>-1,2-C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></sup></p><p>The other data supporting the role of the
19e<sup>&#x02013;</sup> tricarbonyl species comes from the fact that
a higher catalyst activity
is seen for the cationic Co(II) catalyst with electron-donating bisphosphine
ligands such as Et<sub>2</sub>PCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>PEt<sub>2</sub> (depe) and (Et<sub>2</sub>P)<sub>2</sub>-1,2-C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub> (DEPBz). There are no examples of either Co(I) or Rh(I)
hydroformylation catalysts having higher activity with electron-donating
phosphine ligands. More electron-donating phosphines favor the 19e<sup>&#x02013;</sup> tricarbonyl complex, [HCo(CO)<sub>3</sub>(bisphosphine)]<sup>+</sup>, which in turn helps labilize the more strongly coordinated
equatorial CO ligand&#x02014;the coordination site preferred by alkenes.</p><p>Franke and Zhang recently reported studies on HCo(CO)<sub>4</sub> hydroformylation catalysis in which they report stability of this
catalyst under medium pressure conditions and temperatures (e.g.,
20 bar 1:1 H<sub>2</sub>/CO, 140 &#x000b0;C).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></sup> The higher temperature/pressure sensitivity of HCo(CO)<sub>4</sub> was shown by decomposition occurring at 20 bar and 160 &#x000b0;C.
Additionally, they claimed to have prepared the cationic Co(II) catalyst
precursor, [Co(acac)(DPPBz)](BF<sub>4</sub>), (acac = acetoacetonate)]
and reported that it had low activity. They, furthermore, suggested
that HCo(CO)<sub>4</sub> was likely the true catalyst in the cationic
Co(II) bisphosphine catalyst system.</p><p>Reported herein are additional
in situ infrared spectroscopy (IR),
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and electron paramagnetic resonance
(EPR) studies of the cationic Co(II) bisphosphine catalyst system.
Reaction studies to probe the possible role of HCo(CO)<sub>4</sub> as a significant component were performed and, along with the spectroscopic
studies, demonstrate that [HCo(CO)<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>(bisphosphine)]<sup>+</sup>, <italic>x</italic> = 1&#x02013;3, is the dominant hydroformylation
catalyst system.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>In Situ FT-IR Studies</title><p>A number of in situ FT-IR studies

This appears at room temperature (10&#x02013;30 bar) and stays about
the same as the temperature is increased to 120 &#x000b0;C over the course
of 2.5 h. The catalyst precursor starts to activate and react with
H<sub>2</sub> fairly quickly once the temperature reaches 120 &#x000b0;C.</p><p>A heterolytic reaction of H<sub>2</sub> and [Co(acac)(CO)(DPPBz)]<sup>+</sup> is proposed to dissociate acetylacetone (Hacac) and form

1&#x02013;3. The equilibrium mixture of the various carbonyl complexes
has carbonyl bands ranging from 2088 to 1974 cm<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>, with major carbonyl bands at 2027&#x02013;2025 and 1990 cm<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>. The 1937 cm<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> band representing the carbonyl-coordinated
catalyst precursor, [Co(acac)(CO)(DPPBz)]<sup>+</sup>, gradually decreases
over time.</p><p>Most surprising was the formation of a strong carbonyl

1888 cm<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>, and if this carbonyl band was due to
[Co(CO)<sub>4</sub>]<sup>&#x02212;</sup> anion, it would indicate that
the cationic Co(II) catalyst was falling apart to generate a mixture
of HCo(CO)<sub>4</sub> and [Co(CO)<sub>4</sub>]<sup>&#x02212;</sup> anion. As will be discussed later, the 1888 cm<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> carbonyl band is proposed to be due to a dicationic CO-bridged cobalt(I)
dimer and not [Co(CO)<sub>4</sub>]<sup>&#x02212;</sup> anion.</p><p>Continued heating of the catalyst at 120 &#x000b0;C, however, caused
the carbonyl band at 1888 cm<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> to decrease in intensity.
Raising the temperature to 140 &#x000b0;C and pressure to 54.2 bar (1:1
H<sub>2</sub>/CO) caused an even quicker decrease in the 1888 cm<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> band. Lowering the temperature back to room temperature
(23 &#x000b0;C) reforms the 1888 cm<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> peak and a similar
set of carbonyl bands representing the catalyst complexes between
2088 and 1974 cm<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>. The complex representing the
1888 cm<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> band is favored at lower temperatures
and strongly disfavored at 120&#x02013;140 &#x000b0;C.</p><p>Several heating

1888 cm<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> band to reappear. Heating at room temperature
and increasing the temperature to 120&#x02013;140 &#x000b0;C causes the

of carbonyl bands to the various carbonyl containing catalyst species.
These are consistent with the number of carbonyl bands expected for
each species as well as the shifting to higher frequencies for the
complexes with higher numbers of carbonyl ligands. They also agree
qualitatively with the DFT-predicted carbonyl frequencies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></sup></p><p><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref> shows the

Although the square-pyramidal cobalt(I) center is expected to be formally
diamagnetic, the close proximity and coupling to the high-spin tetrahedral
Co(I) center makes the entire complex paramagnetic. The dimer is proposed
to also form via the reaction of the catalyst [HCo(CO)<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>(bisphosphine)]<sup>+</sup>, <italic>x</italic> =

that as the catalyst precursor starts to react with H<sub>2</sub> to
form the catalyst, the 1888 cm<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> band due to dimer
also forms at the same time. During the initial formation of [HCo(CO)<sub>2</sub>(bisphosphine)]<sup>+</sup>, the concentration of the catalyst
precursor, [Co(acac)(bisphosphine)]<sup>+</sup>, is quite high and
can react with the catalyst to directly form the dimer. The 120 &#x000b0;C

complex in the IR study (10 mM) compared to the catalytic runs (typically
1 mM) certainly could favor the dimer complex at lower temperatures.
Catalysis, however, is typically done at temperatures where the dimer
is unstable (&#x0003e;100 &#x000b0;C) and unlikely to play much of a role.</p><p>Kaim and coworkers reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref></sup> the cationic

catalyst was somewhat surprising
because carbonyls are typically considered strong-field ligands. The
localized cationic charge on the cobalt center, however, contracts
the d orbitals and reduces &#x003c0;-backbonding to the carbonyl ligands,
which is a major component of a carbonyl ligand&#x02019;s strong field
characteristics. The EPR likely is a mixture of the 17e<sup>&#x02013;</sup> [HCo(CO)<sub>2</sub>(DPPBz)]<sup>+</sup> and 19e<sup>&#x02013;</sup> [HCo(CO)<sub>3</sub>(DPPBz)]<sup>+</sup> complexes. The IR spectra
(<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>, last spectrum)
clearly show that the 2086 cm<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> carbonyl band assigned
to the 19e<sup>&#x02013;</sup> [HCo(CO)<sub>3</sub>(DPPBz)]<sup>+</sup> complex increases in intensity at lower temperatures and higher
CO concentrations, conditions certainly present in the EPR studies.</p><p>The combination of the localized cationic charge and high-spin
nature of the catalyst offers an excellent explanation for its high
activity. The cationic charge reduces the carbonyl &#x003c0;-backbonding,
making them more labile and allowing easier coordination of alkene
and H<sub>2</sub>. The high-spin electronic configuration also works
to weaken cobalt&#x02013;ligand bonding, which appears to mainly affect
the carbonyl ligands. Indeed, this is a key factor as to why chelating
bisphosphine ligands are critical for this catalyst system. The chelate
effect plays a key role in compensating for the high-spin electronic
configuration, which also weakens the cobalt&#x02013;phosphine bonding.</p><p>This is the only effective high-spin hydroformylation catalyst
known, although other radical and high-spin state catalysts have been
studied.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref></sup> The stability of the catalyst in the absence of excess
phosphine ligand is unique among phosphine-modified cobalt and rhodium
hydroformylation catalysts. This is especially odd given the high-spin
nature of the catalyst that weakens the cobalt&#x02013;phosphine bonding
to some extent. One explanation is that dissociating the chelating
bisphosphine ligand is thermodynamically very unfavorable. Neither
alkene, H<sub>2</sub>, nor carbonyl ligands coordinate strongly enough
to the cationic cobalt(II) center to compensate for the loss of the
donating bisphosphine ligand under normal catalytic conditions. Co(I)
and Rh(I) hydroformylation catalysts, on the other hand, are electron-rich
enough to favor coordination of &#x003c0;-backbonding carbonyl ligands
to displace phosphine ligands.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.4"><title>DFT Studies and Spin State</title><p>DFT computational studies

explain why more electron-donating bisphosphine ligands improve catalysis
by pumping more electron-density onto the acyl ligand, which lowers
the barrier for the heterolyic activation of H<sub>2</sub> to eliminate
aldehyde and reform the catalyst complex. This may indicate that for

the actual catalyst is present in too low concentrations to be observed
spectroscopically and whether what one is observing spectroscopically
are noncatalytically relevant side-equilibria. There are quite a few
similarities between the cationic Co(II) bisphosphine catalyst [HCo(CO)<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>(DPPBz)]<sup>+</sup>, <italic>x</italic> =
1&#x02013;3, and HCo(CO)<sub>4</sub>. Both are highly active toward
sterically hindered branched internal alkenes that are very difficult
to hydroformylate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></sup> They both have similarly
low aldehyde regioselectivities for 1-alkenes such as 1-hexene (&#x0223c;1:1
L/B for the bisphosphine ligands studied) and are highly active alkene
isomerization catalysts.</p><p>The main difference is the higher stability
of [HCo(CO)<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>(bisphosphine)]<sup>+</sup> toward decomposition to cobalt metal under a variety of temperature&#x02013;pressure
conditions and the greater ability to hydrogenate aldehyde to alcohol
when the aldehyde concentration is high relative to alkene. The cationic
Co(II) bisphosphine catalyst system has a maximum operating temperature
of around 170&#x02013;180 &#x000b0;C at the highest pressure studied (90
bar).</p><p>The possibility of HCo(CO)<sub>4</sub> being formed from
[HCo(CO)<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>(DPPBz)]<sup>+</sup> was probed
by adding
monodentate phosphine. The Shell phosphine-modified cobalt catalyst
is essentially generated by adding an alkylated sterically bulky phosphine
ligand to HCo(CO)<sub>4</sub> to form HCo(CO)<sub>3</sub>(PR<sub>3</sub>). This generates a much slower hydroformylation catalyst, but one
that produces L/B aldehyde selectivities around 6&#x02013;8:1 compared
to only around 1:1 for HCo(CO)<sub>4</sub>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref></sup> The phosphine ligand also makes it a better hydrogenation catalyst,
which converts aldehyde to alcohol (desired), as well as alkene to
alkane (undesired).</p><p>A 1-hexene hydroformylation run was performed
using the phosphine-modified
cobalt(I) catalyst system: Co(acac)<sub>2</sub> and 3 equiv of PBu<sub>3</sub> as the model phosphine (2 mM Co, 180 &#x000b0;C, 50 bar H<sub>2</sub>/CO, 6 mM PBu<sub>3</sub>, 1.0 M 1-hexene, dimethoxytetraglyme).
The temperature was increased to 180 &#x000b0;C and the catalyst concentration
was doubled due to the slowness of the phosphine-modified cobalt catalyst.
Only a 1:1 H<sub>2</sub>/CO ratio was used to limit the aldehyde and
alkene hydrogenation reactions. The initial TOF was 4.5/min and after
an hour, the following was observed: 6:1 L/B aldehyde regioselectivity,
24.6% aldehyde, 60.3% alkene isomerization, 4% alcohol, and 1% alkane.</p><p>1 equiv of PBu<sub>3</sub> was then used to probe its effect on
the [HCo(CO)<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>(DPPBz)]<sup>+</sup> catalyst
system (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="other">Table <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="other">1</xref></xref>). The

down by about half and reduce alkene isomerization. Both are expected
if the PBu<sub>3</sub> is only acting as an inhibitory ligand blocking

coordination. Similar inhibitory results were obtained using 10% acetonitrile

and have facile dissociation equilibria under catalytic conditions.
Even Rh(I) hydroformylation catalysts that use chelating bisphosphines
are typically run with 3&#x02013;5 equiv of excess bisphosphine ligand.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref></sup></p><p>The high activity of Rh(I) often leads

fully support
the proposed cationic Co(II) bisphosphine catalyst system: [HCo(CO)<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>(bisphosphine)](BF<sub>4</sub>), <italic>x</italic> = 1&#x02013;3. The EPR studies indicate a high-spin, <italic>S</italic> = 3/2, catalyst. The spectroscopic and reaction studies
do not support the formation or the role of Co(I) catalysts such as
HCo(CO)<sub>4</sub>, HCo(CO)<sub>3</sub>(phosphine) or the Co(&#x02212;1)
complex [Co(CO)<sub>4</sub>]<sup>&#x02212;</sup>. The combination of
a localized cationic charge on the cobalt center along with the high-spin
electronic configuration offers an excellent explanation for the high
activity of this catalyst system. The localized cationic charge on
the cobalt contracts the d-orbitals and reduces the carbonyl &#x003c0;-backbonding,
which weakens the Co&#x02013;carbonyl bonding and facilitates CO dissociation.
The same role of localized cationic charge increasing the hydroformylation
activity has been observed for the dirhodium tetraphosphine catalyst
system studied by our group.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref></sup></p><p>The high-spin
electronic configuration adds to the weakening of
the Co&#x02013;carbonyl bonding and contributes to the high activity.
The chelating bisphosphine ligand plays a critical role via stronger
coordination to compensate for the high-spin weakening of the Co&#x02013;phosphine
bonding. Monodentate phosphine ligands do not generate active cationic
Co(II) hydroformylation catalysts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></sup> Electron-donating
bisphosphine ligands generate more active cationic Co(II) catalysts
by increasing the electron-density on the hydride and transferring
more electron density to the acyl ligand. Increasing the partial negative
charge on the acyl ligand lowers the activation barrier for the heterolytic
cleavage of H<sub>2</sub> and elimination of the aldehyde product.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref></sup></p><p>Electron-donating bisphosphine ligands
also increase the partial
negative charge on the catalyst precursor&#x02019;s acac ligand, [Co(acac)(bisphosphine)]<sup>+</sup>, allowing easier and lower temperature heterolytic activation
of H<sub>2</sub> to generate the catalyst. For example, the DPPBz-based
Co(II) catalyst precursor requires temperatures of 120&#x02013;140
&#x000b0;C to quickly activate, while the stronger donating DEPBz or
depe catalyst precursors activate rapidly around 100 &#x000b0;C.</p><p>The ability to form 19e<sup>&#x02013;</sup> complexes plays an important
role in weakening the stronger coordinated equatorial Co&#x02013;CO
ligand to enhance dissociation and allow coordination of alkene to
the sterically preferred equatorial site. Basolo demonstrated that
the carbonyl substitution chemistry for the 17e<sup>&#x02013;</sup> V(CO)<sub>6</sub> radical proceeds 10<sup>10</sup> times faster
than for 18e<sup>&#x02013;</sup> Cr(CO)<sub>6</sub>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref></sup> The phosphine substitution reaction with the 17e<sup>&#x02013;</sup> V(CO)<sub>6</sub> radical proceeding through a 19e<sup>&#x02013;</sup> transition state was shown to be associative and extremely facile.
The 18e<sup>&#x02013;</sup> [V(CO)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>&#x02212;</sup> anion,
in marked contrast, is inert toward phosphine substitution reactions.</p><p>Although the [HCo(CO)<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>(bisphosphine)]<sup>+</sup>, <italic>x</italic> = 1&#x02013;3, catalyst system uses many
of the same mechanistic steps seen for other hydroformylation catalysts,
there are several unique aspects. The first being that H<sub>2</sub> is activated via a heterolytic cleavage mechanism, which does not
involve any change in the metal center&#x02019;s oxidation state. The
radical nature of the catalyst allows the formation of 19e<sup>&#x02013;</sup> complexes that play an important role in weakening the Co&#x02013;carbonyl
bonding and enhancing carbonyl dissociation, especially from the key
equatorial Co&#x02013;CO coordination site. The localized cationic
charge and high-spin electronic state of the cobalt center also work
together to weaken the Co&#x02013;carbonyl bonding, increasing the
activity of the catalyst.</p><p>The heterolytic H<sub>2</sub> activation
combined with the various
electronic factors discussed above enables higher catalytic activity
with electron-rich chelating bisphosphine ligands. This is unique
for any other known hydroformylation catalyst system, especially since
high catalyst stability is seen with no excess phosphine ligand. Although
the cationic Co(II) catalyst system currently has low L/B aldehyde
selectivity with 1-hexene for the limited number of chelating bisphosphine
ligands studied, there is certainly potential for developing catalysts
with much higher L/B selectivity.</p></sec></body><back><notes id="notes1" notes-type="si"><title>Supporting Information Available</title><p>The Supporting Information is
