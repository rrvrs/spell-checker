Inflammatory response plays a key role in pathogenesis and is initiated through the recognition of virulence factors. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is one of the major virulence factors of <italic toggle="yes">N. meningitis</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">H. influenzae</italic>, and plays a key role in the induction of septic shock [<xref rid="pone.0324153.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. While <italic toggle="yes">S. pneumoniae</italic> does not express LPS, evidence suggests that sepsis promotes gut barrier dysfunction, which releases large amounts of LPS into host blood [<xref rid="pone.0324153.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324153.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In a vicious cycle, this may in turn influence a systemic inflammatory cascade, leading to multiple organ dysfunction and/or death [<xref rid="pone.0324153.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324153.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. There are biomarkers capable of reflecting this intestinal dysfunction. For example, intestinal fatty acid binding protein (I-FABP) is a marker of intestinal damage (ID), released into circulation when the integrity of enterocyte membranes in the small intestine is compromised. Primarily expressed in enterocytes, I-FABP plays a critical role in fatty acid transport. Elevated plasma I-FABP levels indicate intestinal mucosal injury or ischemia and are used as a biomarker in conditions like inflammatory bowel disease and acute intestinal ischemia. In healthy individuals, plasma I-FABP levels typically range between 200&#x02013;600 pg/ml [<xref rid="pone.0324153.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324153.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>As patients suffering from bacterial meningitis often present with sepsis, our study aimed to investigate if pneumococcal meningitis is associated with high circulating levels of LPS in a cohort of patients, compared with healthy volunteers. If the hypothesis is confirmed, it could offer new therapeutic avenues, such as LPS apheresis or the administration of recombinant plasma phospholipid transfer protein, which is likely to remove LPS or to inactivate it.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>We conducted a cross-sectional study including 24 patients with pneumococcal meningitis from a longitudinal, observational, prospective cohort study (Hyalo-Strepto project, NCT01931800) approved by the National Commission on Informatics and Liberty and by the local ethics committee (Comit&#x000e9; de Protection des Personnes Est I). Oral consent was obtained from the patient or their legal representative. From January 1, 2005 to December 31, 2022, at the Dijon-Bourgogne University hospital, patients meeting the following 3 criteria were included: (i) aged 18 years or older who provided oral consent; (ii) diagnosis of acute meningitis defined as an acute illness with typical clinical signs (headaches, neck stiffness, sensitivity to light, nausea, confusion) and CSF pleiocytosis (&#x02265;5/mm3), and (iii) positive CSF culture and/or blood culture for <italic toggle="yes">S. pneumoniae</italic>. Whole blood was collected at admission using citrate tube, once the result of positive culture was communicated, and the plasma was stored.</p><p>We included 34 healthy volunteers (HV) between April and June 2022, from an observational, prospective cohort study (Lymphonie project, NCT03505281) that was approved by the local ethics committee (Comit&#x000e9; de Protection des Personnes SUD MEDITERRANEE V; 2017-A03404-49). Inclusion criteria were: (i) individuals aged 18 years or older who provided oral consent; (ii) absence of fever, antibiotic use or surgery in the last 30 days, (iii) temperature&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;37.8&#x000b0;C the day of inclusion, absence of suspected infection, (iv) no immune deficiency. Citrated whole blood was obtained and the plasma was stored.</p><p>Data were collected using standardized report forms and were fully anonymized before analyses. Comorbid conditions, including those that could lead to intestinal ischemia, were rigorously assessed.</p><p>Human plasma IL-6 and intestinal-fatty-acid-binding protein (i-FABP; considered as a biomarker of intestinal damage) concentrations were determined with an ELISA assay (R&#x00026;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA).</p><p>LPS plasma concentrations were determined using a patented high performance mass spectrometry method (liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)) (EndoQuant) for detection of 3-OH fatty acids (C10, C12, C14, C16 and C18), which are molecules bound to the lipid A motif of LPS [<xref rid="pone.0324153.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324153.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Briefly, plasma was spiked with an internal standard (3-hydroxydecanoic, 3-hydroxydodecanoic, 3-hydroxytridecanoic, 3-hydroxyhexadecanoic and 3-hydroxyoctadecdienoic acids). Samples were hydrolysed in 8-M hydrochloric acid for 3&#x02009;h at 90 &#x000b0;C. Free fatty acids were extracted with distilled water and a mix of hexane/ ethyl acetate (3/2 v/v). The organic phase was discarded by evaporation. The dried extracts were solubilized in ethanol and injected on a ZORBAX SB-C18 column (Agilent) coupled with an infinity 1260 HPLC binary system (Agilent) for fatty acid separation. MS/MS detection was performed using a QQQ 6490 triple quadruple mass spectrometer (Agilent). 3OH-fatty acids quantitation was performed by negative SRM mode as previously described [<xref rid="pone.0324153.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324153.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The esterified form of 3-OH fatty acids (bound to LPS) was calculated as the total-free concentrations. Total LPS concentrations were the sum of each esterified form of 3-OH fatty acids concentrations.</p><p>Qualitative variables were presented as numbers (percentage) and compared using the &#x003c7;2 test (or Fisher&#x02019;s exact test when appropriate). Continuous variables were presented as medians (interquartile range, IQR) and compared with the Mann-Whitney U-test. A <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> value lower than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

The gastrointestinal tract contains trillions of microorganisms, mainly Gram-negative bacteria, that exist symbiotically with a tolerant intestinal immune system. In sepsis, the intestinal dysfunction that occurs could be associated with endotoxemia through bacterial translocation, enhancing inflammatory response [<xref rid="pone.0324153.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324153.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. A preclinical study showed that pneumococcal sepsis was associated with translocation of peptidoglycan from the gut into systemic circulation and likely to prime neutrophil function [<xref rid="pone.0324153.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Pneumococcal meningitis is a model of choice to test this hypothesis since <italic toggle="yes">S. pneumoniae</italic> does not produce LPS. In addition, pneumococcal meningitis is associated with high mortality, as confirmed in our study with a 25% 30-day mortality, and the majority of patients being admitted to ICU with multiple organ dysfunction. Finally, it is also associated with an intense systemic inflammatory response, as confirmed in our study by the high level of C-reactive protein, IL-6 and neutrophils, which are well known biomarkers of LPS-induced inflammation. However, our data does not support the &#x0201c;intestinal hypothesis&#x0201d; since the plasma LPS concentrations were not higher in pneumococcal meningitis, and neither was plasma iFABP. In addition, we observed that pneumococcal pneumonia was not associated with enhanced plasma LPS concentrations in a preclinical rabbit model or when patients were compared to HV [<xref rid="pone.0324153.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>As previously discussed, quantifying LPS is challenging, leading to discrepancies depending on the method used, particularly with regard to false positives in the LAL assay [<xref rid="pone.0324153.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. To address this, we employed a validated method to measure the most abundant 3-OH-fatty acids in lipid A, enabling sensitive, accurate, and direct quantification of total LPS levels in plasma [<xref rid="pone.0324153.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324153.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324153.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>In addition, we observed that the surrogate marker of gut leakage, namely iFABP concentrations, were actually lower in meningitis patients than in healthy volunteers. This has also been observed in the context of pneumonia, whether of viral (COVID-19) or bacterial (<italic toggle="yes">S. pneumoniae</italic>) origin [<xref rid="pone.0324153.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324153.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Other studies have also demonstrated higher concentrations of iFABP in healthy volunteers compared to patients with mesenteric ischemia, a condition well-known for its association with intestinal injury [<xref rid="pone.0324153.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Additionally, no underlying diseases causing intestinal ischemia were identified in healthy individuals. However, these discrepancies between studies could be attributed to the different tools used to measure iFABP, or the timing of the iFABP measurement. In our study, sample from meningitis patients were collected as soon as the pneumococcal strain was identified, approximately two days after admission. We cannot rule out the possibility of an earlier increase in iFABP levels occurring immediately upon admission, followed by a subsequent decrease, as iFABP concentrations may decline with the resolution of intestinal damage.</p><p>If our study does not support the intestinal hypothesis, high levels of systemic inflammation are primarily related to the host&#x02019;s response against the pathogen and its numerous virulence factors, including pneumolysin and the capsule, during invasive pneumococcal infection [<xref rid="pone.0324153.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324153.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Our study has several limits. First, we included a small number of patients, but pneumococcal meningitis is infrequent and this type of prospective cohort with biobanking is rare. Then, we observed a difference between patients and volunteers due to the immunocompromised status of some patients, which could bias the interpretation of plasma endotoxin concentrations. However, as immunocompromised patients are more susceptible to bacterial translocation, this bias can be considered conservative, and not an issue to interpret our data as LPS concentrations were not increased in patients compared to healthy volunteers. Finally, our method only measured LPS mass, but we did not exclude an increased LPS activity in plasma.</p><p>In conclusion, endotoxin levels were unchanged in pneumococcal meningitis. Unlike <italic toggle="yes">N. meningitidis</italic> or <italic toggle="yes">H. influenzae</italic> meningitis, these results indicate that LPS does not drive the excessive systemic inflammatory response and the resulted multiorgan dysfunction in pneumococcal meningitis.</p></sec><sec id="sec005" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material id="pone.0324153.s001" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S1 Data</label><caption><title>Supplemental data raw data of the 34 healthy volunteers (HV) and the 24 patients concerning plasma LPS, C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin 6 (IL-6) and intestinal-Fatty-acid-binding protein (iFABP) plasma concentrations.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0324153.s001.xlsx"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank Julie Quantin from the CIC-P for the inclusion of healthy volunteers, Sandrine Gohier, Carole Charles and Delphine Croisier from the Infectious department for the inclusion of patients.

(Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)</p><p>Reviewer #1:&#x000a0;Dear Authors,</p><p>Where is intestinal Fatty Acid Binding Protein found, what functions does it perform, what does its height indicate. Which diseases are valuable in measuring intestinal Fatty Acid Binding Protein? Is there a defined normal value for intestinal Fatty Acid Binding Protein? It is recommended to specify in the introduction section.</p><p>How do you explain the finding of higher intestinal Fatty Acid Binding Protein levels in healthy individuals, contrary to the hypothesis of your study?</p><p>Are you sure that there is no disease that causes intestinal ischemia in individuals defined as healthy individuals? If you are sure, please state this in the material method</p><p>Reviewer #2:&#x000a0;General comment &#x02013; This is a very interesting research question that aims to define a role, if any, of LPS in the systemic inflammatory response during pneumococcal meningitis. The study is well written and diligently conducted. The results are significant and relevant, adding good information for understanding the pathophysiology of this disease.</p><p>There are some points the authors should review, as follows</p><p>1. In Introduction section correct, in Line 3, Neisseria meningitidis (N. meningitidis)</p><p>2. Which was the time frame for including healthy volunteers? Describe it in the manuscript</p><p>3. The dried extract extracts - remove the duplicate word</p><p>4. &#x0201c;Then, we observed a difference between patients and volunteers, considering immunocompromised status, which may introduce a potential bias in the interpretation of plasma endotoxin concentrations. Since immunocompromised patients are susceptible to gut translocation, this can nevertheless be considered as a conservative bias&#x0201d;- I stopped at this sentence. I read it and reread it several times, but I didn't really understand what you meant by it. Would you please rephrase it? The difference observed for biomarkers was expected.</p><p>**********</p><p>6.

"Where is intestinal Fatty Acid Binding Protein found, what functions does it perform, what does its height indicate. Which diseases are valuable in measuring intestinal Fatty Acid Binding Protein? Is there a defined normal value for intestinal Fatty Acid Binding Protein? It is recommended to specify in the introduction section."</p><p>o Response: We have added detailed information in the Introduction section regarding the location, functions, and clinical relevance of iFABP.</p><p>" There are biomarkers capable of reflecting this intestinal dysfunction. For example, intestinal fatty acid binding protein (I-FABP) is a marker of intestinal damage (ID), released into circulation when the integrity of enterocyte membranes in the small intestine is compromised. Primarily expressed in enterocytes, I-FABP plays a critical role in fatty acid transport. Elevated plasma I-FABP levels indicate intestinal mucosal injury or ischemia and are used as a biomarker in conditions like inflammatory bowel disease and acute intestinal ischemia. In healthy individuals, plasma I-FABP levels typically range between 200-600 pg/ml (1,2)"</p><p>2. "How do you explain the finding of higher intestinal Fatty Acid Binding Protein levels in healthy individuals, contrary to the hypothesis of your study?"</p><p>o Response: In the Discussion section, we addressed the point that &#x0201c;we observed that the surrogate marker of gut leakage, namely iFABP concentrations, were actually lower in meningitis patients than in healthy volunteers. This finding has also been reported in the context of COVID-19 and pneumococcal pneumonia (3,4)&#x0201d; Other studies have shown higher concentrations of iFABP in healthy volunteers compared to patients with mesenteric ischemia, a condition associated with intestinal injury (5). While one might hypothesize an analytical error, the concentrations obtained in our healthy volunteers (432 (248-651) pg/ml) fall within the known average ranges (i.e., 200&#x02013;600 pg/ml). The question of differences between the assay tools used can also be raised. Nevertheless, some authors have validated these observations using multiple techniques (5). iFABP levels in some healthy individuals may reflect non-pathological individual variations, such as oxidative stress or age-related factors. However, age was balanced between the two groups, and no underlying diseases causing intestinal ischemia were identified in healthy individuals. Finally, the timing of measurements could explain some discrepancies in results between studies. iFABP is an early marker of intestinal epithelial damage; however, its concentration may decrease as the damage resolves, which can result in variability depending on the timing of sample collection. In our study, samples from meningitis patients were collected as soon as the pneumococcal strain was identified, approximately two days after admission. We cannot rule out the possibility of an earlier increase in iFABP levels occurring immediately upon admission, followed by a subsequent decrease.</p><p>&#x0201c;In addition, we observed that the surrogate marker of gut leakage, namely iFABP concentrations, were actually lower in meningitis patients than in healthy volunteers. This has also been reported in the setting of COVID-19 and pneumococcal pneumonia (9,13). Other studies have also demonstrated higher concentrations of iFABP in healthy volunteers compared to patients with mesenteric ischemia, a condition well-known for its association with intestinal injury (14). Additionally, no underlying diseases causing intestinal ischemia were identified in healthy individuals. However, these discrepancies between studies could be attributed to the different tools used to measure iFABP, or the timing of the iFABP measurement. In our study, sample from meningitis patients were collected as soon as the pneumococcal strain was identified, approximately two days after admission. We cannot rule out the possibility of an earlier increase in iFABP levels occurring immediately upon admission, followed by a subsequent decrease, as iFABP concentrations may decline with the resolution of intestinal damage.&#x0201d;</p><p>3. "Are you sure that there is no disease that causes intestinal ischemia in individuals defined as healthy individuals? If you are sure, please state this in the material method."</p><p>o Response: We updated the Methods section to specify : &#x0201c;Comorbid conditions, including those that could lead to intestinal ischemia, were rigorously assessed.&#x0201d; And in the results section : &#x0201c;and 34 HV, none of whom had conditions predisposing to intestinal ischemia.&#x0201d;</p><p>Response to Reviewer #2:</p><p>1. General comment &#x02013; This is a very interesting research question that aims to define a role, if any, of LPS in the systemic inflammatory response during pneumococcal meningitis. The study is well written and diligently conducted. The results are significant and relevant, adding good information for understanding the pathophysiology of this disease. There are some points the authors should review, as follows</p><p>o Response: We thank the Reviewer 2 for these positive and kind comments.</p><p>2. "In Introduction section correct, in Line 3, Neisseria meningitidis (N. meningitidis)"</p><p>o Response: The requested correction has been made in the Introduction section.</p><p>3. "Which was the time frame for including healthy volunteers? Describe it in the manuscript."</p><p>o Response: We added to the Methods section that healthy volunteers were included between April and June 2022.</p><p>4. "The dried extract extracts - remove the duplicate word"</p><p>o Response: The typographical error has been corrected.</p><p>5. " Then, we observed a difference between patients and volunteers, considering immunocompromised status, which may introduce a potential bias in the interpretation of plasma endotoxin concentrations.
