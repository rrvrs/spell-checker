</self-uri><abstract><p>Acute Ischemic Stroke (AIS) is a major cause of death and disability worldwide. AIS patients with hyperglycemia demonstrate a potential risk to enhance severity and mortality rates. Glycemic markers, including blood glucose, hemoglobin A1c, and stress hyperglycemia ratio (SHR), have currently been reported to predict unfavorable outcomes in these patients. However, the ability of novel glucose-related blood biomarkers, such as the glucose to albumin ratio (GAR), glucose to estimated average glucose ratio (GAGR), and glucose to potassium ratio (GPR), to predict severe AIS patients and in-hospital mortality in Thailand remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the utility of novel glucose related-blood biomarkers in predicting severity and in-hospital mortality among AIS patients. We conducted a retrospective single-center analysis of data from patients admitted to the Stroke Unit at Saraburi Hospital between January 1 and December 31, 2023. A total of 351 AIS patients were examined, with 191 (54.4%) presenting severe cases, and 31 (8.8%) died in the hospital. We demonstrated that the GAR was superior to SHR, GAGR, and GPR in predicting severity, showing an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.672 (95% CI: 0.614&#x02013;0.731), yielding a sensitivity of 72.8% and a specificity of 56.6%. However, the SHR showed a highest AUC of 0.832 (95% CI: 0.734&#x02013;0.930) in predicting in-hospital mortality, with sensitivity and specificity of 87.1% and 64.7%, respectively. Furthermore, AIS patients with GAR&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;30.0 and SHR&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;18.0 had a 12.761 and 12.365-fold increased risk of death (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001), respectively. Our study indicates that, besides SHR, GAR may serve as a predictive and cost-effective biomarker for predicting severe cases and in-hospital mortality of AIS, facilitating early triage even with limited resources.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The author(s) received no specific funding for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="5"/><table-count count="6"/><page-count count="16"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All relevant data are within the manuscript and its <xref rid="sec016" ref-type="sec">Supporting Information</xref> files.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All relevant data are within the manuscript and its <xref rid="sec016" ref-type="sec">Supporting Information</xref> files.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Stroke is a significant neurological disorder and a major cause of death and disability worldwide [<xref rid="pone.0324291.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In Thailand, the prevalence of stroke among adults aged 45 years and older is estimated to be 1.88%, leading to over 50,000 deaths each year [<xref rid="pone.0324291.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324291.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The damage of stroke can be classified into two types; ischemic stroke and hemorrhagic stroke [<xref rid="pone.0324291.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324291.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is the most common, accounting for 85% of all cases [<xref rid="pone.0324291.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Approximately 20% of AIS patients present at the hospital with high mortality and poor prognosis, posing a global challenge for clinical management [<xref rid="pone.0324291.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324291.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Hyperglycemia is an important risk factor for stroke [<xref rid="pone.0324291.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Elevated blood glucose levels, observed in about 40&#x02013;50% of stroke patients, can exacerbate ischemic injury and worsen clinical outcomes [<xref rid="pone.0324291.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Stress hyperglycemia, a relatively transient increase in blood glucose in response to systemic inflammation or neurohormonal disorders [<xref rid="pone.0324291.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], has been correlated to more severe stroke outcomes [<xref rid="pone.0324291.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324291.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], including an increased risk of functional impairment, stroke recurrence, and death. The stress hyperglycemia ratio (SHR), which can be measured as fasting plasma glucose to glycosylated hemoglobin (FPG/HbA1c), has emerged as a promising biomarker for predicting the severity and mortality of AIS patients [<xref rid="pone.0324291.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324291.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>The stress hyperglycemia ratio (SHR) presently exhibits notable limitations in the early assessment of disease severity, especially in resource-constrained settings with hemoglobin A1c testing [<xref rid="pone.0324291.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0324291.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Besides SHR, the novel glucose-related blood biomarkers, such as the fasting blood glucose to estimated average glucose ratio (GAGR) [<xref rid="pone.0324291.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], glucose to albumin ratio (GAR) [<xref rid="pone.0324291.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], glucose to potassium ratio (GPR) [<xref rid="pone.0324291.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], and glucose-triglyceride index (TyG) [<xref rid="pone.0324291.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], have been used to assess severity and predict mortality rate in AIS patients. Because many patients can progress to critical stages with hemorrhagic transformation [<xref rid="pone.0324291.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], fatal outcomes [<xref rid="pone.0324291.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], and different therapeutic management [<xref rid="pone.0324291.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], an accessible and reliable predictor is crucial for early prognosis and reducing AIS mortality. While SHR has been shown to be a major predictor of fatal ischemic stroke outcomes in Thailand [<xref rid="pone.0324291.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], the predictive capacity of novel glucose-related blood biomarkers remains unassessed. This study aimed to determine the usefulness of novel glucose-related blood biomarkers in predicting severity and in-hospital mortality for AIS patients. Our findings may provide insights into prognosis and help reduce the in-hospital mortality rate among AIS patients in Thailand.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Study design and participants</title><p>This retrospective single-center study enrolled 351 patients with acute ischemic stroke admitted to the Stroke Unit at Saraburi Hospital in Thailand between 1 January and 31 December 2023.

All patients had a routine laboratory examination, including fasting plasma or blood glucose, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), lipid profile, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, liver function test, and electrolyte at admission baseline. Patients having transient ischemic attack, minor stroke, posterior circulation stroke, intracranial hemorrhage stroke, pregnancy, refer to other hospital or conditions affecting their blood parameters such as transfusion and fluid replacement, were excluded.

Patients were categorized into in-hospital mortality (IHM) and survivors, and further classified into mild and severe cases. Severe cases were defined by the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) with score&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;5 and diagnosed by stroke-certified neurologists, including experiencing complications such as early neurological deterioration (END), requiring oxygen support, and transfer to the intensive care unit. Routine laboratory data at admission baseline included blood glucose and biochemistry parameters. Blood biochemistry tests such as fasting plasma glucose (FPG), lipid profile (cholesterol, triglyceride, HDL, LDL-c), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), albumin, and electrolytes (sodium, potassium, carbon dioxide, bicarbonate, anion gap) were performed using an Automated Chemistry Analyzer (Beckman Coulter DxC 700 AU). Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) was analyzed using a Mindray BS-820M Automated Analyzer, and estimated average glucose (EAG) was calculated using the formula: (28.7&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;HbA1c%) &#x02013; 46.7 (mg/dL). Novel glucose-related blood biomarkers were derived using the following ratios: stress hyperglycemia ratio (SHR) = FPG/ HbA1c, glucose to estimated average glucose ratio (GAGR) = FPG/ EAG, glucose to albumin ratio (GAR) = FPG/ Albumin, glucose to potassium ratio (GPR) = FPG/ Potassium, glucose-blood urea nitrogen to eGFR ratio (GUFR) = (FPG&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;BUN)/ eGFR, and triglyceride-glucose index (TyG) = Triglyceride&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;FPG.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Ethics</title><p>The data of this study were fully anonymized, with no identifiable patient information, including hospital numbers, admission numbers, identity card numbers, birthdates, and addresses. This retrospective cohort study was approved by the institutional research ethics committee of Saraburi Hospital (SRBR66&#x02013;005, EC017/2567) in Thailand. The requirement for informed consent was waived due to minimum risk to the patient and no identifiable information.</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The analysis of this study was conducted using the IBM SPSS Statistics version 20.0 statistical package program (Chicago, IL, USA) and GraphPad Prism software version 8.0 (San Diego, CA, USA). The categorical variables, including gender, underlying diseases, and treatments were analyzed by Chi-square or Fisher&#x02019;s exact test, providing the number of units (n), percentage (%) and median. The compliance of the continuous covariate was performed using independent t-tests and the Mann-Whitney U test or log-rank test, respectively. A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) or the Kruskal-Wallis&#x02019;s test was used to assess the differences in the median of multiple groups. The examination of a threshold to differentiate severity and mortality groups was performed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The cutoff value was determined and chosen by Youden&#x02019;s index based on the appropriate sensitivity and specificity from ROC curve analysis. P&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05 value was considered statistically significant with 95% confidence interval (95% CI). The multivariate regression model was used to determine odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for predicting in-hospital mortality. Variables for adjustment in the multivariate regression model were selected based on prior rationale and known associated risk factors. For in-hospital mortality (IHM), the crude model represents univariable analysis. Model A was adjusted for age, sex, blood pressure, and length of hospital stay. Model B included adjustments for age, NIHSS score, and mRS score. Additionally, model C was further adjusted for age, hypertension, and random blood glucose levels to evaluate novel glucose-related blood biomarkers and their association with fatal outcomes.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec007"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec008"><title>Baseline characteristics of AIS patients</title><p>A total of 351 patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) were enrolled in this study. Among cases, 31 AIS patients (8.8%) died in the hospital (in-hospital mortality). The in-hospital mortality rate was associated with the patients&#x02019; clinical characteristics, including age, gender, preexisting conditions, and treatment complications, as shown in <xref rid="pone.0324291.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The median age of patients who died in the hospital (71&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;9 years) and those who survived (64&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;13 years) differed significantly. Among the 351 AIS patients, 314 (89.5%) had underlying conditions. The three most common preexisting conditions were hypertension (78.1%), hyperlipidemia (57.8%), and diabetes (29.6%), respectively. All patients were evaluated for the length of hospital stay. The length of stay in deceased patients was found to exceed 8 days, while it was shorter than 3.5 days in survived cases. Moreover, our study revealed that 53 patients (15.1%) experienced a recurrent stroke and clinical complications during treatment, including stroke-associated pneumonia (SAP) (11.4%), atrial fibrillation (AF) (11.1%), hemorrhagic transformation (3.4%), and sepsis (2.8%), respectively. All AIS patients were treated according to medical practice guidelines and the severity of their condition. Of those patients, 81.7% were given antiplatelet drugs like aspirin, 14.0% were given intravenous thrombolysis with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA), and 9.7% had endovascular thrombectomy (<xref rid="pone.0324291.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p><table-wrap position="float" id="pone.0324291.t001"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0324291.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Clinical characteristics in AIS patients.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="pone.0324291.t001" id="pone.0324291.t001g" position="float"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Characteristics</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">All (n)</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">IHM</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Survivor</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic toggle="yes">p</italic>-value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Number of cases (%)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">351</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">31 (8.8%)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">320 (91.2%)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age, mean&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;SD</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">65&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;13</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">71&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;9</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">64&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;13</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.004</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="5" rowspan="1">Sex, n (%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Male</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">209 (59.5%)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">13 (41.9%)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">196 (61.3%)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.036</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Female</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">142 (40.5%)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">18 (58.1%)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">124 (38.8%)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.036</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Length of stay, median (IQR)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4 (3,6)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8 (3,16)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3.5 (3,6)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0003c;0.001</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Baseline NIHSS score, median (IQR)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4 (2,9)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">17 (11,21)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4 (2,8)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0003c;0.001</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Discharge mRS score, median (IQR)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2 (1,4)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6 (6)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2 (1,4)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0003c;0.001</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="5" rowspan="1">

The analysis includes three distinct models: Model A consisted of variables such as age, sex, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and length of hospital stay; Model B comprised age, NIHSS score, and mRS score; while Model C incorporated age, hypertension, and random blood glucose levels. We found that AIS patients with a SHR&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;18.0 exhibited a markedly greater likelihood of in-hospital mortality, with an odds ratio of 12.365 compared to those with a SHR&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;18.0 (OR = 12.365, 95% CI: 4.221&#x02013;36.222, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001).

worldwide but also the primary source of acquired disability in the adult population [<xref rid="pone.0324291.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0324291.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In recent years, blood biomarkers have been identified, and numerous promising candidates have been proposed as predictors of stroke [<xref rid="pone.0324291.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324291.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. However, no individual blood biomarker has yet demonstrated sufficient sensitivity and specificity for routine clinical use. This study investigated the clinical utility of novel glucose-related blood biomarkers in predicting the severity and in-hospital mortality of patients with AIS. The findings highlighted significant associations between these biomarkers and patient outcomes, demonstrating their potential value in clinical practice.</p><p>To our knowledge, few studies have examined the association between glucose-related blood biomarkers and prognosis in patients with AIS. In this study, we identified SHR as the most reliable biomarker for predicting in-hospital mortality (IHM), with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.832 and a cutoff value of &#x02265;18.0, yielding sensitivity and specificity rates of 87.1% and 64.7%, respectively. SHR reflects the balance between fasting plasma glucose and hemoglobin A1c, providing a stable metric for evaluating acute glycemic fluctuations during stress [<xref rid="pone.0324291.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Elevated SHR values indicate a heightened neurohormonal response and systemic inflammation [<xref rid="pone.0324291.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324291.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrated the relationship between SHR and poor neurological outcomes as well as mortality in AIS patients [<xref rid="pone.0324291.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. A first study by Roberts et al. found that an admission SHR&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;1.14 was indicative of poor outcomes in hospitalized patients [<xref rid="pone.0324291.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Furthermore, SHR has been associated with increased 30-day and 90-day mortality in AIS patients, underscoring its potential value in risk stratification [<xref rid="pone.0324291.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In Thailand, Krongsut S. et al. showed that elevated SHR was significantly associated with increased risks of in-hospital mortality, malignant cerebral edema, symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage, 3-month mortality, and poor functional outcomes in thrombolyzed acute ischemic stroke patients, and SHR exhibited superior predictive performance for these fatal outcomes compared to traditional glucose metrics, including fasting plasma glucose, admission random plasma glucose, and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) [<xref rid="pone.0324291.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In conjunction with our findings, SHR may serve as a key predictor of severity and mortality in AIS patients.</p><p>Interestingly, a novel biomarker, GAR, was demonstrated to be highly effective in assessing both severity and mortality in AIS patients. GAR exhibited an AUC of 0.672 with a cutoff value of 24.4, predicting severity with sensitivity and specificity rates of 72.8% and 56.6%, respectively. Additionally, GAR demonstrated an AUC of 0.825 with a cutoff value of 30.0, forecasting in-hospital mortality with sensitivity and specificity rates of 82.8% and 72.7%, respectively. A related study revealed that GAR outperformed other biomarkers in predicting 90-day mortality in intracranial hemorrhagic stroke (ICH) patients (AUC&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.72) [<xref rid="pone.0324291.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. GAR integrates fasting glucose and albumin levels, with the latter serving as a biomarker of nutritional status and systemic inflammation [<xref rid="pone.0324291.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324291.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. A recent study investigated the admission blood glucose-to-albumin ratio (AAR) as a predictor of futile recanalization in patients with acute cerebral infarction due to anterior circulation large vessel occlusion who underwent successful interventional recanalization [<xref rid="pone.0324291.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The results demonstrated that higher AAR tertiles were significantly associated with increased rates of futile recanalization, defined as a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 3&#x02013;6 at three months post-procedure [<xref rid="pone.0324291.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Moreover, combining AAR tertiles with admission NIHSS scores and collateral circulation status resulted in a predictive model with high accuracy for futile recanalization (AUC&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.907) [<xref rid="pone.0324291.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. However, hypoalbuminemia, commonly observed in cardiovascular events such as ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, correlated with compromised vascular integrity and a pro-inflammatory state, exacerbating the detrimental effects of hyperglycemia [<xref rid="pone.0324291.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The strong association between GAR and patient outcomes underscores its dual role as both a metabolic and inflammatory biomarker. These findings corroborate and expand upon previous research regarding glycemic markers in cerebrovascular diseases. While SHR and GAR outperformed other biomarkers such as the glucose-to-potassium ratio (GPR) and glucose-to-estimated average glucose ratio (GAGR), further investigation in larger and more diverse cohorts is warranted.</p><p>SHR and GAR are biomarkers used to assess stress hyperglycemia and its impact on acute ischemic stroke (AIS) [<xref rid="pone.0324291.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324291.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. However, they differ in their calculation, physiological basis, and clinical significance. SHR represents stress-induced hyperglycemia by adjusting for pre-existing glycemic control (HbA1c) and has more dynamic change of glucose level [<xref rid="pone.0324291.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324291.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] while GAR integrates both hyperglycemia and hypoalbuminemia [<xref rid="pone.0324291.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324291.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], indicating both metabolic and inflammatory stress for AIS patients [<xref rid="pone.0324291.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Incorporating SHR and GAR into routine clinical assessments offers several practical advantages. Both biomarkers rely on commonly available biochemical parameters, making them accessible and cost-effective tools for early risk stratification, particularly in resource-limited settings of AIS patients. By identifying high-risk patients upon admission, these markers can guide timely therapeutic decisions, including intensified monitoring, targeted glycemic control, and advanced interventions such as endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) [<xref rid="pone.0324291.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324291.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324291.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Additionally, they can aid in anticipating severe complications such as stroke-associated pneumonia [<xref rid="pone.0324291.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. SHR and GAR, with cutoff values of &#x02265;17.5 and &#x02265;27.8, respectively, may indicate the need for EVT. Furthermore, SHR&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;18.0 and GAR&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;30.0 were the most effective in predicting disease deterioration associated with stroke-associated pneumonia. Thus, SHR and GAR could provide complementary insights when used alongside established clinical scales, such as the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) [<xref rid="pone.0324291.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Their predictive accuracy for severity and mortality highlights their potential to enhance existing prognostic models, ultimately improving functional outcomes for AIS patients.</p><p>Despite these strengths, certain limitations must be acknowledged. The retrospective design and single-center nature of this study may limit the generalizability of these findings. Selection bias cannot be entirely excluded, and the relatively small sample size may have affected the robustness of the analyses. The cross-sectional measurement of biomarkers precludes an understanding of their dynamic changes over time, which could provide additional prognostic value. This study did not include data on clinical characteristics for mild and severe patients, nor on ischemic time. Moreover, we did not perform a relationship between NIHSS and these biomarkers and conduct comprehensive statistical analyses, such as multivariate analysis for ROC curves, p-value adjustments for multiple variables, or the provision of confidence intervals for sensitivity and specificity. Furthermore, diabetes, a strong confounder, was not incorporated into our multivariate analysis. Future research should focus on validating these biomarkers in larger, multicenter cohorts, exploring their temporal trends during both the acute and recovery phases of AIS, and including comprehensive statistical analysis. Investigating the interplay between glycemic markers and other systemic factors, such as inflammation and oxidative stress, could further elucidate their roles in stroke pathophysiology. Additionally, randomized controlled trials evaluating targeted interventions based on SHR and GAR levels could provide evidence supporting their clinical utility in personalized treatment strategies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec015"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study highlights the potential prognostic value of SHR and GAR in patients with AIS as these parameters demonstrated an association with in-hospital mortality. In resource-limited settings, SHR and GAR may be utilized to systematically record patient information and help gather critical data on stroke incidence and complication. Their integration into routine clinical practice could enhance early risk stratification, optimize resource allocation, and improve clinical outcomes.

Due to the inclusion of these potentially identifying data, we have removed this file from your file inventory. Prior to sharing human research participant data, authors should consult with an ethics committee to ensure data are shared in accordance with participant consent and all applicable local laws.</p><p>Data sharing should never compromise participant privacy. It is therefore not appropriate to publicly share personally identifiable data on human research participants. The following are examples of data that should not be shared:</p><p>-Name, initials, physical address</p><p>-Ages more specific than whole numbers</p><p>-Internet protocol (IP) address</p><p>-Specific dates (birth dates, death dates, examination dates, etc.)</p><p>-Contact information such as phone number or email address</p><p>-Location data</p><p>-ID numbers that seem specific (long numbers, include initials, titled &#x0201c;Hospital ID&#x0201d;) rather than random (small numbers in numerical order)</p><p>Data that are not directly identifying may also be inappropriate to share, as in combination they can become identifying. For example, data collected from a small group of participants, vulnerable populations, or private groups should not be shared if they involve indirect identifiers (such as sex, ethnicity, location, etc.) that may risk the identification of study participants.</p><p>Additional guidance on preparing raw data for publication can be found in our Data Policy (<ext-link xlink:href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability#loc-human-research-participant-data-and-other-sensitive-data)" ext-link-type="uri">https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability#loc-human-research-participant-data-and-other-sensitive-data</ext-link>) and in the following article: <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.bmj.com/content/340/bmj.c181.long." ext-link-type="uri">http://www.bmj.com/content/340/bmj.c181.long</ext-link>.</p><p>Please remove or anonymize all personal, ensure that the data shared are in accordance with participant consent, and re-upload a fully anonymized data set.

You may also include additional comments for the author, including concerns about dual publication, research ethics, or publication ethics. (Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)</p><p>Reviewer #1:&#x000a0;Dear Author</p><p>The manuscript's language is clear but could benefit from minor edits for grammatical consistency. For example: Replace "remain minimized information in Thailand" with "has limited information in Thailand." Change "guiding in-hospital mortality" to "in predicting in-hospital mortality." Include a ROC curve figure to visually represent the AUC of SHR and GAR. Add a flowchart summarizing patient selection and analysis to improve clarity.</p><p>1. The introduction provides a good rationale for the study but could benefit from a clearer linkage between hyperglycemia, glycemic markers, and AIS outcomes. Consider elaborating on why current markers (e.g., SHR) are insufficient and why novel glucose-related markers are needed in clinical practice. The significance of the study in the context of Thailand is mentioned but could be expanded to provide more context on the prevalence of AIS and hyperglycemia in the region.</p><p>2. Clearly define how "severe cases" of AIS were classified. Did you use the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) or another severity index? Describe how the cutoff values for GAR and SHR were determined. Was this based on a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis? Provide more detail about the inclusion/exclusion criteria for the retrospective analysis to ensure reproducibility. Indicate whether ethical approval was obtained for the retrospective study and how patient confidentiality was maintained.</p><p>3. While the AUC values and cutoff points for SHR and GAR are reported, the manuscript should include a comparative analysis of the two biomarkers (e.g., their strengths and limitations in clinical prediction). Provide confidence intervals for sensitivity and specificity values to enhance statistical rigor. Consider including a table summarizing patient characteristics (e.g., age, sex, comorbidities) for better understanding of the study cohort.</p><p>4. The discussion should emphasize the clinical utility of GAR and SHR and their potential integration into existing triage protocols. Compare your findings to those of other studies to highlight similarities or differences and their implications. Discuss limitations, such as the retrospective design, single-center study, and potential confounding factors.</p><p>5. The conclusion is strong but could explicitly recommend how GAR and SHR could be applied in resource-limited settings to improve AIS management.</p><p>Reviewer #2:&#x000a0;This is an interesting study by the authors covering the potential of glucose based prediction of stroke associated endpoints. It is a single-center retrospective analysis from Thailand. However, I have several major points.</p><p>Abstract</p><p>Mention that it is a single center study</p><p>Provide examples of novel glucose biomarkers by name</p><p>Why are different cut-offs used to present AUC and OR for albumin to glucose</p><p>Ratio &#x02013; please correct.</p><p>Why is AGR considered superior if the AUC is lower than SHR?</p><p>-this needs rephrasing</p><p>I think the presented data do not merit the word &#x0201c;predictive&#x0201d; &#x02013; call it &#x0201c;associated&#x0201d;. It is a retrospective study with lots of bias</p><p>Introduction:</p><p>Line 61: do you mean fatal outcomes?</p><p>Line 64-66: far too bold statement. Data provided may at best inform on prognosis but will not influence guidelines and I highly doubt it will change management particularly the acute setting. Rephrase.</p><p>Methods:</p><p>Which glucose measurement at which time point exactly was used for analysis? Was it always the same time window?</p><p>What were the criteria of determining stroke severity? Which NIHSS Scores etc.? The current phrasing is subject to strong interpretation.</p><p>Was there any stratification for baseline characteristics performed? What about multivariate regression? This seems to have been carried out (Table 6) but it isn&#x02019;t described.</p><p>Overal the statistics section needs to explain every statistical model and method that was employed!</p><p>What was the primary outcome? Death or severity? What were the power calculations?</p><p>Was there adjustment of p-value for multiple testing? The authors are basically testing several variables against a several outcomes</p><p>Results:</p><p>Overall, the number of figures and tables is too much and some of the data is redundant. This needs to be re-designed to avoid redundancies.</p><p>Table 1 &#x02013; Include ischemic time if available. This will be one of the main drivers of mortality</p><p>Table1 &#x02013; only shows survivors vs. non-survivors. A table showing clinical characteristics of the so called severe and mild groups is also required</p><p>What were the main causes of death?</p><p>Line 152 &#x02013; how can glucose ratios be used for the diagnosis of cerebrovascular disease? Rephrase.</p><p>Figure 1: why is survived vs. dead included here for GAR although it is already shown in Table 3?</p><p>Figure 2. How does this figure help in interpreting the data? There are already 2 significant differences in FPG. SHR and GAGR only show 3 sign. differences. what is the point of showing this?</p><p>Line 205-213: I cannot interpret this, as there is no definition of stroke severity. You could analyze correlation with NIHSS severity or some other objective parameter (e.g., extent of infarcted area on imaging). Furthermore, the AUC is very low.</p><p>Table 4: is this simple logistic regression?</p><p>Why are no ROC curves provided for multivariate analysis?

</p><p>Point-by-point Reply</p><p>Review Comments to the Author</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>Dear Author</p><p>The manuscript's language is clear but could benefit from minor edits for grammatical consistency. For example: Replace "remain minimized information in Thailand" with "has limited information in Thailand." Change "guiding in-hospital mortality" to "in predicting in-hospital mortality." Include a ROC curve figure to visually represent the AUC of SHR and GAR. Add a flowchart summarizing patient selection and analysis to improve clarity.</p><p>Response: We appreciate the reviewer&#x02019;s comments. We have carefully revised the current manuscript and updated the sentences according to the reviewer&#x02019;s suggestions. Additionally, we have included a flowchart summarizing patient selection and a ROC curve to demonstrate the AUC of SHR and GAR, presented in Figure 1 and Figure 4, respectively, in the revised manuscript.</p><p>1. The introduction provides a good rationale for the study but could benefit from a clearer linkage between hyperglycemia, glycemic markers, and AIS outcomes. Consider elaborating on why current markers (e.g., SHR) are insufficient and why novel glucose-related markers are needed in clinical practice. The significance of the study in the context of Thailand is mentioned but could be expanded to provide more context on the prevalence of AIS and hyperglycemia in the region.</p><p>Response: We thank the reviewer for these suggestions. We have revised the introduction with a clearer context in the current manuscript as suggested by reviewer in line 56-69.</p><p>2. Clearly define how "severe cases" of AIS were classified. Did you use the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) or another severity index? Describe how the cutoff values for GAR and SHR were determined. Was this based on a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis? Provide more detail about the inclusion/exclusion criteria for the retrospective analysis to ensure reproducibility. Indicate whether ethical approval was obtained for the retrospective study and how patient confidentiality was maintained.</p><p>Response: We sincerely appreciate the reviewer&#x02019;s comments. We have used the NIHSS and definitive diagnoses from neurologists to classify severe cases. This information was included in line 90-93 in the revised manuscript.</p><p>For cutoff determination, we performed an analysis based on the ROC curve, considering appropriate sensitivity and specificity. We have included more information in the M&#x00026;M section in this revised manuscript in line 120-130.</p><p>Additionally, we have provided more detailed inclusion and exclusion as demonstrated in the current manuscript in line 75-84.</p><p>Furthermore, we have revised the ethical statement to ensure clear confirmation of human subject protection as demonstrated in the current manuscript line 106-107.</p><p>3. While the AUC values and cutoff points for SHR and GAR are reported, the manuscript should include a comparative analysis of the two biomarkers (e.g., their strengths and limitations in clinical prediction). Provide confidence intervals for sensitivity and specificity values to enhance statistical rigor. Consider including a table summarizing patient characteristics (e.g., age, sex, comorbidities) for better understanding of the study cohort.</p><p>Response: We thank the reviewer for taking the time to review our work. We have focused on the AUC with a 95% CI to assess the ability of the biomarkers. We acknowledge this limitation and address confidential intervals for sensitivity and specificity in future studies (line 410-415). Regarding the summary of characteristic data, we have included patient characteristics in Table 1 in this revised manuscript.</p><p>4. The discussion should emphasize the clinical utility of GAR and SHR and their potential integration into existing triage protocols. Compare your findings to those of other studies to highlight similarities or differences and their implications. Discuss limitations, such as the retrospective design, single-center study, and potential confounding factors.</p><p>Response: We sincerely appreciate the reviewer&#x02019;s comments. We include more discussion on the GAR and SHR in the discussion in line 352-359, 368-376, 384-390 and 410-415 in the revised manuscript.</p><p>5. The conclusion is strong but could explicitly recommend how GAR and SHR could be applied in resource-limited settings to improve AIS management.</p><p>Response: We appreciate the reviewer's comments. We have revised the conclusion accordingly to fit our context.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>This is an interesting study by the authors covering the potential of glucose-based prediction of stroke associated endpoints. It is a single-center retrospective analysis from Thailand. However, I have several major points.</p><p>Response: We sincerely appreciate the reviewer&#x02019;s comments. We have carefully revised the current manuscript and rephrased the sentences according to reviewer&#x02019;s suggestions as below.</p><p>Abstract</p><p>Mention that it is a single center study</p><p>Response: We have revised the abstract following reviewer&#x02019;s comment. (Line 27-28)</p><p>Provide examples of novel glucose biomarkers by name</p><p>Response: We have revised the abstract following reviewer&#x02019;s suggestion. (Line 24-25)</p><p>Why are different cut-offs used to present AUC and OR for albumin to glucose Ratio &#x02013; please correct.</p><p>Response: We thank the reviewer for this comment. The cutoff value was determined and chosen by Youden&#x02019;s index based on the appropriate sensitivity and specificity from ROC curve analysis. Therefore, the different cutoff values for severe cases and in-hospital mortality groups were used according to the ROC analysis. This detail has been incorporated into the materials and methods section in line 120-122 in this revised manuscript.</p><p>Why is AGR considered superior if the AUC is lower than SHR?</p><p>-these needs rephrasing</p><p>Response: We appreciate the reviewer&#x02019;s feedback. In the present manuscript, we have revised abstract for better clarification. Our findings show that the GAR (glucose-to-albumin ratio) has the highest AUC for severe cases, while it is inferior to SHR in predicting in-hospital mortality.</p><p>I think the presented data do not merit the word &#x0201c;predictive&#x0201d; &#x02013; call it &#x0201c;associated&#x0201d;. It is a retrospective study with lots of bias</p><p>Response: We agree and have revised the current manuscript title as &#x0201c;Evaluation of novel glucose-related blood biomarkers for predicting in-hospital mortality in patients with acute ischemic stroke.&#x0201d;</p><p>Introduction:</p><p>Line 61: do you mean fatal outcomes?</p><p>Response: Thanks for correcting this word. We meant "fatal outcomes" and have revised it accordingly, as per the reviewer&#x02019;s comment.</p><p>Line 64-66: far too bold statement. Data provided may at best inform on prognosis but will not influence guidelines and I highly doubt it will change management particularly the acute setting. Rephrase.</p><p>Response: The present manuscript has been revised in accordance with the reviewer&#x02019;s recommendation.</p><p>Methods:</p><p>Which glucose measurement at which time point exactly was used for analysis? Was it always the same time window?</p><p>Response: We collected fasting plasma glucose data at the same time after patients were admitted to the Stroke Unit (line 75-84).</p><p>What were the criteria of determining stroke severity? Which NIHSS Scores etc.? The current phrasing is subject to strong interpretation.</p><p>Response: We appreciate the reviewer&#x02019;s feedback. We determined stroke severity using NIHSS scores. Severe cases were defined as those with an NIHSS score &#x0003e;5 at admission baseline (moderate to severe patients) and experiencing complications such as early neurological deterioration (END), requiring oxygen support, or transfer to the intensive care unit. This information was included in the revised manuscript in line 90-93.</p><p>Was there any stratification for baseline characteristics performed? What about multivariate regression? This seems to have been carried out (Table 6) but it isn&#x02019;t described.</p><p>Overall the statistics section needs to explain every statistical model and method that was employed!</p><p>Response: Thanks for the reviewer&#x02019;s comments. We have further described the statistical analysis section as follows:</p><p>The multivariate regression model was used to determine odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for predicting in-hospital mortality. Variables for adjustment in the multivariate regression model were selected based on prior rationale and known associated risk factors. For in-hospital mortality (IHM), the crude model represents univariable analysis. Model A was adjusted for age, sex, blood pressure, and length of hospital stay. Model B included adjustments for age, NIHSS score, and mRS score. Additionally, model C was further adjusted for age, hypertension, and random blood glucose levels to evaluate novel glucose markers and their association with fatal outcomes. Additional information was added in the materials and methods section in revised manuscript (line 121-130).</p><p>What was the primary outcome? Death or severity? What were the power calculations?</p><p>Was their adjustment of p-value for multiple testing? The authors are basically testing several variables against a several outcomes</p><p>Response: The primary outcome of this study was in-hospital mortality. Additionally, we aimed to investigate the association of these biomarkers with unfavorable outcomes, including severity, complications, and death. We have revised the manuscript to improve clarity.</p><p>Results:</p><p>Overall, the number of figures and tables is too much and some of the data is redundant. This needs to be re-designed to avoid redundancies.</p><p>Table 1 &#x02013; Include ischemic time if available. This will be one of the main drivers of mortality</p><p>Response: Thanks for the reviewer&#x02019;s suggestion. The ischemic time was not available for collection; therefore, we incorporated this potential analysis into the limitation of this study in line 410-411 in this revised manuscript.</p><p>Table1 &#x02013; only shows survivors vs. non-survivors. A table showing clinical characteristics of the so called severe and mild groups is also required</p><p>Response: We appreciate the reviewer&#x02019;s kind suggestions. The data for severe and mild groups were not available for record. We have addressed this limitation in the manuscript and will consider it in future studies.</p><p>What were the main causes of death?</p><p>Response: In this study, AIS patients with pneumonia may be a major cause of in-hospital mortality.</p><p>Line 152 &#x02013; how can glucose ratios be used for the diagnosis of cerebrovascular disease? Rephrase.</p><p>Response: We appreciate this suggestion and have rephrased it as &#x0201c;for the prognosis of various condition, including cerebrovascular disease&#x0201d; in line 172 in the revised manuscript.</p><p>Figure 1: why is survived vs. dead included here for GAR although it is already shown in Table 3?</p><p>Response: Thank you for the reviewer&#x02019;s comment. We have revised Figure for comparing mild and severe cases of GAR.</p><p>Figure 2. How does this figure help in interpreting the data? There are already 2 significant differences in FPG. SHR and GAGR only show 3 signs. differences. what is the point of showing this?</p><p>Response: We are grateful for the reviewer&#x02019;s comments. This figure illustrates the different levels of FPG and novel glucose markers in AIS patients with complications. Our results demonstrate that these markers are associated with complications, including pneumonia and sepsis, which may contribute to severity and in-hospital mortality. The manuscript text has been revised to enhance the clarity of the result in this revised manuscript in line 193-200.</p><p>Line 205-213: I cannot interpret this, as there is no definition of stroke severity. You could analyze correlation with NIHSS severity or some other objective parameter (e.g., extent of infarcted area on imaging). Furthermore, the AUC is very low.</p><p>Response: Severe cases, defined by an NIHSS score &#x0003e;5 at baseline, exhibited various clinical manifestations, including early neurological deterioration and the need for appropriate management, such as thrombolytic agents (e.g., rtPA), oxygen support, endovascular treatments, and transfer to the intensive care unit. However, delayed prediction, especially in clinical settings with limited medical resources, may contribute to in-hospital mortality. The manuscript text has been revised to enhance the clarity of the result in this revised manuscript in line 221-226.</p><p>Table 4: is this simple logistic regression?</p><p>Why are no ROC curves provided for multivariate analysis? This is the more interesting?</p><p>Response: Table 4 presents the results of the simple logistic regression. Our study aimed to investigate the potential ability of the novel glucose-related markers to predict severity and in-hospital mortality. We thus performed the ROC curve analysis for these glucose-related markers, but not for multivariate analysis. We have noted this as a limitation, considering it for further research in line 410-415 in this revised manuscript.</p><p>table 5: why would you use glucose parameters to predict the necessity of endovascular therapy? The decision is usually based on clinical and radiological parameters.</p><p>Response: We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. Clinical and radiological examinations are the primary criteria for decision-making in the appropriate management of endovascular therapy. However, our study may provide valuable data on laboratory markers as supportive tools for clinical management, especially in settings with limited resources. We have provided more information in line 285-289 in the current manuscript.</p><p>Table 6. Why does none of the models contain the diagnosis of diabetes and obesity, which will most likely be strong confounders?</p><p>Why are no further parameters of the multivariate logistic regression shown, e.g. ROC curves for the more promising quotients?</p><p>Moreover, GAR does not do so well in multivariate model A, so I am not so sure about an improved prognostic value compared to the other parameters.</p><p>Response: We would like to thank the reviewer for their valuable suggestions. We have considered these important points. As the data was not recorded, we have acknowledged this gap and limitation in our study. However, our study remains useful in illustrating alternative parameters associated with in-hospital mortality in these patients. Furthermore, we will take this key point into consideration for future studies.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>The first sentence is far too bold given the small sample size, inherent bias etc.</p><p>Replace the first sentence, for example, with the following: &#x0201c;This study highlights the potential prognostic value of SHR and GAR in patients with AIS as these parameters demonstrated an association with in-hospital mortality.&#x0201d; The rest of the conclusion is fine.</p><p>Response: We thank the reviewer for their thoughtful review of our work. We have revised the conclusion in the current manuscript to ensure clarity without overstating the findings.</p><p>Journal requirements:</p><p>When submitting your revision, we need you to address these additional requirements.</p><p>1. Please ensure that your manuscript meets PLOS ONE's style requirements, including those for file naming.</p><p>Response: We have named the files according to PLOS ONE's style requirements.</p><p>2. We note that there is identifying data in the Supporting Information file</p><p>Response: In the revised manuscript, we have removed the key data that should not be shared eg.
