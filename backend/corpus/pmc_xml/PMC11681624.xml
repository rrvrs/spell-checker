Despite the fact that MD has been effectively controlled by vaccines, the virulence of field isolates of MDV has continued to evolve, becoming more virulent under the immune pressure of vaccines. Our previous research has confirmed that the recombinant rMDV strain with REV-LTR insertion can be used as a live attenuated vaccine candidate. The aim of this research was to evaluate the onset and duration of immunity of the rMDV strain through two experiments. In both experiments, 1-day-old SPF chickens were vaccinated subcutaneously with the rMDV strain at a dose of 3,000 Plaque Formation Unit (PFU) per chick in 0.2&#x0202f;mL of the MD diluent. Then, in Experimental design 1, the chicks in the groups Vac-3d/CC-3d, Vac-5d/CC-5d, and Vac-7d/CC-7d were challenged separately with 500 PFU vvMDV strain MD5 at 3&#x0202f;days, 5&#x0202f;days, and 7&#x0202f;days after vaccination; in Experimental design 2, the chicks in group Vac-60d/CC-60d, Vac-120d/CC-120d, and Vac-180d/CC-180d were challenged at 60&#x0202f;days, 120&#x0202f;days, and 180&#x0202f;days after vaccination. The clinical symptoms and weight gain of chickens in each group were observed and recorded. The results showed that the rMDV strain with REV-LTR insertion provides protection starting from 3&#x0202f;days of age and achieves good immune effects at 5&#x0202f;days of age after 1-day-old immunization, and the immunization duration can reach for at least 180&#x0202f;days. Given age-related resistance, it can be confirmed that our vaccine can actually provide lifelong immunity. This study provides valuable insights into the onset and duration of immunity of the rMDV strain, which will provide a basis for the development and improvement of MD vaccines.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Marek&#x02019;s disease virus</kwd><kwd>REV-LTR</kwd><kwd>vaccine</kwd><kwd>onset of immunity</kwd><kwd>duration of immunity</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>The author(s) declare that financial support was received for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.

Its causative agent, Marek&#x02019;s disease virus (MDV), belongs to the <italic>Mardivirus</italic> genus of the <italic>Alphaherpesvirinae</italic> sub-family in the <italic>Herpesviridae</italic> family. Within the <italic>Mardivirus</italic> genus, there are three highly related species which correspond to previously described MDV serotypes: MDV serotype 1 (MDV-1, or Gallid herpesvirus 2, GaHV-2), MDV serotype 2 (MDV-2 or GaHV-3), and turkey herpesvirus (HVT, also known as Meleagrid herpesvirus 1, MeHV-1 or MDV-3) (<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). MDV-1 includes oncogenic viruses of variable virulence, which was further classified into mild (m), virulent (v), very virulent (vv), and very virulent plus (vv+) pathotypes (<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). MDV-2 and HVT are non-oncogenic virus isolates from chickens and turkeys, respectively.</p><p>MD is the first ever viral oncogenic disease that was successfully controlled by vaccination. The CVI988/Rispens (an attenuated MDV-1 strain), SB-1 (an MDV-2 strain), and HVT strains are widely used for monovalent and combined MD vaccines and provide effective and lifelong immunity (<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). These vaccines protected the immunized flocks against field virulent isolates with significant reduction of morbidity and mortality rates and effective inhibition of the formation of tumors. It was reported that the losses from MD infection in the United States sharply decreased from 1.5% in 1970 to 0.003% in 2006 after widespread administration of MD vaccines (<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). However, MD continues to have a significant economic impact on the poultry industry worldwide due to the cost of vaccination and occasional outbreaks (<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>).</p><p>It is widely accepted that the MD vaccines do not provide sterilizing immunity: the virulent viruses could replicate in the vaccinated chickens and keep shedding, which may contribute to the evolution of viruses toward greater virulence (<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). In fact, the field strains of MDV-1 were continuously evolving with increased virulence in the last several decades (<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), even with the widespread use of effective MD vaccines. In the 1970s, HVT was first used as a successful vaccine to protect against vMDV isolates. A decade later, the HVT/MDV-2 bivalent vaccines had to be commercialized to deal with the emergence of vvMDV filed isolates. In the early 1990s, the CVI988/Rispens, a cell culture passage attenuated MDV-1 strain, was recommended to protect against the infection of vv&#x0202f;+&#x0202f;MD field strains (<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Up to now, CVI988/Rispens vaccine strain is still considered the gold standard of MD vaccines because of its superior protection. Nevertheless, the highly virulent MDV strains have been isolated in commercial chickens vaccinated with HVT plus CVI988 since 2017 (<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). It is predicted that a more-virulent MD field strain that emerges in the future may lead to devastating consequences for the poultry industry, thus it is necessary to develop novel and more effective strategies against MDV.</p><p>Based on the long-term protective effect and safety of CVI988/Rispens strain (the gold standard MD vaccine), it may be one of the most effective ways to develop genetically engineered vaccines based on CVI988/Rispens vaccine strain to protect against emerging more-virulent isolates. Since the insertional mutagenesis of retroviral promotor/enhancer sequences in the MDV genome has been shown to enhance virus replication in the chickens (<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), a recombinant CVI988/Rispens (rMDV) strain was constructed in our previous study, in the genome of which two copies of the long terminal repeat (LTR) from avian reticuloendotheliosis virus (REV) were inserted (<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). The REV-LTR insertions increased the horizontal transmission of MD (<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) and enhanced the virus replication of the rMDV strain probably due to a strong promoter and enhancer effect (<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), but had no obvious effect on virus virulence (<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). The previous results showed that the rMDV was safe for vaccinated chickens and showed better protective effect compared to the parental CVI988/Rispens strain (<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>).</p><p>The aim of this study presented here was to evaluate the onset and duration of immunity of the rMDV strain. It is generally believed that herpes virus is lifelong immunity; however, since the molecular manipulation and modifications on the recombinant viruses may have changed their latency and reactivation (<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>), whether recombinant viruses can provide long lasting and highly protection efficacy has not been determined. This study of the duration of immunity for recombinant MD will provide a basis for the development and improvement of MD vaccines and therapies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec3"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec4"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>This study was carried out in strict accordance with recommendations from the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of Shanghai Veterinary Research Institute, the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences (SHVRI, CAAS).

In recent years, there has been a marked increase in the prevalence of MDV in China. Despite extensive vaccination campaigns aimed at reducing the impact of MD, numerous cases have arisen where wild strains of MDV have managed to evade the immune protection conferred by these vaccines (<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Consequently, the development of MDV vaccines is ongoing in response to new virulent circulating strains. Traditional technology is approaching its limits, and genetic modification has become the primary method for research and development in this field. There are numerous virulence gene knock-out or modified vaccines available, including artificially attenuated MDV-1 strains that have been widely utilized (<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>).</p><p>Evidence suggests that the incorporation of REV LTR sequences into MDV can enhance its proliferation efficiency and immune protective effect (<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). However, the precise mechanism underlying this synergistic replication is not yet fully understood. It is known that insertional mutagenesis of retroviral LTR sequences in the MDV genome may elevate virus replication in some unknown manner. This enhancement is not limited to recombinant viruses. In fact, it was also observed that co-infection of MDV and REV has been demonstrated to increase viral replication in co-infected cells (<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). To date, there have been a number of studies trying to uncover the mechanism. Faiz et al. (<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>) evaluated the load of oncogenic MDV DNA in five commercial flocks that were vaccinated with CVI988 with or without REV-LTR insertion. They found that CVI988 with REV-LTR insertion tended to replicate in the thymus earlier than in other lymphoid organs. Previous research has indicated that the extensive replication in the lymphoid organs was associated with vaccine protection (<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). The early and strong replication in the thymus may contribute to decrease oncogenic MDV load and might induce early immune responses (<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Furthermore, Su et al. (<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) found that the REV-LTR insertions increased the horizontal transmission of MD; and however, the mechanism remain unclear.</p><p>Despite the enhancement of certain biological properties of MDV by the REV-LTR insertion, it does not elevate the virus virulence. In our previous studies, no significant virulence changes were found in the recombinant virus after the insertion of REV-LTR insertion (<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Moreover, the virulent MDV strains were partially attenuated after REV-LTR insertion. For example, the RM1 strain of MDV, a recombinant MDV obtained via co-cultivation of the JM/102&#x0202f;W strain of MDV with REV, was highly attenuated for oncogenicity but induced severe bursal and thymic atrophy (<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Further research is needed to understand the mechanism by which REV-LTR enhances the immune effect to develop better MDV vaccines.</p><p>Our previous studies have demonstrated that the safety and improvement of immune protection about the insertion of REV LTR into CVI988 (<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Beyond safety, another consideration when using recombinant MDV strains is the unknown impact of genetic recombination on the onset and persistence of immunity. In this study, we investigated the onset of protection and the duration of immunity of the rMDV strain, which was constructed from the vaccine strain CVI988/Rispens with REV-LTR inserted into its genome (<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). This is the first study to describe the duration of immunity of the LTR-inserted recombinant MDV strain in older SPF chickens after vaccination at 1&#x0202f;day of age.</p><p>In experimental design 1, we initially evaluated the onset of immunity of the rMDV strain in chickens. One-day-old SPF chickens were immunized subcutaneously, and 500 PFU of virulent MDV Md5 was injected intraperitoneally on days 3, 5, and 7 after immunization. Clinical symptoms, weight gain, incidence, mortality, and autopsy were observed in each group of chickens to comprehensively assess the protective effect of rMDV against Md5 challenge. In the two groups challenged on the third day, the morbidity and mortality rates in the non-immunized group (CC-3d) reached 95 and 85%, respectively, while those in the immunized group (Vac-3d) were only 25 and 20%. In terms of the protection rate, immunization with the rMDV strain for 5&#x0202f;days can provide 93.75% protection against the virus, while immunization for 3&#x0202f;days can provide a protection rate of 63.2%. Therefore, our vaccine can take effect at 3&#x0202f;days of age and achieve good immune effects at 5&#x0202f;days of age. Early research indicates that MDV only generates stable protective effects on the 7th day after immunization (<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). This may be due to the proliferative properties of MDV, as inoculated MDV viruses are active in the blood and take 7&#x0202f;days to colonize the T cells (<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). It is supposed that the more rapid onset of protection induced by the rMDV5 strain might result from its proliferation efficiency.</p><p>The immune duration of MDV is generally considered to be lifelong (<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). However, due to age-related persistence, the actual immunoprotective efficiency in old age is difficult to determine (<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). In experimental design 2, protective efficacy of older SPF chickens immunized with rMDV to the challenge of vvMDV MD5 strain. Surprisingly, the vvMDV MD5 strain has strong pathogenicity in older chickens, although chickens aged 60&#x0202f;days or older exhibited a delayed onset of the disease. It was also found that the incidences of MD in 120-, 180-, and 240-day-old non-immunized SFP chickens decreased progressively after being challenged with the vvMDV strain MD5. Regrettably, 60&#x0202f;days of observation is still insufficient, as the group challenged at 180&#x0202f;days old clearly did not enter the peak period of death.</p><p>Moreover, no MDV vaccines can provide sterilizing immunity, so it is unclear whether residual vv&#x0202f;+&#x0202f;MDV in large chickens will also cause cancer or pathological lesions. The results of the present study are consistent with previous work, where older chickens showed age-related resistance to MDV infection (<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). However, the unexpectedly high incidence of MD observed in unvaccinated SPF chickens could potentially be attributed to the enhanced virulence of the vvMD strain, and/or the vulnerability and genetic susceptibility to MD of the SPF used in the experiment. Further work involving other genetic stocks of chickens is needed to confirm this observation.</p><p>In CC-120d and CC-180d group, chickens exposed at 120&#x0202f;days and 180&#x0202f;days of age had a lower incidence of mortality and gross lymphomas than did early exposed SPF chickens. The decreased susceptibility of older chickens corresponded with their age. It was reported that age resistance may well developed at 4&#x0202f;weeks of age in chickens of certain lines (<xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). The control chickens were healthy and had no gross tumors at necropsy, hence the observed resistance of older SPF chickens must not be attributed to the inhibitory effects of pre-existing antibody (<xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). It has been postulated that the time of exposure to MD infection influence the eventual outcome of disease, and certain age-related factors inhibits or delays the development of clinical disease (<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). The age-related resistance to MD infection was firstly reported by Sevoian and Chamberlain (<xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>) and subsequently by Biggs and Payne (<xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). It was then firmly established by experiments that excluded prior infection of experimental chickens (<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). Since older chickens were susceptible to infection with MDV and had microscopic lesions at termination, it is postulated that their resistance may have been based on lesion regression. In fact, previous studies have demonstrated that age-related resistance to MD was expressed through lesion regression (<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="ref46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). It is noted that in a certain proportion of infected chickens, lymph-proliferative lesions in nerves and viscera may regress. However, the factors responsible for recovery from natural or experimentally induced MD have not been investigated.</p><p>The pathogenic effect of MD5 on chickens of different ages can be blocked by our vaccine immunization. In this study, one-day-old SPF chickens were immunized via subcutaneous injection and challenged with vvMDV Md5 at 60d, 120d, and 180d post-immunization. The clinical observation findings indicated that there was no discernible difference between the challenge group Vac-60d, &#x02212;120d and -180d and the control group B, and no clinical manifestations of MD were identified. The results of body weight demonstrated that the body weight of the challenge group following immunization did not decline in comparison to the control group. The vaccine offers effective protection. According to the established criteria, more than 80% of the immune protection provided by the vaccine was determined to be effective, meaning that the rMDV with REV-LTR insertion provided effective protection for at least 180&#x0202f;days. Considering age-related resistance, we can confidently assert that this vaccine effectively provides lifelong immunity.</p><sec id="sec18"><title>Limitations of the study</title><p>For this study, we employed SPF chickens as the subjects of the experiment, which may differ from commercial breeds in terms of genetic background, vaccine response, and disease resistance. As a result, the practical efficacy of the vaccine in commercial farming environments would be quite different. The vaccine efficacy between SPF chickens and commercial strains will prove to be a promising topic for research in the future.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="sec20"><title>Data availability statement</title><p>The original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/<xref rid="sec26" ref-type="sec">Supplementary material</xref>, further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding authors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="ethics-statement" id="sec21"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>The animal study was approved by Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of SHVRI, CAAS.
