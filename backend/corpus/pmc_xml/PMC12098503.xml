Deeply positioned near the sciatic nerve, these structures serve as attachment points for the hamstring muscles, including the long head of the biceps femoris, semitendinosus, and semimembranosus, as well as the sacrotuberous ligament. The ischial tuberosity is a common site for various primary bone tumors, such as chondrosarcoma, giant cell tumors, and aneurysmal bone cysts (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Traditionally, a posterior ischial incision has been utilized for tumor curettage or subperiosteal excision. This incision starts below the posterior inferior iliac spine and follows the hip crease laterally, passing through the ischial tuberosity. It can also be employed for open reduction and internal fixation in ischial tuberosity fractures (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). However, in the case of malignant tumors, extensive ischial bone resection is often required, rendering the posterior ischial incision inadequate. A combined ilioinguinal or transperineal approach is often necessary, depending on the tumor&#x02019;s size and location.</p><p>According to Enneking&#x02019;s classification of pelvic tumor regions, the acetabulum is in Region II, while the ischium and pubis fall under Region III (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Region II resection usually involves a combination of anterior and posterior approaches, such as an ilioinguinal incision paired with a lateral incision extending posterior to the greater trochanter and perpendicular to the iliac spine (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Region III resection typically encompasses the pubic symphysis, subpubic rami, and lateral rami extending to the superior pubic rami and medial acetabulum. In such cases, a vertical incision from the pubic tubercle along the ilioinguinal line is often used to expose the subpubic rami and ischial tuberosity (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>).</p><p>Guo et&#x000a0;al. (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>) reported successful resection of a giant cell tumor of the pelvic bone involving Regions II and III using a combined ilioinguinal and posterior ischial incision, followed by pelvic ring reconstruction using a 3D-printed prosthesis. They concluded that this combination is effective for managing tumors spanning Regions II and III. When tumors are located deep within the inferior pubic ramus or ischial tuberosity, a paraperineal approach may also be required (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).</p><p>While most documented surgical incisions address tumors in Region III or those spanning Regions II and III, there remains a lack of guidance on optimal incision strategies for malignant tumors confined to the ischial tuberosity. Complete tumor resection in this area necessitates precise osteotomies at the lesser sciatic notch and ischial ramus while preserving the integrity of the sciatic nerve. The ilioinguinal incision is advantageous for exposing the superior and inferior pubic rami but offers poor access to the lesser sciatic notch. Conversely, the paraperineal incision allows good access to the ischial ramus and tuberosity but limits osteotomy at the lesser sciatic notch. The posterior ischial incision permits osteotomy at the notch but does not adequately expose the ischial ramus, increasing the risk of sciatic nerve injury (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).</p><p>To address these limitations, we designed a novel surgical approach tailored specifically for the total resection of malignant tumors localized to the ischial tuberosity. Based on the clinical data from two cases of ischiotuberous chondrosarcoma treated using this new approach, this study systematically presents the incision design, relevant anatomy, and operative procedures. Objectives: (1) To evaluate the necessity and clinical implications of complete resection for malignant tumors confined to the ischial tuberosity; (2) To propose and introduce a novel surgical incision design; (3) To analyze the anatomical considerations and procedural techniques associated with this new approach.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2_1"><label>2.1</label><title>Anatomical studies</title><p>Design of the incision for total excision of the ischial tuberosity: The incision was created at approximately 5&#x02013;6-cm inferior to the posterior superior iliac spine and followed a curvilinear path around the Ischial tuberosity, directed toward the Greater trochanter of the ipsilateral femur. It subsequently extended distally along the limb (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">
<bold>Figure&#x000a0;1</bold>
</xref>). The incision was designed based on the surface projections of several key anatomical landmarks. The initial letters and the approximate shape of this incision were adopted (hereinafter referred to as the PIG-S incision).</p><fig position="float" id="f1"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>The incision for the ischial tubercle resection started 5&#x02013;6-cm below the posterior superior iliac spine, curved around the greater trochanter via the ischial tubercle, and extended distally along the femoral greater trochanter. This incision is called the PIG-S incision.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fonc-15-1578468-g001" position="float"/></fig><p>The primary anatomical structure exposed through the PIG-S incision is the gluteus maximus muscle. This approach provides clear visualization of the majority of the muscle&#x02019;s inferior border and part of its insertion. After partially sectioning the insertion of the gluteus maximus, the muscle can be retracted or elevated to expose the underlying anatomical layers. Deeper muscles exposed include the superior gemellus, obturator internus, inferior gemellus, quadratus femoris, and the hamstring muscles. The sciatic nerve, the predominant neural structure in the gluteal region, traverses from the superficial plane of the short external rotators to the deep surface of the biceps femoris. With careful protection of the sciatic nerve, the external rotator muscles are incised, followed by the sectioning of the quadratus femoris. At this point, a finger can be carefully inserted into the space between the ischial tuberosity and the lesser trochanter of the femur to palpate and trace the course of the ischial ramus. Subsequently, the hamstring tendon attachments to the ischial tuberosity and the sacrotuberous ligament are carefully transected. Dissection continues using a finger dissector to access the deep surface of the ischial tuberosity, enabling precise osteotomy of the ischial ramus. Complete excision of the ischial tuberosity is then accomplished through meticulous osteotomy at the level of the lesser sciatic notch (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">

A combined anterior and posterior approach was used: the anterior approach via an ilioinguinal incision and the posterior approach via a PIG-S incision. The anterior incision exposed the muscle attachments around the anterior superior iliac spine. The rectus femoris and femoral vessels were carefully retracted to fully expose the superior pubic ramus, which was then transected as per the preoperative plan. Next, the posterior PIG-S incision was made. The proximal femoral insertion of the gluteus maximus was released to allow exposure and protection of the sciatic nerve. A tumor mass was identified inferior to the sciatic nerve. To access the mass, the semitendinosus, semimembranosus, long head of the biceps femoris, and the sacrotuberous ligament were transected. The muscular portion of the adductor maximus and the external rotators, including the obturator internus, were also carefully dissected. A finger was inserted between the lesser trochanter and the ischial tuberosity to accurately trace the ischial rami. The deep soft tissue mass was sharply dissected, and osteotomy was performed at the junction of the ischial and pubic rami. After incising the joint capsule, the hip joint was dislocated, and the femoral neck was transected 1.5 cm proximal to the lesser trochanter. The femoral head was subsequently excised. Using the osteotomy guide plate, precise osteotomy of the posterior superior acetabular margin was performed. The tumor was completely resected in an anterior-to-posterior direction. A customized 3D-printed acetabular prosthesis and a femoral stem prosthesis with a ceramic ball head were implanted to reconstruct the hip joint.

(<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) compared outcomes in 26 patients with chondrosarcoma who underwent intralesional curettage with those in 38 patients with chondrosarcoma who received wide or marginal resection. The 20-year recurrence-free survival rate was only 7% in the curettage group compared with 64% in the wider resection group. Similarly, Streitburger et&#x000a0;al. (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) analyzed clinical data from 80 patients with low-grade chondrosarcoma, concluding that while intralesional curettage might be acceptable for extremity lesions, marginal or wide resection is necessary for pelvic involvement to prevent tumor recurrence. Although local recurrence may not significantly reduce overall survival, it increases the likelihood of tumor progression to higher-grade chondrosarcomas, thereby elevating the risk of metastasis and ultimately reducing long-term survival (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>).</p><p>In Case 1, tumor recurrence occurred 9 months after curettage. The second operation involved en bloc resection of the ischial region. Eight months after the operation, the tumor recurred. The third surgery included extensive circumferential resection of the acetabulum and femoral head exclusion. Five months after the operation, the tumor recurred and progressed with lung metastasis. By contrast, Case 2 underwent wide resection of the ischial and acetabular regions based on a definitive biopsy diagnosis and remained recurrence-free after 15 months. These cases highlight that complete, <italic>en bloc</italic> resection of chondrosarcoma, especially when located at the ischial tuberosity, is essential to achieving favorable long-term outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="s3_2"><label>3.2</label><title>The design philosophy and application scope of PIG-S incision</title><p>Pelvic tumors are generally challenging to detect at an early stage due to their deep anatomical location. Consequently, most patients present with tumors significantly larger than those typically found in the limbs (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Consequently, achieving complete resection often necessitates a relatively large or combined surgical approach. Enneking and Dunham advocate for the ilioinguinal (extended inguinal) approach as the standard for treating pelvic tumors (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Originally designed by Letuoumel (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), this approach is primarily used for the reduction and fixation of anterior wall fractures of the acetabulum, anterior column fractures, and certain transverse fractures. The incision begins at the pubic tubercle, extends along the inguinal ligament to the anterior inferior iliac spine, and continues along the iliac crest to the posterior superior iliac spine. For anterior (Region III) resections, the incision must be extended medially toward the inner thigh, while posterior (Region I) resections may require posterior extension to the spinal midline. If necessary, a lateral incision can be added to access the posterior acetabulum, ischium, and sciatic nerve.</p><p>Although this mature surgical approach allows for the resection of most tumors in Regions II and III and facilitates prosthetic reconstruction, it presents significant challenges in achieving marginal resection of tumors located posterior to the acetabulum and ischium. The approach is associated with a high degree of operational blind spots and an increased risk of injury to nearby blood vessels, nerves, and organs. Especially, when the aim is to preserve the hip joint or a part of it and perform limited reconstruction, the hip joint itself obstructs access to posterior tumors, rendering safe marginal resection of the tumor extremely difficult and risky (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Therefore, <italic>en bloc</italic> resection of ischial tuberosity tumors cannot be effectively achieved through the ilioinguinal approach alone.</p><p>Although the posterior ischial incision was developed for ischial tuberosity tumors, it provides limited exposure, carries a risk of sciatic nerve injury, and does not adequately expose the ischial ramus (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>).</p><p>Upon reviewing the clinical courses of two patients discussed earlier, we observed a notable distinction from other large pelvic tumors: tumors located near the ischial tuberosity&#x02014;a critical weight-bearing region during sitting&#x02014;may elicit pain symptoms earlier in their progression. This early discomfort often prompts patients to seek medical attention sooner, enabling earlier diagnosis. If <italic>en bloc</italic> resection is performed while the tumor remains small, the prognosis can be significantly improved. Additionally, in cases where the tumor is confined to Region III, reconstruction may not be necessary following resection (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>).</p><p>In response to these findings, we designed the PIG-S incision to facilitate <italic>en bloc</italic> resection of malignant tumors in the ischial tuberosity region. By extending the traditional posterior ischial incision medially and laterally, we can fully expose the inferior border of the gluteus maximus and its femoral insertion, while also safely identifying and preserving the sciatic nerve. Although this incision is relatively extensive, it does not significantly increase intraoperative bleeding or surgical duration compared with the ilioinguinal or combined approach. In Case 2, where acetabular prosthesis reconstruction was performed, intraoperative blood loss was 1000 and 2000 mL in the two surgeries, with durations of 90 and 150 min, respectively. Postoperative follow-up revealed no complications such as poor wound healing or infection. Therefore, we compare the PIG-S incision with other classic posterior lateral pelvic incisions (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">
<bold>Table&#x000a0;1</bold>
</xref>) and preliminarily propose that the PIG-S incision is applicable in the following situations: 1. Isolated malignant tumors of the ischial tuberosity, especially chondrosarcoma; 2. Tumors not involving the sacral plexus, or cases where preservation of the sciatic nerve function is critical; 3. Complex tumors involving zones II/III that require combined approaches for complete resection. However, for patients with extensive soft tissue involvement, multiple metastases, or severe comorbidities who cannot tolerate lengthy operations, the PIG-S incision should be employed with caution.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Comparison of surgical incision characteristics in pelvic regions II and III.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="middle" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Characteristics <break/>of the<break/> approach</th><th valign="middle" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">PIG-S approach</th><th valign="middle" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Ilioinguinal approach</th><th valign="middle" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Iliofemoral approach(S-P)<xref rid="fnT1_1" ref-type="table-fn">

Key anatomical and operational features include the following:</p><sec id="s3_3_1"><label>3.3.1</label><title>The gluteus maximus and the subgluteal space beneath it can be fully exposed</title><p>The gluteus maximus, the largest and most superficial muscle of the gluteal region, is broad with a thick contour and slightly quadrilateral in shape. It originates from the posterior superior iliac spine, iliac crest, lumbodorsal fascia, sacrotuberous ligament, sacral and coccygeal bones, and sacral ligaments. Its fibers run obliquely downward and outward, with the lower quarter inserting into the greater trochanter of the femur. The gluteus maximus bursa separates the tendon from the greater trochanter of the femur. The upper three quarters form a band-like aponeurosis that merges with the tensor fasciae latae aponeurosis to form the iliotibial tract, which descends and finally attaches to the lateral condyle of the tibia. The PIG-S incision basically follows the lower margin of the gluteus maximus and turns toward the greater trochanter at the ischial tuberosity. Once the femoral insertion of the gluteus maximus is detached, the muscle can be retracted proximally, allowing full exposure of the subgluteus space (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). This semi-enclosed anatomical region connects with the pelvic cavity through the greater sciatic foramen. Anteriorly, it is bordered by the iliac periosteum, piriformis, external rotator group, and joint capsule; superiorly, by the gluteal origins and iliac crest; inferiorly, by the gluteal insertions; and posteriorly, by the gluteus maximus itself. The fascia within the space is dense, and the sacrospinous and sacroiliac ligaments are structurally robust, acting as natural barriers to anterior tumor extension (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3_3_2"><label>3.3.2</label><title>The sciatic nerve can be fully exposed and protected</title><p>The sciatic nerve, the most critical structure in the subgluteus maximus space, emerges from the sacral plexus and exits the pelvis through the greater sciatic foramen. It is enveloped by a protective layer of adipose tissue. When dissecting the nerve proximally, the inferior gluteal artery and vein&#x02014;located near the foramen&#x02014;become visible and must be handled with care. Upon lifting the gluteus maximus, deeper structures including the piriformis, superior and inferior gemellus, obturator internus, and quadratus femoris are revealed. Resection of the superior and inferior gemellus, obturator internus, and quadratus femoris allows for posterior retraction of these muscles, effectively shielding and preserving the sciatic nerve.</p></sec><sec id="s3_3_3"><label>3.3.3</label><title>A single incision can be made for the lesser sciatic notch and ischial ramus osteotomy</title><p>Following the dissection of the external rotator muscles and the quadratus femoris, the lesser sciatic notch can be easily exposed proximally, allowing for osteotomy at this site. By inserting a finger into the space between the lesser trochanter of the femur and the ischial tuberosity, the deep surface of the ischial tuberosity can be palpated. After transecting the sacrotuberous ligament, along with the long head of the biceps femoris, semitendinosus, semimembranosus, and part of the adductor magnus at their insertion points, the junction of the inferior pubic ramus and ischial ramus becomes accessible. At this point, a wire saw or bone chisel can be used to perform the osteotomy. Once completed, the ischial tuberosity can be entirely removed. Continued proximal dissection of the flap allows exposure of the superior margin of the acetabulum. In Case 2, we accessed the upper edge of the acetabulum through the posterior PIG-S incision and performed a Region II osteotomy using a pre-positioned osteotomy guide plate.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><label>4</label><title>Limitation</title><p>This retrospective study includes only two cases, as the implementation of a novel surgical approach requires informed patient consent and the accumulation of reliable, high-quality clinical data through long-term follow-up. As an initial exploration, this study is limited by the small sample size and absence of a control group. Future research should adopt a prospective design, include a control group, and expand the sample size. Additionally, since all case data originated from a single institution, future studies should aim for multi-center collaboration to enhance the generalizability of the findings.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><label>5</label><title>Conclusions</title><p>The careful selection of a surgical incision is crucial for the successful resection of pelvic tumors. Adequate surgical exposure is essential; attempting tumor removal through a limited incision may increase the risk of damage to vital structures and compromise the quality of resection. Optimal surgical outcomes are strongly linked to appropriate surgical techniques and approaches. The PIG-S incision allows comprehensive exposure of key anatomical structures in the ischial region, enabling <italic>en bloc</italic> resection of the ischial tuberosity while effectively preserving the sciatic nerve function. Moving forward, we aim to further validate this approach through additional clinical cases, thereby contributing to the anatomical and clinical understanding of this surgical technique.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors would like to thank the investigators and patients who contributed to this study.</p></ack><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s6"><title>Data availability statement</title><p>The original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/supplementary material.
