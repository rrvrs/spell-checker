Chronic hypophosphatemia can be caused by several conditions, such as fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23)-dependent hypophosphatemia, which can be genetic (caused by mutations of the phosphate regulating gene, PHEX) or acquired, and it is characterized by various symptoms, including reduced absorption of phosphate (due to vitamin D deficiency or resistance) and increased urinary excretion (due to primary or secondary hyperparathyroidism or primary reabsorption deficiency). Among the forms of FGF23-dependent hypophosphatemia with a genetic etiology, the most common is certainly X-linked hypophosphatemia (XLH), which can be considered the prototype of a hereditary disorder caused by loss of phosphate at the renal level. XLH is characterized by skeletal abnormalities of varying severity, growth retardation, rickets and/or osteomalacia, bone pain, enthesopathy, osteoarthritis, spontaneous tooth abscesses, hearing problems, and muscle dysfunction. Hypophosphatemic conditions which are FGF23-independent also exist (e.g., hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets with hypercalciuria, nephrolithiasis) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p id="Par22">The lifelong and complex nature of this condition requires an interdisciplinary approach aimed at managing the wide range of symptoms and at maximizing the patients&#x02019; quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p id="Par23">However, there are other less common forms of hereditary FGF23-dependent hypophosphatemia, such as autosomal dominant hypophosphatemic rickets (ADHR) and recessive (autosomal-recessive hypophosphatemic rickets, ARHR), polyostotic fibrous dysplasia, hypophosphatemic rickets with hyperparathyroidism and non-lethal Raine syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p id="Par24">Among the acquired forms of FGF23-dependent hypophosphatemia, there is tumor-induced osteomalacia (TIO), a rare paraneoplastic condition characterized by bone demineralization and a loss of phosphate through the kidney. Typically caused by a phosphaturic mesenchymal tumor of the mixed connective tissue, it can be caused also by other type of tumors (e.g., fibromas, chondrosarcomas, neuroblastomas, osteosarcomas, and soft tissue tumors), most commonly benign, but cases of malignant disease have been found [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In adult patients, this results in osteomalacia associated with bone pain, pathological fractures, muscle weakness, and vertebral deformity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par25">In recent years, international guidelines and consensus have been mainly released concerning the management of patients with XLH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], while only consensus documents are available for TIO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. This paper describes the results of a Delphi consensus that involved Italian experts on the management of hypophosphatemia in adults. The Delphi process aimed to reach a consensus on the case definition, diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of adult patients with hypophosphatemia. After examining the international literature, possible areas of uncertainty in the management of hypophosphatemic adult patients were identified. Subsequently, a set of statements related to the identified areas of uncertainty were submitted to the clinical experts in order to assess their level of agreement on the matter.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par26">A multidisciplinary advisory board consisting of nine physicians with expertise in the management of hypophosphatemic patients was established.

The full search strategy is reported in Online Resource 1. The study selection process was performed independently by two reviewers. The selection of studies was conducted in two phases. Records were initially assessed by screening titles and abstracts, based on predefined inclusion criteria: we included guidelines, consensus statements, integrated care pathways, written in English or Italian, reporting on the diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of adult patients with hypophosphatemia. Later, full-text articles of potential eligible studies were assessed. Disagreements between reviewers were resolved through discussion. The literature selection process is depicted in Online Resource 2 (PRISMA 2020 Flow Diagram).</p><sec id="Sec4"><title>Areas of uncertainty</title><p id="Par30">The authoring team, with the advisory board&#x02019;s support, decided to focus on certain aspects related to the identification of the hypophosphatemic patient, diagnosis, therapeutic options, and patient&#x02019;s follow-up. From the analysis of the guidelines and subsequent discussion, it was agreed to focus the consensus-seeking process on the following subjects: (1) definition of serum phosphate level thresholds; (2) threshold definition of the ratio of tubular maximum reabsorption of phosphate (TmP) to glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (TmPO4/GFR); (3) diagnostic usefulness of FGF23; (4) definition of FGF23 reference values; (5) definition of vitamin D deficiency in patient with hypophosphatemia; (6) definition of normal urinary calcium excretion values; (7) assessment of phosphorus intake in vegetarian and vegan diets; (8) evaluation of vitamin D levels and burosumab treatment; (9) assessment of physical performance as part of the assessment of the efficacy of therapies; (10) need for radiographic imaging for evaluation of elusive clinical signs; 11) use of Patient-Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs) for functional assessments. After defining a premise and a statement for these subjects, consensus was sought through the Delphi process described below.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Delphi study design</title><p id="Par31">A two-round Delphi method was used to reach consensus among a panel of clinical experts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. This method has been previously used by the authors in similar studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The Delphi method is a structured technique aimed at leading a group of experts to reach consensus on a complex or uncertain topic through a series of questionnaires interspersed with controlled feedback. The process guarantees the anonymity of individual responses, avoiding possible source of bias due to dominance and group conformity, also known as groupthink [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In addition, the method allows respondents to modify their initial judgements after receiving controlled feedback. Finally, respondents can provide comments on statements that do not achieve strong convergence, offering useful insights for the analysis of disagreements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par32">In total, 11 statements (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) were formulated for the purpose of the Delphi process. The panel received an e-mail invitation to participate in the study and completed the survey rounds online. Data were analysed with descriptive statistics. The panel was selected by convenience sampling, using the suggestions from the advisory board members, and consisted of 25 professionals operating in 13 Italian regions.</p><p id="Par33">

From a diagnostic point of view, it is also essential to discriminate between renal and non-renal causes of hypophosphatemia, measuring the ratio between the maximum tubular reabsorption of phosphate and the glomerular filtration rate (TmPO4/GFR) which must be calculated from fasting plasma samples and fasting spot urine from the second morning void (obtained 2&#x000a0;h after the first voided urine) for measurement of phosphate and creatinine. Recently, Arcidiacono and colleagues demonstrated that TmP/GFR must be effectively calculated also using 24&#x000a0;h urine collection in adult patients with FGF23-dependent renal phosphate leak [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. This parameter can be obtained using the Walton and Bijvoet nomogram or using the Kenny and Glen algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. If renal phosphate wasting is documented, a distinction must be made between hereditary and acquired FGF23-dependent or FGF23-independent conditions. Regarding family history, international guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] recommend that any first-degree family member of a patient with XLH should be investigated for XLH, even though sons of the males affected by XLH are not at risk. If the PHEX gene analysis produces a negative result for XLH, it is recommended to also evaluate other causes of hereditary or acquired hypophosphatemia. Furthermore, genetic counselling is recommended for patients with XLH, particularly in the transition from paediatric to adult age and for families planning a pregnancy. If genetic analysis is not available, elevated or inappropriately normal plasma levels of intact FGF23 and/or a positive family history of XLH support the diagnosis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Diagnostic workout</title><p id="Par40">The following laboratory tests are indicated for the diagnostic evaluation of the XLH patient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]: serum phosphate, serum calcium, bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (ALP), parathyroid hormone (PTH), 25(OH) vitamin D, 1,25(OH)2 vitamin D, FGF23, serum creatinine, urinary calcium: creatinine ratio, urinary phosphate and creatinine levels to be used for the calculation of TmPO4/GFR.</p><p id="Par41">The presence of hypophosphatemia and loss of phosphate through the urine, in the absence of Fanconi syndrome and hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets, suggests the need to look for a neoplasm in the context of oncogenic osteomalacia.

Primary Fanconi syndrome is usually sustained by inherited diseases (cystinosis, Wilson disease, tyrosinemia, galactosemia) and, being typical of the childhood, its main clinical manifestations are related to rachitis and growth defects. On the contrary, the acquired form of Fanconi regards the adults and its main skeletal manifestation is osteomalacia. Both the forms may be associated with asthenia, polyuria, polydipsia and hypovolemia (following ions losses), constipation and muscle weakness (due to hypokalaemia) and sings of hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis in case of rapid onset (headache, lack of energy, nausea, and vomiting).</p><p id="Par42">A series of additional tests can be considered for differential diagnosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], including urinary pH, plasma bicarbonate, urinary amino acids, urinary glucose, uric acid in urine, and low molecular weight proteinuria.</p><p id="Par43">Radiological examinations and other tests may be considered as well.

This statement collected discordant opinions among the 16 respondents, with a slight consensus in favour: 50% of the respondents in fact expressed a high level of agreement (scores from 7 to 9) on the statement indicating the need to measure FGF23 for the diagnosis and initiation of hypophosphatemia treatment. Respectively, 31% and 19% of respondents reported to be &#x0201c;moderately in agreement&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;slightly or not at all in agreement&#x0201d; with this statement. From the analysis of the reasons provided by the respondents, it emerged that the unreached consensus might be due to a partial misunderstanding of the statement itself: in fact, the statement wording probably failed to clarify that the FGF23 measurement plays a crucial role exclusively in the evaluation of the hereditary forms of hypophosphatemia. The members of the advisory board agreed that clinical chemistry and laboratory tests can certainly, in the early stages of the diagnostic process, lead towards the exclusion of FGF23-independent forms of hypophosphatemia. It was therefore reasonably assumed that a reformulation of the statement that included a specification on the nature of the condition would have resulted in substantially different levels of agreement and potentially favourable opinions from the panel. An additional element that frequently emerged, extremely important from a perspective of optimization and provision of health services, is related to the availability of the FGF23 measurement test. In fact, FGF23 is carried out only in some highly specialized centres in our country- which however do not manage all patients. Finally, it was highlighted that, when available, the measurement of FGF23 is not reimbursed by the National Health Service in a relevant proportion of cases. However, in some regions, it is provided at no additional cost for the patient.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par87">Our results offer the opportunity to make relevant considerations on the management of hypophosphatemic patients. First, they highlight that the Italian community of clinical experts is well informed and generally in agreement concerning the management of hypophosphatemia in adult patients. Furthermore, the analysis strongly underlines the need to develop clear national guidance documents (e.g. consensus, guidelines), not only to support the clinicians (or the multidisciplinary team) in patient management, but also to provide informative elements to those who, on different levels, have the responsibility to define the pathways and related services for a more accurate management of adults with hypophosphatemia.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.</p><p>
