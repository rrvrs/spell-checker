TAME 2.0 is a significant expansion upon the original TAME training resource pilot. TAME 2.0 specifically includes training organized into the following chapters: (1) Data management to enable scientific collaborations; (2) Coding in R; (3) Basics of data analysis and visualizations; (4) Converting wet lab data into dry lab analyses; (5) Machine learning; (6) Applications in toxicology and exposure science; and (7) Environmental health database mining. Also new to TAME 2.0 are &#x0201c;Test Your Knowledge&#x0201d; activities at the end of each training module, in which participants are asked additional module-specific questions about the example datasets and apply skills introduced in the module to answer them. TAME 2.0 effectiveness was evaluated via participant surveys during graduate-level workshops and coursework, as well as undergraduate-level summer research training events, and suggested edits were incorporated while overall metrics of effectiveness were quantified.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Collectively, TAME 2.0 now serves as a valuable resource to address the growing demand of increased data science training in environmental health research.

Data science is now a pillar of environmental health sciences, supporting the successful analysis and integration across an exploding availability of &#x0201c;Big Data,&#x0201d; allowing for integration and interpretation across clinical, epidemiological, social, toxicological, and chemical based evaluations (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Choirat et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Payton et al., 2023</xref>). Only through the effective handling of Big Data and integration across diverse data types will environmental health research better identify environmental drivers of human disease and formulate solutions to alleviate the global burden of disease attributable to environmental exposures (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Choirat et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Shaffer et al., 2019</xref>). Within its current definition provided through the National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Library of Medicine, data science as a field is also highlighted to include the dissemination of data-produced findings through &#x0201c;storytelling, visualization, and other means of communication&#x0201d; (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">NLM, 2024</xref>). Therefore, it is now of increasing importance to train environmental health scientists on data science principles to ensure effective data management, analysis, interpretation, and dissemination, while supporting the underpinnings of fundamental science and research.</p><p>Data science training resources are now in increasing demand worldwide. In the field of environmental health, some example agency-level data science training priorities have been outlined by groups including, but not limited to, the NIH Office of Data Science Strategy (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">NIH, 2024</xref>), United States Department of Defense (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Hartung et al., 2022</xref>), United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) Center for Computational Toxicology and Exposure (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Friedman, 2024</xref>), and the European Chemicals Agency (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">European Chemicals Agency, 2016</xref>). There is also a growing field of data science pedagogy (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Mike et al., 2023</xref>; <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Msweli et al., 2023a</xref>; <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Msweli et al., 2023b</xref>), which has highlighted the need for integrating traditional statistics and mathematical training with interpretation of real-world datasets in data science courses (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Hicks and Irizarry, 2018</xref>; <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Mike et al., 2023</xref>). Furthermore, authors of this article experience first-hand the growing demand for data science training, spanning undergraduates, graduates, post-doctorates, and staff contributing to environmental health research studies.</p><p>To address the growing need for data science training in environmental health, we originally launched the inTelligence And Machine lEarning (TAME) Toolkit, version 1.0 in 2022. The TAME Toolkit is an online training resource that was developed with the goal of promoting trainee-driven data generation, management, and analysis methods to &#x0201c;TAME&#x0201d; data in environmental health research. This publicly available resource was organized through applications-based training modules arranged through a GitHub Bookdown website (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Roell et al., 2022b</xref>) with underlying script made publicly available (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">UNCSRP, 2022</xref>). Modules were organized across three chapters, the first of which focused on introductory data science information. The second chapter focused on methods to incorporate chemical-biological analyses and predictive modeling efforts into toxicology and health research. The third chapter included examples of environmental health database mining approaches and data integration. This initial launch of the TAME Toolkit was accompanied by a parent publication (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Roell et al., 2022a</xref>) and has since attracted viewership worldwide as recorded through continuous Google site analytics (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Google, 2024</xref>) (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). TAME 1.0 was an important starting point to address the critical need for improved data science training resources, and authors have always acknowledged the need for this resource to be expanded upon and updated as the field continues to rapidly progress.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>FIGURE 1</label><caption><p>Global usage of the TAME 1.0 website since its launch in 2022.

Content was prioritized based on observations of the research team and worldwide agency-level data science training priorities. Research team observations included day-to-day interactions with trainees, colleague input, the peer review process, and current events such as the rise in popularity of artificial intelligence (AI) and ML, including natural language processing tools such as ChatGPT. Additional priorities across students, research teams, and agencies included the following: increased training on topics such as statistics and mathematics, improving data visualizations, transitioning between laboratory-based research to computational research, effective statistical method selection, and developing standards for data analysis approaches.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>2.2 Generation of TAME 2.0 training materials</title><p>To describe the methods and underlying software used to generate TAME 2.0, training content was drafted in R Markdown using a codified system, and a bespoke style guide was implemented to improve content ordering and visualization consistencies across modules (see <xref rid="s13" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Slides</xref>). Although each module was allowed flexibility, all modules started with an introduction to the module&#x02019;s topic to provide context and, when needed, domain-specific introductory materials and terminology. Then, a section was dedicated to informing the audience about the content to be explored in the module, which included background on example dataset(s) used throughout the scripted activities. Most modules also included a list of environmental health questions that were answered throughout the module using code, with the goal of engaging audience participation as viewers. Each environmental health question was answered, and supporting text was provided to assist the reader in connecting the concept with its execution within the code and associated annotation. Graphical overviews were provided when needed and were created using <ext-link xlink:href="http://Biorender.com" ext-link-type="uri">Biorender.com</ext-link>. All modules were rendered via Bookdown and are publicly available online and through the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC) SRP GitHub repository (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">UNCSRP, 2024a</xref>). Lastly, modules were wrapped up by providing additional resources for further reading and &#x02018;Test Your Knowledge&#x02019; (TYK) questions. These TYK questions provide trainees with additional example datasets to test what they were able to learn from the module in an additional environmental health research application. Input datasets are available in a folder within the TAME 2.0 GitHub repository (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">UNCSRP, 2024c</xref>), and solutions to these TYK questions, along with code showing how to answer each question, are provided as a separate GitHub repository (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">UNCSRP, 2024b</xref>). These solutions, including the dataset(s) and code, can be downloaded from the GitHub repository if trainees prefer to run them locally on their own computers.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>2.3 Testing and disseminating TAME 2.0 training materials</title><p>Many of the training modules were used as the basis for course materials for a graduate-level course at UNC titled &#x0201c;ENVR730: Computational Toxicology and Exposure Science.&#x0201d; Draft materials were presented as the content for lectures, and TYK activities were used as homework. The course survey was organized such that all classroom participants (n = 25) filled out questionnaires at the start of the semester, and at the end of the semester. Questions were designed to understand students&#x02019; level of familiarity with toxicity and exposure databases, ability to apply general data analysis techniques, and ability to describe or apply analysis techniques specific to environmental health questions (<xref rid="s13" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Table S1</xref>). Responses were on a Likert scale, with lower responses indicating less familiarity or ability, and higher responses indicating higher familiarity or ability. Administration and dissemination of findings from this course survey were reviewed by the UNC IRB and deemed non-human subject research due to subject deidentification protocols (IRB 24-1197). Survey results and training efficacy statistics/figures in this manuscript focus on the course evaluation. Responses were compared pre vs. post course completion using paired Wilcox tests and visualized using box plots and stacked bar charts in R. Additional dissemination of training efforts (summarized in <xref rid="s13" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Table S2</xref>) were coordinated through the following: (1) in-person data science training workshops (two workshops presented to a total of 60 participants), such as our PRogramming for Environmental HEalth And Toxicology (PREHEAT) Retreat (October 20&#x02013;21, 2022 at UNC); (2) longer research training programs (two programs, presented to a total of 25 participants), such as a summer-long Equity and Environmental Justice Program (QUEST) internship, a paid summer experience for undergraduate students interested in environmental justice-based research (yearly at UNC); (3) conference dissemination (four conferences of &#x0003e;500 attendees each), where we often describe how data analysis methods implemented in the discussed research are described through TAME training modules; and (4) promotion of the TAME Toolkit in dedicated presentations nation-wide, including presentations at the NIH, U.S. EPA, and several academic institutions (three presentations, presented to a total of 90 participants). Survey results and training efficacy statistics/figures in this manuscript focus on the course evaluation since it underwent IRB approval, though informal findings from workshops and other mechanisms of dissemination are provided via narrative text and were considered throughout development and refinement of TAME 2.0.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>3 Results</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>3.1 Improved training content</title><p>Training content improvements and expansions implemented within TAME 2.0 were prioritized based upon the review of information obtained from students/trainees, members of our research team, and agency documents, as described in the Methods.

These topics are listed in <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, alongside specific steps we coordinated to address these prioritized edits to TAME. As an example, trainees expressed interest in obtaining more hands-on training exercises.

Within each chapter, individual modules encompass specific topics related to that chapter&#x02019;s theme. Modules are generally designed to stand alone, though some modules may require working knowledge of content presented in previous chapters/modules, acquired through review of earlier TAME chapters and/or from other prior training experience. For example, a user who has not coded previously could begin TAME-based training in Chapter 1, while a user who has familiarity with R programming and basic analyses could begin training within later modules. Module content and recommendations are based on the authors&#x02019; expertise, and throughout modules, it is emphasized to consider best practices and approaches in the participant&#x02019;s research group and/or field of study.

The first module (1.1) describes principles that constitute proper data management based on Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability (FAIR) guidance principles (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Wilkinson et al., 2016</xref>). Part of what makes data FAIR includes publishing datasets in publicly accessible online repositories, which are discussed in Module 1.2. These principles are applicable to code as well and Module 1.3 demonstrates file management with GitHub, the most commonly used resource for depositing, sharing, and collaborating on code. The chapter concludes with Module 1.4, which provides examples for wrangling data in Microsoft Excel to make data files more amenable to performing downstream analyses, especially when using programming languages (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). This chapter collectively serves as a resource for best practices when sharing, publishing, and formatting data for easier dissemination and analysis in environmental health research.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>FIGURE 4</label><caption><p>Example training activity in Chapter 1, highlighting Module 1.4 &#x0201c;Data Wrangling in Excel&#x0201d;.

Module 2.1 serves as a step-by-step guide to walk readers through the basics of downloading R and RStudio, how to use the RStudio interface, and basic coding terminology and concepts. This introduction is followed by Module 2.2, which describes example &#x0201c;best practices&#x0201d; for coding. This module first describes differences between script file types (e.g.,. R script versus R markdown. Rmd) (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>) and then reviews script naming, annotation, organization, and coding styles. Next, the chapter shifts its focus to walk through reshaping and manipulating data as needed for succeeding analyses and visualizations in Module 2.3. The final module, 2.4, introduces approaches to improve coding efficiencies through more advanced coding skills, such as loops and functions. In summary, this chapter helps participants become more familiar with coding in R, the RStudio interface, and ways to organize data and script files for increased interpretability, data tracking, and ease of downstream coding exercises.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>FIGURE 5</label><caption><p>Examples of R files.

To address this, the modules in Chapter 4 provide examples demonstrating how to perform similar analyses using R. Module 4.1 provides an overview of experimental design, including replicates, and it introduces the example data that will be used for the subsequent modules in Chapter 4. Modules 4.2 and 4.3 demonstrate reading in various file types into R that are common outputs of wet lab experiments, handling missing data examples, and averaging replicates.

Modules 6.3, 6.4, and 6.5 are focused on mixtures analysis methods and provide examples of quantile g-computation, Bayesian kernel machine regression, and sufficient similarity, respectively (<xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref>). Then, module content transitions to computational modeling approaches; specifically, toxicokinetic modeling with the <italic>httk</italic> R package (6.6) and chemical read-across with the <italic>fingerprint</italic> and <italic>rcdk</italic> R packages (6.7). Collectively, this chapter represents many ways in which coding strategies can be used to answer important questions in environmental health using advanced approaches and provides essential background and steps needed to execute these analyses.</p><fig position="float" id="F9"><label>FIGURE 9</label><caption><p>Mixtures analysis methods for specific types of research questions.

In Module 7.1, the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Davis et al., 2021</xref>) is featured, with an example demonstrating how to access CTD data and perform a simple analysis of those data in R. Module 7.2 follows a similar structure and focuses on accessing and analyzing data housed within the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). Next, Module 7.3 demonstrates how to access data from the CompTox Chemicals Dashboard (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Williams et al., 2017</xref>) both through manual web-based query and through the recently developed <italic>ctxR</italic> package, which allows users of the CompTox Chemicals Dashboard to access the dashboard through an Application Programming Interfaces (API) request (<xref rid="F10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10</xref>). This module also demonstrates a variety of environmental health-based analyses that are reliant upon substance chemistry and toxicity that can be conducted once data have been acquired. Chapter 7 culminates with Module 7.4, which provides a scripted example of integrating data from multiple databases U.S. (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Author anonymous, 2024</xref>; <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">County Health Rankings, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">U.S. Environmental Protection Agency AirData, 2025</xref>) to assess air quality, mortality, and environmental justice. Altogether, the modules in this chapter provide trainees with knowledge that is needed to begin working with publicly available databases, a skill that is useful across scenarios such as validating experimental findings, integrating findings across groups, and generating new hypotheses.</p><fig position="float" id="F10"><label>FIGURE 10</label><caption><p>Example of database query options available to more quickly parse large datasets organized through the CompTox Chemicals Dashboard.

To quantitatively assess the efficacy of training, a course survey was specifically administered to a class of graduate-level students (n = 25) enrolled in Dr. Rager&#x02019;s course in the Fall of 2023, titled &#x0201c;ENVR730: Computational Toxicology and Exposure Science&#x0201d;. Materials used in the course consisted of training materials organized within TAME 2.0, and survey responses were collected pre vs. post course completion. Students reported significantly increased (p &#x0003c; 0.01) scores for all questions on the survey after taking the course (<xref rid="s13" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure S1</xref>; <xref rid="s13" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Table S3</xref>). Notably, students reported an increased level of familiarity with data analysis techniques to assess exposure and toxicity, increased comfort with applying a breadth of techniques (including Excel and R script) to analyze and visualize data, and increased knowledge of methods to evaluate chemical exposure associated disease risks and chemical-disease relationships (<xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Figure 11</xref>, <xref rid="s13" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figures S2&#x02013;S4</xref>). On a qualitative basis, we received feedback through multiple additional mechanisms of TAME 2.0 dissemination, spanning data science training workshops, longer research training programs, conference dissemination, and promotion of TAME 2.0 through dedicated presentations across the nation. Collectively, narrative-level feedback from these efforts tended to highlight the appreciation for such a resource to continue to expand, as trainees continue to communicate their interest in more data science training. Engaged audience members and workshop participants noted that the website was visually pleasing and that the training materials were welcoming towards participants of diverse backgrounds and levels of comfort surrounding coding.</p><fig position="float" id="F11"><label>FIGURE 11</label><caption><p>Pre- and post-course student survey results from UNC &#x0201c;ENVR730: Computational Toxicology and Exposure Science.&#x0201d; Students filled out a survey before beginning the course and after completing the course to understand changes in their <bold>(A)</bold> familiarity with and <bold>(B, C)</bold> ability to describe or apply computational methods in toxicology and exposure science.

In the spirit of its predecessor &#x02014; to equip trainees with skills required to &#x0201c;TAME&#x0201d; data &#x02014; relevant topics for inclusion were identified using undergraduate and graduate feedback in workshops and coursework, as well as input from experts and agencies within the field. Based on these insights, we released TAME 2.0, which includes expanded data science training content, hands-on training exercises, and a focus on communicating and disseminating results of analyses. The effectiveness of these training modules was subsequently demonstrated using surveys administered to graduate students prior to and following the implementation of the training program at UNC. This quantitative approach to evaluating effectiveness supports TAME 2.0 as one of the first educational resources to report educational data regarding its reach and effectiveness in the field of environmental health.</p><p>It is notable that data science training resources are currently expanding. For example, the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) recently posted a list of current resources for environmental health science data training (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">NIEHS, 2023</xref>), which mentioned our initial TAME resource. The majority of these resources are spread across different organizations and formats and often cover specific data science skills rather than illustrating applications of these skills to examples within environmental health. In contrast, TAME 2.0 is intended to span introductory to advanced applications and integrates didactic content, narrated scripted analyses in environmental health, and independent practice. Thus, materials across the TAME collection continue to provide unique training resources for participants engaged in environmental health research.</p><p>While TAME 2.0 gives an illustrative introduction to various data analysis methods, it is not intended to be exhaustive. Where relevant, the toolkit includes links to additional resources for trainees regarding R programming and in-depth explanations of analysis methods. Notably, the goal of TAME is not to prescribe specific analysis methods or styles to environmental health data but rather to demonstrate relevant approaches based on our coding and data analysis experiences. Others within the field may be preferential to other methods and styles, which is acknowledged throughout the modules, and readers are encouraged to consider standard approaches in their line of research or research group. Additionally, TAME 2.0 was scripted in the R coding language because R is an open-source language with relevant packages and compressive documentation, ideal for collaboration, reproducibility, and transparency. Due to these attributes, R has become a popular language for environmental health researchers. In the future, we seek to provide training resources in other coding languages, such as Python, to further increase accessibility of scripted analyses and leverage packages and methods that may be unique to specific coding languages. Lastly, measuring the effectiveness of data analysis training, such as TAME modules, is an ongoing challenge. In the future, assessment of effectiveness of data science training is needed, including both quantitative outcomes such as learner retention, time to competency for a module, and time to completion for a specific application based on engagement with the TAME website and qualitative feedback regarding trainees&#x02019; experiences using TAME 2.0.</p><p>In conclusion, TAME 2.0 represents a significant expansion on the original TAME resource and enables participants to independently gain skills relevant to environmental health data management and analysis. TAME 2.0 serves as an example of how training materials can be constructed to meet the ever-expanding needs for data science training, paving the way for future efforts, which will improve the capabilities of the research workforce and increase the quality and reproducibility of research studies in environmental health.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s5"><title>Data availability statement</title><p>The raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will be made available by the authors, without undue reservation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="ethics-statement" id="s6"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>Ethical approval was not required for the study involving humans in accordance with the local legislation and institutional requirements.
