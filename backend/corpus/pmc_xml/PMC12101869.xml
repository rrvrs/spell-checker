In 2003, Karck <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> [<xref rid="ivaf104-B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] used the Chavan&#x02013;Haverich device (Curative Medical Devices GmbH, Dresden, Germany) and named it &#x02018;frozen elephant trunk (FET)&#x02019;. FET is used to treat extensive aortic dissections and thoracic aortic aneurysms involving the distal arch and more distal segments, primarily to promote favourable aortic remodelling in these regions, and different commercial devices have been introduced globally. Frozenix (Japan Lifeline, Tokyo, Japan) was approved in Japan for insurance reimbursement in 2014 [<xref rid="ivaf104-B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], making FET a standard procedure for thoracic aortic surgery in Japan. The FET is known for its high aortic remodelling effect and ability to perform distal anastomosis at a shallow position during aortic surgery [<xref rid="ivaf104-B3" ref-type="bibr">3&#x02013;5</xref>]. However, stent-induced new entry (SINE) has been reported in approximately 15&#x02013;18% of cases, which is a relatively high incidence [<xref rid="ivaf104-B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], although most SINE cases are asymptomatic. SINE causes rapid aortic expansion or rupture, which has a mortality rate of 28% [<xref rid="ivaf104-B7" ref-type="bibr">7&#x02013;10</xref>]. The implicated risk factors for SINE include chronic aortic dissection, oversizing, stent length and forces inherent to the FET, such as the radial force, which expands the stent outwardly in a radial direction, and the spring-back force, a characteristic of nitinol that enables the stent to return to its original shape [<xref rid="ivaf104-B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="ivaf104-B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="ivaf104-B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Few studies have investigated the duration of these forces and their effect on the stent&#x02019;s shape over time [<xref rid="ivaf104-B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="ivaf104-B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Elucidating the long-term morphological changes of FET is crucial to improve follow-up strategies. Therefore, we conducted a single-centre retrospective study to investigate the morphological changes in FET during mid-term follow-up in patients who underwent Frozenix placement for distal aortic arch aneurysms or DeBakey type I or III aortic dissections between April 2014 and December 2023. The primary end-point of this study was the morphological change of FET, whereas secondary end-points included postoperative mortality, other clinical outcomes, aortic remodelling and aortic reinterventions.</p></sec><sec><title>PATIENTS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Ethical statement</title><p>This single-centre, retrospective observational study obtained approval from the Ethics Committee of Shizuoka Prefecture General Hospital on 6 August 2024 (protocol number SGHIRB#2024023). This study adhered to ethical standards under the 1964 Helsinki Declaration and its amendments. It was conducted in accordance with the STROBE criteria for retrospective studies. Written informed consent was waived due to the retrospective nature of the study. The study data were collected and stored in accordance with the ethical guidelines outlined in the WMA Declaration of Taipei. The establishment and ongoing management of the study database were reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committee of Shizuoka Prefecture General Hospital.</p></sec><sec><title>Patient characteristics</title><p>The FET was used in patients with distal aortic arch aneurysms or DeBakey type I or III aortic dissections involving extensive aortic disease. Patient selection flowchart is presented in <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>. This retrospective observational study included patients who underwent Frozenix placement at our hospital between April 2014 and December 2023. Clinical outcomes were analysed in all patients, whereas morphological changes were assessed in patients who underwent non-contrast or contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT), including CT angiography (CTA), with a minimum follow-up period of 1&#x02009;month. The present study aimed to evaluate morphological changes in the FET; therefore, patients with a history of thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) or descending aortic replacement were excluded. Patients who were treated with the original Frozenix, introduced in 2014, were included, whereas those treated with the newer Frozenix Partial ET, launched in 2023, were excluded. Frozenix was the only FET device available in our institution during the study period. During the study period, no patient underwent aortic surgery using Thoraflex Hybrid (Vascutek, Inchinnan, UK), which was also approved for insurance in Japan in July 2023. Additionally, E-vita Open NEO (JOTEC, Hechingen, Germany) has not been approved for insurance coverage in Japan.</p><p>Aortic dissection occurring more than 3&#x02009;months after onset were defined as chronic, whereas those occurring between 2&#x02009;weeks and 3&#x02009;months after onset were defined as acute.</p></sec><sec><title>Operative procedures</title><p>Preoperatively, we used a three-dimensional (3D) imaging analysis system to determine the circumference of the entire aorta and the true lumen at the intended placement site, calculating the vessel diameter in perpendicular view. We selected stents that were 105&#x02013;120% of the distal vessel&#x02019;s diameter for true aneurysms and 105&#x02013;110% of the true lumen&#x02019;s diameter for aortic dissection cases, following the manufacturer&#x02019;s recommendations. In cases where 3D image analyses were unavailable, the FET size was defined as 105% of the maximum diameter of the true lumen. The FET&#x02019;s length was selected to position its distal end in the straight segment of the descending aorta, avoiding extension beyond the level of the seventh thoracic vertebrae to minimize the risk of spinal cord injury (SCI).</p><p>In cases of aortic arch aneurysms, cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) was established via the ascending aorta with single venous drainage as the standard strategy. For aortic dissection cases, CPB was established via the femoral and axillary arteries, with double venous drainage through the superior and inferior vena cava as the basic approach. Antegrade cerebral perfusion under circulatory arrest and moderate hypothermia (25&#x000b0;C&#x02013;28&#x000b0;C) were used for the surgical process. The FET graft was transected, leaving 5&#x02013;10&#x02009;mm of the graft from the stent. Distal anastomosis was established distal to the left subclavian artery or between the left common carotid and the left subclavian arteries. When performing the distal anastomosis between the left common carotid artery and the left subclavian artery, the left subclavian artery reconstruction was achieved using one of the following two methods. In cases where the fenestration technique was used, following the report by Okamura <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> [<xref rid="ivaf104-B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], a fenestration was created through an &#x0223c;10-mm hole in the FET graft at the origin of the left subclavian artery using scissors. The other method involved reconstructing the left subclavian artery by anastomosing an 8-mm graft to the exposed axillary artery below the clavicle, guiding the graft through the thoracic cavity, and connecting it to a 4-branched graft.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical outcomes</title><p>Postoperative follow-up was conducted at 1&#x02009;month, 6&#x02009;months and 1&#x02009;year after surgery, and annually thereafter. During the follow-up period, the survival status and cause of death were investigated through direct outpatient visits and telephone inquiries. The follow-up period was concluded on 28 February 2024.</p><p>Patients with neurological deficits underwent brain MRI. Those with acute-phase cerebral infarction findings were classified as having cerebral infarction, and transient ischaemic attacks were excluded. SCI was defined as acute-phase infarction identified on spinal MRI or lower limb paralysis and bladder or rectal dysfunction, where cerebral infarction was ruled out.</p></sec><sec><title>CTA data acquisition and image reconstruction methods</title><p>We retrospectively investigated how the distal diameter and stent angle of Frozenix changed. The distal diameter was measured in the coronal and sagittal sections, and their average was considered as the distal diameter. Changes in distal diameter were analysed using follow-up data that were available for up to 5&#x02009;years. Consistent with a previous report, we defined the stent angle as the angle between the proximal and distal ends of the stent graft [<xref rid="ivaf104-B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and measured it using the 3D imaging analysis system, Vincent (Fujifilm Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="ivaf104-F1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a and b). CT follow-ups were performed at discharge, 1&#x02009;month, 6&#x02009;months postoperatively, and annually thereafter. Cases that required additional treatments for the distal aorta post-FET, such as TEVAR or descending aortic replacement, were excluded from the follow-up analysis of morphological changes after the additional intervention, as these treatments could alter the natural course of the morphological changes in the FET.</p><fig position="float" id="ivaf104-F1"><label>Figure 1:</label><caption><p>Measurement of stent angle and distal diameter.

Kaplan&#x02013;Meier curves estimated all-cause mortality, and the log-rank test compared groups. A mixed-effects linear regression model assessed the effect of time on the stent angle. All analyses were performed using SPSS (version 30, IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA).

Five (5%) patients experienced SCI postoperatively, two and three of which were transient and permanent, respectively. The logistic regression evaluating the association between the FET length and SCI incidence revealed an odds ratio of 1.08 (95% confidence interval 0.76&#x02013;1.54) for SCI occurrence per 1-mm increase in FET length, indicating no statistically significant association (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.656). A total of 18 patients (17%) developed cerebral infarction. However, six of these cases underwent emergency surgery without preoperative brain MRI, including three cases with coma. SINE was observed in seven cases (7%), including two of true aneurysm and five of aortic dissection. All cases demonstrated no aortic diameter expansion with conservative treatment; thus, no reoperations were required. Aortic reintervention was performed in 16 cases (15%), including 15 TEVAR cases (8 for false lumen expansion, 5 for aneurysm expansion, 1 for re-dissection and 1 for aortic rupture), and 1 descending aorta replacement for a descending aortic aneurysm. The incidence of reintervention was 6.92 events/100 patient years, and the median time to reintervention was 14.5 (IQR 6.0&#x02013;38.0) months.

These findings provide new insights into the long-term morphological changes of FET, which have been scarcely reported, and offer new perspectives on FET size selection.</p><p>The FET offers several advantages, including high aortic remodelling effect and distal anastomosis at a shallow level during arch replacement. In Japan, several studies have reported favourable outcomes using Frozenix [<xref rid="ivaf104-B3" ref-type="bibr">3&#x02013;5</xref>, <xref rid="ivaf104-B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Similarly, favourable remodelling outcomes have also been reported for other FET devices, such as Thoraflex Hybrid Prosthesis and E-vita Open [<xref rid="ivaf104-B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>Current knowledge about the radial and spring-back forces of FET remains limited. Factors that regulate these forces include the material, design and length of the stent. Most FET devices, including Frozenix, are made of Nitinol, which exhibits the shape-memory characteristics that generate the radial and spring-back forces. These properties may contribute to long-term morphological changes of FET. The diameter of the wire of the newer Frozenix Partial ET is &#x0223c;10% smaller than that of the original Frozenix, resulting in a 43% reduction in the spring-back force and a 29% reduction in the radial force. This highlights that wire thickness is also a crucial factor in regulating stent forces.</p><p>Kreibich <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> conducted an <italic toggle="yes">ex vivo</italic> experiment on the association between stent structure and stiffness, comparing the radial force of Thoraflex and E-vita by applying mechanical pressure to the distal ends of the stents. Thoraflex exhibited greater stiffness, which was related to its ring-type structure at the distal end and might be associated with its higher rate of SINE [<xref rid="ivaf104-B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. No similar studies have focused on Frozenix; however, Frozenix exhibits a distinct structure compared to Thoraflex and E-vita, indicating that radial and spring-back forces may vary. Thoraflex and E-vita comprise independent wires, whereas Frozenix is a woven-type stent formed by a single wire. Woven stents are considered to demonstrate a stronger spring-back force than independent stents [<xref rid="ivaf104-B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="ivaf104-B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In the present study, the stent angle changed by 5.5&#x000b0; over 6&#x02009;months, exceeding the 4&#x000b0; expansion over 3.8&#x02009;years reported by Osswald <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> [<xref rid="ivaf104-B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] for E-vita. However, Frozenix has an internal skeleton; thus, the direct stress on the aorta may be less than the external skeleton stents.</p><p>Remarkably, in this patient group, expansion beyond the product size of the FET was observed in 62% of cases. Similarly, Hayashi <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> [<xref rid="ivaf104-B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] analysed FET morphology in 45 cases using Frozenix and reported that it expanded beyond its product size in 95.6% of cases. Frozenix uses a woven graft, which is known to expand after placement under the influence of blood flow [<xref rid="ivaf104-B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Additionally, the stent used in Frozenix is &#x0223c;10% larger than the size of the graft itself; for example, a 27-mm FET contains a stent &#x0223c;30&#x02009;mm in size. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that expansion beyond the product size occurs after the implantation of Frozenix. If there is concern about sizing when selecting the FET, choosing a smaller size might be advisable, considering potential oversizing.</p><p>Although the all-cause mortality rate was relatively high (28 cases, 9.69 events/100 patient years) during the follow-up period, aortic-related death occurred in only one patient. The high overall mortality rate was influenced by the inclusion of older adults and high-risk patients with multiple comorbidities. Moreover, most deaths were unrelated to the surgery. In a study of 121 cases of FET using Frozenix with long-term follow-up, Tokunaga <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> [<xref rid="ivaf104-B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] reported an aortic-related mortality rate of 3% (four cases), including aneurysmal rupture, graft infection and non-occlusive mescentric ischemia. These results are comparable to our findings, suggesting the high potential of FET in reducing aortic-related mortality. As previously reported by some studies [<xref rid="ivaf104-B19" ref-type="bibr">19&#x02013;21</xref>], FET is a safe procedure even in resternotomy cases, such as those with a history of ascending aorta replacement for Stanford type A aortic dissection followed by enlargement of the aortic arch. In this study, seven patients (6%) underwent resternotomy, and their outcomes were comparable to those of primary surgery cases.</p><p>A total of 18 patients (16.8%) developed cerebral infarction. Among these, six underwent emergency surgery without preoperative brain MRI, including three patients with coma, suggesting the possibility of pre-existing cerebral infarction. Berger <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> [<xref rid="ivaf104-B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] reported cerebral infarction in 13% of patients undergoing FET for aortic dissection using the Thoraflex and E-vita Open, whereas Ogino <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> [<xref rid="ivaf104-B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] reported a cerebral infarction rate of 10% in patients undergoing FET with Frozenix. Based on these findings, we believe that there is no significant difference in the incidence of cerebral infarction among different devices.</p><p>Kreibich <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> [<xref rid="ivaf104-B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] reported a d-SINE incidence of 13% with Thoraflex and E-vita, which was comparable to that reported for Frozenix, estimated at &#x0223c;14% [<xref rid="ivaf104-B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="ivaf104-B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], though some studies have reported higher incidences [<xref rid="ivaf104-B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Given that our study had a relatively short follow-up period, the incidence of SINE may have been underestimated. The causes of SINE include radial and spring-back forces, oversizing and longitudinal strain mismatch [<xref rid="ivaf104-B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="ivaf104-B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Hiraoka <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> [<xref rid="ivaf104-B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] reported that the cumulative incidence of SINE after FET placement increased over several years after the procedure, which may be related to the persistent radial and spring-back forces. Symptomatic d-SINE accounts for &#x0223c;5% of all SINE cases. However, once SINE occurs, it can lead to rapid aortic enlargement or rupture, with an extremely high mortality rate of 25% [<xref rid="ivaf104-B7" ref-type="bibr">7&#x02013;10</xref>]. Thus, postoperative surveillance of morphological changes of FET and the occurrence of SINE is crucial, and regular CT follow-up is warranted.</p><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>This study has several limitations. First, it is a small-scale retrospective study with limited number of cases, preventing comprehensive statistical analysis. Especially, the analysis of stent angle was performed in only 33 cases, which is an extremely small sample size, limiting the generalizability of the findings. Second, the observation period is short, and further long-term studies on the morphological changes of Frozenix are warranted. Another limitation of this study is the lack of a comparative group, such as patients treated with TEVAR. In addition, the study population included heterogeneous diagnoses, such as aneurysms, acute and chronic dissections, and redo cases, which may have influenced the morphological outcomes.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>The sustained expansion of the distal diameter and stent angle observed in this study suggests that the radial and spring-back forces of FET persist through the mid-term postoperative period. These findings emphasize the importance of careful follow-up after FET placement to monitor ongoing morphological changes and the potential risk of SINE.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="sup1" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>ivaf104_Supplementary_Data</label><media xlink:href="ivaf104_supplementary_data.zip"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="ack1"><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>The authors would like to thank Enago (<ext-link xlink:href="http://www.enago.jp" ext-link-type="uri">www.enago.jp</ext-link>) for the English language review.</p></ack><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL</title><p>
