This study aims to investigate the therapeutic effects of Liupao tea aqueous extract (LPTAE) on ulcerative colitis (UC) induced by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in rats. The rats were randomly divided into five groups: the Normal group, the DSS group, the LPTL group, the LPTM group, and the LPTH group. Throughout the experiment, the rats&#x02019; activity levels, stool consistency, and body weights were observed and recorded daily. After the experiment, colon length was measured, and colon tissues were collected for pathological analysis. Additionally, the colon contents were analyzed for gut microbiota composition and short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) level, while serum samples were collected to determine inflammatory and oxidative factors. The results indicated that treatment with low, medium, and high doses of LPTAE significantly inhibited weight loss, alleviated rectal bleeding, and reduced colon shortening compared to the DSS group. It also decreased the disease activity index and histopathological activity index scores in the rats. Furthermore, LPTAE reduced the levels of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1<italic toggle="yes">&#x003b2;</italic>, IL-6, TNF-<italic toggle="yes">&#x003b1;</italic>, and malondialdehyde, while simultaneously increasing the levels of superoxide dismutase and SCFAs, including acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyric acid. 16S rDNA gene sequencing of the gut microbiota revealed that all doses of LPTAE reversed the decrease in both <italic toggle="yes">&#x003b1;</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">&#x003b2;</italic> diversities caused by UC, increased the relative abundance of beneficial bacteria such as <italic toggle="yes">Lactobacillus</italic>, Muribaculaceae, <italic toggle="yes">Alloprevotella</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">Blautia</italic>, and decreased the levels of harmful bacteria such as <italic toggle="yes">Prevotella</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Romboutsia</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">Bacteroides</italic>.

Chronic and recurrent inflammatory flare-ups can increase the risk of UC progressing to colon cancer [<xref rid="j_biol-2025-1106_ref_002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The exact cause of UC remains unclear, but current research suggests that its onset is closely related to factors including genetics, environmental influences, disruptions in gut microbiota, and autoimmune system disorders [<xref rid="j_biol-2025-1106_ref_003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The prevalence of UC has been rising globally in recent years, especially in developing countries, which has made it a worldwide public health concern, it is estimated that by 2050, there could be 1.5 million IBD patients in China alone, highlighting the severity of this issue [<xref rid="j_biol-2025-1106_ref_004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The primary treatments for UC include 5-aminosalicylic acid, sulfasalazine, mesalazine, biologics, and immunomodulators [<xref rid="j_biol-2025-1106_ref_003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. However, these medications often come with side effects and can be costly, creating a financial and physical burden for patients who require long-term treatment. Therefore, finding an economical, effective, and low-side-effect treatment for UC that encourages high patient adherence is of significant clinical importance.</p><p>Liupao tea, a well-known beverage from Guangxi, is cherished by the local population and is named after its origin in Liupao Town, Wuzhou City, Guangxi. Historical records trace the origins of Liupao tea back to a medical book from China&#x02019;s Northern and Southern Dynasties, as a type of black tea, Liupao tea is celebrated for its various health benefits, including improving stomach health and digestion, alleviating heatstroke and dampness, and enhancing intestinal function. During China&#x02019;s late Qing Dynasty, Liupao tea gained both domestic and international fame for its ability to alleviate gastrointestinal issues among Chinese laborers seeking work in Southeast Asia due to climate changes, this led to the tea being referred to as &#x0201c;life-saving tea&#x0201d; [<xref rid="j_biol-2025-1106_ref_005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Liupao tea is included in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia as a medicinal tea and is rich in active compounds such as tea polyphenols, tea polysaccharides, theanine, and alkaloids, which provide anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties [<xref rid="j_biol-2025-1106_ref_006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Research has shown that Liupao tea can regulate oral microbiota, enhance oral tissue regeneration, and reduce mild oral inflammation [<xref rid="j_biol-2025-1106_ref_007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. It also can regulate gut microbiota, relieve airway inflammation in allergic asthma, improve hyperglycemic conditions in diabetes, and reduce fat accumulation in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [<xref rid="j_biol-2025-1106_ref_008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="j_biol-2025-1106_ref_009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="j_biol-2025-1106_ref_010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Additionally, a study conducted by Gong et al. [<xref rid="j_biol-2025-1106_ref_011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] found that extracts of Liupao tea significantly promote the transport and colonization of beneficial bacteria like <italic toggle="yes">Bifidobacterium</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Lactobacillus</italic> in the gastrointestinal tracts of normal mice, while inhibiting the growth of harmful bacteria such as <italic toggle="yes">Escherichia coli</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Enterococcus</italic>. Liupao tea also demonstrates a remarkable ability to reverse ileal pathological damage and restore gut microbiota balance disrupted by antibiotics. Current research indicates UC is closely related to imbalances in intestinal microecology, characterized by a decrease in the abundance of probiotics and commensal bacteria and an increase in harmful bacteria [<xref rid="j_biol-2025-1106_ref_012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. One study revealed that germ-free mice developed symptoms similar to colitis after receiving fecal microbiota from UC patients, establishing a causal relationship between gut microbiota and UC [<xref rid="j_biol-2025-1106_ref_013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Therefore, we hypothesize that Liupao tea can effectively influence UC by inhibiting inflammatory and oxidative stress responses, which may be partly linked to its effects on gut microbiota.</p><p>We evaluated the therapeutic potential of Liupao tea aqueous extract (LPTAE) in rats treated with dextran sulfate sodium (DSS), a commonly used animal model for UC [<xref rid="j_biol-2025-1106_ref_014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. DSS is a highly hydrophilic compound, and its molecular weight ranges from 36,000 to 50,000&#x02009;Da, which gives it a specific binding affinity and toxicity toward colonic epithelial cells. This compound disrupts the integrity and permeability of the colonic epithelial structure, alters the characteristics of the gut microbiota, and induces UC. The DSS-induced UC model closely resembles human UC [<xref rid="j_biol-2025-1106_ref_015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="j_biol-2025-1106_s_002"><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="j_biol-2025-1106_s_002_s_001"><label>2.1</label><title>Materials and reagents</title><p>Liupao tea was purchased from Wuzhou Liupao Tea Co., Ltd.

The Normal and DSS groups were given an equivalent volume of saline solution. Throughout the study, daily observations were made regarding food and water consumption, fur appearance, activity levels, and stool consistency across all groups. On day 15, the rats were humanely euthanized. Under sterile conditions, blood was collected from the abdominal veins for analysis of inflammatory and oxidative stress markers. The colons were then extracted, their lengths were measured, and approximately 5&#x02009;g of colonic content was rapidly stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C for 16S rDNA gene sequencing to assess gut microbiota composition.

The PCR mixture had a total volume of 25&#x02009;&#x003bc;L and consisted of 12.5&#x02009;&#x003bc;L of 2&#x000d7; Taq Plus Master Mix, 3&#x02009;&#x003bc;L of BSA (at a concentration of 2&#x02009;ng/&#x003bc;L), 1&#x02009;&#x003bc;L of the forward primer (at 5&#x02009;&#x003bc;M), 1&#x02009;&#x003bc;L of the reverse primer (at 5&#x02009;&#x003bc;M), 2&#x02009;&#x003bc;L of DNA template (with a total DNA input of 30&#x02009;ng), and 5.5&#x02009;&#x003bc;L of nuclease-free water to bring the volume to 25&#x02009;&#x003bc;L. The thermal cycling conditions were as follows: an initial denaturation step at 95&#x000b0;C for 5&#x02009;min; 28 cycles of denaturation at 95&#x000b0;C for 45&#x02009;s, annealing at 55&#x000b0;C for 50&#x02009;s, and extension at 72&#x000b0;C for 45&#x02009;s, concluding with a final extension at 72&#x000b0;C for 10&#x02009;min. The PCR amplicons were analyzed for the correct band size using 1% agarose gel electrophoresis and subsequently purified with the Agencourt AMPure XP nucleic acid purification system. The purified PCR products were then subjected to high-throughput sequencing on the Illumina MiSeq PE300 platform, utilizing paired-end sequencing methodology. The resulting raw sequencing data were deposited in the NCBI Sequence Read Archive database, with sequencing services provided by Beijing Allwegene Technology Co., Ltd.</p></sec><sec id="j_biol-2025-1106_s_002_s_009"><label>2.9</label><title>Sequencing data analysis</title><p>After obtaining sequencing data from the sequencing machine, we demultiplexed the samples based on barcode sequences using QIIME1 software (version 1.8.0).

Imbalances in intestinal microecology are closely linked to the occurrence and progression of diseases, such as UC [<xref rid="j_biol-2025-1106_ref_036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Dysregulation of the intestinal microecology can disrupt immune homeostasis and the epithelial barrier function of the intestine. This disruption occurs through microbial metabolites that increase the permeability of epithelial cells, allowing harmful microorganisms to invade and colonize more easily, which in turn heightens the susceptibility to colitis [<xref rid="j_biol-2025-1106_ref_022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Patients with UC often exhibit reduced microbial diversity in their intestines [<xref rid="j_biol-2025-1106_ref_026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Our analysis of the colonic microbiota, utilizing 16S rDNA gene sequencing technology, supports this observation.

This intervention helps reverse the reduction in gut microbiota diversity in these rats, corrects the dysbiosis of the gut microbiota, and brings the composition and structure of the microbial community in colitis rats closer to that of the normal control group. These findings are consistent with the results reported by Zhou et al. [<xref rid="j_biol-2025-1106_ref_022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>Previous studies have indicated that Firmicutes and Bacteroidota make up over 90% of the relative abundance in the gut microbiota of both humans and animals [<xref rid="j_biol-2025-1106_ref_037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].

In our study, we observed that Firmicutes and Bacteroidota dominated the gut microbiota of rats across all groups, but there were variations in their relative abundance.

However, after intervention with LPTAE at tested doses (100, 150, 250&#x02009;mg/kg), the declining trend in the F/B ratio was reversed, approaching the levels observed in the normal control group.

This further confirms that LPTAE can promote the growth of beneficial bacteria, inhibit the growth of harmful bacteria, and play a significant role in regulating the balance of intestinal microecology.</p><p>SCFAs in the intestine are the main metabolites produced by the gut microbiota. They serve as important energy sources and functional regulators for intestinal epithelial cells. SCFAs primarily include acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid, isobutyric acid, valeric acid, and isovaleric acid. Among these, acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyric acid account for over 95% of the total SCFAs [<xref rid="j_biol-2025-1106_ref_048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], particularly butyric acid, which exhibits significant anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. Research has shown that the levels of SCFAs in the intestinal contents of patients with UC are significantly reduced, indicating a close relationship between SCFAs and the occurrence and progression of UC [<xref rid="j_biol-2025-1106_ref_018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Consequently, SCFAs can be seen as a bridge between the gut microbiota and UC. In this study, we observed that the levels of SCFAs in the intestines of rats with colitis decreased significantly, except for valeric acid, which showed a less pronounced decrease. The other SCFAs, including acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyric acid, displayed notable reductions. SCFAs can bind to G protein-coupled receptors GPR41, GPR43, GPR109, and others on the surfaces of intestinal epithelial cells and immune cells, they regulate intestinal epithelial barrier function, immune responses, production of reactive oxygen species in the intestine, inflammatory responses, and colonic motility through various signaling pathways, including NF-&#x003ba;B, TLR/NF-&#x003ba;B/HDAC, and AhR/IL-22 [<xref rid="j_biol-2025-1106_ref_040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Importantly, there is a bidirectional communication between SCFAs and the gut microbiota. SCFAs are produced through the fermentation of dietary fiber by the gut microbiota, and in turn, they function as regulators of the microbiome, helping to maintain the balance of intestinal microecology and homeostasis of the internal environment [<xref rid="j_biol-2025-1106_ref_049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Our research found that after intervention with the tested doses (100, 150, and 250&#x02009;mg/kg) of LPTAE, the decreasing trend of SCFAs in the intestines of rats with colitis was reversed to varying degrees. This indicates that LPTAE may help correct the metabolic imbalance of intestinal SCFAs, which could be the basis for its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects.</p><p>The gut microbiota often regulates the host&#x02019;s biological functions through its metabolites. In our study, we found that the dominant bacterial genera in the DSS group were negatively correlated with SCFAs, colon length, and body weight, while they showed positive correlations with inflammatory cytokines, MDA, and HAI. In contrast, the dominant bacterial genera following the LPTAE intervention were positively correlated with SCFAs, colon length, and body weight, while negatively correlated with inflammatory cytokines, MDA, and HAI. As noted earlier, the dominant bacterial genera in the DSS group are primarily associated with the onset and progression of colitis. On the other hand, the dominant genera after LPTAE intervention are more likely to be probiotics and commensal bacteria that produce SCFAs. These findings suggest that the gut microbiota imbalance in rats with colitis can be linked to a metabolic imbalance of SCFAs. LPTAE appears to rectify this metabolic imbalance by promoting the growth of SCFA-producing and commensal bacteria in the intestine while inhibiting the colonization of harmful bacteria. Consequently, this intervention exerts anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, alleviating the symptoms of colitis.</p><p>Our study does have certain limitations. We observed that LPTAE intervention alleviated symptoms of colitis in rats and helped to restore the intestinal microecological balance. However, it remains to be validated whether this effect is mediated by the gut microbiota in the context of UC. Additionally, the molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways through which LPTAE alleviates UC require further investigation. It is important to note that LPTAE is a complex mixture that contains multiple components, such as tea polyphenols, tea polysaccharides, theanine, and alkaloids. At this point, we cannot identify which specific component is responsible for the therapeutic effect on UC. This will necessitate precise isolation and purification of LPTAE, along with further experiments. Furthermore, we need to study whether these mixed components have beneficial or detrimental effects on other organs.</p></sec><sec id="j_biol-2025-1106_s_005"><label>5</label><title>Conclusions</title><p>In summary, our study demonstrates that LPTAE is an effective gut microbiota modulator. By utilizing LPTAE, we can reshape the gut microbiota in UC. This process promotes the growth of probiotics and beneficial bacteria while inhibiting harmful bacteria, thereby maintaining SCFA levels in the intestine. As a result, we observed a reduction in serum pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1<italic toggle="yes">&#x003b2;</italic>, IL-6, TNF-<italic toggle="yes">&#x003b1;</italic>) and an improvement in serum oxidative stress markers (MDA, SOD). These changes contribute to alleviating symptoms of UC in rats. Our findings provide essential data for the clinical application and the development of functional foods of Liupao tea.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="j_biol-2025-1106_fn_002" fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p>
