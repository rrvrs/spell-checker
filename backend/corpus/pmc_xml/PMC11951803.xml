Mutations in TDP-43 are rare, indicating that the progressive accumulation of exogenous factors &#x02013; such as cellular stressors &#x02013; converge on TDP-43 to play a key role in disease pathogenesis. Post translational modifications such as SUMOylation play essential roles in response to such exogenous stressors. We therefore set out to understand how SUMOylation may regulate TDP-43 in health and disease. We find that TDP-43 is regulated dynamically via SUMOylation in response to cellular stressors. When this process is blocked in vivo, we note age-dependent TDP-43 pathology and sex-specific behavioral deficits linking TDP-43 SUMOylation with aging and disease. We further find that SUMOylation is correlated with human aging and disease states. Collectively, this work presents TDP-43 SUMOylation as an early physiological response to cellular stress, disruption of which may confer a risk for TDP-43 proteinopathy.

Despite the highly heterogenous nature of neurodegenerative diseases &#x02013; likely owing to the extreme genetic and environmental diversity acting upon individuals &#x02013; a select few proteins are recurringly implicated in pathology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. TDP-43 is an essential RNA binding protein notorious for its involvement in neurodegenerative diseases including Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD). In a diseased state, TDP-43 is found mislocalized from the nucleus and aggregated in the cytoplasm of neurons within the central nervous system (CNS) in&#x02009;~&#x02009;97% and&#x02009;~&#x02009;45% of ALS and FTD cases, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Additionally, ALS and FTD exist on a clinical and genetic spectrum linked by TDP-43 dysfunction often referred together as ALS/FTD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Beyond ALS/FTD, TDP-43 pathology is increasingly linked to other neurological disorders including Limbic-predominant Age-related TDP-43 Encephalopathy (LATE), Alzheimer&#x02019;s Disease (AD), Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE), and Stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Thus, TDP-43 pathology has garnered much attention to better understand the causes of these diseases and to uncover potential routes of therapeutic intervention.
</p><p id="Par3">The accumulation of cytoplasmic TDP-43 aggregates is considered a late-stage event in neurodegeneration. Increasing evidence suggests that the partial mislocalization or complete depletion of TDP-43 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm is an early event in ALS/FTD pathogenesis, functioning independently &#x02013; however tightly associated &#x02013; with aggregation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. As a result, recent efforts have focused on the outcomes of TDP-43 mislocalization as early markers of dysfunction and/or mechanisms driving disease. Indeed, loss of function due to mislocalization of TDP-43 causes aberrant cryptic splicing in genes including <italic>STMN2</italic> and <italic>UNC13A</italic> that drive the progression of ALS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. To wit, cryptic mis-splicing of <italic>STMN2</italic> was recently found to correlate strongly with TDP-43 pathology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Additionally, once in the cytoplasm, TDP-43 can exert additional toxicity through gain of function effects by sequestering critical proteins into cytoplasmic aggregates thus disrupting crucial pathways leading to cellular demise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Together, dysregulation of TDP-43 is sufficient to drive neuronal dysfunction ultimately leading to neurodegeneration. However, the mechanisms instigating TDP-43 pathogenesis remain convoluted.</p><p id="Par4">Despite the overwhelming prevalence of TDP-43 pathology in ALS/FTD and related diseases, mutations in the gene encoding TDP-43 (<italic>TARDBP</italic>) are only present in less than 1% of all ALS and FTD cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. It is becoming evident that not one, but many genetic and/or environmental factors affect pathways converging on TDP-43 in ALS/FTD. Many ALS/FTD causative genes exert toxicity by disruption of key pathways such as nucleocytoplasmic transport and cellular stress responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The cellular stress response is a critical pathway tightly linked to ALS/FTD and TDP-43 supported via genetic, experimental, and epidemiological evidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. On the one hand, ALS/FTD-linked mutations disrupting various steps of the stress response pathways converge on the dysregulation of TDP-43 resulting in pathology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. On the other hand, exogenous insults such as aging, head injuries, viral infections, and other exposures may confer susceptibility or precipitate ALS/FTD and can serve as pre-clinical models of TDP-43 proteinopathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Motor neurons, the primary vulnerable cell type in ALS, are thought to be particularly susceptible to stress due to the high levels of excitotoxicity experienced throughout one&#x02019;s lifetime [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Indeed, prolonged cellular stress due to chronic stress exposure or failures in stress recovery can result in TDP-43 pathology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. However, much less is known about the molecular pathways acting upon TDP-43 in the cell stress response and how they might be linked to age-related neurodegeneration. Uncovering these mechanisms will help to better understand how environmental insults that occur throughout aging converge on TDP-43 and cause susceptibility to disease.</p><p id="Par5">Post translational modifications (PTMs) play key roles in regulating protein function and have been tightly linked to TDP-43 (dys)function and disease. TDP-43 is modified by an array of PTMs including phosphorylation, ubiquitination, acetylation, and polyADP-ribosylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Abnormal TDP-43 phosphorylation and ubiquitination are pathognomonic of ALS and TDP-43 related FTD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Recent studies have suggested that SUMOylation &#x02013; the covalent conjugation of a Small Ubiquitin-like Modifier (SUMO) to target lysine residues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>] &#x02013; by SUMO1 may have a role in regulating TDP-43 nucleocytoplasmic transport and RNA binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. SUMO1 is best characterized for its roles in nucleocytoplasmic shuttling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. SUMO2 however is the only essential SUMO paralog and selectively plays roles in orchestrating cellular stress responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. SUMO2 has previously been observed in TDP-43 aggregates in vitro and is related with TDP-43 insolubility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. However, it is unclear whether TDP-43 is a direct target of SUMO2 and what the implications are on TDP-43 function and disease pathogenesis.</p><p id="Par6">Here, we show that TDP-43 is modified by SUMO2 selectively in response to cellular stressors. TDP-43 becomes SUMOylated within the nucleus early in response to stress, upstream of TDP-43 aggregation. Modification by SUMO2 is further correlated with dosage and duration of cellular stress and peaks during the recovery phase before it is cleared through the ubiquitin proteosome system. We further identified four E3 SUMO ligases that can modulate the levels of TDP-43 SUMOylation. We found that TDP-43 is SUMOylated by SUMO2 in a conserved region of the C-terminal domain at lysine (K) 408 directly adjacent to phosphorylation residues serine (S) 409/410 characteristically phosphorylated in TDP-43 aggregates. To understand the physiological consequences of blocking TDP-43 SUMOylation, we generated a knock in mouse model bearing a p.K408R point mutation in endogenous mouse <italic>Tardbp</italic> allele. Cortical neurons cultured from these mice display impaired stress recovery and accumulation of nuclear TDP-43. These mice do not show abnormalities in development but develop mild social and cognitive deficits as they age. Pathologically, we observe TDP-43 mislocalization and accumulation of phosphorylated TDP-43 in the spinal cord and significant denervation of neuromuscular junctions in aged mice. As SUMOylation of TDP-43 plays a protective role in mice during aging, we assessed human brain samples and observed a positive correlation between global SUMOylation and age inferring an increased demand on SUMO-related pathways during aging. Finally, we observed significant increase in TDP-43 and SUMO2 interactions in the prefrontal cortex from individuals diagnosed with ALS/FTD compared to unaffected controls suggesting SUMOylation is actively engaged in regulating TDP-43 in disease states.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>TDP-43 is SUMOylated in the nucleus in a context specific manner</title><p id="Par7">Various acute stressors including oxidative (sodium arsenite, NaAsO<sub>2</sub>), hyperosmotic (D-sorbitol and sodium chloride), and heat shock have been demonstrated to induce TDP-43 mislocalization and aggregation in vitro, helping to uncover key mechanisms affected in disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. As sodium arsenite is a commonly used stressor to interrogate TDP-43 alterations, we examined whether TDP-43 became SUMOylated in response to sodium arsenite treatment. Using an immunoprecipitation assay (&#x0201c;SUMOylation Assay&#x0201d;, Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A) to immunoprecipitate HA-SUMO bound proteins under denaturing conditions to disrupt non-covalent protein interactions, we found that TDP-43 becomes SUMOylated by SUMO2 and can form polySUMO chains specifically in response to stress (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B). Interestingly we found that sodium arsenite and heat shock stressors, but not hyperosmotic stress, induced TDP-43 SUMOylation suggesting that SUMOylation is a context specific modifier of TDP-43 (Fig. S1A). However, it remains unclear whether TDP-43 SUMOylation functions down a pathway shared by sodium arsenite and heat shock, or whether TDP-43 SUMOylation responds to a specific stress burden not met under hyperosmotic stress despite the formation of stress granules.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>SUMOylation dynamically regulates nuclear TDP-43 in a stress-responsive manner. <bold>A</bold> Schematic of immunoprecipitation assays to detect TDP-43 SUMOylation. <bold>B</bold> Representative SUMOylation Assay western blot in HEK293T cells detecting TDP-43 SUMOylation specifically in response to 1 h sodium arsenite (250 &#x000b5;M) stress. *&#x02009;=&#x02009;SUMOylated TDP-43, **&#x02009;=&#x02009;PolySUMOylated TDP-43. <bold>C</bold> Schematic&#x000a0;of TDP-43-GFP Nuclear Localization Sequence (NLS) variants and representative florescent microscopy analysis of their subcellular localization.

Strikingly, we found that TDP-43 SUMOylation was modified by SUMO2 and SUMO3 specifically under stressed conditions; consistent with the conserved roles of SUMO2 and SUMO3 in response to stress (Fig. S1B). Mature (covalently bound) SUMO2 and SUMO3 share nearly 100% amino acid homology making them difficult to differentiate and thus referred together as SUMO2/3. Since SUMO2 is the only essential and most abundantly expressed SUMO paralog in the CNS and sodium arsenite is commonly used to study TDP-43 pathobiology, we focused on TDP-43 SUMOylation by SUMO2 in response to sodium arsenite stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>].</p><p id="Par9">To test whether TDP-43 SUMOylation is linked with disease-like states, we expressed ALS-linked mutant TDP-43 (TDP-43<sup>Q331K</sup>) and found that TDP-43 SUMOylation was significantly increased compared to wild type TDP-43 (Fig. S1C). Next, we disrupted the nuclear localization sequence in TDP-43 (TDP-43<sup>NLSmut</sup>) to mislocalize TDP-43 to the cytoplasm and found that in response to sodium arsenite, TDP-43<sup>NLSmut</sup> blocks SUMOylation indicating that nuclear localization is essential for TDP-43 SUMOylation (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>C,D). Classically, lysine (K) residues, in addition to arginine (R) residues, are critical components of a traditional NLS to enable the interaction with importins to facilitate nuclear import of proteins; but they may also be direct targets of SUMOylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. To determine whether loss of TDP-43 SUMOylation is mediated through loss of nuclear localization or disruption of lysine (K) residues in the NLS, we sought to restore TDP-43 localization to rescue TDP-43 SUMOylation. We surveyed the literature to identify a NLS that functions independent of lysine (K) residues. Previous studies have demonstrated that the RNA binding protein HNRNPA1 contains a non-conventional PY-NLS to facilitate nuclear localization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. We expressed a chimeric TDP-43 where the native NLS was replaced with an HNRNPA1 PY-NLS (TDP-43<sup>PY&#x02212;NLS</sup>) and found that TDP-43<sup>PY&#x02212;NLS</sup> localizes to the nucleus reflecting wild type TDP-43 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>C). By performing a GFP-Trap SUMOylation assay we found that TDP-43<sup>PY&#x02212;NLS</sup> rescues the loss of SUMOylation observed when expressing TDP-43<sup>NLSmut</sup> indicating that nuclear localization, and not the lysine (K) residues within the NLS, is required for stress-dependent TDP-43 SUMOylation (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>D).</p><p id="Par10">Finally, we aimed&#x000a0;to validate our findings and visualize the interaction between TDP-43 and SUMO2 in primary cortical neurons. As TDP-43 and SUMO2 are widely expressed throughout the nucleus, co-localization analysis is challenging to infer SUMOylation events (Fig. S1D). To visualize the interaction between TDP-43 and SUMO2/3 we performed a proximity ligation assay (PLA) in murine primary cortical neurons cultures (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>E, Fig. S1E). We found that in response to sodium arsenite there is a significant increase in PLA signal between endogenous TDP-43 and SUMO2/3 in the nucleus. Taken together, SUMOylation may be an important mechanism regulating nuclear TDP-43 upstream of mislocalization in response to stress.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>SUMOylation is an early event in response to stress and helps clear TDP-43 through the ubiquitin proteasome system during recovery</title><p id="Par11">Prolonged cellular stress in vitro leads to mislocalization of TDP-43 and progressive transition into insoluble aggregates resembling aspects of pathology observed in disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. As TDP-43 SUMOylation occurs within the nucleus upstream of nuclear egress, we postulated that SUMOylation would occur upstream of aggregation during prolonged sodium arsenite stress. To test this hypothesis, we performed a time course assay to characterize the dynamics of TDP-43 SUMOylation during prolonged treatment with sodium arsenite. We observed that TDP-43 becomes readily SUMOylated in the first 15&#x02013;30 min of the acute stress response upstream of the accumulation of RIPA-insoluble, phosphorylated TDP-43 (Fig. S1F). Furthermore, we observed an increase in TDP-43 SUMOylation that linearly correlated with the duration of stress (R<sup>2</sup>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.6922, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001). To determine whether SUMOylation occurs in response to relative stress intensity, we performed a dose response assay and found that TDP-43 SUMOylation is proportional to relative stress intensity (Fig. S1G). Therefore, the increase in TDP-43 SUMOylation during prolonged stress is likely due to an increased stress burden over time.</p><p id="Par12">To determine the fate of SUMOylated TDP-43, we performed a stress-recovery time-course assay where cells were stressed with sodium arsenite for up to 1 h, then allowed cells to recover after washout. For the first hour during stress recovery, we observed an&#x02009;~&#x02009;threefold increase in TDP-43 SUMOylation indicating that TDP-43 continues to be SUMOylated and polySUMOylated during the early stages of stress recovery (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>F). Furthermore, SUMOylated TDP-43 was not detectable after 3 h of recovery, suggesting that most of the clearance occurs between 2&#x02013;3 h post stress. TDP-43 is known to interact with the SUMO-Targeted Ubiquitin Ligase RNF4 which can polyUbiquitinate SUMOylated proteins to be degraded through the UPS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. To determine whether the UPS functions to clear SUMOylated TDP-43 during stress recovery, we treated cells with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 and monitored TDP-43 SUMOylation during stress and recovery. We observed that inhibiting the UPS system by MG132 treatment prevented clearance of SUMOylated TDP-43 during post-stress recovery indicating that SUMOylated TDP-43 is marked for degradation by the UPS pathway. Importantly, treatment with MG132 for 1 or 4 h was not sufficient to induce TDP-43 SUMOylation by itself, consistent with the stress-selective nature inducing TDP-43 SUMOylation. Taken together, TDP-43 SUMOylation occurs early in the stress response which then leads to ubiquitin-targeted clearance during stress recovery demonstrating SUMOylation may be an important mechanism regulating nuclear TDP-43 proteostasis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Stress-dependent TDP-43 SUMOylation is mediated by select E3 SUMO ligases</title><p id="Par13">E3 SUMO ligases are important mediators for SUMOylation of select substrates and enable spatiotemporal regulation of this modification.

To identify potential E3 SUMO ligases that may regulate TDP-43 SUMOylation, we first performed a literature search to identify potential ligases with evidence of mediating SUMOylation. We prioritized 15 candidate E3 SUMO ligases and using a dual sgRNA/Cas9 approach generated knockout cell lines for each of the candidate ligases and performed GFP-Trap SUMOylation assays to test the effects on TDP-43 SUMOylation (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>G) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>].

By performing a GFP-trap SUMOylation assay, we observed that TDP-43<sup>K136R</sup> did not block sodium arsenite-induced TDP-43 SUMOylation (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A). Through fluorescent microscopy, we observed that TDP-43<sup>K136R</sup> formed nuclear puncta with resemblance to RNA-binding deficient TDP-43 (5FL) (Fig. S2A). We predicted the structure of TDP-43 and TDP-43<sup>K136R</sup> with AlphaFold3 in the presence of UG repeated RNA and found that K136R is predicted to slightly alter the tertiary structure of TDP-43 and affect the interaction with RNA (Fig. S2B and S2C).

In addition, we were surprised to find a significant increase in the proportion of stress granules colocalizing with TDP-43-SUMO2-HA compared to TDP-43-HA alone. Taken together this suggests that SUMOylation of TDP-43 at the C-terminus converges on stress response pathways involving stress granules and the integrated stress response (i.e. eIF2&#x003b1; pathway).

Together, TDP-43<sup>K408R/K408R</sup> neurons appropriately respond to, but not efficiently resolve acute cellular stress which may render cells vulnerable to further insult.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Blocking TDP-43 SUMOylation at K408 impairs the cellular stress response in neurons. <bold>A</bold> Representative images and quantification of G3BP1 stress granule dynamics in mouse primary cortical neurons (7 DIV) during stress (1 h 250 &#x003bc;M sodium arsenite) and recovery.

We designed a paradigm where primary cortical neurons were stressed for 30 min with sodium arsenite then allowed to recover for 30 min before receiving subsequent insults. We stressed and recovered the same neurons a total of 3 times over 3 h and assessed stress granule dynamics in SUMO-competent (TDP-43<sup>+/+</sup>) and SUMOylation-deficient (TDP-43<sup>K408R/K408R</sup>) neurons. In TDP-43<sup>+/+</sup> neurons we observed that during the first stress phase, stress granules formed in a proportion of neurons which were then retained during the first recovery (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>D). Subsequent rounds of stress further increased the proportion of cells containing stress granules which were roughly maintained or decreased during subsequent rounds of recovery suggesting that recovery pathways are being engaged and subsequent stress induces an additive effect without full recovery. In TDP-43<sup>K408R/K408R</sup> neurons however we observed the initiation of stress granule formation in the first 30 min of stress that followed by inappropriate reactivation and recovery following subsequent rounds of stress. This supports that stress responses related to stress granule dynamics are altered in TDP-43<sup>K408R/K408R</sup> likely related to inefficient recovery. Additionally, we observed a striking increase in the proportion of cells presenting with nuclear TDP-43 foci after the third round of stress and recovery (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>E), though increases in TDP-43 mislocalization in this experimental paradigm were rather marginal and did not reach significance(Fig. S6E).</p><p id="Par24">To better determine how blocking TDP-43 SUMOylation may respond to mild chronic stress, we treated neurons with low dose of sodium arsenite for 30 h then allowed them to recovery for 3 days and assessed biochemical changes in TDP-43 solubility. In TDP-43<sup>+/+</sup> neurons we observed a significant decrease in RIPA soluble TDP-43 after chronic stress followed by a marked increase in phosphorylated TDP-35 fragments in the urea-fraction (Fig. S6F). Upon recovery these fragments were cleared and insoluble TDP-43 returned to unstressed levels by 72 h recovery. In TDP-43<sup>K408R/K408R</sup> neurons however, we observed the same changes in response to chronic stress, however during recovery we observed significantly lower soluble TDP-43 levels and significantly increased phosphorylated TDP-35 fragments in the urea-fraction. Furthermore, we observed significant shift in the solubility of Ubiquitinated proteins during recovery. Taken together, blocking TDP-43 SUMOylation impairs the ability for cells to recover from cellular stress and may shift to other pathways involving phosphorylation or cleavage to regulate TDP-43.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Blocking TDP-43 SUMOylation in vivo leads to female-specific social and cognitive deficits</title><p id="Par25">Following on our findings that blocking TDP-43 SUMOylation affect neurons abilities to recover from repeated or mild cellular stress, we posited that blocking TDP-43 SUMOylation in aging may render long lived cells (i.e. neurons) vulnerable across aging as mild life stresses accumulate over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Thus, we aimed to comprehensively characterize the TDP-43<sup>K408R</sup> mice across their lifespan to uncover the baseline phenotypic changes that occur with aging as an innate stress upon cells. As TDP-43 SUMOylation is involved in supporting the normal cellular stress response and maintaining TDP-43 proteostasis, we hypothesized that disrupting this process leads to age-dependent physiological changes accelerated by impaired stress responses and TDP-43 accumulation. To ensure that the K408R mutation did not lead to post gestational developmental changes that would confound the presentation of age-related impairment, we assessed the weights and motor abilities of pups at P21. We did not observe any significant differences between TDP-43<sup>+/+</sup> and TDP-43<sup>K408R/K408R</sup> with respect to body weight or motor abilities indicating that blocking TDP-43 SUMOylation does not lead to gross developmental abnormalities (Fig. S7A-C).To determine whether blocking TDP-43 SUMOylation leads to phenotypes in an age-dependent manner, we assessed general wellness biweekly, including measuring body weight and hindlimb clasping scores, and performed a battery of 14 behavioral tests focusing on motor, social, and cognitive function related to ALS and FTD at three time points (2, 9 and 16 months, Fig. S7D-F, S8-10).&#x000a0;Of note: TDP-43<sup>K408R/+</sup> mice are generally omitted from figures for clarity to avoid confounding variables that may arise due to asymmetric regulation of wild type and K408R alleles due to the autoregulatory nature of TDP-43 (i.e. potential dominant negative effects conferred by the mutation and not partial loss of SUMOylation), but are accessible in Table S2 and typically exhibit a milder phenotype than TDP-43<sup>K408R/K408R</sup>.</p><p id="Par26">We were surprised to observe that blocking TDP-43 SUMOylation in TDP-43<sup>K408R</sup> mice resulted in sex-specific cognitive and social deficits selective to female animals. Starting around 2 months of age, we observed significant barbering in female mice leading to alopecia in the K408R mutants (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A). Consistent with this finding, we found that aged female TDP-43<sup>K408R/K408R</sup> mice were significantly more submissive to their TDP-43<sup>+/+</sup> counterparts in the tube test (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>B). Thus, blocking TDP-43 SUMOylation leads to social abnormalities in female mice. In assessing the cognitive behaviors, we observed significant risk taking and hyperactivity in the open field test at 2 months of age (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>C). This hyperactivity was age-dependent and selectively affected young female mice as they were significantly less active than their TDP-43<sup>+/+</sup> counterparts at 9 months of age in the open field tests (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>C). Additionally, these female TDP-43<sup>K408R/K408R</sup> mice presented with significant impairment during habituation at 9 months in the beam break test (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>D). As there was no change in motor abilities in the rotarod and digigait tests (Fig. S9C,D), we rationalized that the activity abnormalities were likely due to cognitive and anxiety impairments as opposed to motor impairments. By 16 months of age, female TDP-43<sup>K408R/K408R</sup> mice performed significantly worse than TDP-43<sup>+/+</sup> mice in the spontaneous Y-maze, inferring age-dependent cognitive decline in the domain of working memory (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>E). Together, female mice present with social and cognitive impairment in early age with slight impairments in cognitive performance with aging. There were no significant cognitive effects in male TDP-43<sup>K408R/K408R</sup> mice, however mild impairments were observed on the rotarod test at 9 months of age (2-way ANOVA <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.0273, Table S2). This deficiency was not observed at 16 months of age, largely due to all mice performing significantly worse at the rotarod task, limiting the interpretation of this assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">93</xref>]. Taken together, the age-dependent cognitive and social impairment observed in female TDP-43 SUMO-deficient mutants highlight interesting and unexplored aspects of TDP-43 with important implications for understanding sex-specific roles of TDP-43 SUMOylation.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Blocking TDP-43 SUMOylation at K408 in vivo leads to sex-specific social and cognitive impairment in female mice. <bold>A</bold> Representative image of a barbered female mouse and quantification of cumulative barbering probability. 2-Way ANOVA with Tukey&#x02019;s Multiple Comparisons, *** <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0005. <bold>B</bold> Tube test of social dominance at 16 months of age (16MO) displaying the total head-to-head battles and win percentage by genotype comparing wild type against K408R (K408R/&#x02009;+&#x02009;and K408R/K408R animals).

We did not observe significant differences in cortical thickness of the primary motor cortex nor prefrontal cortex in male or female mice across all timepoints suggesting that loss of TDP-43 SUMOylation does not lead to widespread cortical degeneration occurring during normal aging (Fig. S11A,B). To gain an additional layer of granularity into vulnerable neuron subpopulations in the cortex, we stained for CTIP2 to highlight neurons in layer V, including upper motor neurons, in the cortex and did not observe significant differences in neuron quantity across aging (Fig. S11C,D). We further stained for CUX1 as a marker of layer II/III neurons which can be vulnerable to TDP-43 pathology in FTD and degeneration in Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease. Again, we did not observe significant changes in male nor female mice across the mouse lifespan supporting the absence of cortical degeneration in TDP-43<sup>K408R</sup> animals during native aging (Fig. S11C,D). To determine if blocking TDP-43 SUMOylation results in neuroinflammation, we probed for the reactive astrocyte marker GFAP and reactive microglia marker Iba1 and observed no change in neuroinflammation (Fig. S11E-H). Together these data suggest the process of aging does not lead to cortical neurodegeneration nor cortical neuroinflammation.</p><p id="Par28">Cellular and molecular changes are generally thought to precede behavioral changes in mouse models and human disease. Our biochemical and cellular assays show that stress-induced SUMOylation helps to clear TDP-43 during recovery and blocking TDP-43 SUMOylation in neurons leads to impaired recovery from stress and TDP-43 accumulation (Figs. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>E,&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, Fig. S6A,F). Due to the sex-specific social and cognitive impairment in female mice, we posited that TDP-43 accumulation would reflect the behavioural changes. Consistent with the sex-specific social and cognitive impairment described above, we find that insoluble phosphorylated TDP-43 accumulated in the cortex of female, but not male mice (Fig. S12A,B). Furthermore, this accumulation was observed as early as 2 months of age and was maintained throughout aging, which may imply that impaired TDP-43 proteostasis is underlying the social and cognitive phenotypes observed in female TDP-43<sup>K408R</sup> animals. Interestingly, we observed significant changes in <italic>MAPT</italic> splicing in the cortex of TDP-43<sup>K408R</sup> mice, specifically the N2/N0 splice isoform (Fig. S12C).

Through semiquantitative analysis, patient samples collected from various sites were assessed for relative TDP-43 pathology by a neuropathologist in a blinded manner. We confirmed there was a significant increase in TDP-43 pathology in the prefrontal cortex of ALS/FTD patients relative to controls (Fig. S13A). When assessing the interaction between TDP-43 and SUMO2/3, we observed a significant increase in interactions in the prefrontal cortex of ALS/FTD patients with TDP-43 pathology suggesting the TDP-43 SUMOylation pathway is engaged in disease (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>C, Fig. S13B). This may be a result of increased stress burden throughout the prefrontal cortex in those affected by ALS/FTD with TDP-43 pathology compared to age and sex matched counterparts. Taken together, SUMOylation as a stress responsive modification is positively correlated with aging in the human brain, potentially linked to the increase demand imposed by age-associated stress.

Mutations in various genes can lead to TDP-43 pathology, however the majority of ALS and FTD cases occur sporadically without a clear genetic cause [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Additionally, patients living with disease causing mutations do not present with symptoms of disease until later in life suggesting exogenous factors related to aging play a role in phenoconversion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">94</xref>]. Cellular stressors are well characterized to induce TDP-43 pathology providing a clue as to how exogenous factors may contribute to disease pathogenesis. Given the postmitotic nature of neurons, maintaining proteostasis in response to lifelong stressors is critical for neuronal longevity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. This is particularly true for motor neurons which endure constant excitotoxic stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. In this study, we found that SUMOylation maintains TDP-43 proteostasis in the nucleus specifically in response to stress. This modification is critical to preserve neuronal function, the absence of which results in neuronal demise and TDP-43 proteinopathy.</p><p id="Par34">Here, we find that SUMOylation of TDP-43 occurs at K408 by SUMO2/3 in response to stress. This is in contrast to what was previously reported for TDP-43 and SUMO1; where it was suggested that SUMO1 modified TDP-43 at lysine 136 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Indeed, mutating K136 to an arginine (R) had no effect on stress-induced TDP-43 SUMOylation by SUMO2/3, though this does not discount the possibility that SUMO1 may modify TDP-43 under conditions where increased SUMO machinery (e.g. UBC9 overexpression) is present. In our hands, expression of TDP-43<sup>K136R</sup> led to the formation of nuclear TDP-43 puncta as previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. However, these puncta were similar to those observed when expressing RNA binding deficient TDP-43. Furthermore, prediction of TDP-43 structure suggests that K136R mutation may impact the structure of the RNA recognition motif and RNA binding. Thus, phenotypes observed in TDP-43 carrying the K136R mutation should be interpreted with caution.</p><p id="Par35">In genetic forms of ALS or FTD caused by mutations in TDP-43, the C-terminal domain harbors the overwhelming majority of disease-causing mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref>]. Thus, understanding the involvement of the C-terminal domain in TDP-43 biology is critical to uncover pathways that may be linked to disease independent of TDP-43 mutations. Phosphorylation of TDP-43 in the C-terminal domain, particularly S403/404 and S409/410, have garnered much attention in this regard as these residues are characteristically phosphorylated in disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. However, the roles for phosphorylation at these sites remains generally elusive. Few reports have suggested roles in regulating liquid&#x02013;liquid phase separation and solubility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">96</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">97</xref>]. Our findings suggest that phosphorylation and SUMOylation act antagonistically on TDP-43, indicating potential distinct mechanisms of regulation. We further observed that this region of the C-terminal domain targeted by SUMOylation and phosphorylation is highly conserved throughout vertebrate species. Thus, this PTM-enriched region may play key roles for regulating TDP-43 in vertebrate biology.</p><p id="Par36">Regulation of TDP-43 proteostasis is critical for cells as fluctuations in TDP-43 levels can lead to toxicity in cell and animal models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">98</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">101</xref>]. Unsurprisingly, TDP-43 is regulated in a variety of mechanisms including transcriptionally, post-transcriptionally, translationally and post-translationally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">102</xref>]. Furthermore TDP-43 can be cleared through several pathways including the proteasome, endo-lysosome, autophagy, and extracellular vesicle pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">103</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110">110</xref>]. Here we add another mechanism of regulation through SUMOylation during stress and recovery. We hypothesized that blocking TDP-43 SUMOylation with K408R mutation would result in its accumulation during stress recovery. Interestingly, we observed a significant increase in insoluble phosphorylated TDP-43 in TDP-43<sup>K408R/K408R</sup> cortical neurons and a delay in stress granule disassembly during stress recovery indicating TDP-43 accumulation. However, this was resolved 3 h post-stress indicating that the neurons could compensate to clear the aberrantly accumulated TDP-43 within this acute stress paradigm. We questioned whether chronic stress may exacerbate phenotypes and found that chronic stress significantly resulted in increased phosphorylated, insoluble TDP-35 fragments which then recovered upon removal of stress. Thus phosphorylation of TDP-43, in addition to cleavage, may be additional mechanisms to regulate TDP-43 proteostasis in the event of SUMOylation-pathway failure. Thus, SUMOylation may be an early line of defense to regulate TDP-43 in response to stress and blocking TDP-43 SUMOylation shifts proteostasis leading to delayed recovery. Future studies exploring repeated and/or divergent stressors will be crucial in determining the degree to which TDP-43 SUMOylation safeguards from cellular demise.</p><p id="Par37">Previous reports have emphasized the status of altered proteostasis as a hallmark of aging in the CNS, culminating in impaired removal of damaged proteins with age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In TDP-43<sup>K408R/K408R</sup> mice, TDP-43 was found to accumulate in the CNS in an age-dependent manner, suggesting SUMOylation plays important roles during aging. Supporting these findings, in human temporal lobe samples we similarly observed a positive correlation between global SUMOylation and age supporting SUMOylation as a potential protective mechanism during aging in the CNS. Previous studies on global SUMOylation have focused on the dynamic nature of this modification playing roles during development, and associations between SUMOylation and neurodegeneration gaining traction however roles for SUMOylation in the central nervous system during the process of human aging remain understudied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111">111</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112">112</xref>]. This may be ascribed, in part, to challenges in studying SUMOylation due to the dynamic nature of the modification and lack of specific tools to study its interactions. We employed a PLA approach to assess the interaction between TDP-43 and SUMO in ALS/FTD patients and found significantly increased interactions in the prefrontal cortex relative to age/sex matched unaffected controls. It was interesting to observe that PLA signal occurred and was increased in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm in ALS/FTD patient samples. We hypothesize that SUMOylation of TDP-43 is an early event regulating TDP-43 proteostasis, however if overwhelmed other systems such as phosphorylation or protein cleavage may help respond to regulate TDP-43. As we are observing late-stage events, SUMOylation in the cytoplasm may be co-occurrent with late-stage regulation of TDP-43. Approaches that provide increased resolution for detecting TDP-43 SUMOylation events are clearly warranted. Recent studies have used RNA aptamers to reveal nuclear changes in TDP-43 in spinal and cortical neurons of ALS patients prior to traditional cytoplasmic pathology in vulnerable cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Further development of these technologies with respect to TDP-43 SUMOylation may help advance biomarker development that can provide information about TDP-43 stress-response and pathogenesis in ALS/FTD patients.</p><p id="Par38">While the extent of phenotypes observed in TDP-43<sup>K408R</sup> are relatively mild, they similarly reflect the magnitude of phenotypes observed in mice with significant construct validity to ALS/FTD (i.e. TDP-43<sup>Q331K</sup>, TDP-43<sup>M337V</sup>, and TDP-43<sup>K145R</sup> models) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">113</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR114">114</xref>]. These knock in models highlight potential shortcomings of other TDP-43 models relying on overexpression to induce behavioural phenotypes in mice which may not reflect the underlying biology of TDP-43 in ALS/FTD. The emergence of predominantly cognitive FTD-like phenotypes in the TDP-43<sup>K408R</sup> mice is not unusual in TDP-43 knock in models such as TDP-43<sup>Q331K</sup> and TDP-43<sup>K145R</sup> mice which present with features of cognitive dysfunction but lacking the entire constellation of ALS/FTD-like phenotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">113</xref>]. However, we were surprised to observe that the cognitive phenotypes were specific to female mice with no behavioural phenotypes being observed in male mice. This may imply that TDP-43 plays important role regulating sex specific behaviours. Alternatively, female and male mice may experience different forms of life stress that may act upon SUMOylation pathways. For example, we observed differences in social behaviors which may indicate social pathways linked with female behaviour may also be associated with SUMOylation. Alternatively, male mice were frequently separated due to fighting behavior, which could contribute to altered baseline social features, regardless of genotype. Future work exploring sex-specific roles of TDP-43 and/or SUMOylation will help provide mechanistic insight into sex-specific behaviour and experience.</p><p id="Par39">As TDP-43 SUMOylation plays roles in regulating TDP-43 clearance during recovery from stress, blocking TDP-43 SUMOylation in the TDP-43<sup>K408R/K408R</sup> mouse line disrupts this proteostasis and leads to subsequent mislocalization consistent with loss of nuclear function. Additionally, we observe significant increases in insoluble phosphorylated TDP-43 and motor neuron loss in male mice suggesting that gain of function may be occurring, phenocopying disease pathogenesis. While we did observe some motor impairment in 9-month-old mice correlating with TDP-43 mislocalization, we did not observe significant motor impairment in the male mice at 16 months of age, which may be explained by the overall poor performance during motor tests at this age limiting the sensitivity to detect mild changes. Despite this, we did observe molecular and histological evidence supporting early motor impairment with significant neuromuscular junction denervation and reduction in ChAT positive motor neurons in the ventral horn. Additionally, as the male TDP-43<sup>K408R/K408R</sup> mice displayed a significant decrease in survival, behavioral analysis at 16 months of age may have preceded the onset of significant motor phenotypes. Future refined studies using key pathological centered around key pathological markers of cellular dysfunction will help uncover specific points of phenoconversion and phenotransition to identify the chronology of events leading to phenotypes associated with neurodegeneration.</p><p id="Par40">We have demonstrated that TDP-43 SUMOylation occurs in response to cellular stress, thus careful characterization of the TDP-43<sup>K408R</sup> mice is critical to determine baseline phenotypes without the addition of exogenous stressors. We initially hypothesized that aging may be a sufficient stressor to interrogate TDP-43 SUMOylation in mice leading to age-dependent phenotypes. However, the various stressors that individuals with ALS/FTD were previously exposed to during their lifetime (i.e. the &#x0201c;exposome&#x0201d;) are not experienced by mice in vivaria on a short timescale thus mouse aging likely does not faithfully reflect human aging. The TDP-43<sup>K408R</sup> model will therefore help facilitate the exploration of how the exposome synergizes with TDP-43 to better understand how ALS/FTD relevant stressors that humans may experience throughout aging (e.g. <italic>C9ORF72</italic> expansions, viral infections, and traumatic brain injury) converge on TDP-43 and uniquely drive aspects of neurodegeneration.

The apparatus consists of white plastic square arenas measuring 45 cm on each side. The mice were placed in a corner of the arena and allowed to freely explore for 10 min with light levels at 300 lx. The distance travelled, time spent in the corners and center of the field was recorded and analyzed by EthoVision software (Noldus Information Technology).</p></sec><sec id="Sec52"><title>Rotarod</title><p id="Par77">The rotarod (IITC Life Science, Ugo Basile) was used to test the motor performance of mice including coordination and resistance to fatigue. Mice were placed in the stationary rotarod bar for 10 s before the rotarod program was initiated. The bar accelerated from 4 to 40 rpm for 5 min and the latency to fall for each mouse was recorded. The time was stopped when the mouse fell from the bar or rotated passively. Mice were completed four trials per day, with a 10-min intertrial interval in their home cage, for 3 consecutive days.</p></sec><sec id="Sec53"><title>Spontaneous Y-maze</title><p id="Par78">The spontaneous Y-Maze test was used to assess spatial working memory. The Y-shaped maze has three identical arms at 120 &#x000b0;C around a center point triangle. The mice were placed in the center point and allowed to freely explore the arms for 8 min. The movement of the mouse was tracked including the sequence of arm entries by EthoVision (Noldus Information Technology). An alternation is defined as the mouse making consecutive, sequential entries into each of the three arms without revisiting an arm. The alternation index was calculated as (number of alternations/(total number of arm entries minus two)) and reported as a percent.</p></sec><sec id="Sec54"><title>Tail suspension</title><p id="Par79">The automated Tail Suspension apparatus (Med Associates) was used to assess apathetic-like behaviors of the mice. Mice were taped and suspended by the tail to a vertical steel bar which measures strain gauge as the mouse moves during a 6-min trial. The cumulative time spent immobile, hanging passively (below lower threshold) was measured by the Tail Suspension software.</p></sec><sec id="Sec55"><title>Three chamber sociability</title><p id="Par80">The Three Chamber test was conducted to measure the sociability of mice when allowed to interact with a novel mouse or a similarly sized inanimate object. The testing apparatus is a 19&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;45 cm plastic box divided into three equal chambers with clear plastic wall dividers. The two external chambers each have a single weighted metallic mesh pencil holder and the central chamber is empty. The mice are habituated to the apparatus for 5 min by being placed in the central chamber and allowed to freely explore and enter all chambers. The mouse has a 5-min intertrial interval in its home cage. In the test trial, a sex and age matched wild type mouse (social target) is placed beneath one mesh pencil holder, and an inanimate plastic toy (non-social target) is placed beneath the other. To commence the test trial, the mouse is paced in the central chamber. The time spent in each chamber and interacting with the social or non-social target is recorded and analyzed by EthoVision software (Noldus Information Technology).</p></sec><sec id="Sec56"><title>Tube test of social dominance</title><p id="Par81">Tube test was used to assess social dominance and within cage social hierarchy. Cage mates were paired against each other for testing in a round-robin design. The tube test was conducted on a flat tabletop, which the mice were allowed to run around on for 5 min prior to commencing the testing. One foot of vinyl tubing was used. Mice were habituated to the tube prior to testing on the same day by encouraging them to run through the empty tube from either side 5 times. A blinded experimenter placed a mouse on either end of the tube, and released their tales when they completely entered the tube. The first mouse to step its hind paws out of the tube lost the battle. The battle was redone if after 2 min no mouse had won.</p></sec><sec id="Sec57"><title>Collection and preparation of mouse tissue</title><p id="Par82">Mice were harvested for both histology and biochemistry/molecular analyses to reduce total animal numbers. Mice were first acclimated for 2 h prior to dissection to help control for activity-induced changes and all dissections were performed at zeitgeber hours ZT6 to ZT11 to control for potential circadian affects. Mice were randomly dissected by cage to limit batch effects and additional stress. Mice were anesthetized using isoflurane inhalation, blood was collected, and then mice were sacrificed via decapitation and the brains were quickly isolated, weighted, then cut into 2 hemispheres where the left hemisphere was drop fixed in 10% buffered formalin and the right hemisphere was dissected by region and flash frozen on dry ice. Spinal cords were removed using hydraulic extrusion and the lumbar spinal cord was isolated.
