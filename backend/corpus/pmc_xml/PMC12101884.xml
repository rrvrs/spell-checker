This study examines the burden and associations of modifiable traditional, nontraditional, and female sex&#x02013;specific risk factors with young-onset CIS, stratified by clinically relevant patent foramen ovale (PFO), defined by high-risk features of atrial septal aneurysm or large right-to-left shunt.</p></sec><sec><title>METHODS:</title><p>We enrolled consecutive patients aged 18 to 49 years with recent CIS and frequency-matched stroke-free controls of the same age and sex from 19 European sites. Logistic regression assessed the association of risk factor counts (12 traditional, 10 nontraditional, 5 female sex&#x02013;specific) and individual risk factors, stratified by PFO. Analyses were stratified by sex and age (18&#x02013;39 and 40&#x02013;49 years), with computation of population-attributable risk.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS:</title><p>We included 523 patients (median age, 41 years; 47.3% women; 196 [37.5%] with PFO) and 523 controls. In patients with CIS without PFO, each additional traditional (odds ratio, 1.417 [95% CI, 1.282&#x02013;1.568]), nontraditional (odds ratio, 1.702 [95% CI, 1.338&#x02013;2.164]), and female sex&#x02013;specific risk factor (odds ratio, 1.700 [95% CI, 1.107.1&#x02013;2.611]) increased CIS risk. For patients with CIS with PFO, each traditional risk factor increased the risk (odds ratio, 1.185 [1.057&#x02013;1.328]), but only nontraditional risk factors remained significant when fully adjusted (odds ratio, 2.656 [2.036&#x02013;3.464]). Population-attributable risks for CIS without PFO were 64.7%, 26.5%, and 18.9% for traditional, nontraditional, and female sex&#x02013;specific risk factors. For CIS with PFO, population-attributable risks were 33.8%, 49.4%, and 21.8%, respectively. Migraine with aura was the most significant contributor, with population-attributable risks of 45.8% for CIS with PFO and 22.7% for CIS without PFO, showing a stronger impact in women.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS:</title><p>Despite the initial cryptogenic label of these strokes, traditional risk factors significantly contribute to CIS without PFO, while nontraditional factors seem more critical for CIS with PFO.

This hypothesis is supported by concurrently declining rates of myocardial infarction and sudden cardiac death among young adults, which are also strongly associated with traditional risk factors, and the observation that the proportion of cryptogenic ischemic strokes (CIS) has increased.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Prior large case-control studies assessing risk factors for young-onset ischemic stroke have predominantly focused on traditional risk factors, demonstrating strong associations with these factors.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> However, recent research suggests that nontraditional risk factors may have a more profound impact on the increasing incidence of ischemic strokes, especially among younger individuals and women.<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Notably, the multiplicative effect of several risk factors combined&#x02014;for example, a combination of behavioral risk factors including low physical activity, alcohol intake, and smoking&#x02014;may be more significant than individual risk factors, as highlighted in a few studies focusing on young-onset strokes.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup></p><p>Limited data from studies stratifying by stroke pathogenesis or focusing on CIS suggest associations of several individual risk factors&#x02014;such as hypertension, diabetes, current smoking, heavy alcohol consumption, abdominal obesity, low physical activity, and migraine with aura&#x02014;with young-onset CIS.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> However, data on the combined influence of traditional, nontraditional, and female sex&#x02013;specific risk factors in the context of young-onset CIS are lacking. An important consideration when assessing phenotypes and potential causes of young stroke patients is the presence of a patent foramen ovale (PFO). Yet, previous large case-control studies of young-onset strokes have struggled to consistently classify PFO-associated strokes due to the uncertainty in attributing the cause. Consequently, the majority were labeled traditionally as cryptogenic, with a minority as cardioembolic. As a result, the potential interactions with risk factors have not been adequately addressed when stratifying by the presence of a PFO. It is known that young patients with CIS and PFO are less likely to have traditional risk factors and more likely to have nontraditional risk factors, especially migraine.<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Furthermore, recent research demonstrates that specific high-risk features of PFO&#x02014;particularly atrial septal aneurysm or a large-sized shunt&#x02014;should be considered in assessing the causal role of PFO and classification of this phenotypic trait.<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup></p><p>To our knowledge, no studies thus far have assessed the influences of a comprehensive set of risk factors on young-onset CIS, in the context of a clinically relevant PFO, defined as those with high-risk features. In this international case-control study, we evaluated the burden and strength of association of traditional, nontraditional, and female sex&#x02013;specific risk factors in young-onset CIS, stratified by the presence or absence of PFO, as well as by sex and age groups.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>In this case-control study, we included consecutive young patients aged 18 to 49 years with CIS from the SECRETO study (Searching for Explanations for Cryptogenic Stroke in the Young: Revealing the Triggers, Causes, and Outcome) and an equal number of age- and sex-matched stroke-free controls. Participants were enrolled across 19 European centers between November 2013 and January 2022.<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Study sites were instructed to enroll consecutive patients among all acute stroke patients presenting to the hospital during the active recruitment phase. Ethical approval was obtained from local committees, and written informed consent was secured from all participants. This article follows the STROBE (Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology) reporting guideline (<ext-link xlink:href="www.strobe-statement.org" ext-link-type="uri">www.strobe-statement.org</ext-link>). Data supporting the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.</p><p>Patients underwent standardized and timely etiologic examinations and were eligible (labeled as cryptogenic stroke) when they had A-S-C-O (atherosclerosis, small vessel disease, cardiac source, other cause) classification as the absence of disease (grade 0), or any of grade II (causality uncertain) or grade III (unlikely a direct cause) pathology applying the diagnostic testing of the highest level of evidence.<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> All patients with PFO were included throughout the study period as data on the factors increasing the causality of PFO accrued over the years of enrollment and to ensure enrollment of the entire spectrum of patients with CIS with PFO. Etiologic investigations included brain magnetic resonance imaging, imaging of intracranial and extracranial vessels with either computed tomography angiography or magnetic resonance angiography, routine laboratory testing, 12-lead ECG, and continuous ECG for at least 24 hours. Transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography studies were performed according to a standardized protocol.<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> Ancillary etiologic testing in patients was carried out at the discretion of the attending physician.</p><p>PFO was diagnosed with color Doppler imaging showing spontaneous right-to-left shunt or the shift of shunt direction during Valsalva maneuver. PFO confirmation required a bubble study with microbubbles visualized in the left atrium during the first 3 to 5 cardiac cycles in transesophageal echocardiography. Selected sites also used additional transcranial Doppler bubble screens according to consensus guidelines to detect and quantify right-to-left shunt.<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> Transcranial Doppler bubble screen was performed both at rest and with the Valsalva maneuver unless a severe right-to-left shunt was present at rest. A clinically relevant PFO was defined as a PFO with high-risk features including an atrial septal aneurysm or a large-sized shunt (&#x02265;25 microbubbles crossing the atrial septum in transesophageal echocardiography or detected in transcranial Doppler bubble screen).</p><p>Stroke-free control subjects, frequency-matched for sex and age (&#x000b1;5 years), from the same region, was identified locally at each study center. Due to differing legislation across study sites, sources for identifying control subjects were not standardized. They included random searches through population registers where feasible, and community controls including patients&#x02019; unrelated proxies and hospital staff unrelated to the study. None of the control subjects was hospitalized. The absence of a prior stroke was verified using the Questionnaire for Verifying Stroke-Free Status<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> and a review of medical records. All stroke-free controls attended a study visit including interviews, anthropometric measurements, and review of medical records.</p><p>Clinical history was gathered from all patents and controls through medical records and structured interviews. Low level of education was classified as either primary or lower secondary education, or upper secondary education. As traditional risk factors, we considered those documented in the INTERSTROKE study (Global and Regional Effects of Potentially Modifiable Risk Factors Associated With Acute Stroke in 32 Countries)<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> and focused the analysis on modifiable or potentially modifiable risk factors. Hypertension was defined as a prior diagnosis, antihypertensive medication use, or a mean of 2 office blood pressure measures &#x02265;140/90 at the study visit. Diabetes was defined as a prior diagnosis or antidiabetic medication. Hypercholesterolemia was defined as a prior diagnosis of hypercholesterolemia or lipid-lowering medication. Current smoking was defined as smoking at least 1 cigarette per day on average. Cardiovascular disease was defined as a history of coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, peripheral arterial disease, valvular or aortic disease, and obstructive sleep apnea as a prior diagnosis. Abdominal obesity was defined as a waist-to-hip ratio as &#x0003e;0.85 in women and &#x0003e;0.90 in men. An unhealthy diet was defined as a score of &#x0003c;25 on the modified version of the Mediterranean Diet Score.<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> Physical inactivity was assessed using the short version of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire,<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> defined as &#x0003c;1500 metabolic equivalents per week. Alcohol consumption was assessed using an adaptation of the World Health Organization Alcohol, Smoking and Substance Involvement Screening Test.<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> Heavy alcohol consumption was defined as &#x0003e;7 units per week for women and &#x0003e;14 units per week for men, or binge drinking (&#x02265;5 units per instance for women and &#x02265;7 units per instance for men) at least twice a month,<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> according to Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, US Department of Health and Human Services). Psychosocial stress was defined as a combined measure of general stress at home and at work (permanent or several periods of stress versus no or some periods of stress in the past year). Depression was defined as feeling sad, blue, or depressed for 2 or more consecutive weeks during the past year.</p><p>Nontraditional risk factors that have been increasingly recognized as relevant contributors to ischemic stroke, particularly in the younger population,<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> included a history of venous thrombosis, malignancy, and any chronic multisystem disorder, such as autoimmune disease, inflammatory bowel disease, chronic kidney disease, chronic liver disease, or hematologic disease/thrombophilia. Furthermore, we recorded the presence of migraine with aura, assessed with a validated standardized questionnaire,<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> and current use of illicit drugs with the Alcohol, Smoking and Substance Involvement Screening Test questionnaire.<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup></p><p>Available female sex&#x02013;specific risk factors<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> included a history of perinatal conditions including gestational diabetes, gestational hypertension, pregnancy complications (preeclampsia, eclampsia, or hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count syndrome), and current pregnancy or puerperium. Furthermore, current estrogen use through any route of administration was recorded.</p><p>In addition, we defined behavioral risk factors as additional clinically actionable group of risk factors, which included current smoking, abdominal obesity, physical inactivity, unhealthy diet, heavy alcohol use, illicit drug use, psychosocial stress, and in women, estrogen use.</p><sec><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Statistical analyses used IBM SPSS Statistics 29.0 and R (R Core Team 2023). <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05 were considered significant.

Among patients with CIS only, clinical characteristics were compared between those with and without PFO. Based on their distributions, counts of the 12 traditional risk factors were described in categories of none, 1, 2, 3, and &#x02265;4. Count of the 9 nontraditional risk factors was categorized as none, 1, and &#x02265;2, whereas the presence of any female sex&#x02013;specific risk factor was described as a binary variable. Risk factor counts were chosen to quantify the overall burden of risk factors in a simple, interpretable manner, and provide a cumulative estimate of the exposure. Pearson &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup>, Fisher exact, Mann-Whitney <italic toggle="yes">U</italic> test, and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were used for univariable comparisons. To address potential bias produced by nonstandardized methods of identifying controls, we performed a sensitivity analysis comparing control subjects identified from population-based sources versus nonpopulation-based sources.</p><p>In patients with CIS with and without PFO, our primary multivariable analyses consisted of risk factor counts in logistic regression models rather than conditional regression models, as maintaining 1-to-1 matching between cases and controls was not applicable. The linearity assumption for risk factor counts was assessed using logits and confirmed. Models were adjusted for age, sex, and level of education. The first model included the count of traditional risk factors, whereas the second model incorporated counts of both traditional and nontraditional risk factors. For women, a third model was constructed by adding female sex&#x02013;specific risk factors. To evaluate demographic differences in the contribution of these risk factors, separate models were fitted for women, men, and 2 predefined age groups (18&#x02013;39 and 40&#x02013;49 years). In addition, interactions between risk factor counts and both sex and categorical age were tested to assess potential effect modification.</p><p>We secondarily examined associations of individual risk factors using models adjusted for age, sex, level of education, traditional risk factors, and nontraditional risk factors. These models were applied separately to women, men, and the predefined age groups. In women, the model also incorporated female sex&#x02013;specific risk factors.</p><p>We calculated population-attributable risks (PAR) for both risk factor counts and individual risk factors using the Bruzzi method,<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> based on logistic regression, and adjusted for confounding factors. CIs for the PARs were estimated using the jackknife method from the R package attribrisk. PARs were derived for traditional, nontraditional, female sex&#x02013;specific, behavioral, and all combined risk factors.</p><p>Among patients with CIS only, we conducted a logistic regression to identify risk factors associated with the phenotype characterized by a higher overall burden of risk factors, using the absence of PFO as the dependent variable.

Traditional risk factors were strongly associated with CIS without PFO, whereas nontraditional risk factors played a more prominent role among patients with CIS with PFO. Migraine with aura emerged as the most prominent individual risk factor for CIS, among patients with and without PFO, particularly in female patients.</p><p>Only a few case-control studies have assessed the impact of risk factor burden on young-onset ischemic stroke. A German study comparing 2125 young stroke cases (94% ischemic strokes) to 8500 controls showed that traditional cardiovascular risk factors are significant contributors. Low physical activity and hypertension were the most important risk factors for ischemic stroke, accounting for 59.8% and 25.2% of the risk, respectively, with behavioral risk factors combined explaining 71.0% of the risk.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> In our study, behavioral risk factors contributed to the risk of CIS to the same extent as all traditional risk factors combined, but notably, behavioral risk factors combine both individual traditional and nontraditional risk factors. A US study found that stroke risk increased exponentially with the number of concurrent vascular risk factors: odds ratios were 2.1 for 1 risk factor, 2.6 for 2, 7.6 for 3, and 16.5 for 4, with Black patients &#x02248;6&#x000d7; more likely to have all 4 major risk factors compared with White patients.<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Another study demonstrated that atherosclerotic risk factors and atherosclerosis become more impactful with age but were already important at younger ages, affecting 8.5% of ischemic stroke cases in ages 20 to 29 years and rising to 42.5% in ages 40 to 49 years.<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> A recent US study based on administrative claims explored both traditional and nontraditional risk factors, finding that nontraditional factors, such as migraine, play a significant role in strokes among younger adults, especially female survivors. The influence of nontraditional factors declined with age, while traditional factors became more prominent.<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> However, the former studies did not include nontraditional risk factors, and the latter did not have accurate ascertainment of risk factors because it was performed on an administrative data set. This study assessed traditional, nontraditional, and female sex&#x02013;specific risk factors and focused specifically on their association with young-onset CIS. Our study aligns with previous research demonstrating the cumulative impact of risk factor burden on the risk of ischemic stroke, extending this evidence specifically to the main clinical young-onset CIS subtypes, both with and without PFO.</p><p>Among young adult patients with ischemic stroke the prevalence of PFO is known to vary according to the prevalence of traditional risk factors,<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> One study specifically assessing the number of traditional atherosclerosis risk factors in young-onset CIS suggested that the influence of the interatrial right-to-left shunt (primarily PFO) on CIS risk diminishes as the number of traditional risk factors increases, indicating a potential inverse association.<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> However, this and other studies have used varying definitions of PFO, often considering any grade of right-to-left shunt as PFO. This broad definition of PFO does not align with the more clinically relevant concept of PFO defined as having high-risk features which we used in our study. PFO with high-risk features is clinically relevant because of its association with a higher likelihood of causing a stroke, leading to the decision on whether to recommend PFO closure.<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> Nevertheless, our findings reinforce the idea that traditional and nontraditional risk factors play distinct roles in young-onset patients with CIS, depending on the presence of a clinically relevant PFO.</p><p>Earlier data have indicated that young patients with CIS with PFO have a higher prevalence of migraine, further suggesting different stroke mechanisms in those with and without PFO.<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> A recent case-control study by Leppert et al<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> emphasized migraine as the most important nontraditional risk factor for young-onset stroke, with a stronger impact in younger individuals and female survivors, surpassing traditional risk factors, such as hypertension and tobacco smoking. However, this study was limited by the lack of specific clinical criteria to define migraine and could not distinguish between all types of migraine or migraine with aura, the latter of which is more strongly associated with ischemic strokes. Although it remains unclear whether cryptogenic cases are primarily responsible for this association, our findings align with and expand upon these observations, identifying migraine with aura as the leading individual risk factor for young-onset CIS. This risk is significant regardless of the presence of PFO but is particularly pronounced in patients with CIS with PFO, women, and younger patients. The potential mechanisms linking migraine and CIS have been extensively discussed,<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> and our findings, alongside others, strongly advocate for further research to unravel the pathogenesis underlying the increased stroke risk in individuals with migraine. Furthermore, interactions between migraine with aura and other individual risk factors merit further investigation.</p><p>To our knowledge, this study is the first to provide sex- and age-specific estimates on the contribution of a broad range of traditional, nontraditional, and female-specific risk factors to young-onset CIS, stratified by the presence of clinically relevant PFO. Notably, the extent to which these risk factors explain young-onset CIS is comparable to, and even close to the upper range for, young-onset ischemic stroke of any pathogenesis.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> This challenges the historical view that cryptogenic cerebrovascular events have limited explanations. Importantly, some traditional risk factors (eg, psychosocial stress, unhealthy diet, heavy drinking) are often underrepresented in medical records or lack accuracy, requiring extra effort to capture them. Our findings underscore the need to systematically screen not only traditional risk factors with sufficient detail but also nontraditional and female-specific factors, which often receive too little attention. This comprehensive approach is crucial for planning preventive strategies for young individuals, even those who appear to have low stroke risk. In addition, identifying clinically relevant PFO can help target interventions, such as more aggressive management of traditional risk factors in young patients with CIS without PFO. Nevertheless, it should be noted that some of the individual risk factor associations observed in our study were only weak or moderate, and not all risk factors, such as migraine with aura, are convincingly modifiable.</p><p>Our study has several strengths, including its large, well-defined cohort of young adults with CIS enrolled in a multicenter study, inclusion of consecutive patients irrespective of PFO status, and comprehensive assessment of traditional and nontraditional risk factors, including those specific to women. Stratification by clinically relevant PFO provides valuable insights into the differential impact of risk factors in young-onset CIS. In addition, the inclusion of behavioral risk factors, often underreported in prior research, adds depth to the analysis. However, the study also has limitations. The cross-sectional design precludes causal inferences, and reliance on self-reported data for behavioral risk factors may introduce recall bias. Although we stratified by PFO status, the absence of further anatomic high-risk PFO features and related clinical factors may limit classification accuracy. Stroke-free controls were not stratified by PFO status and while their lack of knowledge about PFO status at the time of assessment minimized bias, certain risk factors&#x02014;such as migraine with aura&#x02014;are associated with PFO. Given that stroke-free controls likely have fewer high-risk PFOs, some associations between CIS and risk factors may partially reflect PFO itself rather than stroke risk alone. Selection bias cannot be excluded due to variability in control recruitment methods, although risk factor frequencies in controls closely mirror those in the general population. Sensitivity analysis revealed minor differences in risk factor prevalence between population-based and nonpopulation-based controls, but these were unlikely to affect conclusions. Multiple univariable comparisons were used to descriptively characterize baseline differences, without corrections for multiple comparisons, as they were not the basis of our conclusions. Primary findings rely on multivariable analyses, which adjust for confounding factors and provide robust estimates. Lack of power limited the detection of associations for rare risk factors and smaller subgroups. We underestimated the prevalence of certain conditions, such as hyperlipidemia, diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea, and prothrombotic disorders, as their definitions relied only on history. Finally, although the study&#x02019;s focus on young adults is a strength, the findings may not be generalizable to older populations or those with different racial, ethnic, or geographic backgrounds. Notably, 95% of our participants were White Europeans, and although this reflects the demographic composition of the study sites, it limits the applicability of our results to more diverse populations. Stroke risk factors may vary across racial and ethnic groups due to genetic, environmental, and socioeconomic factors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our study highlights the multifaceted nature of young-onset CIS, revealing that both traditional and nontraditional risk factors significantly influence its development, with variations based on clinically relevant PFO status.
