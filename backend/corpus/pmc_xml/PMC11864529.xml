According to Rajan et al. [<xref rid="pone.0318065.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], 60% to 80% of deaths from cardiorespiratory arrest occur in out-of-hospital settings. Mortality in these sudden events is influenced by several factors, such as underlying clinical causes, the response time of pre-hospital care services, the quality of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), the presence of CPR-trained lay rescuers, and the availability of automated external defibrillators (AEDs) [<xref rid="pone.0318065.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. OHCA reversal requires prompt care by healthcare professionals and/or laypersons. AEDs are essential for increasing the chances of survival of OHCA victims. In this context, &#x02019;success rate&#x02019; refers specifically to the proportion of patients who survive to hospital discharge with favorable neurological outcomes, a critical indicator of the effectiveness of interventions in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Early defibrillation plays a pivotal role in achieving these outcomes; when performed within 3 to 5 minutes of cardiac arrest, survival rates can reach 50% to 70% [<xref rid="pone.0318065.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. This underscores the importance of timely access to automated external defibrillators (AEDs) in improving patient survival.</p><p>Despite the growth of AED programs (e.g. in Japan, Sweden and the USA), many limitations to early defibrillation in cardiac arrest persist. A public AED is used in only a small percentage of OHCAs. Barriers to AED use include inaccessibility, lack of awareness, and negative perceptions [<xref rid="pone.0318065.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. AED accessibility is often limited, either by a scarcity of devices or a lack of knowledge among the population about their location and use [<xref rid="pone.0318065.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. For instance, many establishments that have AEDs are not open 24 h a day, which makes these devices inaccessible during the night and on weekends. As OHCA can occur at any time, restricting access to AED devices to regular opening hours impacts their use by the population [<xref rid="pone.0318065.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>In Europe, public access defibrillation (PAD) programs have played a critical role in reducing mortality from out-of-hospital cardiac arrests (OHCA). These initiatives, supported by organizations like the European Resuscitation Council and the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR), have focused on strategic AED placements in high-traffic areas such as airports, stadiums, and public transport hubs. Alongside these efforts, extensive public education campaigns have aimed to increase awareness and confidence in using AEDs. Studies show that these measures have improved survival rates, though challenges such as underutilization and access inequalities persist. These programs illustrate the importance of leveraging both technology and public engagement to address life-threatening emergencies effectively [<xref rid="pone.0318065.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Poland exemplifies significant efforts to address out-of-hospital cardiac arrests (OHCA) through public access defibrillation (PAD) initiatives. While metropolitan areas like Warsaw and Krak&#x000f3;w have advanced in deploying automated external defibrillators (AEDs) and raising public awareness, rural regions still face critical gaps in access and education. Innovative programs such as &#x02019;Impulse of Life&#x02019; highlight the country&#x02019;s commitment to expanding AED availability and integrating community-driven strategies. Despite systemic challenges, Poland&#x02019;s progress demonstrates how localized approaches can adapt broader European PAD strategies to diverse sociodemographic needs [<xref rid="pone.0318065.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0318065.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>In Brazil, another relevant limitation is the lack of physical maps or geolocation applications for locating AEDs in public places. Moreover, the few available AEDs are usually located in private spaces. Most of these devices were purchased from online distributors, either wholesale or individually for private use. AED registration is the owner&#x02019;s responsibility, and the registration process varies by region. Therefore, the lack of centralized registration data represents a barrier to the mapping and surveillance of these devices, impacting accessibility [<xref rid="pone.0318065.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Additionally, the locations where AEDs are installed typically do not correspond to the areas where cardiac arrests are most frequent [<xref rid="pone.0318065.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. This lack of alignment between AED locations and high-risk areas contributes to the underutilization of the devices, which, combined with the lack of lay training and concerns about legal responsibilities, hinders an effective and rapid response in emergency cases [<xref rid="pone.0318065.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>International studies have used georeferencing data as an additional tool to improve OHCA care [<xref rid="pone.0318065.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0318065.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Likewise, there is a growing availability of health-related mobile applications that can empower individuals to respond to OHCA events. To the best of our knowledge, no comprehensive studies have been conducted in Brazil on the design, development, and validation of a mobile application that uses geospatial resources for the location of AED devices.

Empirical observations are confronted with the available literature to gain a better understanding of the problem and formulate hypotheses to define the target product [<xref rid="pone.0318065.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The assumption of this study was the following: laypeople do not know where to search for an AED when faced with a victim of cardiac arrest on a public road. This assumption combined the project scope and kick-off point, serving as a starting point for app development. However, it was first necessary to understand the provision of OHCA care in Brazil.</p><p>In an OHCA situation, the victim is typically found falling on the ground or unresponsive on a public road or at home. The person who identified the situation (lay responder) makes attempts at verbal and tactile stimulation. Upon not getting any response, the responder should immediately call the mobile emergency care service, which in Brazil is known as SAMU [<xref rid="pone.0318065.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] (<xref rid="pone.0318065.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="pone.0318065.g001"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0318065.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Flowchart describing the steps in providing care for victims of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.</title><p>AED, automated external defibrillator; CPR, cardiopulmonary resuscitation.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0318065.g001" position="float"/></fig><p>At the SAMU call center, calls are answered by an emergency call technician, who collects information on the victim&#x02019;s location, condition, and, whenever possible, medical data. The collection of basic information should be concluded in the shortest time possible. Emergency call technicians are trained with service protocols to identify phrases indicative of a potentially severe semiology syndrome, such as OHCA. Examples include: "I found him/her passed out," "he/she is purple," "he/she is not breathing," and "he/she is not moving" [<xref rid="pone.0318065.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>After this initial screening, the emergency call technician forwards the call to the regulatory physician, who performs a detailed assessment of the situation using specific questions directed to the caller. In OHCA cases, questions aim to assess the level of consciousness, respiratory status, and circulation (vital signs). The procedures are tailored to the specific emergency. For example, in the case of cardiac arrest, the regulatory physician prioritizes rapid identification of the event, often based on key indicators such as the absence of a pulse and unresponsiveness. After categorizing the situation as cardiac arrest, the regulatory physician initiates the dispatch of the nearest available resources, preferably an advanced life support ambulance, while guiding the caller to begin basic life support measures, such as chest compressions and the use of an automated external defibrillator (AED), if accessible. The regulatory physician should remain on the line to provide ongoing instructions until the emergency team arrives at the scene [<xref rid="pone.0318065.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Meanwhile, the physician instructs the caller to start CPR.</p><p>The ideal in such events would be for another individual (bystander) to be present at the scene, know the location of a nearby AED device (roundtrip travel time &#x0003c; 5 min), and be able to use the device. Once the AED is attached to the victim, it identifies whether the heart rhythm is shockable and, if so, delivers the electric shock while SAMU does not arrive. Having prior knowledge about the location of AEDs saves valuable time, allowing defibrillation to be initiated as soon as possible, which is crucial to increase the victim&#x02019;s chances of survival [<xref rid="pone.0318065.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, most of the population does not know where public-access AEDs are located. It should be noted that there is a consensus in the literature that cardiac arrest, regardless of whether it occurs inside or outside the hospital, is a time-dependent event. In other words, rapid high-quality care is essential to improve the outcome [<xref rid="pone.0318065.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Thus, it is essential to know not only the location of AEDs distributed throughout the city but also the fastest route to the nearest equipment.</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Define: Guiding users to the nearest AED</title><p>In the definition step, the feasibility of the proposed solution is analyzed in light of available resources. Here, the solution to facilitate the location of AEDs by the population was to design a geolocation app. This app would allow users to quickly find the nearest AED, optimizing response time in emergency situations and potentially saving lives.</p><p>Several studies endorse the main difficulties reported by prehospital care providers in providing timely treatment for OHCA cases. These difficulties include a lack of widespread knowledge among the general population about the location of public-access AEDs [<xref rid="pone.0318065.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0318065.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and the recommended procedures for CPR provision by laypeople [<xref rid="pone.0318065.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0318065.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Adding to this situation, the arrival time of the prehospital care team at the scene is often longer than the recommended for providing initial care in OHCA cases [<xref rid="pone.0318065.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>There are several mobile applications that provide interactive maps showing AED locations in the United States and European and Asian countries [<xref rid="pone.0318065.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0318065.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Some examples are described in <xref rid="pone.0318065.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref>. These applications were assessed for functionality and potential weaknesses. Each application was downloaded and examined manually and individually to identify the most relevant points of each technological solution.</p><p>Analysis of the above-mentioned applications revealed several limitations that could compromise their effectiveness and usefulness. Most applications do not offer a feature that calculates and suggests the shortest route for different means of transport, such as car, bicycle, or walking. This limitation precludes users from receiving optimized guidance for their specific mode of transportation, potentially increasing travel time and decreasing the victim&#x02019;s chances of survival. Additionally, it was noted that the applications lacked a screen for users to send suggestions and feedback directly to developers. A feedback screen would allow users to easily share their ideas and help improve the app. Another point worthy of mention was the lack of a feature that provides quick and practical access to an updated registry of hospitals and emergency care units (UPAs), including the distance and travel time to these locations. The absence of this information could lead to delays in receiving medical care in emergency situations.</p><p>As part of the definition step, an active search for AEDs was carried out in public establishments with high foot traffic. This procedure was necessary because of the lack of available information from municipal health agencies regarding the locations of AED devices. The search found 5 AEDs in the city, which were placed on the App. Based on the collected information and the gaps identified in existing applications, an innovative application was designed to offer a comprehensive and efficient solution to the problem at hand. Key features of the app include:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Global positioning system (GPS) location of AEDs.

These services offer a graphical and communication application programming interface (API) that enables the use of various GPS features. A well-known example is Google Maps. Google Maps can be used to obtain a map interface, interact with it, edit it by adding coordinates and reference points, and save locations on the map. The communication API [<xref rid="pone.0318065.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], on the other hand, offers features such as route calculation and determination of the shortest path to a specified location, which are among the key functionalities of the proposed application.</p><p>The requirements survey was based on the general requirements of the project, user interface and interaction analysis, and adaptation of related works with similar objectives.

Travel times to strategically installed AEDs were compared with ambulance travel times in emergency situations. The city center was selected for the simulation due to its high population density and presence of a nearby ambulance station. A total of 50 points were randomly plotted in the center region using the generated random points in the extension algorithm of QGIS software version 3,28, with each point representing potential OHCA occurrences. Two simulations were performed for each point. The first estimated the response time from the ambulance station, and the second modeled the AED position and the travel time to and from the AED device.</p><p>In the first step, the probability of an ambulance responding to simulated occurrences within 5 min was determined by creating a distance matrix using Valhalla plugin version 2.4.2, available as an extension to QGIS software.

Most participants (80%) reported having experience using apps.</p><p>Most of the items of the CSUQ instrument received neutral or positive results (Q1, Q4, Q5, Q6, Q9, Q10, Q11, Q12, Q13, and Q14) (<xref rid="pone.0318065.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref>). However, Q2 (it is simple to use the app), Q3 (I can easily remember how to use the app), Q7 (I can easily and quickly recover from mistakes when using the app), Q8 (it would be easy to become skilled at using the app), Q11 (the app meets my needs), Q15 (the app does everything I would expect it to do), and Q16 (the app works the way I want it to) received some negative answers. More specifically, 1% of respondents strongly disagreed with Q2; 1% disagreed with Q3, Q11, and Q16; 2% disagreed or strongly disagreed with Q7; 10% somewhat disagreed, disagreed, or strongly disagreed with Q8; and 4% disagreed with Q15. The results indicate that the app was well-rated in terms of ease of use and functionality, but some specific areas require improvement, related to the simplicity of use, memorization, error recovery, and ease of becoming skilled in using the application.</p><fig position="float" id="pone.0318065.g006"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0318065.g006</object-id><label>Fig 6</label><caption><title>Distribution of responses to the Computer System Usability Questionnaire rated on a Likert scale.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0318065.g006" position="float"/></fig><p>Result reliability was assessed by using the global Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha, which was found to be 0.92.

In view of the need to act quickly in such cases, this study developed a mobile application to assist lay people in locating the nearest AED or emergency medical service, optimizing response times and increasing the chances of survival. To the best of our knowledge, there are no studies that address the design, development, and validation of an app using geospatial resources to locate AEDs in Brazil.</p><p>The main feature of the Local DEA app is the geolocation of AEDs in a medium-sized municipality, calculating the time and shortest route to the device. The app could positively impact the outcome of OHCA victims by offering the quickest and most convenient way to locate AEDs. AED accessibility and knowledge of their location are real difficulties in the care of OHCA [<xref rid="pone.0318065.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The app also has important secondary features, such as an illustrated guide on how to provide initial care for a patient experiencing OHCA. Such information is particularly important for people without experience in this situation. The app provides a frequently asked questions section on AED use, which may assist bystanders during an OHCA event. These resources are fundamental, given that many people fear that the device may pose risks to the operator, find it to have a complex application technique, and have little or no knowledge of its correct use [<xref rid="pone.0318065.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Furthermore, the app provides specific information about AED location, such as the address and telephone number of the establishment, facilitating contact and clarification about the device&#x02019;s availability. The AEDs are retrieved from a server using Firebase. It&#x02019;s cloud-based, and every time the app is opened, it fetches the latest data from the server. Users will not need to reinstall the app, as the data is fetched online from the server. Whenever an AED is added, users are automatically updated.</p><p>In the present study, CSUQ was used to evaluate the usability of the app by specialists. Most answers were positive, evidencing the app&#x02019;s ease of use and suggesting that it is intuitive and effective for real situations. Furthermore, the instrument had excellent internal consistency, as shown by the global Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha value (0.92). This result indicates a strong agreement between participants&#x02019; responses, reinforcing the reliability of the data and the robustness of CSUQ in assessing the usability of the app.</p><p>Following validation by experts, a test simulation was conducted, revealing the importance and effectiveness of the app. In the simulation, 47 of the 50 OHCA events were covered by AEDs within 5 min (for this simulation, it was assumed that lay first responders traveled at a running speed of 10 km/h), showing excellent coverage. In the same time interval, the ambulance station attended only 23 OHCA cases. This result confirms that, given the strategic allocation of AEDs, the travel time of lay first responders is shorter than the travel time of ambulances. Similar results were described by Hatakeyama et al. [<xref rid="pone.0318065.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], who developed an app called "AED-SOS." Use of the app significantly reduced the time for recognizing a cardiac arrest to delivering an AED from 202.2 s to 133.6 s, which may contribute to increasing the chances of survival after OHCA [<xref rid="pone.0318065.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Berglund et al. [<xref rid="pone.0318065.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] investigated the impact of sending volunteer first responders via a smartphone app to fetch AEDs from nearby locations in cases of OHCA. The study showed that although the use of AEDs by volunteer first responders did not increase significantly compared with the control, the use of an app to dispatch volunteers had a positive impact on how quickly AEDs were found and used [<xref rid="pone.0318065.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].</p><p>The findings of Sakai et al. [<xref rid="pone.0318065.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] corroborate the relevance of technology in route calculation. The authors developed a mobile web system called "Mobile AED Map," which displays the location of available AEDs. In a controlled simulation, the study compared travel time and distance to retrieve an AED with and without the use of the mobile map. The results indicated that, although the time to recover AEDs was not significantly different, the traveled distance was significantly shorter with the use of the mobile map, suggesting that technological improvements may increase the app&#x02019;s usefulness in emergency settings [<xref rid="pone.0318065.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. According to Smith et al. [<xref rid="pone.0318065.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], such differences may be attributed to the way routes are calculated. When real obstacles of urban areas are taken into account, it is possible to achieve gains in travel time compared with routes drawn exclusively as straight lines over the geographical space.</p><p>McLay and Mayorga [<xref rid="pone.0318065.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] argued that maximizing response times to 7 and 8 min may maximize patient survival rates. The authors used data from Hanover County, Virginia, to illustrate that response times within these limits are strongly associated with better survival outcomes, especially in rural regions where response times of 9- and 10-min result in more equitable outcomes for patients [<xref rid="pone.0318065.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. In densely populated urban areas, a response time of 8 min is often not associated with a significant improvement in the rates of survival to hospital discharge, suggesting that, for some medical emergencies, quality of response may be more crucial than speed [<xref rid="pone.0318065.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].</p><p>In the simulation conducted here, there was a significant difference in median travel times between AED retrieval and ambulance response. The travel time was 223 s for AED retrieval and 309 s for ambulances. Thus, use of well-allocated AEDs in an OHCA scenario may provide better coverage and shorter travel time, potentially improving the clinical outcomes of patients. The simulation is very important, given that a delay in CPR onset in cases of OHCA may directly impact the survival and neurological prognosis of patients.</p><p>Studies have shown that the chances of survival after a cardiorespiratory arrest decrease by about 7% to 10% for every minute of delay in initiating CPR [<xref rid="pone.0318065.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Huang et al. [<xref rid="pone.0318065.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] showed that the optimal ambulance response time to maximize the chances of survival after OHCA is 6.2 min. This period can be extended to up to 7.2 min in public places or when CPR is performed by a bystander, showing the positive influence of rapid interventions [<xref rid="pone.0318065.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. In areas where AEDs are well distributed and accessible, such as in certain regions of Japan [<xref rid="pone.0318065.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], defibrillation carried out by laypeople before the arrival of emergency services can significantly improve OHCA outcomes. Kobayashi et al. demonstrated that the effectiveness of public defibrillation depends substantially on the specific characteristics of each location, such as population density and AED accessibility [<xref rid="pone.0318065.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].</p><p>Despite the available features, the Local DEA app has some limitations. For example, it requires internet connection to function properly, without which, it becomes unfeasible to calculate routes or locate AEDs. In cases of no internet connection, the app is limited to providing the CPR guide. Furthermore, the connection speed can affect the app&#x02019;s performance in calculating routes. However, no other factors were identified that could impair the use of Local DEA. The app did not exhibit performance failures and was considered easy to use by experts. In this study, ambulance travel times were calculated based on the assumption that all ambulances depart from a central station. While this approach provides a standardized model for comparison, it does not account for the dynamic nature of real-world ambulance deployment, where vehicles may be distributed across the city and respond to calls from various locations. This limitation highlights the need for future simulations to incorporate real-time GPS data or typical dispatch patterns to provide more accurate predictions of response times. Additionally, the assumed ambulance travel speed was based on an average of 50 km/h; this speed represents typical urban conditions but does not explicitly account for variations such as peak traffic hours or road closures, which could impact actual response times.</p><p>Future work will focus on testing the App with lay users to evaluate its usability, accessibility, and effectiveness in real-life scenarios, ensuring it meets the needs of its primary target audience. Further development will include integrating real-time AED registry data and geolocation services to improve functionality, as well as collaborating with municipalities and emergency services to optimize deployment and tailor features to regional needs. Public engagement and education initiatives will be prioritized to build confidence in using the App during emergencies, and longitudinal studies will assess its long-term impact on survival rates in out-of-hospital cardiac arrests, contributing to global efforts to improve outcomes through innovative public health tools.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec021"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The Local DEA app is an innovative and promising tool to reduce mortality from OHCA. Combining geolocation, AED instructions, and initial care guidelines, the app empowers laypeople to act in critical situations, decreasing response time and increasing the chances of patient survival. Combined with the strategic allocation of AEDs, the app can have significant impacts on public health, contributing to the reduction of the number of deaths due to OHCA.</p></sec><sec id="sec022" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material id="pone.0318065.s001" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>Examples of mobile apps that provide interactive maps showing AED locations in the United States and European and Asian countries.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0318065.s001.docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pone.0318065.s002" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S2 File</label><caption><title>Copy of CSUQ.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0318065.s002.docx"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank the Group of Technologies in Health and Geoprocessing (GETS) for the support in the analyses.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0318065.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Rajan</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Wissenberg</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Folke</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Hansen</surname><given-names>SM</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Gerds</surname><given-names>TA</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Kragholm</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name>, <etal>et al</etal>. <article-title>Association of Bystander Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Survival According to Ambulance Response Times After Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest</article-title>. <source>Circulation</source>. <year>2016</year>
