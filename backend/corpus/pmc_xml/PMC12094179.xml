However, these programs face significant challenges due to inadequate suitability of vaccine product attributes for LMIC contexts, which can reduce their ability to meet coverage targets and achieve public health impact [<xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. For instance, current vaccine presentations require cold chain storage and transport, but access to cold chain equipment and/or grid electricity to run the equipment can be limited in some areas. In addition, the number of injections being administered during a single vaccination visit is increasing, adding logistical complexity and reducing patient/caregiver acceptability. Moreover, vaccines are often stored in multidose containers, which leads to increased wastage or missed opportunities for vaccination when health workers are hesitant to open these containers for only the few individuals attending the vaccination session. The complexity of vaccine preparation and administration also varies by vaccine with some vaccines involving more complex steps, which can result in safety issues and increase the time it takes to administer vaccines.</p><p id="p0050">In spite of efforts to strengthen country immunization programs and increase vaccine coverage globally, the proportion of children who receive three doses of a diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis&#x02013;containing vaccine before their first birthday, a common metric for assessing immunization program strength, has stagnated at 84&#x000a0;% over the last decade, with declines in coverage after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic (range: 81&#x02013;86&#x000a0;%) [<xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In 2023, approximately 21 million children were un- or under-vaccinated, including 14.5 million zero-dose children (those who had not received any vaccines) [<xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Based on these trends, there is increasing recognition of the need for improved vaccine presentations, designed to meet the needs of LMIC immunization programs, and targeted solutions to expand vaccine access, reach remote and hard-to-reach populations, reduce missed opportunities for vaccination, and increase equitable vaccine coverage [<xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The COVID-19 pandemic has further highlighted the need for vaccine product innovations that improve ease of use; enable rapid, large-scale administration of vaccines during outbreak and/or pandemic response; and increase access to underserved populations, including hard-to-reach communities especially in conflict, vulnerable, or fragile settings.</p><p id="p0055">Vaccine product innovations could help address some of the shortcomings of current vaccine presentations and ease delivery and/or administration to overcome vaccine coverage and equity shortfalls [<xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. For instance, microarray patches (MAPs)&#x02014;also referred to as microneedle patches or patches&#x02014;consist of microscopic projections that deliver dry vaccine or drug when applied to the skin [<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>]. Compared to existing vaccine presentations, wherein the vaccine is stored in a multidose glass vial and administered with an autodisable needle and syringe, MAPs for vaccine applications offer several potential benefits, including increased thermostability, improved ease of use, reduced open-vial wastage, and improved safety (e.g., reduced administration errors, contamination, needle-stick injuries) [<xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. By addressing barriers related to the product attributes of current injectable vaccines, MAPs could increase reach among un- and under-immunized populations and improve acceptability [<xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>]. Based on these potential programmatic benefits, MAPs have been prioritized by the Vaccine Innovation Prioritisation Strategy (VIPS) Alliance&#x02014;composed of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance (Gavi); the World Health Organization (WHO); the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF); the Gates Foundation; and PATH&#x02014;as a transformative vaccine product innovation with the potential to increase vaccine coverage and equity in LMICs [<xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p id="p0060">In 2021, the VIPS Alliance published a five-year action plan for vaccine MAPs (2021&#x02013;2025) that describes key activities needed to accelerate the development and future uptake of vaccine MAPs for LMIC use [<xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Considering the significant financial investment that development of vaccine MAPs will require, activity 1 of the action plan is to &#x0201c;identify priority vaccines to be used with MAPs for LMICs.&#x0201d; This goal came as a response to industry consultations highlighting the need for clearer guidance to inform the business case for vaccine MAP investments, particularly for LMIC contexts. To address this gap, the VIPS Alliance conducted a prioritization process to identify high-priority vaccines for which there is likely a strong public health need for a MAP presentation in LMICs to help technology developers, vaccine manufacturers, and donors better respond to country needs.</p></sec><sec id="s0010"><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><p id="p0065">The prioritization process was conducted in 2021&#x02013;2023.

We first selected vaccines that are administered by intramuscular, intradermal, or subcutaneous injection, as vaccines administered orally, intranasally, or intravenously were assumed to be less suitable for MAP administration. Oral/intranasal formulations are also already needle-free and therefore would benefit less from a MAP presentation. We also filtered for vaccines that have or are expected to have an LMIC market, regardless of whether they have a market in HICs, as our focus was on vaccine MAPs that could be of value to LMIC markets. After that, we selected vaccines in which there is interest in the vaccine or disease area from a global/regional health organization (e.g., vaccines regarded as a priority by the WHO Product Development Vaccine Advisory Committee [PDVAC] for non-epidemic pathogens or WHO R&#x00026;D Blueprint for outbreak pathogens). Moreover, we selected vaccine targets that address an already established global health need (e.g., to combat antimicrobial resistance [<xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]) as a proxy for general global health relevance of the vaccine target. Next, we selected licensed vaccines or candidates in phase 3 clinical development to increase the likelihood of MAP technical and regulatory success compared to using an earlier-stage antigen for which safety/immunogenicity data have not yet been generated with another route of administration (e.g., intramuscular, intradermal, or subcutaneous). For outbreak pathogens, we included candidates in phase 2 if they were considered a high priority according to the WHO R&#x00026;D Blueprint [<xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] or CEPI [<xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Finally, we selected vaccines that are often administered outside of routine, fixed-post settings for infants since MAPs have the greatest potential for programmatic benefit when administered to other target populations (e.g., birth-dose, adolescents, adults, pregnancy) and outside facilities (e.g., outreach, campaigns, community settings). This filtering process resulted in an interim list of vaccine targets for MAP delivery that were evaluated in a second phase of the prioritization process.<table-wrap position="float" id="t0010"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Selection criteria for evaluation of the reference list (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;91) of potential vaccines for use with microarray patches and down-selection to the interim list (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;21).</p></caption><alt-text id="al0025">Table 2</alt-text><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Category of attributes</th><th>Selection criteria</th><th>Rationale</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Vaccine target information</td><td>Selected vaccines that are administered by IM, ID, or SC injection.</td><td>Vaccines that are delivered orally, intranasally, or intravenously are not likely to be suitable for MAP administration compared to vaccines currently administered by IM, ID, or SC injection. Current vaccines administered via the oral and intranasal routes are typically live attenuated organisms that deliver vaccine directly to the mucosal surfaces that are the site of transmission (e.g., respiratory tract, intestine). The vaccine antigen then replicates in the mucosal epithelium to induce local mucosal immunity. Although live attenuated vaccines can also be administered via the IM, ID, or SC route, these routes typically induce only a systemic immune response instead of both systemic and mucosal immunity. Vaccines administered intranasally or orally would likely also benefit less from a MAP presentation since these formulations are already needle-free. Intravenous administration of vaccines is rare and typically only considered if other routes are not technically feasible, which could further reduce the probability of technical success when reformulating an intravenous vaccine into a MAP presentation.</td></tr><tr><td>Market distribution</td><td>Selected LMIC market.</td><td>Captures vaccines that have or are expected to have a market in LMICs, whether or not they have a market in high-income countries.</td></tr><tr><td>Global/regional health organizations with known interest in vaccine or disease</td><td>Selected vaccines for which there is interest or funding from any of the stakeholders listed.</td><td>Existing stakeholder interest in the vaccine or pathogen indicates knowledge of the target and that there is need for a vaccine, and therefore potentially a need for a vaccine MAP, provided other criteria are met.<break/><break/>Existing stakeholder interest might also increase likelihood of funding and support for vaccine MAP development.</td></tr><tr><td>Specific global health priority</td><td>Selected vaccines that meet any of the criteria.</td><td>There is already an identified specific global health need for these vaccines.</td></tr><tr><td>Status of vaccine development</td><td>Selected vaccines that are in phase 3 or later (including licensed vaccines).<break/><break/><italic>Phase 2 or later for outbreak pathogens.</italic></td><td>This selects for vaccines that are either WHO prequalified, licensed, or have successfully completed phase 2 trials. They should therefore have demonstrated some level of efficacy or proof of concept in the clinic. This reduces some of the risks associated with developing a vaccine MAP.<break/><break/>Vaccines with outbreak potential were not excluded if they were in phase 2, since these pathogens are considered high priority in the WHO R&#x00026;D Blueprint or by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, with a mandate on outbreak diseases.</td></tr><tr><td>Populations and settings for potential use of vaccine MAPs</td><td>Selected vaccines that meet any of the subheading criteria, except routine immunization for children.</td><td>MAPs could be used in any vaccination setting or population. The potential benefits of MAPs are likely to be greater in settings other than routine immunization of infants in fixed-post settings (i.e., special strategies).

Using the information collected on each vaccine target and from the previously conducted VIPS country consultations [<xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], team members with knowledge of these issues assessed the considerations described above and qualitatively ranked them from &#x0201c;low&#x0201d; to &#x0201c;high&#x0201d; for each remaining vaccine target (Supplemental Tables 3&#x02013;5). The initial rankings were assigned collaboratively by two individuals and then finalized based on group consensus after review and discussion with the broader VIPS team.

This suggests alignment between the ongoing work in the MAP field and the VIPS Alliance's process for selecting potential MAP targets. These lists also represent a range of different vaccine types and platforms, highlighting that MAPs have the potential to be broadly applicable to a variety of vaccines. Inclusion of several vaccines against pathogens that have epidemic and/or pandemic potential, including SARS-CoV-2 and influenza, reinforces the role that MAPs could have in outbreak response. By acting on these priorities, stakeholders can ensure that MAP research and development investments better respond to global health needs. Integrating MAPs into broader health systems strengthening initiatives could also further improve health outcomes by addressing systemic issues in addition to vaccine-specific challenges.</p><p id="p0190">Since the prioritization process described herein focuses on MAPs for LMIC contexts, other stakeholders may weigh the parameters differently and/or use different selection criteria. For instance, MAP developers may put more weight on the potential global market size or probability of technical and regulatory success to de-risk their product development efforts, and place less emphasis on the potential programmatic impact of a MAP application. Considering the status of vaccine development, we selected vaccines that were in phase 3 clinical development and beyond, except for outbreak pathogens, which reduces the risk of product failure when formulating a vaccine in a MAP presentation and ensures that efficacy and safety data have already been generated for the vaccine in its current presentation (e.g., liquid injectable). However, MAP developers may prefer to work with vaccines in preclinical or early-stage clinical development, which may be easier to access, offer more favorable commercial terms, and provide more options with regard to vaccine candidates and vaccine manufacturers compared to vaccines in late-stage clinical development. Since selection criteria are stakeholder- and context-specific, vaccine targets that are not on the final priority list should not be regarded as being de-prioritized or as nonviable candidates for MAP delivery. Although stakeholders may prioritize vaccine MAPs differently, our approach provides valuable insights into how to assess trade-offs relevant to the value proposition of vaccine MAPs. Moreover, our approach emphasizes the potential MAP use cases including alternative delivery scenarios since MAPs are expected to offer significant programmatic benefit when used outside of facility-based infant immunization visits.</p><p id="p0195">Prioritization of vaccines for use with MAPs involves evaluating and balancing many different parameters.

However, as some data are not available for all vaccine targets, we used proxy measures to account for missing data. For instance, we used whether a vaccine is needed to combat antimicrobial resistance, if an elimination agenda has been set, and epidemic/pandemic potential as proxies for disease burden. In addition, many of the selection criteria are binary, which does not fully capture the possible values of each parameter. Moreover, the same level of detail was not available for all vaccines for each parameter. In the second stage of the prioritization process, we incorporated qualitative data based on stakeholder feedback to generate the final priority list. Although this enabled us to obtain critical insights into the nuances of prioritizing vaccine applications for MAPs, expert opinions are inherently subjective. To address this limitation, we selected diverse, independent experts and validated our findings through a public consultation process, which increased the breadth of feedback captured. By combining both quantitative and qualitative data inputs into our prioritization process, we were able to gain a more comprehensive understanding of high-priority vaccine applications for MAPs while mitigating the limitations of both methodological approaches. Furthermore, our results represent a snapshot in time, incorporating publicly available information as of February 2022, and do not fully capture the dynamic nature of product development. As new data are generated, our results could be updated to incorporate progress in the MAP field to provide guidance on which vaccine MAP candidates should be prioritized next.</p></sec><sec id="s0115"><label>5</label><title>Conclusions</title><p id="p0200">This prioritization process highlighted the most advanced vaccine MAP candidates currently in early-stage clinical development, including MR, influenza, SARS-CoV-2, and hepatitis B, as well as new vaccine MAP concepts that could be high-impact targets for future MAP research and investments. VIPS partners are now working to address additional evidence gaps to accelerate MAP introduction timelines for LMIC markets, including generating clinical data, clarifying the regulatory and policy pathway, and conducting demand forecasts. Moreover, total cost of delivery and cost-effectiveness analyses are being conducted to ensure affordable access to vaccine MAPs in LMICs. To facilitate successful introduction and sustainable MAP use in LMICs, future studies should also focus on in-country evaluations and implementation research. Since the commercial viability of MAPs can be strengthened by advancing a balanced portfolio of MAP products, in terms of risk and the resources needed to bring MAP products to market, these findings could inform MAP developers, vaccine manufacturers, donors and financiers, as well as global health partners when deciding which global health MAP applications to advance within their own portfolios.</p></sec><sec id="s0120"><title>Funding</title><p id="p0205">PATH's contributions to this work were supported by the <funding-source id="gts0005">Gates Foundation, Seattle, Washington, USA</funding-source> [<award-id award-type="grant" rid="gts0005">INV-041275</award-id>; <award-id award-type="grant" rid="gts0005">INV-062084</award-id>].
