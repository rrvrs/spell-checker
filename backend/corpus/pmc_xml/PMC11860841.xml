His treatise is the oldest surviving work entirely dedicated to melancholia, making it a pivotal milestone in the history of psychiatry. It is noteworthy that Ibn Imr&#x000e2;n&#x02019;s work has often been overlooked in Western psychiatry. This oversight highlights the enduring relevance of his insights within the context of modern psychiatry.</p></sec><sec id="sec5665"><title>Objectives</title><p>The objective of this study is to assess the clinical and therapeutic aspects delineated by Ibn Imr&#x000e2;n in his treatise on melancholia for their contemporary accuracy and relevance within the field of modern psychiatry.</p></sec><sec id="sec5666"><title>Methods</title><p>The review method for the Ish&#x000e1;q Ibn Imr&#x000e2;n treatise involves a detailed analysis of the original Arabic text and its French translation by Adel Omrani and Radhi Jazi from the Tunisian Academy of Sciences, Letters, and Arts Beit el Hekma. This includes studying the content, structure, and historical context, as well as comparing the Arabic and French versions for accuracy.</p></sec><sec id="sec5667"><title>Results</title><p>The treatise is divided into two parts to clinical examination and treatment. While some of the terminology may differ from contemporary classifications, the core observations resonate with modern psychiatric knowledge.&#x000a0;The clinical form is described as sadness, loss of pleasure, social withdrawal, dark thoughts, and loss of interest,&#x000a0;along with somatic manifestations: sleep disturbances such as onset insomnia or hypersomnia, as well as weight loss. Additionally, perceptual disturbances, including elementary visual hallucinations (black silhouettes), are mentioned. Regarding etiologies, perinatal factors are mentioned in the treatise (&#x0201c;mood of the uterus&#x0201d;), along with six postnatal acquired causes that must be balanced in an individual: movement and rest, sleep and wakefulness, food and drink, depletion and retention, ambient air and location and psychological torment.&#x000a0;A seasonal pattern is described, with an association between melancholia and autumn. Several clinical forms are described, with the most prominent being catatonia compared to epilepsy, in its two agitated and inhibited forms. The second part of his treatise is dedicated to treatment, focusing on individualized approaches such as talk therapy, music therapy, and dietary interventions. Ibn Imr&#x000e2;n also describes mental strategies to correct false beliefs. For the pharmacological treatment, specific herbs has been used via oral, nasal, or intra-rectal.</p></sec><sec id="sec5668"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, Ish&#x000e1;q Ibn Imr&#x000e2;n&#x02019;s treatise on melancholia represents a timeless cornerstone in the history of psychiatry. This historical treasure serves as a reminder of the enduring quest to understand and alleviate the complexities of mental health.</p></sec><sec id="sec5669"><title>Disclosure of Interest</title><p>None Declared</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="1"/></counts></article-meta></front></article>
