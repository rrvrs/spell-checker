Yet, the mechanisms driving A&#x003b2; clearance in the immunized AD brain remain unclear. Here, we use spatial transcriptomics to explore the effects of both active and passive A&#x003b2; immunization in the AD brain. We compare actively immunized patients with AD with nonimmunized patients with AD and neurologically healthy controls, identifying distinct microglial states associated with A&#x003b2; clearance. Using high-resolution spatial transcriptomics alongside single-cell RNA sequencing, we delve deeper into the transcriptional pathways involved in A&#x003b2; removal after lecanemab treatment. We uncover spatially distinct microglial responses that vary by brain region. Our analysis reveals upregulation of the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (<italic>TREM2</italic>) and apolipoprotein E (<italic>APOE</italic>) in microglia across immunization approaches, which correlate positively with antibody responses and A&#x003b2; removal. Furthermore, we show that complement signaling in brain myeloid cells contributes to A&#x003b2; clearance after immunization. These findings provide new insights into the transcriptional mechanisms orchestrating A&#x003b2; removal and shed light on the role of microglia in immune-mediated A&#x003b2; clearance. Importantly, our work uncovers potential molecular targets that could enhance A&#x003b2;-targeted immunotherapies, offering new avenues for developing more effective therapeutic strategies to combat AD.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="web-summary"><p id="Par2">Spatial transcriptomics reveals distinct microglial mechanisms driving amyloid-&#x003b2; clearance in both passively and actively immunized patients with Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Neuroimmunology</kwd><kwd>Molecular neuroscience</kwd><kwd>Alzheimer's disease</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Health &#x00026; Human Services | NIH | National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS112458</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gate</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/100006312</institution-id><institution>BrightFocus Foundation (BrightFocus)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>A2023003S</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gate</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/100000957</institution-id><institution>Alzheimer's Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>23AARG-1026607</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gate</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/100000049</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Health &#x00026; Human Services | NIH | National Institute on Aging (U.S. National Institute on Aging)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AG078713</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gate</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100010969</institution-id><institution>Alzheimer Nederland (Alzheimer Netherlands)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>WE.06-2023-03</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>van Olst</surname><given-names>Lynn</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer Nature America, Inc. 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Main</title><p id="Par3">For nearly three decades, clinical trials have targeted cerebral A&#x003b2; accumulation in AD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>.

We then filtered out genes not expressed in at least 1% of either comparison group based on raw counts, excluding genes starting with RPS, RPL, MT or HB. Pseudobulk data were created by summing raw counts by donor to facilitate a more robust differential expression analysis. The DESeq2 analysis was conducted with the inclusion of covariates such as sex, age, average features within subsampled ST spots and gDNA percentage, all of which were standardized, if continuous. The DESeq function was run with fitType&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02018;local&#x02019; to estimate dispersions using local regression, the results function was run with independentFiltering&#x02009;=&#x02009;FALSE to include low-expression genes in statistical testing, and LFC shrinkage was performed by running lfcShrink with type&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02018;apeglm&#x02019;. <italic>P</italic> values were adjusted using the Benjamini&#x02013;Hochberg method.

Sample-specific and brain region-specific downsampling was applied to ensure that no single sample contributed more than 50% of ST spots or cells within a comparison group, that the fold difference in total ST spots or cells between comparison groups did not exceed three, and that each group contained no more than 3,000 ST spots or cells. Continuous covariates at the ST spot level, including age, the CDR from recorrected SCT data and gDNA percentage per sample, were standardized within each subset of ST spots or cells. We applied PrepSCTFindMarkers on the ROI, which recorrects SCTransform counts to normalize sequencing depth across samples. SCT data (log1p-transformed SCT counts) were then extracted from the Seurat object. Genes prefixed with RPS, RPL, MT or HB were excluded, and additional filtering was performed based on percentage expression within comparison groups. Genes were tested if they were expressed in 1% of both groups and in 10% of either group using SCT expression data, except for Visium HD data, where genes were tested if they were expressed in 1% of either group. The log<sub>2</sub> fold change between comparison groups for the remaining genes was calculated using the Seurat FoldChange function. MAST was run with covariates such as sex, age, CDR, gDNA percentage, brain region and manually annotated regions or cortical layers, all of which were standardized if continuous. Sample ID, or brain region and sample ID, was included as a random effect for comparisons involving multiple samples. MAST hurdle <italic>P</italic> values were adjusted using the Benjamini&#x02013;Hochberg method.

Genes prefixed with RPS, RPL, MT or HB were excluded from testing. Marker gene selection was based on Benjamini&#x02013;Hochberg-adjusted <italic>P</italic> values below 0.05. For the specific analysis of positive and negative markers within cortical A&#x003b2; niche cluster 6, FindMarkers was used to compare cluster 6 against all others, allowing for both positive and negative marker detection (only.pos&#x02009;=&#x02009;FALSE), with min.pct set to 0.1 and logfc.threshold set to -Inf, using the default Wilcoxon test.
