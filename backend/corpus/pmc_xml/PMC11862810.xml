In 2020, a multicenter, retrospective evaluation of 247 patients undergoing radiofrequency (RF)-assisted facial rejuvenation was published.<sup><xref rid="sjae232-B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> This review documented improvements in the appearance of facial and neck aging when combining minimally invasive bipolar RF (FaceTite/AccuTite; InMode Ltd., Lake Forest, CA) and noninvasive fractional bipolar RF (Morpheus8; InMode). In this study we addressed the so-called treatment-gap population in facial rejuvenation, which included 3 patient groups, including (1) young patients whose skin redundancy was not severe enough to justify a traditional excisional procedure (facelift/neck lift), but also not mild enough to treat with liposuction or noninvasive modalities alone; (2) patients who had already undergone a facelift or neck lift who presented with recurrent skin laxity; and (3) patients who would benefit from a facelift or neck lift but wanted to avoid surgery and were willing to accept a more modest improvement. Historically, nonexcisional improvement of facial soft tissue laxity and descent posed a challenge. In this study, however, we demonstrated that improvements in skin appearance and quality were possible with advanced RF-assisted technologies.</p><p>The &#x0201c;aging face&#x0201d; is a result of volume deflation and increased dermal and subcutaneous tissue laxity. Energy-based devices address the latter through thermal contraction and subacute neocollagenesis.<sup><xref rid="sjae232-B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="sjae232-B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Bipolar RF energy can be delivered in a transdermal fractional manner through a microneedling device (noninvasive) or as a full-field treatment (minimally invasive). These can be performed independently or concomitantly to obtain the desired results when tailored according to patient anatomy, treatment necessity, and patient desires. A thorough understanding of anatomy, particularly the ligamentous vs fat pad landscape of the face, is critical for optimizing the results of these treatments.</p><p>Radiofrequency devices were popularized in nonaesthetic fields such as cardiac catheter ablation and ophthalmology. Now RF-assisted skin tightening of the body, arms, and face continues to grow, with increasing evidence supporting its safety, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness.<sup><xref rid="sjae232-B1" ref-type="bibr">1-15</xref></sup> Volumetric analyses of treated skin support thickening and shortening of the collagen fibroseptal network as well as decreases in the thickness of the subcutaneous fat from heat coagulation.<sup><xref rid="sjae232-B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> In facial rejuvenation, when maintaining or even augmenting volume in certain areas to treat the &#x0201c;aging face,&#x0201d; the operator must be precise and intentional with RF thermal energy delivery (ie, power, temperature cutoffs, anatomic location, total energy delivered, and depth of energy delivery). Melting subcutaneous fat of the face may distort contours and lead to unintended downstream sequelae.</p><p>The purpose of the present paper is to describe a more focused, anatomical approach to RF-assisted facial rejuvenation, which now expands beyond the traditional treatment gap population outlined in previous reports.<sup><xref rid="sjae232-B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Readers will learn the nuances of RF energy treatment procedures and how to manipulate various treatment parameters according to anatomic locations.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="sjae232-s1"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="sjae232-s1.1"><title>Radiofrequency Modalities</title><p>This study was conducted in accordance with the ethical principles stated in the Declaration of Helsinki. Informed consent was obtained from all participants. Consecutive patients undergoing RF-assisted facial rejuvenation in S.A.&#x02019;s practice were treated with the Embrace protocol (InMode), with a combination of bipolar RF (FaceTite/AccuTite) and fractional bipolar RF (Morpheus8). These 2 RF delivery methods administer energy by different mechanisms and target different depths of the dermal and subdermal tissue (<xref rid="sjae232-F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A, B</xref>). The minimally invasive FaceTite bipolar RF cannula is 1.3&#x02005;mm in diameter and 13&#x02005;cm long, and the AccuTite bipolar RF cannula is 0.9&#x02005;mm in diameter and 6&#x02005;cm long. For both handpieces the electrical current is directed from the internal tip toward the external, surface probe. The fractional bipolar applicator deploys RF emitting needles with tunable energy levels (1 to 45) at variable programmable depths (in 1-mm increments from 1 to 4&#x02005;mm). The &#x0201c;number of passes&#x0201d; is another variable, which refers to the number of times the same area undergoes deployment of the bipolar RF microneedles. Fractional bipolar radiofrequency creates controlled zones of dermal injury, narrow at the epidermis, with conical enlargement as the needles descend. It is recommended to reduce the RF power intensity at superficial depths to avoid thermal injury to the epidermis. By doing so, in effect there is a conical distribution of thermal dispersion as greater RF energy is selected at greater needle depths. This is unlike fractional photothermolysis (lasers), which cause thermal injury that tapers at deeper depths.</p><fig position="float" id="sjae232-F1" fig-type="figure"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Planes of action of radiofrequency devices.

Treatment decisions are made to account for the unique anatomical variants between patients, as well as the different topographical anatomy of the face and neck. We therefore routinely modify treatment type and energy delivery based on dermal thickness, fibroseptal network density, subcutaneous fat thickness, and rhytid depth. Gender, age, genetics, and lifestyle contribute to the dermal thickness, amount of subcutaneous fat, and density of the fibroseptal network. RF-assisted treatments must be tailored accordingly.</p></sec><sec id="sjae232-s1.2"><title>Anatomical Approach to Radiofrequency-Assisted Facial Rejuvenation</title><p>An appreciation for facial topographical variations in dermal thickness, fibroseptal network density, fat distribution, and arterial and neural anatomy are critical for surgeons performing facial rejuvenation procedures (<xref rid="sjae232-F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A, B</xref>, <xref rid="sjae232-F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>) of any kinds.<sup><xref rid="sjae232-B17" ref-type="bibr">17-29</xref></sup> Multiple cadaveric and 3-dimensional (3D) volumetric studies have reported regional differences across the face, which are important to the success and safety of applying minimally invasive and noninvasive technologies. Whether performing minimally invasive bipolar RF, fractional bipolar microneedling, or both, the depth, temperature, energy, and number of passes can be modified based on the specific anatomical area being treated to achieve optimal results (<xref rid="sjae232-T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="sjae232-F2" fig-type="figure"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>(A) Topographical variations in dermal thickness. The thickness of the skin varies based on the anatomical area of the face. A surgeon's understanding of dermis topographical anatomy is important for adjusting treatment depth with radiofrequency devices.

When applying FaceTite, surgeons must appreciate the topographical variations in subcutaneous fat thickness of the face. Orienting the bipolar probe safely and with maximal treatment effect requires an understanding of the relative thickness of facial fat across the face (periorbita (green), very thin; forehead and perioral region (blue), thin; malar eminence/cheek (purple), moderate thickness.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="sjae232f2" position="float"/></fig><fig position="float" id="sjae232-F3" fig-type="figure"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Topographical map of fibroseptal network density.

The thinner fat layer and dense FSN arrangement of the upper lip contributes to relatively fixed skin which is much less prone to sagging.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="sjae232f3"

All patients who participated in this study were female. The patient follow-up time ranged from 3 months to 2 years (average follow-up time: 6 months).</p><sec id="sjae232-s2.1"><title>Forehead</title><p>Soft tissue thickness of the forehead is quite variable, but overall quite thin with a very thin layer of subcutaneous fat. Over time, dynamic rhytids develop into static rhytids due to repetitive muscle activation resulting in the aged appearance of the forehead.</p><p>Fractional bipolar microneedling is the treatment of choice for the forehead, with the operator modifying the protocol intensity based on the palpated soft tissue thickness. For patients with thin forehead tissue microneedling is performed at 2- and 1-mm depths for 2 to 3 passes, with 50% overlap and an energy of 15J to 20J. When the soft tissue on the forehead is thicker, treatment at 3-, 2- and 1-mm for 2 to 3 passes, 50% overlap, and energy of 15J to 20J is performed.</p><p>Subdermal adipose remodeling is anticipated to occur to a greater extent when the forehead is thicker. Even a degree of brow elevation has been observed in some patients. Transverse forehead lines, however, are very difficult to eliminate with RF-assisted treatment alone. Therefore, we routinely use neuromodulators in conjunction to obtain an optimal improvement in patients and find this exceeds the aesthetic of neuromodulators alone. Whereas the neuromodulators address the dynamic rhytids, the RF microneedling treatment improves pore size, dermal thickness, and overall skin quality.<sup><xref rid="sjae232-B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="sjae232-B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> High dosages of neuromodulators, or when placed too inferiorly in the frontalis muscle, can cause the eyebrow position to descend. In theory, the dermal contraction from the concomitant RF treatment may also help balance these effects and provide brow stability.</p><p>Of 364 foreheads treated with Morpheus8 since 2018, 268 were in the context of isolated full-face RF treatment, and 96 were an adjunct procedure, ancillary to a face and neck lift. There were no minor or major complications with the RF treatments.</p></sec><sec id="sjae232-s2.2"><title>Periorbital Skin</title><p>Mild to moderate dermatochalasis can be safely and effectively treated with fractional RF microneedling. This area is characterized by very little (if any) subcutaneous fat and the thinnest dermis of the human body.<sup><xref rid="sjae232-B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Our most common treatment protocol includes 3 sessions of fractional bipolar RF microneedling, 4 weeks apart. The Morpheus8 Prime 12-pin tip is always employed because its size lends to precise control of needle placement in this anatomically sensitive area. The inside of the orbital rim is treated with 2 passes at 2&#x02005;mm and 3 passes at 1&#x02005;mm. The upper eyelid skin superior to the palpebral sulcus is retracted superiorly such that the skin is on tension and the bony orbit serves as a platform for the treatment. Typically, this area is treated with 2 to 3 passes at 1&#x02005;mm. For maximal safety, the tip is never directed toward the globe. The lower lid is usually treated at 2 mm and 1&#x02005;mm with 2 passes at each depth. We will come as close as 2 to 3&#x02005;mm below the lid margin and lateral canthus. The skin overlying the lateral orbital rim (ie, crow's feet) is then treated with 2 to 3 passes at 2&#x02005;mm, and 2 to 3 passes at 1&#x02005;mm. Energy level remains at 20J to 25J throughout. Analogous to the forehead, we have found that concomitant neuromodulators to the lateral orbital orbicularis muscle in addition to the fractionated RF treatment improve skin quality and overall periorbital appearance compared to neuromodulators alone (<xref rid="sjae232-F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A-C</xref>). Intraoperative periorbital treatment is demonstrated in Video 1, in which the patient received stand-alone periorbital treatment under local anesthetic.</p><fig position="float" id="sjae232-F4" fig-type="figure"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>(A) Periorbital anatomy.

The aging face is characterized in part by increased laxity of the fibroseptal network leading to malar fat pad descent, thereby deepening the appearance of the sulcus.</p><p>Facelift procedures redistribute the malar fat pads in a vertical and/or superolateral oblique direction to improve the perceived nasolabial crease. A different technique to address the appearance of a pronounced nasolabial fold involves bipolar RF (AccuTite) through a 1-mm needle puncture at the base of the fold. The operator will observe an immediate improvement due to the thermal contraction of the underlying ligaments. Multiple excursions of the cannula parallel to the nasolabial fold are performed until the desired effect is achieved. Fractional bipolar RF microneedling is then performed: 1 to 2 passes at 4&#x02005;mm, followed by 2 to 3 passes each at 3-mm and 2-mm depths. This improves skin quality to encourage retraction of the overlying skin of the upper lip-cheek junction and to soften the severity of the nasolabial fold. We follow this approach for severe nasolabial folds (ones that are deep and extend inferior to the lateral lip commissure) as a stand-alone procedure, as well as during a full facelift. When indicated, it is also performed in conjunction with jowl and jawline treatment (<xref rid="sjae232-F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A, B</xref>). An illustration of the nasolabial fold treatment is demonstrated in Video 2.</p><fig position="float" id="sjae232-F5" fig-type="figure"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>(A) Nasolabial fold anatomy. The nasolabial fold results from dense muscular attachments, a condensed superficial musculoaponeurotic system (SMAS) structure, and a denser fibroseptal network arrangement below compared to above the fold. With aging the thicker malar fat compartments become ptotic, leading to increased depth and definition to the sulcus. (B) A 60-year-old female before and (C) 1 year after the application of AccuTite to nasolabial folds during a facelift. The accompanying video of nasolabial fold treatment (Video 2) is this patient. Although she had a facelift, the nasolabial fold reduction is markedly enhanced by the AccuTite because of the dermolipolysis of the fat in the nasolabial folds. This kind of change is not achieved with a facelift alone.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="sjae232f5" position="float"/></fig><p>Since 2020, Accutite was performed for nasolabial folds as a stand-alone procedure in 43 patients and in the context of face and neck lift in 24 patients. There were no minor or major complications.</p></sec><sec id="sjae232-s2.4"><title>Perioral Region</title><p>Dermal atrophy and the attenuation of the dense fibroseptal network of the upper lip contribute to pathognomonic changes of the aging lip; lengthening of the prolabium, loss of vermillion height, and static, tangential perioral rhytids. MRI studies illustrate a decrease in the volume and anteroposterior thickness of the upper lip, with histological studies confirming thinning of the dermis, thickening of the subcutaneous layer, and degeneration of the collagen and elastin fibers.<sup><xref rid="sjae232-B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> The dermis of the upper lip is one of the thickest areas of the face, and the underlying fibroseptal network forms strong attachment, tethering the dermis to the underlying muscle.<sup><xref rid="sjae232-B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> This fixed unit of the face is not improved with a facelift, and fractional bipolar RF treatment is the procedure of choice for patients requesting improvement of the upper lip appearance, but not wanting prolonged downtime as seen with lasers and dermabrasion.</p><p>Although it is more common to treat the upper lip in isolation from the lower lip, the entire perioral area requires treatment in a large percentage of patients. As with all aesthetic procedures, adjustments are made based on the quality and apparent thickness of the individual patient's skin and the improvement in appearance needed, allowing for variations according to the patient's pretreatment skin state. Deep, static, vertical lines on the upper lip are particularly displeasing to patients; however, they are challenging to completely efface. We usually perform 4 RF microneedling treatment sessions 1 month apart. The first 2 treatments are at 4-, 3-, 2-, and 1-mm depths with 3 passes at each depth. The third and fourth sessions are at 2 mm and 1&#x02005;mm, with 4 passes at each depth. When only treating the perioral area, the 12-pin Prime applicator is utilized for precise and even deployment of needles on the convex surface of the upper lip. The fixed resurfacing 0.5-mm-depth tip is also placed for 1 to 3 passes when needed to improve multiple fine lines and wrinkles (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Figure 1</xref>, located online at <ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1093/asj/sjae232" ext-link-type="uri">https://doi.org/10.1093/asj/sjae232</ext-link>).</p><p>Of 353 perioral zones treated with Morpheus8 since 2018, 259 were treated as a stand-alone procedure, and 94 cases in the context a face and neck lift. There were no complications seen with these treatments, in contrast to more traditional perioral treatments that include herpetic outbreaks, bacterial infections, and hypopigmentation or hyperpigmentation.</p></sec><sec id="sjae232-s2.5"><title>Jowls/Mandibular Border/Neck</title><p>The aging jawline is characterized by attenuation of the fibroseptal support, fat excess, and descent of the 2 mandibular fat compartments posterior to the mandibular ligament.<sup><xref rid="sjae232-B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="sjae232-B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> As the fat compartments descend, the sharp mandibular border is obscured, and a sulcus forms around the mandibular ligament, leading to the so-called marionette line anteriorly. Although a surgical release of the ligament and resuspension of fat is an effective way to address the jowl, RF-assisted soft tissue contraction can both reduce the thickness of the subcutaneous jowl fat compartment and strengthen the integrity of the fibroseptal network. Both of these techniques work synergistically to improve mandibular contours.</p><p>Both the inferior extent of the descended jowl and the inferior border of the mandible going through the jowl are marked. This designates zone 1, and inferior to the mandibular border represents zone 2. For patients who are having the bipolar RF procedure limited to just the jowl area (and possibly the nasolabial fold) we utilize the AccuTite cannula because it can deliver energy to the entire treatment area. A well-defined lower face-jawline-mandibular border that gently transitions to the adjacent convex and concave contours is the ultimate goal of all facial and neck rejuvenation procedures. This includes the young patient cohort that presents to a plastic surgeon's office desiring an improved cervicomental angle due to genetics, weight fluctuations, or other lifestyle-related anatomy. Precision marking of the entire jowl with the mandibular border dividing zone 1 (above) and zone 2 (below) the mandible in the standing or sitting position is mandatory. We perform application of energy with each stroke upon withdrawal of the cannula in a fanning technique until the desired temperature is reached. Jowl improvement can be seen in real time as the procedure is performed. Subsequent fractional RF microneedling is then performed at 3 mm, 2 mm, and 1&#x02005;mm directly over the treated jowl area, with 2 passes at each depth. Zone 2, where a mild degree of lipolysis can be beneficial to accentuate contours, can be treated with 3&#x02005;mm and even 4&#x02005;mm in some cases.</p><p>Most patients benefit from treating the entire mandibular border with the 13-cm 1.9-mm bipolar applicator. Treatment of the entire neck with the bipolar cannula followed by fractional bipolar microneedling can significantly improve neck appearance. Bipolar RF improves the neck skin appearance and cervicomental angle augmenting the jawline. The neck is usually treated bilaterally from the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle to the midline with 3 access ports; 1 behind each earlobe and 1 in the middle of the submental skin crease. Treatment extends from the mandibular border down to the first cervical skin crease. Temperature settings are set to an internal temperature cutoff of 68 degrees Celsius and external temperature cutoff at 38 to 40 degrees Celsius.</p><p>Submental fullness can be very challenging to address when there is any degree of skin laxity, even in younger patients. For each fractional RF microneedling treatment, the settings are as follows: 3 mm, 2 mm, and 1&#x02005;mm, performing 3 passes at each depth with 50% overlap. A total of 3 to 4 treatment sessions of fractional RF is recommended, 1 month apart, to optimize skin retraction and overall neck contours. Although subdermal adipose remodeling occurs with repeat treatments, it is important to preserve an adequate layer of subdermal fat over the platysma to prevent excessive banding, which is often seen in the aging neck. Therefore, power and needle depth during each treatment session require keen clinical judgement with conservative settings, based on the specific patient's anatomy (<xref rid="sjae232-F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). Intraoperative videos of the anterior neck treatment and jowl treatment are demonstrated in Video 3 and Video 4, respectively.</p><fig position="float" id="sjae232-F6" fig-type="figure"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>(A) Jowls/mandibular border/neck anatomy.

We have transitioned from a proof-of-concept model to the identification and successful management of &#x0201c;treatment gap&#x0201d; patients, and now to performing bipolar RF and fractional bipolar microneedling RF beyond the treatment gap population.<sup><xref rid="sjae232-B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> It has become a key adjunct to a facelift, replacing traditional adjuncts such as lasers, chemical peels, and dermabrasion. Morpheus8 of the upper lip and/or perioral area is fairly standard during facelift surgery. We also apply the Morpheus8 on elevated skin flaps over the neck, mandibular border, and nasolabial folds; however, we refrain from this on elevated skin flaps of the immediate preauricular area, where the skin is thin.</p><p>Although surgical excision remains the gold standard for the treatment of moderate to severe facial skin laxity, we have found that the proportion of patients seeking a less invasive procedure with quicker recovery is increasing. A younger demographic is spending more time in the public eye with social media and has a desire for improvement in facial and neck appearance. Many patients present knowing that minimally invasive RF technology can give them an improvement in their specific areas of concern, and they seek physicians with experience in performing these procedures. The terms FaceTite, AccuTite, and Morpheus8 (all products of InMode) are now common in the public vernacular. Due to global marketing efforts, patients will often call the office specifically requesting these procedures, with the short recovery time noted as one of the primary reasons for their interest.</p><p>The posttreatment recovery for fractional bipolar radiofrequency is usually minimal. There is no limitation to physical activity immediately after treatment. Mild erythema and edema are expected to last for 1 to 2 days. Patients apply antibiotic ointment 3 times per day for the first 3 days, depending on the extent of the area treated. The microneedle entrance points heal during that time, and patients can resume makeup as they desire. Many patients are able continue work or social engagement throughout the healing process. Ecchymosis is most often due to injection of local anesthesia; when topical anesthesia is utilized there is usually no bruising.</p><p>Bruising and edema following bipolar radiofrequency is variable, just as with a full facelift procedure. The overall recovery period is much less than a facelift procedure, because there is no incision to heal, and no stitches to be removed. Posttreatment management of the jowls/mandibular border/neck include our usual facelift compression dressing for 2 days, after which there is no dressing. When concomitant fractional bipolar is performed with a facelift, a small layer of antibiotic ointment is applied just before placing the usual facelift bandage. Whether or not to apply another coat of ointment for an additional day depends on clinical evaluation when the bandage is removed.</p><p>In our experience some patients benefit from 2, 3, or 4 sessions of radiofrequency microneedling which are scheduled 4 weeks apart. The subdermal adipose remodeling and collagen/elastin generation continue throughout the entire treatment series, providing cumulative effects. We have observed that although patients see a change in the skin appearance after the first treatment, the continued improvement with each succussive treatment makes them enthusiastic to complete the entire treatment series.</p><p>To date we have not observed any burns or scars secondary to bipolar RF. The RF console has built in safety controls of an internal temperature cutoff and external temperature cutoff. The console gives audible and visible cues on the console screen as set temperatures are reached. Treatment continues for 1 minute after target temperatures are reached. The most frequent settings are 68 degrees Celsius internally and 38 degrees Celsius externally.</p><p>We have likewise had no scaring or burns with bipolar RF microneedling but are diligent to evaluate the skin appearance with each depth of the treatment and each pass of the handpiece just as one would do with laser or dermabrasion treatments. Energy variations depend on the anatomical zone being treated, as noted in <xref rid="sjae232-T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>.</p><p>A limitation of this study was the lack of objective, measurable outcomes. The degree of contribution of these adjunct or stand-alone treatments to skin tightening is difficult to quantify. Patient and surgeon safety are 2 important outcomes in aesthetic plastic surgery literature. The main objective here was to report the low complication rate and demonstrate how a very high-volume, experienced surgeon performed these treatments. The goal is that surgeons with less experience with radiofrequency devices can implement these protocols to perform this treatment in a safe, efficient, and reproducible fashion.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sjae232-s4"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>RF treatment of the various anatomical areas of the face and neck produces soft tissue contraction and improved skin quality appearance. An anatomical approach to facial rejuvenation yields the best results. This requires specific RF type, depth, energy level, and number of treatments to be tailored to the individual patient's anatomy and the specific topographical area of the face being treated.</p></sec><sec id="sjae232-s5"><title>Supplemental Material</title><p>This article contains <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">supplemental material</xref> located online at <ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1093/asj/sjae232" ext-link-type="uri">https://doi.org/10.1093/asj/sjae232</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="sup1" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>sjae232_Supplementary_Data</label><media xlink:href="sjae232_Supplementary_Data.zip"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><sec id="sjae232-s6"><title>Disclosures</title><p>Drs Stein and Vranis have no disclosures.
