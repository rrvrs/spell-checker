However, it was not until the 1970s that the molecular structure of relaxin was determined, identifying it as an insulin-like molecule comprising two peptides (A-chain, B-chain) linked by two interchain disulfide bridges and one intrachain disulfide bridge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Subsequently, a family of relaxin-type peptides has been identified in mammals, which include relaxin1&#x02013;3 (RLN1&#x02013;3) and insulin-like peptides 3&#x02013;6 (INSL3&#x02013;6) in humans. Furthermore, analysis of the expression and functions of these peptides has revealed roles in the regulation of reproduction and a variety of other physiological processes, including gastrointestinal and cardiovascular function, metabolism, and stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].
</p><p id="Par53">Discovery of the mechanism of action of relaxin-type peptides was enabled by the observation that the phenotype of abnormal testis descent is observed in gene-knockout mice for both INSL3 and LGR8, a leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR). Thus, it was hypothesized that LGR8 is a relaxin receptor and this was confirmed by experimental studies demonstrating that INSL3 acts as a ligand for LGR8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Furthermore, a second leucine-rich repeat-containing GPCR known as LGR7 was found to be the receptor for RLN2, and orphan GPCRs known as GPCR135 and GPCR142 were found to act as receptors for RLN3 and INSL5, respectively. Accordingly, LGR8, LGR7, GPCR135, and GPCR142 are now referred to as relaxin family peptide (RXFP) receptors 1&#x02013;4, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The focus of this study is on relaxin-type signaling and it is noteworthy that, within the broader family of insulin-related peptides, relaxin-type peptides are unique in exerting their physiological effects by binding to GPCRs. This contrasts with insulin and insulin-like growth factors (IGFs), which exert their effects by binding to tyrosine kinase-type receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par54">Insights into the evolution and comparative physiology of relaxin signaling have been obtained with the discovery and functional characterization of relaxin/insulin-type peptides and their receptors in the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>. Thus, human RXFP1&#x00026;2 are co-orthologs of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> receptor LGR3, and experimental studies have demonstrated that a relaxin/insulin-like peptide known as <italic>Drosophila</italic> insulin-like peptide 8 (Dilp8 or gonadulin) acts as a ligand for LGR3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Furthermore, functional studies indicate that Dilp8-LGR3 signaling regulates growth, maturation, and reproductive behavior in <italic>Drosophila</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Interestingly, it has recently been reported that a second insulin-like peptide in <italic>Drosophila</italic> known as Dilp7 acts as a ligand for LGR4, a GPCR that is closely related to LGR3, and Dilp7-LGR4 signaling is required for noxious light avoidance in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Thus, relaxin/insulin-related peptides that act as ligands for GPCRs are evolutionarily ancient regulators of diverse processes, ranging from reproductive maturation and function to escape behavior. However, to obtain a broader comparative perspective, an investigation of the occurrence and function of GPCR-mediated relaxin/insulin-type signaling in other invertebrate taxa is needed.</p><p id="Par55">A key insight into the evolution of relaxin-type signaling as a regulator of reproductive processes was the identification of a gonadotropic neuropeptide in starfish&#x000a0;(phylum Echinodermata) that is a relaxin-like peptide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The existence of a gonadotropic substance in starfish was first reported in 1959 with the observation that extracts of radial nerve cords trigger spawning when injected into reproductively mature animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The gonadotropin was named gonad-stimulating substance (GSS) and subsequent studies revealed it to be a peptide that exerts its effects by stimulating ovarian follicle cells surrounding oocytes to produce 1-methyladenine, which then triggers germinal vesicle breakdown and spawning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Fifty years after its existence was first reported, GSS was finally identified in the starfish <italic>Patiria pectinifera</italic> as a relaxin-type peptide and it was then renamed relaxin-like gonad-stimulating peptide (RGP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Subsequently, RGP has been identified in other starfish species and has also been shown to have gonadotropic activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Furthermore, a recent detailed anatomical analysis of RGP in the starfish <italic>Asterias rubens</italic> revealed a widespread pattern of expression, including the radial nerve cords, digestive system, body wall-associated organs, and gonoducts. Informed by these findings, it was hypothesized that the release of RGP from the gonoducts triggers gamete maturation and spawning in starfish, while RGP produced in other parts of the body may regulate other physiological/behavioral processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p id="Par56">Interestingly, a cDNA encoding the precursor of a second relaxin-type peptide has been identified in the starfish <italic>A. rubens</italic> by analysis of transcriptome sequence data and named relaxin-like peptide 2 (ArRLP2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Subsequently, orthologs of ArRLP2 have been identified in other starfish species, indicating that the occurrence of two relaxin-type peptides is an evolutionarily conserved feature of the class Asteroidea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Furthermore, in vitro pharmacological tests on ovarian tissue from two starfish species, <italic>A. rubens</italic> and <italic>P. pectinifera</italic>, have revealed that RLP2-type peptides mimic the gonadotropic action of RGP and induce oocyte maturation and spawning. Therefore, RGP and RLP2 have been renamed as RGP1 and RGP2, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p id="Par57">The discovery that two relaxin-like peptides (RGP1 and RGP2) act as gonadotropins in starfish provided a basis for the aims of this study. Firstly, to investigate the evolution of these neuropeptides by performing a detailed analysis of the phylogenetic distribution and relationships of relaxin-type precursors in echinoderms and other bilaterian phyla. Secondly, to investigate the mechanisms by which RGP1 and RGP2 exert their gonadotropic effect in starfish by identifying candidate receptor(s) for these peptides, which was accomplished by analysis of transcriptome/genome sequence data to determine the phylogenetic relationships and structures of genes encoding relaxin-type receptors in echinoderms and in other bilaterian phyla. Having identified two relaxin receptor-related GPCRs in starfish, our third aim was to experimentally test both RGP1 and RGP2 as ligands for these receptors. The findings of this study provide new insights into the evolution of relaxin-type signaling as a regulator of reproductive physiology.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Relationships of starfish RGP1 and RGP2 with relaxin/insulin/IGF-type peptides in other taxa</title><p id="Par58">To investigate the evolution of starfish RGP1 and RGP2 and their phylogenetic relationships with relaxin/insulin/IGF-type peptides in other taxa, the sequences of relaxin/insulin/IGF-type precursors were identified in bilaterian taxa. Then both CLANS and phylogenetic analysis were employed to investigate relationships between relaxin/insulin/IGF-type peptide precursors in the Bilateria. CLANS revealed that the starfish RGP1 and RGP2 precursors and the precursors of relaxin-like peptides in other echinoderms cluster with chordate relaxin-type precursors (Additional File 1: Fig. S1). Phylogenetic analysis of bilaterian relaxin/insulin/IGF-type precursors using a maximum likelihood method revealed that echinoderm precursors of relaxin-like peptides (including starfish RGP1 and RGP2) and chordate relaxin-type precursors are positioned in the same clade and this clade also comprises precursors of relaxin-like peptides from a variety of protostome phyla, including <italic>Drosophila</italic> Dilp8. Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis revealed that within the wider family of relaxin/insulin/IGF-type peptide precursors, relaxin/Dilp8-type precursors are most closely related to Dilp7-type precursors (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Phylogenetic analysis of relaxin/insulin/IGF-type peptide precursors.

This revealed in the starfish (<italic>A.</italic> cf. <italic>solaris</italic>, <italic>A. rubens</italic>) RGP1 and RGP2 precursor genes the presence of a phase 1 intron that interrupts the coding sequence at a position located between an exon that encodes the signal peptide, the B-chain, and the N-terminal region of the C-peptide and an exon that encodes the C-terminal region of the C-peptide and the A-chain. Accordingly, an intron was found in the same position in genes encoding relaxin-type precursors in other taxa (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A). By way of comparison, genes encoding Dilp7-type peptide precursors have a phase 1 intron in the same position but these genes also have a second intron (phase 2) that interrupts the coding sequence at a position located between an exon that encodes the signal peptide and an exon that encodes the B-chain (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B). Thus, the presence or absence of this intron distinguishes Dilp7-type precursors and relaxin/Dilp8-type precursors, respectively.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>Comparison of the exon/intron structure of genes encoding relaxin/Dilp8-type precursors and Dilp7-type precursors in selected bilaterian species. Schematic representations of the gene structures are shown, with protein-coding exons displayed as rectangles and introns shown as lines (with intron length stated above). The phase of introns is stated at the start of each intron above each diagram. Protein-coding exons are color-coded to show regions that encode the N-terminal signal peptide (blue), the B-chain (pink), monobasic or dibasic cleavage sites (green), the C-chain and other regions of the precursors (black), and the A-chain (orange).

However, in addition, the Dilp7-type precursor genes have a second intron (phase 2) located between exons that encode the signal peptide and B-chain and this feature distinguishes Dilp7-type precursor genes from relaxin/Dilp8-type precursor genes. Accordingly, unlike in relaxin/Dilp8-type precursors where the B-chain is located immediately after the signal peptide, in Dilp7-type precursors the signal peptide and B-chain are separated by a polypeptide sequence (shown in black).

Interestingly, this revealed the presence of an alanine residue in RGP2 B-chains that is not present in the B-chain of RGP1-type peptides in starfish or relaxin-type peptides in other echinoderms. However, an alanine residue is present in the same position in <italic>Drosophila</italic> Dilp8 and a relaxin-type peptide in the annelid <italic>Owenia fusiformis</italic>. Furthermore, a Gly-Ile (GI) motif is a feature of the A-chain in starfish RGP2-type peptides that is also present in the <italic>O. fusiformis</italic> A-chain, but which is not present in starfish RGP1-type peptides or relaxin-type peptides in other taxa (Additional file 2: Fig. S2).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Identification of a candidate receptor for RGP1 and RGP2 in starfish</title><p id="Par61">Having established that starfish RGP1 and RGP2 belong to a bilaterian family of relaxin/Dilp8-type peptides, we sought to identify candidate receptors for RGP1 and RGP2 in <italic>A. </italic>cf.<italic> solaris</italic> and <italic>A. rubens</italic>. To accomplish this, we investigated the occurrence in starfish and other echinoderms of homologs of the mammalian relaxin-type receptors RXFP1&#x02013;4. BLAST analysis of transcriptome/genome sequence data did not reveal the presence of RXFP3/RXFP4-type receptors, but homologs of mammalian leucine-rich repeat type RXFP1/RXFP2-type GPCRs and <italic>Drosophila</italic> LGR3/LGR4-type receptors were identified in starfish and other echinoderms. Thus, two genes encoding RXFP1-2/LGR3/LGR4-type receptors were identified in both <italic>A. </italic>cf.<italic> solaris</italic> (LOC110976116; LOC110984685) and <italic>A. rubens</italic> (LOC117293693; LOC117296788) and homologs of these were identified in other echinoderms. To investigate relationships more specifically between these echinoderm receptors and leucine-rich repeat-type GPCRs more generally in the Bilateria, we performed CLANS analysis of the sequences (Additional file 3: Fig. S3) and generated a phylogenetic tree using the maximum-likelihood method (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;3</label><caption><p>Phylogenetic analysis of leucine-rich repeat type G-protein coupled receptors (LRR-GPCRs).

A more detailed analysis of the type C1 clade revealed that it further sub-divides into two distinct clades.

Secondly, a clade that includes <italic>Drosophila</italic> LGR4 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).

Accordingly, receptors from other echinoderms and some protostome taxa are likewise positioned in both clades.

This revealed the presence/absence of evolutionarily conserved introns that distinguish genes encoding RXFP/LGR3-type proteins and genes encoding LGR4-type proteins. Thus, in genes encoding RXFP/LGR3-type proteins in humans (HsapRXFP1 and HsapRXFP2), starfish (AsolRXFP/LGR3; ArubRXFP/LGR3) and the annelid O. <italic>fusiformis</italic> (OfusLGR3) there is a conserved phase 1 intron that interrupts the coding sequence for the second transmembrane domain, whilst this intron is not present in LGR4-type genes. Furthermore, in genes encoding RXFP/LGR3-type proteins in humans (HsapRXFP1-2) and starfish (AsolRXFP/LGR3; ArubRXFP/LGR3) there is also a conserved phase 1 intron that interrupts the coding sequence for the fifth transmembrane domain, whilst this intron is not present in LGR4-type genes. Conversely, in genes encoding LGR4-type proteins in starfish (AsolLGR4; ArubLGR4), the annelid O. <italic>fusiformis</italic> (OfusLGR4) and in the mollusk <italic>Crassostrea virginica</italic> (CvirLGR) there is a conserved phase 0 intron located after the exon that encodes the seventh transmembrane domain, whilst this intron is not present in RXFP/LGR3-type genes. These findings provide further evidence that AsolRXFP/LGR3 and ArubRXFP/LGR3 are orthologs of the RXFP/LGR3-type proteins in other taxa and AsolLGR4 and ArubLGR4 are orthologs of LGR4-type proteins in other taxa. Furthermore, these findings, together with our phylogenetic analysis of sequence data, indicate that RXFP/LGR3-type genes and LGR4-type genes are paralogs that evolved via an&#x000a0;evolutionarily ancient gene duplication in a common ancestor of the Bilateria<italic>.</italic><fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;4</label><caption><p>Comparison of the exon/intron structure of genes encoding RXFP/LGR3-type receptors and LGR4-type receptors in selected bilaterian taxa.

In <italic>A. </italic>cf.<italic> solaris</italic> there are two predicted isoforms of RXFP/LGR3 (isoform X1&#x02009;=&#x02009;XP_022084824.1; 847 residues; isoform X2&#x02009;=&#x02009;XP_022084826.1; 833 residues), with an alternative start codon conferring an additional 14 residues at the N-terminus in isoform X1. However, contained within both isoforms is a 775-residue sequence that has a predicted N-terminal signal peptide. In <italic>A. rubens</italic> there are also two predicted isoforms of RXFP/LGR3 (isoform X1&#x02009;=&#x02009;XP_033631987.1; 836 residues; isoform X2&#x02009;=&#x02009;XP_033631990.1; 817 residues), but with alternative splicing predicted to give rise to transcripts encoding proteins that differ in their C-terminal regions, but which are otherwise identical. Interestingly, ArubRXFP/LGR3 differs from AsolRXFP/LGR3 in not having a predicted N-terminal signal peptide. However, analysis of the N-terminal region of ArubRXFP/LGR3 revealed the presence of a predicted membrane-spanning domain, and analysis of this region of the protein using SignalP revealed that it has the structural characteristics of a signal peptide. Therefore, unlike AsolRXFP/LGR3, which has a typical N-terminal signal peptide, we infer that the putative membrane spanning region proximal to the N-terminus in ArubRXFP/LGR3 may function as an internal signal peptide (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>; Additional file 4: Fig. S4).

Therefore, we examined the sequence of the N-terminal region of O. <italic>fusiformis</italic> LGR3 in more detail and, importantly, we discovered that consistent with our findings for ArubRXFP/LGR3, there is a predicted internal signal peptide in this receptor (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>).</p><p id="Par67">Turning now to LGR4-type proteins in starfish, there are two predicted isoforms in <italic>A. </italic>cf.<italic> solaris</italic> (isoform X1&#x02009;=&#x02009;XP_022100793.1, 938 residues; isoform X2&#x02009;=&#x02009;XP_022100794.1 888 residues) and three predicted isoforms in <italic>A. rubens</italic> (isoform X1&#x02009;=&#x02009;XP_033635728.1, 905 residues; isoform X2&#x02009;=&#x02009;XP_033635729.1, 884 residues; isoform X3&#x02009;=&#x02009;XP_033635731.1, 864 residues).

However, a distinctive feature of the extracellular N-terminal region of type C leucine-rich repeat GPCRs, which is not present in type A and type B receptors, is a low-density lipoprotein receptor class A (LDLa) module.

Furthermore, a relaxin-type peptide has also been shown to exhibit gonadotropic activity in sea cucumbers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], indicating that this is an ancient and conserved role of relaxin-type peptides in the phylum Echinodermata. Interestingly, analysis of transcriptome sequence data has revealed the occurrence of a second relaxin-like peptide (RLP2) in starfish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] and recently it was reported that RLP2 also triggers spawning in the starfish species <italic>P. pectinifera</italic> and <italic>A. rubens</italic>. Therefore, RGP and RLP2 are now referred to as RGP1 and RGP2 (Mita et al., 2023). Accordingly, in this study, we show that both RGP1 and RGP2 trigger the shedding of mature eggs from the ovaries of the starfish <italic>A. </italic>cf.<italic> solaris</italic> when tested in vitro. Informed by these findings, the aims of this study were to investigate relationships of RGP1 and RGP2 with relaxin/insulin-type peptides in other taxa to gain insights into the evolution of these gonadotropic peptides and to identify the receptor or receptors that mediate their effects in starfish.</p><sec id="Sec11"><title>Identification of RXFP/LGR3 as a receptor for RGP1 and RGP2 in starfish</title><p id="Par76">Phylogenetic and cluster analysis of sequence data revealed that RGP1 and RGP2 belong to the family of relaxin-type peptides that include vertebrate relaxins, relaxin-like peptides in other echinoderms, and relaxin-like peptides in several protostome taxa, including the <italic>Drosophila</italic> peptide Dilp8. Therefore, it can be inferred that the evolutionary history of relaxin-type peptides can be traced back to an urbilaterian common ancestor of protostomes and deuterostomes. Closely related to the relaxin-type family of peptides is the insulin-like peptide 7 family (<italic>Drosophila</italic> Dilp7-type), which is found in several protostome taxa, echinoderms, and hemichordates, but not in chordates. Hence, it can be inferred that the origin of this family can also be traced back to an urbilaterian common ancestor of protostomes and deuterostomes, but with loss in chordates. Consistent with phylogenetic analysis, relaxin/Dilp8-type precursor genes and Dilp7-type precursor genes can be distinguished based on their exon/intron structure. Thus, whilst genes encoding both precursor types have a conserved phase 1 intron that interrupts the coding sequence of the C-chain domain, genes encoding Dilp7-type precursors also have a conserved phase 2 intron between the signal peptide and B-chain encoding regions of the genes. Furthermore, the occurrence of two or more genes encoding relaxin-type peptides in starfish and other taxa indicates that lineage-specific gene duplication has given rise to these paralogs. However, precise determination of the timing of these gene duplications will require analysis of sequence data from a wider range of taxa than currently available.</p><p id="Par77">Identification of starfish RGP1 and RGP2 as relaxin/Dilp8-type peptides provided a basis for the identification of candidate receptor(s) for these peptides. Relaxin-type peptides in vertebrates exert their effects by binding to two distinctly different families of GPCRs. Firstly, RXFP1/2-type receptors, which are leucine-rich repeat type GPCRs, and secondly RXFP3/4-type receptors, which belong to a different family of GPCRs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Analysis of starfish transcriptome/genome sequence data revealed the presence of genes encoding homologs of RXFP1/2-type receptors, but not RXFP3/4-type receptors. Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis revealed that starfish and other echinoderms have two leucine-rich repeat-type GPCRs that are closely related to vertebrate RXFP1/2-type receptors. Firstly, a GPCR that is an ortholog of vertebrate RXFP1/2-type receptors and the <italic>Drosophila</italic> leucine-rich repeat type GPCR known as LGR3 and therefore we refer to this receptor as RXFP/LGR3 (i.e., AsolRXFP/LGR3 in <italic>A. </italic>cf.<italic> solaris</italic> and ArubRXFP/LGR3 in <italic>A. rubens</italic>). Secondly, a receptor that is an ortholog of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> leucine-rich repeat type GPCR known as LGR4 and which we therefore refer to as LGR4 (i.e., AsolLGR4 in <italic>A. </italic>cf.<italic> solaris</italic> and ArubLGR4 in <italic>A. rubens</italic>).</p><p id="Par78">Importantly, consistent with the orthology of vertebrate RXFP1/2-type receptors and <italic>Drosophila</italic> LGR3, experimental studies have demonstrated that the <italic>Drosophila</italic> insulin-like peptide Dilp8 acts as a ligand for LGR3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. This suggests that relaxin/Dilp8-type peptides have co-evolved with cognate RXFP/LGR3-type receptors. It is noteworthy that our analysis of the phylogenetic distribution of relaxin/insulin/IGF-type precursors revealed that a clade containing precursors of starfish RGP1, starfish RGP2, vertebrate relaxins, and <italic>Drosophila</italic> Dilp8 also contains precursors of relaxin/insulin-like peptides from taxa in which we have not found RXFP/LGR3-type receptors, including nematodes, mollusks, and platyhelminthes. However, some of the precursors in the clade containing precursors of starfish RGP1, starfish RGP2, vertebrate relaxins, and <italic>Drosophila</italic> Dilp8 have long branches leading to them. Therefore, sequence divergence/convergence in these precursor proteins may explain this mismatch. With regard to LGR4-type receptors, indirect evidence that Dilp7 acts as a ligand for LGR4 in <italic>Drosophila</italic> has also been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Accordingly, our analysis of sequence data reveals good correspondence in the phylogenetic distribution of Dilp7-type precursors and LGR4-type proteins. Thus, genes encoding Dilp7-type precursors and LGR4-type receptors were found in several taxa, including echinoderms, hemichordates, arthropods, mollusks, annelids, nemerteans, but genes encoding Dilp7-type precursors and LGR4-type receptors were not found in chordates, nematodes, and platyhelminthes.</p><p id="Par79">Informed by experimental identification of relaxin/Dilp8-type peptides as ligands for RXFP/LGR3-type receptors in vertebrates and <italic>Drosophila</italic>, indirect experimental evidence that Dilp7 acts as a ligand for LGR4 in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and our analysis of the phylogenetic distribution of RXFP/LGR3-type receptors and LGR4-type receptors, we hypothesized that RGP1 and RGP2 may both act as ligands for the RXFP/LGR3-type receptor in starfish. It should be noted that alternative hypotheses regarding the receptors that mediate the effects of RGP-type peptides in echinoderms have been proposed previously. For example, it was proposed that RGP-type peptides may exert their effects by binding to a receptor tyrosine kinase-type protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. However, this hypothesis runs contrary to experimental findings that have demonstrated that the effects of RGP1 in starfish are mediated via G-protein signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. It has also been reported that in the starfish <italic>P. pectinifera</italic>, RGP1 acts as a ligand for a GPCR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] which, based on our phylogenetic analysis, is an LGR4-type receptor (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Therefore, to help resolve these conflicting hypotheses/findings, here we performed experiments in which RGP1 and RGP2 were tested as ligands for both the RXFP/LGR3-type and LGR4-type receptors in starfish. Importantly, we discovered that RGP1 and RGP2 act as ligands for RXFP/LGR3 in two starfish species&#x02014;<italic>A.</italic> cf. <italic>solaris</italic> and <italic>A. rubens</italic>. Furthermore, we also discovered that RGP1 and RGP2 do not act as ligands for LGR4 in these two starfish species. Thus, our findings are inconsistent with the previous study that reported that RGP1 acts as a ligand for <italic>P. pectinifera</italic> LGR4. How can this inconsistency be explained? An explanation may be found in differences in the experimental methods employed. For the experiments reported by Mita et al. (2020), Sfp cells were transfected using a baculovirus-based method where the open reading frame (ORF) of the human promiscuous G&#x003b1;q16 protein was subcloned into the <italic>Xba</italic>I site of the pFastbacI plasmid and the <italic>P. pectinifera</italic> LGR4-type receptor ORF was cloned into the <italic>Not</italic>I/<italic>Xba</italic>I site of the G&#x003b1;q16-ligated pFastbacI plasmid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Thus, with this method a chimeric protein comprising the <italic>P. pectinifera</italic> LGR4-type receptor N-terminally and the alpha subunit of Gq16 C-terminally was expressed in Sfp cells. Incorporation of the alpha subunit of Gq16 at the C-terminus of the receptor may alter the structure of the receptor in a way that enables the binding of peptides that do not act as ligands for the receptor physiologically. Furthermore, because the predicted ligands for LGR4-type receptors are the relaxin/insulin-like Dilp7-type peptides, promiscuous binding of the structurally related peptide RGP1 may have been facilitated by expression in cells of the chimeric LGR4-G&#x003b1;q16 proteins that do not occur naturally. Accordingly, it is noteworthy that activation of LGR4-G&#x003b1;q16 mediated signaling was only observed with relatively high concentrations of RGP1 and consequently it was not possible to determine an EC<sub>50</sub> for <italic>P. pectinifera</italic> RGP1 as a candidate ligand for <italic>P. pectinifera</italic> LGR4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Informed by the findings of our experiments in which starfish RXFP/LGR3 and LGR4 were tested without a C-terminally linked G-protein alpha subunit, we conclude that RXFP/LGR3, and not LGR4, acts as the receptor for RGP1 and RGP2 physiologically in starfish.</p><p id="Par80">It is noteworthy that both RGP1 and RGP2 exhibited lower potency when tested as ligands for RXFP/LGR3 in this study than when tested for gonadotropic activity in <italic>A.</italic> cf. <italic>solaris</italic> (this study) and in <italic>A. rubens</italic> and <italic>P. pectinifera</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. This may be a consequence of heterologous expression of starfish receptors in mammalian cells, where receptor coupling with G-proteins may be less effective than with native G-proteins in starfish tissue. Furthermore, when testing RGP1 and RGP2 as ligands for RXFP/LGR3 we also observed that RGP2 was less potent than RGP1, most notably with the <italic>A.</italic> cf. <italic>solaris</italic> receptor. The physiological significance of this finding remains to be determined because RGP1 and RGP2 appear to exhibit similar potency when tested for spawning activity in <italic>A.</italic> cf. <italic>solaris</italic> (this study) and in <italic>A. rubens</italic> and <italic>P. pectinifera</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. To address this issue in the future it would be interesting to knock down RXFP/LGR3 expression in starfish ovaries to investigate if this partially or completely abolishes responsiveness to RGP1 and/or RGP2 as gonadotropic peptides.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>The RXFP/LGR3-type receptor in the starfish <italic>A. rubens</italic> and the annelid <italic>O. fusiformis</italic> have an internal signal peptide</title><p id="Par81">Analysis of the sequences of RXFP/LGR3-type receptors in different taxa revealed differences with regard to the presence of an N-terminal signal peptide. Thus, the RXFP/LGR3-type receptors in <italic>A. cf. solaris</italic>, human (RXFP1 and RXFP2), and <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> have a methionine residue at the start of the predicted signal peptide and therefore it can be inferred that this residue is encoded by a start codon and the receptors have an N-terminal signal peptide. However, the predicted signal peptide sequence in <italic>A. rubens</italic> RXFP/LGR3 does not have an N-terminal methionine residue and therefore the receptor must have an internal signal peptide. Furthermore, this feature of RXFP/LGR3 in <italic>A. rubens</italic> is also seen in the annelid <italic>O. fusiformis</italic>.</p><p id="Par82">The occurrence of internal signal peptides has also been reported in other proteins, including receptors. For example, the receptor tyrosine kinase known as Sevenless (Sev), which is required for the specification of R7-type photoreceptor cells in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, has a signal peptide located sixty residues after the N-terminal methionine. Furthermore, evidence that cleavage of the N-terminal sixty residues and the internal signal peptide occurs during biosynthesis of the mature Sev protein was obtained [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. By way of comparison, the putative internal signal peptide in ArubRXFP/LGR3 is located sixty-five residues after the N-terminal methionine. Furthermore, we infer that cleavage of the N-terminal sixty-five residues and the internal signal peptide occurs during the biosynthesis of ArubRXFP/LGR3. Evidence in support of this hypothesis is provided by our observation that replacement of the N-terminal eighty-seven residues of ArubRXFP/LGR3 (including the putative internal signal peptide) with the signal peptide of the human prolactin precursor yields a protein that is functional as a receptor for RGP1 and RGP2. It remains to be determined why internal signal peptides have evolved in some proteins. Our discovery that RXFP/LGR3-type receptors have an N-terminal signal peptide in some taxa (<italic>A. </italic>cf.<italic> solaris</italic>, human, and <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>) and an internal signal peptide in other taxa (<italic>A. rubens</italic>, <italic>O. fusiformis</italic>) may provide&#x000a0;a basis for further investigation of this issue.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Evolution and comparative physiology of relaxin-type signaling as a regulator of reproductive processes</title><p id="Par83">Ever since the seminal discovery of relaxin as a relaxant of the interpubic ligament in mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], the relaxin family of peptides has been linked with reproductive physiology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Although subsequent studies have also revealed non-reproductive associated functions of relaxins in mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], it is reproductive physiology that relaxins are mostly strongly associated with. This notion has been strengthened by the discovery and functional characterization of relaxin-type peptides in invertebrates. Thus, it was the identification of RGP (RGP1) as a gonadotropic neuropeptide in starfish that provided the first evidence that relaxin-type peptides are evolutionarily ancient regulators of reproductive processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Evidence that this conserved function also extends beyond deuterostomes to protostomes has been provided by functional characterization of the Dilp8-LGR3 signaling system in adult <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Dilp8 is expressed at high levels in the ovaries of adult female <italic>Drosophila</italic> and activation of LGR3-expressing neurons in the abdominal ganglion of females inhibits receptivity to male courtship and reduces female fecundity. Thus, it is hypothesized that the ovaries release Dilp8 to signal their physiological state via LGR3-expressing neurons, which then regulate female reproductive behavior accordingly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Furthermore, detailed analysis of <italic>Drosophila</italic> ovaries has revealed that Dilp8 is expressed in follicle cells that surround mature eggs and knockdown of Dilp8 expression in follicle cells causes a reduction in egg-laying. Accordingly, it is proposed that the release of Dilp8 by follicle cells acts locally to trigger LGR3-mediated follicle cell rupture, whilst also acting systemically via LGR3-expressing abdominal motor neurons to stimulate oviduct contractions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p id="Par84">In the context of what has been discovered about the role of Dilp8-LGR3 signaling in regulating reproductive processes in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, it is of interest to make comparisons with the RGP1&#x00026;2-RXFP/LGR3 signaling system that we have discovered here in starfish. Immunohistochemical analysis of RGP1 has revealed a widespread pattern of expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], which contrasts with the much more restricted expression of Dilp8 in <italic>Drosophila</italic> ovarian follicle cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. However, it has been proposed that it is the gonoducts that are the physiological source of RGP1 that triggers spawning in starfish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Furthermore, RGP1 exerts its gonadotropic effect in starfish by binding to receptors on ovarian follicle cells, which triggers 1-methyladenine-mediated germinal vesicle breakdown in oocytes and spawning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Thus, it is proposed that relaxin-type signaling within the reproductive system of <italic>Drosophila</italic> and starfish stimulates egg-laying and oocyte spawning, respectively, providing evidence of an evolutionarily conserved role in the regulation of reproductive processes.

Then to enable a broader analysis of the relationship of these proteins with related GPCRs in other starfish and in other bilaterian taxa, tBLASTn analysis of GenBank nucleotide sequence data was performed to generate a database of sequences of proteins belonging to the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) containing family of GPCRs (LGRs). In addition, locally installed BLAST was used for analysis of the genome sequence of the annelid <italic>Owenia fusiformis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].

All four receptors have seven predicted transmembrane domains, as expected for G-protein coupled receptors. The predicted extracellular N-terminal region of the receptors contain several predicted glycosylation sites (green), a low-density lipoprotein receptor class A (LDLa, yellow) module and leucine-rich repeats (LRRs, blue), which are a characteristic feature of leucine-rich repeat type G-protein coupled receptors. However, a key difference between the receptors is the position of the predicted signal peptide (red), which in A. solRXFP/LGR3, AsolLGR4 and ArubLGR4 is located at the N-terminus of the protein, whilst in ArubRXFP/LGR3 it is located internally and with a valine residue located at the start of the predicted signal peptide.
