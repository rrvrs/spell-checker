Introduction</title><p>Soybean (<italic toggle="yes">Glycine max</italic>) is one of the most economically important crops worldwide. Herbivorous pests are damaging and limit yields in soybean. Several insect pests are known as the major defoliator for soybean yield losses [<xref rid="B1-plants-14-00617" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The other important herbivorous pest is white-tailed deer (<italic toggle="yes">Odocoileus virginianus</italic>), causing extensive damage in terms of yield losses in soybean in the Americas [<xref rid="B2-plants-14-00617" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-plants-14-00617" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Effective strategies exist to manage damage from insect pests, but these options may not be sustainable and can result in harm to both humans and the environment. Yet, effective management strategies against the white-tailed deer, an anomalous yet destructive pest to soybean in the Midwest, Midsouth, Northeast, and Southeast of the United States, do not exist. Soybean farmers go to great lengths to protect their crops from herbivores, but pest control can be expensive, labor intensive, ineffective, dangerous, or lead to unintended consequences [<xref rid="B4-plants-14-00617" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-plants-14-00617" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-plants-14-00617" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Soybean yield loss due to deer damage is also costly, with one model based on indemnity payments estimating that wildlife damage in the United States caused approximately USD 323.9 million in 2018 alone [<xref rid="B2-plants-14-00617" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Another study examining wildlife damage indemnity payments in soybean for the past two decades indicated that this problem is increasing, likely because of the loss of habitat and food sources [<xref rid="B2-plants-14-00617" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-plants-14-00617" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In 2011, wildlife damage indemnity payments for soybean crops in Missouri, Kentucky, Arkansas, Tennessee, Mississippi, Alabama, and Georgia was USD 1 million. In 2022, payments had increased to USD 4.8 million. The wildlife damage reported in these indemnity payments is almost entirely from white-tailed deer, with some damage also resulting from wild hogs [<xref rid="B3-plants-14-00617" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Furthermore, higher rates of deer defoliation have been shown to correlate with increased amounts of herbivorous insects, as well as allowing light to reach the soil, which increases weed pressure, in turn negatively impacting yield [<xref rid="B2-plants-14-00617" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B7-plants-14-00617" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The significance of this yield loss is a two-fold economic burden on soybean farmers, as both herbivore damage and strategies to address damage are multimillion-dollar issues.</p><p>While foliar insecticides can be effective in reducing insect herbivory, they can also affect the environment in unintended ways, such as leaching into water and soil, as well as causing harm to non-target organisms [<xref rid="B4-plants-14-00617" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. An incorporated plant protectant could mitigate these off-target effects caused by insecticides. Soybean that has been genetically engineered to express <italic toggle="yes">Bacillus thuringiensis</italic> (Bt) toxins [<xref rid="B8-plants-14-00617" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] could offer more direct protection, but due to its highly specific mode of action, there is a greater risk for insects to evolve a resistance [<xref rid="B9-plants-14-00617" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Strategies to mitigate deer damage also have several downsides, foremost being that they are generally ineffective. Common methods of control include depredation hunting, fencing, herbivory deterrent compounds (e.g., blood, urine, putrid egg solids), and optical deterrents [<xref rid="B10-plants-14-00617" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-plants-14-00617" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-plants-14-00617" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-plants-14-00617" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Depredation hunting is often qualitative and does not ensure that populations are reduced below the biological carrying capacity. This leads to unstable fluctuations in deer numbers, which puts further strain on crops as a food source [<xref rid="B14-plants-14-00617" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Herbivory-deterrent compound repellents may be considered hazardous or unsanitary to humans and require reapplication as they break down in the environment. Optical deterrents are also still used in many farms [<xref rid="B12-plants-14-00617" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], but deer deterrent technology may finally progress to the level of other modern pest-deterrence strategies in other major crops.</p><p>Because deer are adaptable and intelligent animals, each of these solutions is only effective in the short term, if at all. Deer feed by preference, consuming all the most nutritious food available before moving on to their second choice. Their natural food sources consist mostly of browsing young twigs, leaves, and forbs that grow at the edge of forested areas [<xref rid="B14-plants-14-00617" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-plants-14-00617" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In the absence of an ecosystem that can provide enough of this preferred forage, deer readily will consume row crops which are accessible and meet their energy requirements, such as wheat or soybean [<xref rid="B16-plants-14-00617" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. If a source of forage has antinutritional or toxic aspects, deer will strive to keep their intake of that forage below the threshold of toxicity [<xref rid="B17-plants-14-00617" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Deer require a diet high in easily digestible protein [<xref rid="B18-plants-14-00617" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], which also makes crop plants an apt feed. In many agroecosystems, soybean, wheat, or other crops are the optimal source of nutrients, and can compose over three-fourths of deer&#x02019;s diets [<xref rid="B16-plants-14-00617" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Deer are highly selective in the balance of their diets, carefully maximizing nutrients and minimizing toxins. Deer optimize their feeding efficiency by remembering and continuously seeking nutritionally preferable forage in the environment. Consequently, deer also identify nutritionally poor and unsuitable forage, and avoid their consumption, as well as the areas where they are located [<xref rid="B18-plants-14-00617" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>One promising candidate incorporating a broad range of plant protectants for soybean are plant proteinase inhibitors. Proteinase inhibitors prevent the digestion of protein and deplete the supply of digestive enzymes in an animal&#x02019;s gut [<xref rid="B19-plants-14-00617" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Soybean, along with many other plant species, naturally contain proteinase inhibitors as an herbivory defense mechanism but are mainly concentrated in reproductive tissues, e.g., seeds and tubers [<xref rid="B20-plants-14-00617" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-plants-14-00617" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-plants-14-00617" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. One important class of proteinase inhibitors are trypsin inhibitors (TIs). TIs have been thoroughly studied as an incorporated crop protectant against insects, and their effects are largely anti-nutritional instead of abiotic, although they significantly reduce pest damage to transgenic host plants [<xref rid="B23-plants-14-00617" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24-plants-14-00617" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-plants-14-00617" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>We previously investigated the functional role of soybean TIs in plant defense against insects by the overexpression of several individual TI genes in soybean using detached leaf-punch feeding bioassay and whole soybean plant feeding bioassay under greenhouse conditions. We showed a significantly reduced leaf defoliation in the transgenic compared to non-transgenic plants [<xref rid="B26-plants-14-00617" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. However, experiments conducted under such conditions cannot predict how the plants might perform in the field. Assessing agronomic performance in the field is a necessary validation step for genetically engineered plants as greenhouse observations are not always predictive of field performance.</p><p>For that, in the present study, four promising TI-overexpressing transgenic lines from our greenhouse study [<xref rid="B26-plants-14-00617" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] were selected for further analysis under the field conditions in Knoxville, Tennessee. We further examined the potential of these TI-overexpressing lines against the white-tailed deer in a separate field experiment at Jackson, Tennessee. We also performed controlled feeding assays with tame deer to more directly study behavior and quantify animal feeding preferences.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec2-plants-14-00617"><title>2.

Discussion</title><p>Soybean is an important crop in agricultural production where pest damage limits yields in soybean. There has been interest in incorporating trypsin inhibitors (TIs) as the plant protectant against herbivory pest [<xref rid="B23-plants-14-00617" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24-plants-14-00617" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-plants-14-00617" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In the present study, we evaluated the field performance of four TI-overexpressing soybean lines selected from our previous greenhouse study [<xref rid="B26-plants-14-00617" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] against insects and white-tailed deer.</p><sec id="sec3dot1-plants-14-00617"><title>3.1. Ambient Insect Herbivory Field Trial</title><p>Field experiments are especially important for modified plants to ensure that the agronomic performance is not compromised by their genetic modifications. Our field study revealed consistencies in growth phenotypes between greenhouse [<xref rid="B26-plants-14-00617" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and field-grown transgenic lines. These results are congruent with our previous study, where the growth parameters of these lines were determined under greenhouse conditions, suggesting there is no significant environmental influence on the growth of TI-overexpressing transgenic soybean lines. Furthermore, the herbivorous insect species observed in our population surveys were consistent with the common insects that cause soybean yield loss [<xref rid="B27-plants-14-00617" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28-plants-14-00617" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B29-plants-14-00617" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B30-plants-14-00617" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B31-plants-14-00617" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><p>Two of the transgenic lines (35S-KTi7 and GTP-KTi7) showed a significant reduction in defoliation compared to wild-type soybean. Yet, the overall defoliation observed at this field site was low and below the economic threshold for yield loss [<xref rid="B32-plants-14-00617" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Distinctly low defoliation in both transgenic and wild-type lines may indicate that there may have been other ecological interactions responsible for reducing defoliation throughout the entire field for the following reasons. The large fallow region required in the USDA APHIS BRS environmental release permit may have also hindered insect movement into the field, as the total areas of the fallow zone was wider than the field dimensions on all sides. The fallow region was also kept free of any plants or ground cover and mainly consisted of bare soil. However, the insect population surveys confirmed the consistent presence of common soybean insect pests throughout the growing season, suggesting that there may be an ecological explanation for the low defoliation observed across all lines. This notion is supported by the consistent presence of notable predatory insect species. A population of four to five gray treefrogs (<italic toggle="yes">Hyla chrysoscelis</italic>) were observed in each of the four insect population surveys. Other predatory species such as assassin bugs (<italic toggle="yes">Reduviidae</italic> spp.), ladybugs, (<italic toggle="yes">Coccinellidae</italic> spp.), and spiders including jumping spiders (<italic toggle="yes">Salticidae</italic> spp.), crab spiders (<italic toggle="yes">Thomisidae</italic> spp.), and lynx spiders (<italic toggle="yes">Oxyopidae</italic> spp.) were also observed in multiple insect population surveys. The consistent presence of predatory species may partially explain the low levels of defoliation across transgenic and wild-type lines. Foliar pesticides increase the mortality of both pest and predator species. Moreover, after predatory species are lost in an agroecosystem, fecund pest populations can rapidly repopulate [<xref rid="B33-plants-14-00617" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The diversity of predatory species provides the compounded biocontrol of insect pests, which can result in yield protection [<xref rid="B34-plants-14-00617" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The overexpression of TI genes in soybean has shown a significant reduction in lepidopteran larval weight and delay development in insect feeding bioassays but does not usually lead to insect mortality [<xref rid="B24-plants-14-00617" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-plants-14-00617" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-plants-14-00617" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B35-plants-14-00617" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Crops containing antinutrients that hinder digestion and impede the development of herbivorous insects, leaving them in lifecycle stages that are vulnerable to predators for longer periods of time, potentially increasing their risk of becoming prey [<xref rid="B36-plants-14-00617" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="B37-plants-14-00617" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="B38-plants-14-00617" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Transgenic TI-overexpressing soybean could reduce insect herbivory in field conditions, not only by deterring feeding and weakening pest insects, but also by retaining conditions that support predatory species. This potential multi-level interaction would need to be examined in further research. Transgenic TI-overexpressing soybean may provide protection from insect herbivores in sensitive ecosystems. Unlike foliar insecticides that can result in harm to off-target organisms [<xref rid="B4-plants-14-00617" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], transgenic TI-overexpressing soybean would only affect insects that are actively engaging in herbivory. These transgenic soybean would be well suited for fields located near aquatic ecosystems such as wetlands, rivers, and lakes [<xref rid="B39-plants-14-00617" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. In this setting, transgenic TI-overexpressing soybean could significantly reduce defoliation by insect pests without harmful off-target effects to aquatic ecosystems associated with the application of foliar insecticide sprays [<xref rid="B4-plants-14-00617" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B33-plants-14-00617" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot2-plants-14-00617"><title>3.2. Ambient Deer Herbivory Field Trial</title><p>Deer feeding behavior detected in the field was consistent with the literature. The majority of herbivory was observed within the first two weeks after plant emergence, and leveled off as the plants matured, as established by deCalesta [<xref rid="B15-plants-14-00617" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Deer readily and repeatedly consumed transgenic TI-overexpressing lines. One explanation for this continued consumption is the category of deterrent that TIs exert on herbivores. TIs are considered a conditioned-aversion repellent, which causes feelings of illness, digestive discomfort, and post-consumption malaise [<xref rid="B13-plants-14-00617" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Avoidance behavior is learned by association of sickness or malaise after consumption of the plants, which may take multiple instances of feeding [<xref rid="B13-plants-14-00617" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. This explanation would be congruent with the two instances of early-season herbivory by a group of females (does) followed by a lack of deer activity recorded on the game cameras. This behavior may represent deer learning the effects of the transgenic soybean and avoiding it for the rest of the growing season. However, because the deer did not differentiate between plots, this potential avoidance behavior is not reflected in the data. The deer likely did not experience the deterrent effects of the TI overexpression quickly enough to potentially learn the difference between transgenic and wild-type lines.</p><p>Also, the location of the plots in the field was more distinctly related to the percentage of plants defoliated by deer. Blocks one and eight were located at the outer edges of the field, where deer damage is known to be highest [<xref rid="B15-plants-14-00617" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The only notable difference in deer feeding behavior on soybean in this field site was the lack of stand loss. Stand loss occurs when deer defoliate the entire shoot portion of a young soybean plant, leaving only a short section of hypocotyl. This form of herbivory is fatal to individual soybean plants, and is the main cause of yield loss from deer damage [<xref rid="B15-plants-14-00617" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Young soybean plants can partially recover from defoliation above the cotyledonary nodes, which usually results in stunted growth, delayed maturity timing, and lower yield [<xref rid="B40-plants-14-00617" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Soybean stand loss from deer damage has been consistently observed at this field site in recent years, but did not occur during this experiment.</p><p>Furthermore, perhaps a different field design is needed for studying the potential of TIs as a deer deterrent. Randomized block designs are a standard method for examining insect herbivory on multiple lines of transgenic crops compared to nontransgenic crops in field conditions [<xref rid="B41-plants-14-00617" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="B42-plants-14-00617" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="B43-plants-14-00617" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Randomized block designs have also been used in field trials to quantify deer herbivory and preference between forage options [<xref rid="B13-plants-14-00617" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B17-plants-14-00617" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B44-plants-14-00617" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. However, because of the high similarity of the transgenic lines, delayed mode of action for deterrence, and overall low percentage of nontransgenic soybean in the field trial (one-fifth of total plants), deer may not have been able to differentiate between the effects of transgenic and nontransgenic soybean in a randomized block design.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot3-plants-14-00617"><title>3.3. Controlled Deer Feeding Trials</title><p>Out of the five-day trials, on average, deer consumed more wild-type than transgenic soybean leaf material. However, on day four, the average transgenic soybean consumed was nearly quadruple that of the wild type. No abnormal conditions or behaviors were observed on day four of the feeding trial that would explain this reversal in trend. A second feeding trial was performed to ascertain whether the behavior observed in the first feeding trial reflected a pattern that was disturbed by an unknown factor. The second feeding trial ascertained that the feeding behavior observed in the first trial was representative and would likely be observed in any further repetitions of this experiment. During the second feeding trial, the deer consumed more wild-type than transgenic soybean on three of the five days, and more transgenic soybean on two of the five days. The total amount of each option consumed during each day was more consistent during the second trial compared to the first trial. No clear preference between transgenic and wild type soybean could be discerned from the total amount of each option consumed per day in the feeding trials. Deer readily and repeatedly consumed transgenic soybean leaf materials in both feeding trials. Perhaps the simple two-option controlled feeding study could not be well adjusted to represent the deer damage in an agronomic field setting.</p><p>Moreover, live plants may have better reflected deer feeding behavior to TI-overexpressing soybean opposed to frozen and thawed leaves (as required to devitalize transgenic plants). A longer trial period in an environment that the deer are more accustomed to may also yield more accurate behavioral results.</p><p>Yet, despite the lack of significant impacts, the controlled deer feeding assays may have potential to be used as prescreening for plant protectants before developing transgenic plants. In these assays, wild-type soybean treated with a potential deterrent could be examined for the deterrent&#x02019;s efficacy before attempting the genetic transformation of plants. These assays could also be used to determine the necessary concentration of the deterrent or examine the additive effects of multiple deterrent compounds acting together. Controlled deer feeding studies also allow the close monitoring of animals to assess behavioral changes in response to deterrents.</p><p>In conclusion, we showed that the overexpression of TI could lead to improved insect resistance in soybean without negatively impacting plant growth and yield under field conditions. We further examined the potential against deer herbivory in a field setting as well as under controlled feeding experiments. Despite the lack of significant impacts on deer herbivory, our results could represent useful progress towards the development of transgenic crops with incorporated protectants for deer deterrence. Further research on TIs enhance our understanding of the factors associated with reducing pest herbivory damage.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec4-plants-14-00617"><title>4.

Insect Herbivory Quantification</title><p>To confirm and quantify insect pest damage in the field, two approaches were used. Defoliation ratings were used to score insect damage to plants, and insect population surveys were used to confirm the presence of common soybean pests. Defoliation ratings were taken on three time points: 13 July 2023, 1 August 2023, and 15 August 2023. Each plant was visually scored by selecting a representative leaf from the top, middle, and bottom of the plant. The most and least defoliated leaves were not considered, and the remaining leaf was used for rating. The defoliation rating was determined using a reference sheet with the leaf area removed quantified as a percentage. The reference sheet was generated with ImageJ2 and specific to soybean [<xref rid="B46-plants-14-00617" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. The mean of the defoliation measurements for each line across the three measurement time points was determined. Data were analyzed using an ANOVA and log transformed to meet normalcy assumptions with a Dunnett post hoc test. Population surveys were performed on four time points: 7 July 2023, 8 August 2023, 22 August 2023, and 5 September 2023. The top and bottom of each leaf, petiole, and the stem were carefully observed on each plant, and the herbivorous insects were recorded.</p></sec><sec id="sec4dot2dot3-plants-14-00617"><title>4.2.3.

Field Design</title><p>The field experiment was conducted at the West Tennessee Research and Education Center (WTREC) Jackson, Tennessee (35.622250, &#x02212;88.850200) with a history of consistent and destructive deer herbivory to soybean during prior growing seasons. Deer had been observed to enter the field from the edge of the forest and browse plants throughout the entire field. The field trial was performed on an agronomic scale, with a planting density comparable to commercial farming. Homozygous T6 seeds of the transgenic and wild-type lines (<xref rid="plants-14-00617-t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>) were planted on 14 June 2024, in a randomized block design in eight replicate blocks. The field contained a total of 40 plots (<xref rid="plants-14-00617-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). Each individual plot measured 3.05 m by 9.14 m, and contained four rows of 240 seeds, planted at a density of twenty-four seeds per meter. Each plot contained a total of 960 plants.</p><p>The field was oriented with block one aligned to face the forest, block eight facing an open field, and the other two sides of the field facing cotton and corn (<xref rid="plants-14-00617-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). The field was bordered by a fifteen-foot fallow region as required in the USDA APHIS BRS environmental release permit. The field was treated with pre-emergent, herbicide, and plots were marked with stakes after emergence. All non-target pests were controlled following the University of Tennessee&#x02019;s recommendations. Two game cameras (Browning Spec Ops Elite HP5; Browning Trail Camera; Arnold, MI, USA) were placed on the outer edges of the field and set to capture ten-second videos when motion was detected for the duration of the experiment to observe the deer feeding behavior. Plants were allowed to reach full maturity in the field and then each plot was harvested mechanically. The total weight of seeds from each plot was determined.</p></sec><sec id="sec4dot3dot2-plants-14-00617"><title>4.3.2. Data Collection</title><p>Deer defoliation was measured twice during the growing season: on 28 June 2024, two weeks after planting, and on 8 July 2024, approximately three weeks after planting. Deer predation was measured by counting the number of emerged soybean plants that were defoliated per six-meter row in each plot. Deer feeding in the early stages of soybean growth is visually distinct (<xref rid="plants-14-00617-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>) and can be easily identified.

Cafeteria-style trials were carried out with tame deer that were presented a choice between transgenic (35S-KTi7) and wild-type lines. Cafeteria-style trials involve presenting animals with free access to a variety of food options in order to observe and quantify preference. A total of two feeding trials were performed following the same methods on 1&#x02013;5 July and 30 September&#x02013;4 October 2024.</p></sec><sec id="sec4dot4dot2-plants-14-00617"><title>4.4.2.

Once the sufficient plant mass was established (33 kg wild type and 27 kg transgenic soybean), the soybean plants were cut at the base and packed tightly into large sealable freezer bags, then flash frozen and devitalized using liquid nitrogen on 17 June and 29 August 2024. The freezer bags were then packed into Styrofoam coolers with dry ice and shipped overnight to the facility for the feeding trials.

Feeding Trial Design</title><p>A doubly repeated randomized block design was used. A total of ten deer participated in each feeding trial. The trials were conducted between 7:00 a.m. and 12:00 p.m., and hay/regular feed was removed between approximately 6:00 and 8:00 p.m. the night before each trial, allowing for twelve hours of fasting between each trial. The fasting period was included to encourage involvement and curiosity toward the soybean leaves. Hay/normal feed was replaced after each trial.</p></sec><sec id="sec4dot4dot4-plants-14-00617"><title>4.4.4. Acclimatization Phase</title><p>First, twelve tame deer participated in a three-day acclimation trial to select suitable subjects and familiarize the deer with the experimental procedure on 26&#x02013;28 June and 25&#x02013;27 September 2024. During this acclimation trial, the deer were presented with one pan containing 100 g of wild-type soybean for 90 min. At 30 min intervals, the pan was weighed, the amount of soybean consumed was recorded, and the pan was refilled to 100 g. After this three-day acclimation trial, the deer were given a two-day rest period in compliance with the animal use permit conditions. From the data collected in the acclimation trials, the ten tame deer that were the most amenable to experimental procedures were selected out of the original twelve for the choice trials. The deer that participated in the trials included nine females and one male, all one and a half years of age or older. After the two days of rest, the choice trials began.</p></sec><sec id="sec4dot4dot5-plants-14-00617"><title>4.4.5. Trial Implementation</title><p>The choice trials followed the same feed and fasting schedule as the acclimation trials and took place over five consecutive days. Each day, ten deer were presented with two pans of soybean: one pan containing 300 g of transgenic soybean and one pan containing 300 g of wild-type soybean for a 90 min period. At 30 min intervals, the pans were weighed, the amount consumed from each pan was recorded, and each pan was refilled to 300 g. The pans were refilled at 30 min intervals to ensure there would be a remainder for statistical analysis. Total reduction in soybean from each pan over the 90 min period was measured for each of the ten deer for the five consecutive days of the trials (<xref rid="plants-14-00617-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). The location of the pans in the stall was randomized each day to avoid any placement bias. Water loss from the plant material during the 30 min intervals was observed to be negligible in the raw data, as the weight of the leaves did not change from the beginning to the end of the interval if the deer not consume any soybean. During the second trial, the last of the three reduction measurements during the 90 min period were not recorded for deer W198 and Bambam on day four. The sum of the first two reduction measurements fell within the normal variation of the data, and thus was used for statistical analysis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec4dot5-plants-14-00617"><title>4.5.
