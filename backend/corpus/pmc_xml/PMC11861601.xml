This study investigated how the recombinant <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> Lon protease (rLon), which targets MYC in human cells, inhibits MYC over-activation in models of infection and cancer. In silico predictions identified specific peptide domains of bacterial Lon that target MYC and the affinity of these peptides for MYC was investigated by surface plasmon resonance. The N-terminal domain of rLon was shown to interact with the C-terminal, leucine zipper domain of MYC and MAX and to prevent MYC/MAX dimerization. Furthermore, rLon targeted and degraded c-MYC in vitro and in cellular models, through the peptidase domain. In a model of kidney infection, rLon treatment prevented, c-MYC, N-MYC and L-MYC over-expression, MYC-dependent gene expression, specifically renal toxicity genes and pathology, suggesting that rLon recognizes and corrects MYC dysregulation in this disease. The findings describe a multitarget mechanism of MYC inhibition by rLon, and the combined effects achieved by the Lon domains, targeting different MYC epitopes and MYC-dependent functions, with no evidence of toxicity or detrimental effects on homeostatic MYC expression.</p><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1038/s41598-025-88093-2.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Drug development</kwd><kwd>Experimental models of disease</kwd><kwd>Infectious diseases</kwd><kwd>Biotechnology</kwd><kwd>Computational biology and bioinformatics</kwd><kwd>Molecular biology</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Lund University</institution></funding-source></award-group><open-access><p>Open access funding provided by Lund University.</p></open-access></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer Nature Limited 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">The MYC transcription factors are master regulators of gene expression and tissue homeostasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>.

The resulting dimeric structures then underwent a sanity check in PyMOL and were ranked in terms of their interface predicted template modelling (ipTM) scores (Extended Data Fig. 2). The highest ipTM score was obtained for c-MYC aa residues 356&#x02013;439 interacting with the rLon NTD aa residues 191&#x02013;251 (ipTM&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.697).

In silico analysis predicted that rLon or the NTD peptide bind to the c-MYC-MAX binding site, thereby competitively inhibiting MYC/MAX hetero-dimerization.

Inhibition of MYC/MAX dimerization and DNA binding was further documented using an ELISA assay, where rLon, NTD as well as peptidase and AAA&#x02009;+&#x02009;domains showed inhibitory activity. The K<sub>D</sub> values obtained for NTD binding to full length c-MYC were below 1 &#x000b5;M, potentially lower than the small molecule inhibitor MYCMI-6 with a K<sub>D</sub>value of 1&#x02013;2 &#x000b5;M for the bHLH-LZ domain of c-MYC, which inhibited MYC/MAX dimerization (aa 354&#x02013;437)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>.

This study used the NTA Sensor Chip based binding assay to validate the alpha-fold predictions. Ni-NTA and the antibody based His-tag captures are used for immobilizing histidine-tagged proteins and offers distinct advantages particularly when conducting kinetic analyses that require regeneration of the surface between each concentration, performed in this manuscript. NTA Sensor Chips offer superior control over protein orientation and density by enabling uniform immobilization through the His-tag and allowing tunable density adjustments to minimize steric hindrance and non-specific interactions. In contrast, antibody-based capture can affect protein orientation and reduce assay reproducibility due to multiple conformations of antibody-protein complexes. However, NTA-based surfaces are susceptible to non-specific interactions and baseline increases are an inherent feature of the assay, as can be seen from the fitted curves. These interactions reduce specificity, and lower the signal-to-noise ratio, potentially affecting the accuracy of kinetic and affinity analyses.</p><p id="Par47">Despite the remarkable inhibition of MYC-dependent gene expression in rLon-treated, infected mice, there was no evidence that rLon treatment had a corresponding effect on <italic>Myc</italic>&#x000a0;expression in uninfected mice. rLon treatment did not adversely affect healthy mice, indicating that rLon treatment may target the disease response, potentially reducing the risk for off target effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>.

The cell without nickel loading served as a reference for nonspecific binding of proteins and chemicals. This method follows recommendations from senior scientists specializing in Biacore applications, which advise against using a Ni-charged surface without the His-tagged protein for control experiments. By employing a non-Ni-charged surface as the control, this approach ensures the accurate evaluation of specific interactions while minimizing the risk of non-specific binding, thereby preventing misleading results. Adhering to this protocol aligns with best practices and enhances the reliability of experimental outcomes. Biacore X100 control software was programmed to first prime the instrument with running buffer (0.1&#x000a0;M HEPES, 1.5&#x000a0;M NaCl, 0.03&#x000a0;M EDTA and 0.5% v/v Surfactant P20).
