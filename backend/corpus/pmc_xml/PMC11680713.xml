Well stimulation techniques, such as hydraulic fracturing and acidizing, have become indispensable tools in unlocking the potential of these tight formations. However, the effectiveness of these techniques can vary widely depending on the specific characteristics of the reservoir. In this context, a data-driven approach to assess well stimulation practices offers a promising avenue to optimize recovery processes and reduce uncertainties. This paper presents a comprehensive study that leverages the power of big data analytics and machine learning to analyze and improve well stimulation strategies in unconventional gas reservoirs. By systematically gathering and processing vast arrays of geological, operational, and production data, this study aims to identify patterns and correlations that can predict stimulation outcomes more accurately. The ultimate goal is to develop a robust framework that allows for tailored stimulation designs based on the unique properties of each reservoir, thereby maximizing efficiency and minimizing environmental impacts. This study introduces a new procedure for assessing well stimulation performance, which involves analyzing the EUR through Duong&#x02019;s model, calculating the key performance indicator of the treatment, and establishing a data-driven model to predict the treatment KPI.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Unconventional gas reservoirs</kwd><kwd>Stimulation</kwd><kwd>Data-driven</kwd><kwd>Geological data</kwd><kwd>Hydraulic fracturing</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Energy science and technology</kwd><kwd>Engineering</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer Nature Limited 2024</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par10">Unconventional gas reservoirs, characterized by their complex geologies and low permeabilities, require more advanced extraction techniques than conventional reservoirs to ensure economic viability and efficient gas production. Traditional extraction methods often fall short in these settings, making well stimulation techniques like hydraulic fracturing and acidizing crucial. These methods, however, exhibit varying degrees of effectiveness, heavily influenced by the geological characteristics of the reservoir<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par11">The literature on hydraulic fracturing reveals a significant focus on understanding the geomechanical properties of shale formations and their responses to stimulation techniques. According to Zhu et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>, the microseismic events during fracking provide insights into fracture spread and efficacy, suggesting optimization strategies for fracture propagation. Guo et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> emphasize the optimization of fracturing fluid viscosity to improve conductivity and fracture propagation. Bandara et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> explore the influence of proppant characteristics on fracture permeability, demonstrating significant variations in long-term production rates based on proppant selection. Zhao<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> discuss the role of pumping rates and pressures, noting that increased rates can expand fracture networks but also raise the risk of induced seismicity. Additionally, Zhang et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> highlight the importance of geological factors such as rock stiffness and in-situ stresses in dictating fracture behavior and effectiveness. Gong et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> investigate the impact of well orientation and depth on fracturing efficiency, illustrating that optimal alignment with stress fields can significantly affect production outcomes.</p><p id="Par12">Conversely, acidizing is a critical well stimulation technique used to enhance permeability and production in both conventional and unconventional reservoirs, particularly in carbonate and sandstone formations. Research in this domain focuses on the chemical interactions between acid solutions and rock matrices, optimizing acid composition to maximize the dissolution of minerals and the creation of conductive flow paths. For instance, Martyushev et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> explore the effectiveness of acid treatments in carbonate reservoirs, identifying optimal acid concentrations that balance rock dissolution with structural integrity preservation. Ali et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> investigates the role of acid type and concentration in sandstone formations, demonstrating how specific acid blends can reduce formation damage caused by fines migration. Jiang et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> discuss the integration of thermochemical reactions in acidizing processes to improve the depth and uniformity of penetration in high-temperature wells. Additionally, these studies collectively advance the understanding of acidizing as a nuanced stimulation technique that requires careful consideration of geological, chemical, and environmental factors to optimize performance and sustainability in hydrocarbon extraction.</p><p id="Par13">Recent advancements in big data analytics and machine learning have opened new avenues for optimizing well stimulation beyond traditional experimental and modeling approaches. Hsu et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> demonstrated the utility of machine learning in predicting fracture behavior from historical data sets, while Xiong et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> applied advanced analytics to optimize the composition and injection rates of fracturing fluids. This paper builds on these methodologies, proposing a comprehensive approach that synthesizes geological, operational, and production data to refine well stimulation strategies in unconventional gas reservoirs.</p><p id="Par14">The cornerstone of this study is the development of a robust framework for tailored well stimulation, which is critical for maximizing operational efficiency and minimizing environmental impacts. We introduce a novel procedure for assessing well stimulation performance, utilizing the Duong&#x02019;s model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. This model, augmented by machine learning techniques, enables the calculation of key performance indicators that predict treatment outcomes with greater accuracy. The literature underscores the importance of data-driven approaches in unconventional reservoir exploitation. Xiao et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> assert that the application of predictive analytics can significantly enhance the accuracy of stimulation outcome predictions. Moreover, Jankovi&#x00107; et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> discuss the environmental benefits of these approaches, demonstrating how optimized resource extraction processes can lead to reduced ecological footprints.</p><p id="Par15">In conclusion, this paper not only seeks to advance the technical understanding and application of well stimulation techniques in unconventional gas reservoirs but also aims to contribute to the broader discourse on sustainable energy production practices. By integrating empirical research with cutting-edge data analytics and machine learning, this study provides actionable insights into the optimization of resource extraction, ensuring both economic feasibility and environmental sustainability. This approach ultimately enables the design of more efficient and environmentally friendly stimulation strategies that are customized to the unique properties of each reservoir.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methodology</title><p id="Par16">This study&#x02019;s methodology assesses the stimulation performance using the fracturing wells in Xujiahe and acidizing wells in Carboniferous as an example.

In such reservoirs, the low permeability of the rock formation, combined with hydraulic fracturing, often leads to prolonged periods of transient flow before the reservoir reaches boundary-dominated conditions. Traditional models, such as Arps, are generally inadequate in these cases, as they assume an earlier onset of boundary-dominated flow, which can result in underestimating both production rates and the ultimate recovery.</p><p id="Par38">Duong&#x02019;s model addresses this limitation by incorporating a time-dependent exponent that adapts to the extended transient phase, making it more flexible and suitable for the unique production characteristics of tight formations. By capturing the gradual transition from transient to boundary-dominated flow, Duong&#x02019;s model provides a more accurate framework for predicting the EUR in unconventional reservoirs. This is particularly important in shale gas and tight gas plays, where long-term production forecasts are critical for assessing economic viability and optimizing field development strategies.</p><p id="Par39">In practice, Duong&#x02019;s model is widely used for decline curve analysis in these types of reservoirs because it aligns more closely with actual production data compared to traditional models.

The data reveals that most wells experience a 25% improvement in EUR post-stimulation, with some achieving increases up to 60%. However, some wells show a decrease in EUR following stimulation, which may be attributed to ineffective design or engineering failures. <fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>EUR improvement percentage of the acidized wells.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41598_2024_82454_Fig5_HTML" id="d33e810"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Data-driven stimulation performance prediction</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Stimulation performance modeling using machine learning</title><p id="Par48">To effectively analyze and predict the stimulation performance, a data-driven approach that leverages information from similar wells is more practical than relying solely on Estimated Ultimate Recovery (EUR) methods. This strategy starts with feature engineering to refine the dataset, ensuring that only the most relevant variables are included for analysis.</p><p id="Par49">An empirical Bayesian Network (BN) is then used for feature selection, focusing on stimulation performance. This network, which encompasses the entire dataset as depicted in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>, pinpoints the key features that significantly influence the predictive power concerning stimulation performance. Employing a Bayesian Network in this context facilitates a more efficient machine learning training process by isolating the most pertinent features for predicting stimulation performance. <fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><p>Bayesian Network of KPI of stimulation performance.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41598_2024_82454_Fig6_HTML" id="d33e828"/></fig></p><p id="Par51">Once the relevant features for predicting the KPI of stimulation performance are identified through the feature selection process, the focus shifts to training machine learning models. Previous studies have shown that for a complex process with high dimension data and relatively small data size, traditional machine learning models such as neural network and tree-based models suffers from overfitting problem<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. To overcome this limitation, a stacked model framework was adopted in this study. This approach involves a two-step process: training base models followed by training a meta model.</p><p id="Par52">Stacked modeling, or stacking, is a sophisticated ensemble technique where multiple predictive models, such as decision trees, support vector machines, or neural networks, are first trained on the same dataset to generate predictions. These predictions are then used as inputs for a second-level model, known as the meta model. This meta model, often simpler, like a linear regression, integrates these varied predictions. Its key role is to synthesize them into a final output, effectively smoothing out individual model biases and errors to enhance overall accuracy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. The procedure starts with the training of various base models using the dataset, where each model undergoes hyperparameter optimization via a Bayesian optimization algorithm. This step, aimed at maximizing the model&#x02019;s performance, is measured by a 10-fold cross-validation score, ensuring that each model is finely tuned to capture the underlying patterns and relationships in the data.</p><p id="Par53">After optimizing and training the base models, their predictions, along with the target variable from the training dataset, are used to train the meta model. This meta model, serving as the second layer in the stacked model architecture, is designed to learn how to optimally combine the predictions from the base models into a cohesive final prediction. This method not only leverages the strengths of each base model but also mitigates their individual weaknesses, enhancing the overall predictive accuracy. This modeling technique, illustrated in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>, utilizes the complementary capabilities of multiple machine learning models to achieve a high degree of accuracy in predicting stimulation performance. <fig id="Fig7"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption><p>Modeling process.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41598_2024_82454_Fig7_HTML" id="d33e855"/></fig></p><p id="Par55">Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> provides a comparative analysis of performance metrics for individual base models against the aggregated performance of the stacked model in predicting well stimulation performance. Notably, some base models, such as gradient boosting and the extra trees model, show strong training scores, which underscores their effectiveness at learning from the training dataset. However, these models also exhibit a significant performance drop on the testing dataset, suggesting a tendency to overfit. This is most likely caused by the limited data size of this study, which also justifies the adoption of staked model. <table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Base model and meta model performance comparison.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left">model</th><th align="left">Train <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup></th><th align="left">Test <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Random forest</td><td char="." align="char">0.86</td><td char="." align="char">0.47</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Lasso</td><td char="." align="char">0.41</td><td char="." align="char">0.33</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Gradient boosting</td><td char="." align="char">0.96</td><td char="." align="char">0.56</td></tr><tr><td align="left">XGBoost</td><td char="." align="char">0.95</td><td char="." align="char">0.59</td></tr><tr><td align="left">HistGB</td><td char="." align="char">0.91</td><td char="." align="char">0.55</td></tr><tr><td align="left">AdaBoost</td><td char="." align="char">0.77</td><td char="." align="char">0.46</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Extra tree</td><td char="." align="char">0.83</td><td char="." align="char">0.45</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Neural network</td><td char="." align="char">0.51</td><td char="." align="char">0.38</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Stacking regressor</td><td char="." align="char">0.96</td><td char="." align="char">0.60</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p id="Par57">In contrast, the stacked model surpasses the individual base models, achieving the highest scores on both training and testing datasets. This superior performance underscores the stacked model&#x02019;s ability to enhance overall predictive accuracy beyond the capabilities of any single model. By effectively combining predictions from various base models and mitigating their overfitting issues, the stacked model achieves a higher level of prediction accuracy and generalizability.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Sensitivity analysis of stimulation performance</title><p id="Par58">After completing the training phase for the models, the influence of different features on the predicted outcomes is evaluated. SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) and LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) analyses both offer valuable insights of the feature sensitivity. SHAP provides a global interpretation approach, attributing feature importance based on the cooperative game theory and ensuring consistency with the model output. It offers precise contributions of each feature to individual predictions, facilitating a deeper understanding of model behavior across the entire data set. LIME, on the other hand, focuses on local interpretability, approximating the predictions of the model locally around the prediction of interest. This method is particularly useful for explaining individual predictions but may vary depending on the locality and perturbations used. Since the aggregated global feature sensitivity is more meaningful in this study, SHAP is employed for the sensitivity analysis. This analysis is essential as it quantifies each feature&#x02019;s contribution to the target variable. The ranking of feature importance, as determined by their mean absolute Shapley values, is illustrated in Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref> and <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>. The mean absolute Shapley value of a feature indicates its average impact on the model&#x02019;s prediction, providing insights into which features are most influential. <fig id="Fig8"><label>Fig. 8</label><caption><p>Fractured well EUR model feature importance measured by the mean absolute Shapley value.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41598_2024_82454_Fig8_HTML" id="d33e968"/></fig><fig id="Fig9"><label>Fig. 9</label><caption><p>Acidized well EUR improvement percentage model feature importance measured by the mean absolute Shapley value.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41598_2024_82454_Fig9_HTML" id="d33e975"/></fig></p><p id="Par60">The analysis shows that certain features, such as proppant per meter, average pump rate, average porosity, and fracturing fluid per meter, are particularly impactful on the performance of hydraulic fracturing treatments, significantly outweighing other features. This distribution of feature importance aligns with the fundamental factors that dictate the EUR of a well, primarily the quantity and quality of the resources within the stimulated reservoir volume.</p><p id="Par61">Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref> focuses on the acidized wells, highlighting that the average pump rate, average pump pressure, porosity, and pressure are the most crucial features for the performance of acidizing.
