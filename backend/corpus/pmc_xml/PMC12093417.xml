Common etiologies include lichen sclerosus and iatrogenic causes such as traumatic catheterization and endoscopic instrumentation [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>While strictures involving the anterior urethra are relatively common, panurethral strictures pose significant challenges to urologists. The use of buccal mucosa in urethroplasty, first described by Humby in 1941 [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], gained popularity for this indication in the early 1990s. It is now considered the gold standard urethral substitute due to several advantages, including ease of harvesting and handling, resistance to infection, a thick epithelium and thin lamina propria that facilitate early inosculation, compatibility with moist environments, and reduced donor site morbidity compared to lip or lingual mucosa [<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>The use of preputial skin is preferable to other graft materials such as lingual or buccal mucosa, as it avoids the need for a secondary oral procedure and associated complications at the donor site, such as bleeding, difficulty in oral intake, prolonged healing time, and contractures. Single-stage procedures utilizing penile skin are now favored over traditional buccal mucosal grafting (BMG), which is associated with significant donor site morbidity [<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>In this study, we evaluate the outcomes of spiral preputial graft urethroplasty, as described by Kulkarni et al. [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], in a cohort of 15 patients with panurethral stricture disease.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>The study adhered to the guidelines outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki and received approval from the Institutional Ethics Committee - Bio Medical Research, Apollo Hospitals, Chennai (application number AMH-C-S-095/J 0-24). Case records of 15 patients who underwent preputial graft urethroplasty were selected for analysis. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients as part of the preoperative process. All procedures were performed by a single surgeon with extensive expertise in reconstructive urology, having performed over 250 urethroplasties annually. Data collected included patient age, etiology of stricture, history of previous urethroplasty, dorsal visual internal urethrotomy (DVIU), and dilatation. Preoperative assessments included uroflowmetry and maximal urine flow rate (Qmax), as well as the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF). The length and nature of strictures were determined by ascending urethrograms. Intraoperative parameters such as stricture length and operative time were also recorded. Postoperative data collected included hospital stay duration, duration of antibiotic therapy, duration of Foley catheter placement, date of catheter removal, uroflowmetry, and Qmax at the time of catheter removal, at 6 months, and at 1 year. IIEF scores post surgery, complications, and recurrence rates were also documented. The surgical technique followed was based on the previously described Kulkarni technique (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="FIG1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and Figure <xref rid="FIG2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).</p><fig position="anchor" fig-type="figure" id="FIG1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Prepucial graft quilted over the urethra</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="cureus-0017-00000082678-i01" position="float"/></fig><fig position="anchor" fig-type="figure" id="FIG2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Prepucial graft harvested and rolled over a plastic 10 cc syringe</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="cureus-0017-00000082678-i02" position="float"/></fig><p>Postoperative care and follow-up</p><p>Patients received intravenous antibiotics for 2 days postoperatively, followed by oral antibiotics for 28 days. Follow-up included scheduled clinical visits and uroflowmetry assessments. The first follow-up occurred on postoperative day 5 for perineal wound evaluation. The next follow-up, for catheter removal, was scheduled 30 days after surgery and included a uroflowmetry assessment. Subsequent follow-up visits were scheduled at 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year, during which both clinical evaluation and uroflowmetry were performed.</p><p>Definition of treatment success</p><p>Treatment success was defined as the absence of patient-reported symptoms along with a urinary flow rate exceeding 12 mL/sec. Patients with persistent symptoms, a Qmax below 12 mL/sec, or recurrent urinary tract infections were further evaluated with ascending urethrograms to confirm stricture recurrence.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>A total of 15 patients were included in this study (Table <xref rid="TAB1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).

Four patients (26.67%) had a history of prior urethroplasty, and in this subset, the use of a buccal graft was not considered. All 15 patients were chronic smokers and pan chewers, further limiting the suitability of buccal mucosal grafts.</p><p>Most surgeries (n=8) lasted between 150 and 200 minutes, with a mean operative time of 185 minutes (IQR: 170-195 minutes). Postoperative hospital stay was typically limited to just 2 days in most (n=14)&#x000a0;of the patients.</p><p>Preoperative Qmax was 4.99 &#x000b1; 1.70 mL/s. At the time of catheter removal, Qmax significantly improved to 19.37 &#x000b1; 4.16 mL/s. At the last follow-up, Qmax slightly declined to 17.37 &#x000b1; 5.03 mL/s but remained significantly higher than the preoperative values. The mean stricture length was 10.42 &#x000b1; 1.68 cm (IQR: 9-12 cm). The mean International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) score preoperatively was 21.21 &#x000b1; 3.45, which dropped to 16.71 &#x000b1; 3.15 postoperatively.&#x000a0;Minor complications (Clavien-Dindo Grade I) were observed in five patients (33.33%), including epididymo-orchitis, fever, penile edema, penile skin necrosis, and scrotal hematoma, each affecting one patient. No stricture recurrence was noted at the 1-year follow-up.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Management of panurethral strictures has been a conundrum for urologists over the decades. Challenges include deciding between single-stage versus staged procedures, availability of sufficient tissue for reconstruction, and the potential for associated complications [<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Several single-stage techniques have been described to address these complex strictures [<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The ingenious&#x000a0;Q-flap technique&#x000a0;described by Morey et al. utilizes a distal circumferential penile skin flap for reconstruction of panurethral strictures and is known for its long, vascularized pedicle. However, it is limited by prolonged operative time and complications such as scrotal hematoma, recurrent strictures, and, in rare cases, cerebrovascular accidents [<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>Preputial skin offers several advantages: it is thin, pliable, hairless, located close to the urethra, and provides adequate graft material for long-segment strictures. Moreover, it withstands prolonged exposure to urine better than other skin substitutes [<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Harvesting the preputial skin in a spiral shape was first described by Kulkarni et al. and allows the creation of longer grafts. This mucocutaneous graft, derived from a 5-cm-wide preputial skin strip, can be extended up to 20 cm when harvested in a helicoidal fashion. The technique improves anterior urethral exposure, reduces the risk of diverticulum formation, and avoids the oral complications associated with buccal mucosal grafts (BMG) [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Kulkarni also described a one-stage dorsal onlay BMG urethroplasty technique via a perineal incision. While this technique offers a high success rate and a reduced risk of fistula formation and hypospadiac meatus, it carries the risk of recurrence at the dual-graft anastomotic site, narrowing at the suture line, the requirement for healthy oral mucosa, and the burden of oral complications [<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Two patients in our study with previously failed BMG urethroplasty achieved good functional outcomes following spiral graft urethroplasty.</p><p>The results of spiral preputial graft urethroplasty in our cohort were consistent with the outcomes reported by Kulkarni et al. [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Although the operative time was slightly longer compared to other single-stage penile skin techniques [<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], the complication rate was lower, and the technique proved successful even in complex cases, including those with previous urethroplasty failure.</p><p>With newer and innovative robotic approaches for reconstruction gaining popularity in urology and reconstructive surgery, the exploration of alternative techniques such as the spiral preputial graft paves the way for future advancements in the field [<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].&#x000a0;</p><p>The limitations of our study include a small sample size and a relatively short follow-up duration. This limits the ability to assess late stricture recurrence, long-term graft contraction, and the effects on micturition and erectile function.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Preputial spiral graft urethroplasty is a safe and effective option for managing complex panurethral strictures, particularly in patients with prior failed surgeries or unsuitable oral mucosa. It offers adequate graft length, favorable tissue characteristics, and minimal donor-site morbidity. Our early results are encouraging, with good functional outcomes and low complication rates. Larger studies with long-term follow-up are needed to validate its wider applicability.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group content-type="conflict"><title>Disclosures</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Human subjects:</bold> Consent for treatment and open access publication was obtained or waived by all participants in this study.
