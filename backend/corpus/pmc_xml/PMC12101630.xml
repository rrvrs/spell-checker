AMR develops as bacteria evolve due to antimicrobial exposure. This evolutionary adaptation is hastened by the excessive or inappropriate use of antimicrobial drugs. Of particular interest, the rising trend of antimicrobial usage can also be seen clearly in Asian countries, even in Malaysia. As of 2021, a research in Malaysia has shown that the prevalence of antimicrobial use was 49% during the patients&#x02019; stay in the hospital [<xref rid="pone.0321551.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Increased antimicrobial use is correlated with the emergence of AMR as can be shown in a study in 2018. Resistance to specific antimicrobial drugs can increase when the consumption of those drugs passes a specific threshold [<xref rid="pone.0321551.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. This is of great concern as it can be seen that there is a lack of improvement shown within these years in the crucial area to fight against AMR. In fact, the antimicrobial prescription rate in the oncology setting was one of the highest with a proportion of 57.1% [<xref rid="pone.0321551.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] which leads back to the topic regarding the implementation and persistent development of antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) in the oncology setting.</p><p>In the context of rising AMR in Asian countries, the focus on oncology care within the broader discussion of AMS becomes even more critical. Oncology patients who undergo treatment like chemotherapy and radiation therapy have weakened immune systems making them highly susceptible to infections. Therefore, the wise use of antimicrobials in this setting is crucial for treating infection effectively and averting the emergence of resistance. This is significant as resistance can harm patient outcomes and limit treatment options.</p><p>Research conducted by the Asian Network for Surveillance of Resistant Pathogens (ANSORP) has demonstrated a high prevalence of erythromycin resistance across the region, with rates reaching 72.7%. In particular, China exhibited a resistance rate of 96.4%, followed by Taiwan at 84.9%, and Vietnam at 80.7% [<xref rid="pone.0321551.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. These infections caused by multidrug-resistant organisms (MDRO) are easily spreadable and can lead to treatment failure and subsequently, increased mortality and morbidity. Prolonged neutropenia further complicates the matter, as it predisposes cancer patients to infections, necessitating extended and repeated courses of broad-spectrum antibiotics, which is a leading cause of MDRO development [<xref rid="pone.0321551.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Besides, hospitalised cancer patients with multiple and recent antimicrobial exposures may have higher than necessary drug exposure values that can lead to drug toxicity instead.<sup>5</sup> Due to the high interpatient PK variability [<xref rid="pone.0321551.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) distribution of pathogens that further complicates antimicrobial dosing in oncology patients, tailored guidelines should be formulated in aid of treatment for this population to balance the risk and benefits of antimicrobial activity. Furthermore, failure in antibiotic treatment is correlated with increased risk of sepsis, mortality rate and healthcare cost. This is further complicated by the fact that chemotherapy may encourage microbial evolution and increased appearance of mutant bacteria in patients who have developed antibiotic resistance [<xref rid="pone.0321551.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. A study by Raheem et. al. in 2020 [<xref rid="pone.0321551.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] highlights the critical role of AMS adherence in managing AMR, showing that pharmacist-led AMS initiatives are particularly effective in reducing resistance rates, even in outpatient settings. This study underscores the importance of robust AMS practices in controlling the spread of MDROs and improving patient outcomes, further emphasizing the need for similar targeted AMS strategies in oncology care</p><p>Throughout the years, there has been limited research in evaluating pharmacist&#x02019;s knowledge and practices in AMS, especially in oncology care. For instance, a study done in 2021 by Mubarak et. al [<xref rid="pone.0321551.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. have discussed the implementation of AMS practices within hospital settings, and underscored the important contributions pharmacists make in optimizing antimicrobial use and preventing resistance. However, although these studies have explored the broader role of pharmacists in AMS implementation in hospital settings, they often fail to address the unique needs of oncology patients. This reflects a significant gap of how healthcare professionals deal with the complexities of antimicrobial management in oncology patients, and the importance of pharmacists&#x02019; involvement in determining the fine balance between the judicious and effective use of antimicrobials in managing patients&#x02019; infections and preserving oncological treatment outcomes. As drug experts, pharmacists would need to deal with the specific challenges of antimicrobial use in oncology settings which include issues such as drug-drug interactions (DDIs) and the emergence of MDRO which requires tailored and individualised approaches. On that account, further research is also necessary to explore pharmacists&#x02019; knowledge and practice regarding AMS in oncology to reduce AMR through timely clinical intervention and improve patient outcomes in the vulnerable population.</p><p>Up to date, there are no existing assessment tools that are designed particularly to evaluate the knowledge and practice of pharmacists towards AMS in oncology care. Thus, the aim of this study is to develop and evaluate a comprehensive tool evaluating pharmacists&#x02019; knowledge and practices towards AMS in oncology care, providing a better understanding of pharmacists&#x02019; contributions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Methodology</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Study design</title><p>A cross-sectional survey was selected as the instrument of choice to develop and validate the questionnaire assessing pharmacists&#x02019; knowledge and practice towards AMS in oncology care. This research design was utilised to effectively examine the knowledge and practice of health personnels and allowing validation and reliability studies to be done [<xref rid="pone.0321551.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The Knowledge and Practice of Antimicrobial Stewardship in Oncology Care Questionnaire (KP-AMS-OC-Q) consisted of two distinct phases. The first phase includes the generation of items through a rigorous examination of relevant literature, which is then reviewed by experts in a single round of the Delphi technique. The second phase of KP-AMS-OC-Q involves the evaluation of the psychometric properties of this questionnaire, in particular its factorability and reliability.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Study setting</title><p>This study is conducted in Malaysia, a nation in Southeast Asia where there is a high cancer incidence rate, with an estimation of 155,507 cancer cases occurring in the past 5 years [<xref rid="pone.0321551.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Besides, there is an increased AMR rate of penicillin, erythromycin and gentamicin towards Staphylococcus aureus when compared to 2022 according to the National Antibiotic Resistance Surveillance Report 2023 in Malaysia. Additionally, reports have indicated a rise in vancomycin resistance towards Enterococcus faecalis [<xref rid="pone.0321551.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Throughout the years, infections have grown to be the second leading cause of death among cancer patients [<xref rid="pone.0321551.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. This is further supported with research done by Zheng et al., demonstrating that the mortality rate of a cancer patient from deadly infection is three times higher than the normal population [<xref rid="pone.0321551.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Despite the severity of this issue, few studies have been conducted in Malaysia to evaluate the knowledge and practice of AMS among pharmacists [<xref rid="pone.0321551.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0321551.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. However, they are generally concentrated on hospital settings or comparisons among different hospitals without a specific focus on oncology care. Therefore, Malaysia is a suitable study location to conduct this research.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Study population</title><p>The study population comprised adult Malaysian individuals who are hospital pharmacists employed in the hospital sector. The exclusion criteria were carefully selected to omit those who are not registered as pharmacists, do not work as hospital pharmacists, are illiterate, or are non-Malaysian citizens. These criteria aimed to specifically assess the knowledge and practices of pharmacists regarding AMS in oncology settings found in hospitals. This approach allows the general applicability of study findings for identifying the gaps in pharmacists&#x02019; knowledge and practice in this sector.

Diving deeper into the oncology setting, the questionnaire is set out to review the pharmacists&#x02019; knowledge in infections and their management in oncology patients, PK-PD of antimicrobials in cancer patients as well as the association between chemotherapy and AMR.</p><p>Besides that, the practice section of the questionnaire focused on pharmacists&#x02019; practice in assessment and decision making of antimicrobial use, implementation of AMS strategies within the clinical field along with interdisciplinary collaboration with other healthcare professionals. Questions related to pharmacists&#x02019; practice in provision of patient education and counselling, education and training in relation to AMS in oncology care and the management of DDIs between chemotherapy and antimicrobials were also included in the survey.</p><p>Based on ideas obtained via comprehensive literature reviews, a total of 133 questions were generated for the initial questionnaire.

A single round of the Delphi technique was conducted in this study due to time and resource constraints. Given the study timeline and the availability of experts, conducting additional rounds would have posed logistical challenges without necessarily yielding substantial improvements in content validity. Delphi technique is a method which involves collecting opinions and feedback from a panel of experts who are knowledgeable about this topic for the research team to make more informed predictions and decisions. In this process, five experts with extensive clinical background were chosen but remained anonymous to each other. The diversity in background ensured that a variety of perspectives were being considered, hence reducing the risk of bias. Majority of the expert panel was made up of oncologists, hospital pharmacists who are working mainly in the oncology unit and academic lecturers with a range of clinical specializations and backgrounds. They were requested to rate the relevance of the item to the topic using a 4-point Likert scale, with a score of 1 (not relevant) to 4 (extremely relevant). Items with an I-CVI value of less than 0.78 were removed, while those with a value of at least 0.78 were retained [<xref rid="pone.0321551.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Besides this, the expert panels&#x02019; feedback has been taken into account while the items are being revised and modified.</p><p>During the Delphi approach, the expert panel reviewed the 130 items in the KAP-AMS-OC-Q. After collecting responses from the panel, it was identified that a total of 26 items were irrelevant and were subsequently removed from the questionnaire. Within the removed questions, 1 question in particular was split into 2 individual items, which were added in response to experts&#x02019; suggestions. Additionally, 19 items were modified based on the expert input, while 1 item was relocated from one domain to another. As a result, the finalized version of KAP-AMS-OC-Q consists of 106 items, with 50 items in the knowledge domain and 56 items in the practice domain, as demonstrated in <xref rid="pone.0321551.t001"

The questionnaire was then created in a Google Document and then transferred to SurveyMonkey<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> to aid in the disseminating process by sharing the survey link. The recruitment process in disseminating the questionnaire was done via online platforms such as WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram, Emails and LinkedIn. Various social media platforms were used to ensure that participants are of different social demographics which include age, gender, qualification in pharmacy, education setting, duration of job experience and job scope in the hospital.</p><p>For eligibility of this study, participants were required to meet the inclusion criteria that were stated above. The process of recruitment involved sending the survey link and providing basic information regarding the study to invite interested participants to click on the survey link, which brings them to then questionnaire collection portal in SurveyMonkey.</p><p>Data collection took place from February to May 2024. Throughout this period, a total of 128 emails and reminders were sent to the heads of pharmacy departments in respective hospitals across Malaysia with requests to aid us in distributing the questionnaire in their pharmacy departments. The questionnaire was also posted in Facebook groups such as the Malaysia Pharmacist group as well as on LinkedIn to recruit pharmacists who are active in the platform. However, the response rate was 54.74%, as only 52 participants out of 95 completed the entire questionnaire at the end of the data collection phase.</p><p>In the beginning of the survey, the purpose of the survey and a link to the full version of the explanatory statement were provided before the participants decide whether or not to participate in the study. The inclusion criterias, a brief introduction of the study and the privacy and confidentiality of participants&#x02019; personal information and responses were explained thoroughly. Participants were informed that the collected information would be handled professionally and confidentially and that their personal information will not be linked to the data collected. They were requested to provide their consent before assessing the questionnaire. Contact information of the research team was also included in the introductory page of the questionnaire if further clarifications were required. On average, each respondent spent roughly 12 minutes to complete the full questionnaire.</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Data analysis</title><sec id="sec010"><title>Construct validity and reliability.</title><p>Data analysis of the collected responses in this study was conducted using SPSS (version 29.00), while the demographic data of participants was summarised via descriptive statistics. The questionnaire&#x02019;s validity and reliability were assessed using various assessment techniques. Item response theory (IRT) was used to validate the knowledge domain while Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was used to validate the practice domain. Besides this, Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha was used to calculate the internal consistency and assess reliability, which is the extent of conformity between items in the questionnaire with a minimum acceptable value of 0.7 [<xref rid="pone.0321551.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The degree of agreement between the items increases with a greater Cronbach's alpha value.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Item response theory (IRT)</title><p>To assess the knowledge section of the questionnaire, IRT, which is a valuable approach for understanding how participants&#x02019; responses to individual questions correlate to their proficiency level in the assessed knowledge domain, was employed [<xref rid="pone.0321551.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Specifically, the one-parameter logistic (1PL) model, i.e., Rasch model was employed with ltm package version 1.2.0. Rasch model is a model used to evaluate participants&#x02019; performances and increase researcher&#x02019;s construct instrument quality and accuracy in which compromises parameter a (discrimination) and parameter b (difficulty) [<xref rid="pone.0321551.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. For evaluation of psychometric properties of the domain, certain cutoff values have been established. Parameter a (discrimination) is fixed at a value of a&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.0 for all items, implying that all items on the test are equally discriminating and the participants gathered for answering the questionnaire have similar level knowledge and traits. As for parameter b (difficulty), it spans between -3 and +3 [<xref rid="pone.0321551.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. These parameters and target range enable the model to faithfully depict the data and generate dependable estimates of the underlying constructs.</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>Exploratory factor analysis (EFA)</title><p>EFA is used to aid in the identification of underlying inter-correlations among the variables of ordinal data (i.e., the Likert scale) and reduce the data to a smaller number of factors [<xref rid="pone.0321551.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Varimax rotations are used to maximise each item's loading factor on the extracted respondents. Items that have a factor loading of minimum 0.3 are retained within the questionnaire while others will be removed to find items that meet acceptable construct validity standards [<xref rid="pone.0321551.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec013"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec014"><title>Sociodemographic characteristics of the participants</title><p>The study enrolled 52 participants with a mean age of 32&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;6.06.

For instance, a study by Mubarak et. al. in 2021 [<xref rid="pone.0321551.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] assessed AMS-related education among pharmacy students, highlighting key areas of AMS knowledge that may also be relevant to practicing pharmacists. However, our study is the first study of its kind that aims to develop and validate a questionnaire focusing on the knowledge and practice of AMS in oncology care, filling a significant gap in existing research and assisting future evaluation of pharmacists&#x02019;s AMS levels. The development process of the KP-AMS-OC-Q, involving rigorous psychometric analysis, has resulted in an instrument with satisfactory content validity, face validity, and reliability, making it a valuable tool for evaluating AMS practices among pharmacists in this specialized field.</p><p>This research serves as a pilot testing for content and construct validity and reliability of the questionnaire before disseminating it to the greater population of pharmacists. Knowledge and practice domains were assessed using psychometric instruments such as IRT and EFA respectively. The IRT analysis of the knowledge domain, conducted via the Rasch model, revealed that the majority of items demonstrated appropriate psychometric properties, with difficulty parameters within the acceptable range. The removal of item K17 due to its deviation from the recommended range reflects the stringent criteria employed to ensure the accuracy and validity of the questionnaire. The overall Cronbach's alpha coefficient of 0.763 for the knowledge domain indicates a high level of internal consistency, confirming that the items effectively measure the intended constructs related to AMS in oncology care.</p><p>The EFA of the practice domain revealed a six-factor model that aligns well with the predefined domains, providing a strong structural foundation for the questionnaire. The decision to reduce the number of factors from the initial 14-factor suggestion to 6 was guided by the need for better interpretability without compromising the questionnaire's comprehensiveness. The acceptable factor loadings (&#x0003e;0.3) [<xref rid="pone.0321551.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] across all 56 items further validate the relevance of these items to the respective factors. The internal consistency reliability of the practice domain was notably high, particularly in the subdomains related to AMS strategies implementation, patient education and counselling, pharmacists&#x02019; education and training, and management of drug-drug interactions between chemotherapy and antimicrobials. However, the lower reliability observed in the subdomains of assessment and decision-making and interdisciplinary collaboration suggests areas that may benefit from further refinement or additional research.</p><p>The final 105-item KP-AMS-OC-Q, with an overall Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha of 0.889, demonstrates strong internal consistency reliability, making it a reliable tool for assessing pharmacists&#x02019; knowledge and practices towards AMS in oncology care. The high reliability across both the knowledge (0.763) and practice (0.921) domains highlights the instrument's potential utility in both research and clinical practice. The removal of item K17, which did not meet the acceptance criteria, further ensures that the final instrument is both statistically robust and practically relevant.</p><p>In spite of the extensive nature of this questionnaire, the result of the pilot testing revealed that participants are able to fully complete it within an average timeframe of approximately 12 minutes. This, in addition to the favourable findings from the psychometric analysis, further support the questionnaire applicability and viability if conducted in a larger sample size.</p><sec id="sec019"><title>Limitations of the study</title><p>Notable limitations are present in our study. Firstly, a cross-sectional design does not allow the assessment of changes in pharmacists&#x02019; AMS knowledge and practices over time. Hence, future research could address this limitation by incorporating longitudinal follow-up studies to observe changes in knowledge and practices of pharmacists over an extended period. Secondly, a larger sample size of at least 100 participants would present a greater validation for future studies to conduct EFA [<xref rid="pone.0321551.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. A greater response rate can further increase the generalizability of the questionnaire&#x02019;s results to the pharmacist population. Given that there are less hospitals in Malaysia which have oncology specialities, pharmacists who have responded to the questionnaire are primarily hospital pharmacists who may not be specialised in the setting, hence limiting the quantity of data obtained. Besides, future research could also consider using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) for a better reliability and validity of the psychometric evaluation of KP-AMS-OC-Q. Furthermore, the nature of the questionnaire may introduce potential for social desirability bias that will lead to overestimation of pharmacist adherence to antimicrobial stewardship practices. Therefore, future studies may incorporate objective assessments such as direct observation to improve the transparency of the results.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec020"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The Knowledge and Practice of Antimicrobial Stewardship in Oncology Care Questionnaire (KP-AMS-OC-Q) has been diligently developed and validated to specifically target hospital pharmacists in Malaysia as the primary study participants. Following a thorough psychometric evaluation, the final questionnaire comprises 112 items (7 items in sociodemographic information, 49 items in the knowledge domain and 56 items in the practice domain). This instrument plays a crucial role in healthcare settings, particularly in enhancing the effectiveness of AMS programs within oncology care and will help identify gaps requiring further education and training. Thus, this will lead to enhanced patient care, more efficient antimicrobial use and strengthened efforts to combat antimicrobial resistance in oncology patients.</p></sec><sec id="sec021" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material id="pone.0321551.s001" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>Supporting information &#x0201c;Questionnaire Tool&#x0201d;.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0321551.s001.docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pone.0321551.s002" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S2 File</label><caption><title>&#x0201c;Statitical Raw Data&#x0201d;.</title><p>(ZIP)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0321551.s002.zip"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0321551.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Jamaluddin</surname><given-names>NAH</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Periyasamy</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Lau</surname><given-names>CL</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Ponnampalavanar</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Lai</surname><given-names>PSM</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Ramli</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name>, <etal>et al</etal>. <article-title>Point Prevalence Survey of Antimicrobial Use in a Malaysian Tertiary Care University Hospital</article-title>. <source>Antibiotics (Basel)</source>. <year>2021</year>;<volume>10</volume>(<issue>5</issue>):<fpage>531</fpage>. <comment>doi: </comment><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.3390/antibiotics10050531</pub-id>
