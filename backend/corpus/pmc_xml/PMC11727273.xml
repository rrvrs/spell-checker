</xref> SIDC should be considered a serious complication that potentially affects the long&#x02010;term outcomes of patients with CP. However, few studies have evaluated SIDC in CP, with most involving morphological assessments using endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (ERP). To our knowledge, no reports have assessed the mucosal or tissue changes in SIDC under direct vision. Here, we report the course of mucosal changes in CP with MPD stricture caused by endoscopic pancreatic duct stenting&#x000a0;observed via peroral pancreatoscopy (POPS) with a videoscopy (Video <xref rid="deo270050-supinfo-0001" ref-type="">S1</xref>).</p><sec id="deo270050-sec-0020"><label>1.1</label><title>Case report</title><p>A 68&#x02010;year&#x02010;old man with a history of acute alcoholic pancreatitis reported to our department. The patient had a history of chronic alcohol consumption and presented with persistent abdominal pain. Abdominal computed tomography revealed a pancreatic calculus of approximately 13&#x000a0;mm in the pancreatic head and MPD dilatation of the caudal pancreas. Based on the Japanese clinical diagnostic criteria,<xref rid="deo270050-bib-0003" ref-type="bibr">

</xref> the patient was diagnosed with definite CP. The pain was thought to be caused by increased pressure within the pancreatic ductal system from impaired MPD outflow, leading to a referral for endoscopic treatment.</p><p>At our hospital, ERP revealed impacted pancreatic headstones. We performed endoscopic pancreatic sphincterotomy and placed a 5&#x02010;Fr endoscopic nasopancreatic drainage tube in the MPD. Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy was performed in 10 sessions (20,000 shots), and most stones were removed via subsequent endoscopic procedures. MPD stenosis in the pancreatic head was identified and a 10&#x02010;Fr/6&#x000a0;cm S&#x02010;type plastic stent (PS) was placed to achieve a dilating effect (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). After 104 days, we performed a follow&#x02010;up ERP to evaluate MPD strictures and residual pancreatic stones. Pancreatography revealed a focal elevated duct change of approximately 4.5&#x000a0;mm at the distal tip of the PS (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="deo270050-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1a&#x02013;c</xref>). We attempted to evaluate the pancreatic duct changes using POPS. POPS was performed using the mother&#x02010;baby scope method with saline injection. The mother scope was TJF&#x02010;260&#x000a0;V (Olympus), and the baby scope was CHF&#x02010;B290 (Olympus). The observation device used was the EVIS X1 endoscopy system (Olympus). We successfully inserted the baby scope into the MPD (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="deo270050-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>). Details of the elevated mucosal changes detected by pancreatography were observed using POPS. An elevated ductal change at the tip of the stent was identified as a clear villiform&#x02010;like nodular mucosal change. In addition, the spread of the pale papillary and granular mucosa around the villiform mucosa was confirmed. Narrow&#x02010;band imaging did not reveal obvious irregular blood vessels (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="deo270050-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2a,b</xref>). The pancreatic duct mucosa proximal to the elevated lesion showed erosion, and flat elevated mucosal changes were confirmed, which were not detected morphologically on ERP (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="deo270050-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). Dilated and tortuous blood vessels were observed, suggesting that the congested blood vessels were associated with edematous changes in the mucosa (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="deo270050-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2c,d</xref>). Biopsy of the villiform mucosal lesion and flat elevated mucosal changes was performed using Endojaw slim forceps (Olympus) for histological diagnosis. Histological findings from the two biopsy sites revealed reactive mucosal changes but no neoplastic alterations (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="deo270050-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). The identified mucosal changes were strongly suspected to be caused by SIDC; therefore, the PS was removed.</p><fig position="float" fig-type="FIGURE" id="deo270050-fig-0001"><label>FIGURE 1</label><caption><p>Pancreatogram before the placement of 10&#x02010;Fr S&#x02010;type plastic stent shows no obvious focal elevated ductal changes (a).

The elevated mucosal changes were attributed to the inflammatory changes caused by contact with the PS. Pancreatography revealed no dilation of the MPD after PS removal, and the POPS was successfully inserted. Consequently, the MPD stricture in the pancreatic head region was considered improved, and the PS was not reinserted. The patient has since been followed up as an outpatient for CP with no significant changes in symptoms.</p><fig position="float" fig-type="FIGURE" id="deo270050-fig-0004"><label>FIGURE 4</label><caption><p>Pancreatogram 95 days after the removal of the 10&#x02010;Fr S&#x02010;type plastic stent.

Previous reports have suggested that SIDC develops at the stent tip and improves over time following PS removal, implying that these changes may result from local edema or acute inflammation because of direct trauma to the ductal epithelium.<xref rid="deo270050-bib-0002" ref-type="bibr">

</xref> We reported the incidence of SIDC in 10&#x02010;Fr PS is as high as 31.1%, but therapeutic risk factors such as the choice of stent length and computed tomography&#x000a0;findings of axial discrepancy between MPD and PS tip have not been identified.<xref rid="deo270050-bib-0002" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>2</sup>
</xref> In this case, we observed SIDC under direct vision with POPS and identified villiform and papillary elevations along with erosive changes. Morphologically, the duct changes appeared to be reversible; however, scarring suggested permanent damage. This is the first report documenting a course on SIDC using POPS with videoscopy.</p><p>The development of imaging diagnosis using videoscopy has dramatically improved, leading to a wide range of clinical applications.<xref rid="deo270050-bib-0007" ref-type="bibr">

</xref> In this case, ERP recognized only the elevated lesion at the tip of the PS, but POPS confirmed more extensive mucosal changes along the PS. The MPD has a complex three&#x02010;dimensional course. Therefore, it may be difficult to recognize the overall image of the focal elevated changes. The histological findings at the two locations were similar; however, the differences in appearance under direct visualization are likely attributed to mucosal damage caused by scratching from the flap at the tip of the PS and irritation from contact with the stent body. SIDCs are defined as both elevated and stricture changes.<xref rid="deo270050-bib-0002" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>2</sup>
</xref> In this case, the villiform mucosal change at the tip of the stent was recognized as an elevated type. The pale papillary and granular mucosa surrounding the villiform mucosa was thought to represent inflammation spreading to the adjacent areas. Continued PS placement for elevated&#x02010;type SIDC can result in more pronounced stricture changes.<xref rid="deo270050-bib-0002" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>2</sup>
</xref> Persistence of inflammation caused by PS contact may lead to mucosal changes, such as growth or extension. Moreover, it is important to differentiate between the identified elevated MPD lesions and neoplastic lesions. In this case, narrow&#x02010;band imaging did not reveal any obvious irregular blood vessels. However, it is essential to differentiate the mucosal structure with villiform, papillary, and granular elevations from intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMN). IPMN are characterized by various papillary growths of mucus&#x02010;producing neoplastic epithelium and comprises a spectrum of epithelial changes ranging from hyperplasia to carcinoma.<xref rid="deo270050-bib-0008" ref-type="bibr">

</xref>, <xref rid="deo270050-bib-0009" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>9</sup>
</xref> In addition to the pathological diagnosis by direct visual biopsy, follow&#x02010;up evaluation after elimination of the cause of SIDC is important to distinguish it from neoplastic lesions. In this case, evaluation of the mucosal course using POPS was particularly useful.</p><p>Previous reports have shown that residual SIDC after PS removal, as assessed morphologically by ERP, is often determined to be an irreversible ductal change.<xref rid="deo270050-bib-0010" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>10</sup>
</xref> Direct observation with follow&#x02010;up POPS also demonstrated the disappearance of the elevated lesions. However, mucosal findings showed discoloration and retraction of the mucosa, suggesting scarring, which was suspected to be an irreversible change. Sherman et&#x000a0;al.<xref rid="deo270050-bib-0005" ref-type="bibr">

</xref> reported that endoscopic ultrasound evaluation after morphological pancreatic duct improvement detected persistent local parenchymal changes, similar to those in CP, over a long period of time. PS may cause irreversible mucosal and parenchymal changes that cannot be noted morphologically by ERP, thus likely underestimating stent&#x02010;induced changes in CP. It is important to emphasize that the treatment of PS requires attention to the potential pancreatic damage in the non&#x02010;stenotic areas.</p><p>This report is the first to demonstrate that POPS with videoscopy is effective in identifying the course of SIDC. In recent years, remarkable progress has been made regarding the use of baby scopes for better performance of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. In the future, the role of POPS in the endoscopic treatment of CP is likely to become even more significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="COI-statement" id="deo270050-sec-0050"><title>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT</title><p>None.</p></sec><sec id="deo270050-sec-0060"><title>PATIENT CONSENT STATEMENT</title><p>Informed consent for publication was obtained from the patient.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material id="deo270050-supinfo-0001" position="float" content-type="local-data"/><supplementary-material id="deo270050-supitem-0001" position="float" content-type="local-data"><caption><p>1.
