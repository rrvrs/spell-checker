The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recommends compilation of antibiograms as a way to allow for institutional surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibility and to serve as an empirical guide to antimicrobial treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. From clinical susceptibility tests, average susceptibility percentage of specific organisms-antimicrobial pairings are calculated to track changes in antimicrobial susceptibility. The Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) publishes consensus guidelines (M39) on the methods of developing antibiograms to ensure their accuracy and comparability. The M39 document outlines methods regarding the collection, analysis and presentation of data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Basic recommendations include that: antibiogram reports should be presented at least annually; only diagnostic isolates should be included; only the first isolate of a species per patient per analysis period should be included; and reported species should have &#x02265;&#x02009;30 isolates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The CLSI M39 document and IDSA guidelines suggests the use of stratified antibiograms over non-stratified to improve empiric antibiotic therapy in specific populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] suggesting that a hospital-wide antibiogram may conceal differences in susceptibility across different healthcare parameters within a single institution, such as the hospital unit, the infection site, and patient population. The concern is that this can ultimately affect optimal empiric patient treatment as well as impede tracking emerging antimicrobial resistance patterns that are relevant to certain settings.</p><p id="Par6">Indeed, the aggregation of susceptibility data in hospital-wide antibiograms has been shown to be potentially misleading due to the masking of trends in specific patient settings. To date, comparison of hospital-wide to stratified antibiograms are largely focused on categories specific to hospital unit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] with an emphasis on ICU differences, while some have also looked at impact of stratification by infection location [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], and patient characteristics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Most studies have focused on investigating an a priori identified specific strata as opposed to looking at hospital wide differences across many strata.</p><p id="Par7">Our laboratory serves a number of academic acute care and non-acute care health care facilities in the Greater Toronto Area. Our laboratory publishes hospital-wide antibiograms annually along with specimen-specific antibiograms stratified by unit for all acute care hospital clients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The challenges of creating these stratified antibiograms include knowing which strata to focus on, the limited number of isolates in stratified antibiograms, and the heavy workload associated with data clean-out and manipulation associated with the additional analyses required. Given the amount of data and its presentation as distinct antibiograms, it is difficult to determine the value-added of each stratified antibiogram. Using one of our larger acute care hospital&#x02019;s data, the purpose of this study is to compare differences in antibiotic susceptibility between hospital-wide, all-specimens antibiogram and stratified antibiograms in order to identify the value added of subgroup stratification across all strata.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par8">Antibiotic susceptibility of bacterial isolates from 2021 of a quaternary-care academic hospital served by our laboratory was obtained from published hospital-wide and unit- and specimen-specific stratified antibiograms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Susceptibility testing and antibiogram generation was performed in accordance with CLSI with the exception of including data for species with less than 30 organisms per strata but greater than 10 in order to be able to include all subgroup analyses. Differences in percent susceptibility by organism and antimicrobial between the reference antibiogram and stratified antibiograms were calculated (Appendices 1&#x02013;5). Weighted averages (WA) of the change in percent susceptibility, excluding coagulase-negative staphylococci, was calculated for each stratified antibiogram using the number of organisms on the stratified antibiogram as the weight. Heat maps representing these values were created. Excel and R Statistical Software (4.2.1., R Core Team 2022) were used for graph generation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Comparing unit-specific antibiograms to the hospital-wide antibiogram</title><p id="Par9">Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> presents the weighted average differences in specific units (emergency department [ED], intensive care unit [ICU], transplant [TR] and units that are not ED, ICU, nor TR [nEIT]) when compared to a hospital-wide all-specimens antibiogram divided by gram-negative and gram-positive organisms.</p><p id="Par310">

Overall, the ED antibiogram showed increased susceptibility for all types of bacteria, especially gram-negative bacteria. The opposite trend was revealed for TR where the TR antibiogram had reduced susceptibility compared to the non-stratified hospital-wide all-specimen antibiogram. When looking at the most prevalent organisms in <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">Appendix 1</xref>, these trends were seen in most organism-antimicrobial combinations. Some notable findings are that <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> ciprofloxacin susceptibility in TR exhibited a large decrease in susceptibility at 31% and <italic>Enterococcus faecium</italic> vancomycin showed reduced susceptibility in TR of 13%.</p><p id="Par20">Comparing the specimen-specific (syndromic) antibiograms stratified by unit by weighted average to unit-specific antibiograms in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> highlights the value of this additional layer of stratification.

It is clear from our data that using a hospital-wide all-specimens antibiogram may both overcall and under call susceptibility leading to poor empiric antimicrobial choices. While others have recommended ICU-specific antibiograms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and ED-specific antibiograms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], our data suggest value-added in further extending unit-specific data to include other units of interest such as TR units, and to further stratify unit-specific data by specimen type (syndrome) in order to identify nuanced changes in susceptibility that would otherwise go unnoticed in non-stratified antibiograms. The small numbers that may result from such sub-stratification should be recognized as a limitation with a caution that precision around those subgroup estimates of susceptibility may not be high. Collecting data from a larger time duration for those substrata may be helpful to obtain more precise estimates of susceptibility. It is recognized that this study was performed using data collected from a large urban area quaternary-care academic center and the results may not be generalizable to all. Laboratories and antimicrobial stewardship programs are encouraged to examine the specific needs of their own populations and to recognize the limitations of non-stratified antibiograms.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic Supplementary Material</title><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.</p><p>
