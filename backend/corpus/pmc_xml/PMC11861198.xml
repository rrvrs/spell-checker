Learning ability assessments are often employed as indicators to monitor disease progression and measure the potential adverse effects of treatments (<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">Othman et al., 2022</xref>; <xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">Vorhees and Williams, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">Lueptow, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">Jones et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">Shiotsuki et al., 2010</xref>). However, the specific genetic characteristics of some model systems can introduce confounding factors when assessing learning in mice, requiring careful consideration. Three significant factors impacting learning assessments are motor function, sensory (auditory and visual) capabilities, and motivation levels (<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">Brown and Wong, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">Othman et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Motor function-based learning assessments, such as Morris Water Maze (MWM), assess the subject&#x02019;s ability to learn a physical task (<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">Vorhees and Williams, 2006</xref>). Measurements of how quickly the subjects learn to perform the task are used to determine learning ability. Differences in motor function, such as changes in body weight, muscle composition, and gait, confound the results of these assessments and can provide inaccurate measures of learning (<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">Vorhees and Williams, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">Shiotsuki et al., 2010</xref>). Motor function-based learning assessments such as MWM and Rotarod tests are inherently stressful on the subjects, leading to potential variability in subject response (<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">Sankowski et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">Hung and Hsueh, 2021</xref>). In cases where motor deficits are central to a disease phenotype or treatment effect, other learning assessments need to be used.</p><p>Vision-based learning assessments, such as Novel Object Recognition, assess the subject&#x02019;s ability to recognize and respond to visual cues (<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">Lueptow, 2017</xref>). Changes in visual capability and visuospatial awareness can affect performance in these tasks and can undermine the utility of this test in model systems that demonstrate such deficits. For example, C57BL/6&#x0202f;J mice, one of the most commonly used strains of laboratory mice, can develop sporadic and age related eye abnormalities even though they are considered to have &#x0201c;normal&#x0201d; vision overall and are used for visual based learning (<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">Koch and Gowen, 1939</xref>; <xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">Ferdous et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">Ikeda et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">Brown and Wong, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">Berger et al., 2014</xref>). C57BL/6&#x0202f;J mice have also been shown to perform worse in visual tasks at 6&#x0202f;months of age than other strains (<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">Wong and Brown, 2007</xref>). Other strains of mice, such as BALB/cJ and A/J, have established strain-wide disruptions in visual acuity that reduce their ability to learn via visual based assays (<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">Brown and Wong, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">Wong and Brown, 2006</xref>). Visual capability can also be affected by various disorders, including inflammatory responses (<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">Noailles et al., 2018</xref>). In cases where visual capabilities are affected by a disease phenotype or treatment effect, other learning assessments need to be used.</p><p>While many olfaction-based assessment protocols rely on visual cues or motor function, they can also offer an alternative option that can be used to avoid confounds with deficits in motor function or visual capability (<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">Aqrabawi and Kim, 2018</xref>; <xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">Jones et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">Schellinck et al., 2001</xref>). However, these protocols commonly use fear response or motivational weight loss to increase participation levels during training so that learning capabilities can be assessed (<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">Schellinck et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">Jones et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">Hakim et al., 2019</xref>). Fear conditioning is inherently stressful for the subject, which can create variability in subject responses. Fear conditioning is also often dependent on auditory and visual cues, leading to increased variability in subject responses (<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">Xiao et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">Kuboyama et al., 2020</xref>). For example, if a treatment is anxiolytic, then it will reduce fear learning independent of learning capability. Motivational weight loss is an effective way to increase subject participation in food reward-based training, as it involves restricting food intake to induce weight loss in subjects (<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">Schellinck et al., 2001</xref>). This restriction increases exploratory behavior which increases participation in tasks that are reward-based. However, as metabolism-based mechanisms of action are becoming more widely appreciated in health and disease, it is clear that caloric restriction and weight loss can present a confounding factor for many studies, especially those testing metabolic-targeted therapies (<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">Riddle et al., 2013</xref>). Strains such as SPRET/EiJ mice are intolerant to motivational weight loss, and were excluded in an arm of a study comparing strain differences in learning capabilities due to this (<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">Brown and Wong, 2007</xref>). This is likely due to variations in mouse strain body composition (<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">Reed et al., 2007</xref>). In addition, anhedonia can suppress reward-seeking independent of learning. This makes using motivational weight loss inappropriate in studies for which changes in metabolism, changes in mood, or weight loss may be a central part of the disease process.</p><p>While learning assessment protocols exist that can overcome some of these confounding factors, there is a need for additional protocols that are independent of vision, audition, and aversive or caloric conditioning. Thus, we have designed and assessed an olfaction-based learning assessment that does not rely on motivational fear or weight loss. After demonstrating that C57BL/6&#x0202f;J mice can learn this task, we use lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration (a model for sepsis that causes an inflammation-induced learning deficit in low doses; <xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">Fr&#x000fc;hauf et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">Jung et al., 2023</xref>) as proof of concept to assess learning changes in this novel protocol. Effects of LPS treatment include changes in motor function and muscle composition, dramatic weight loss, and increases retinal inflammation (<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">Skrzypczak-Wiercioch and Sa&#x00142;at, 2022</xref>; <xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2022</xref>). Thus, we demonstrate a novel method for assessing olfaction-based learned preference in C57BL/6&#x0202f;J mice without the use of motivational fear or weight loss following LPS treatment.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><label>2</label><title>Materials and equipment</title><sec id="sec6"><label>2.1</label><title>Animal husbandry</title><p>Male and female C57BL/6&#x0202f;J mice (between 7 and 33&#x0202f;weeks of age as indicated in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"/><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) were bred in-house in the University of South Florida Morsani College of Medicine Vivarium with a standard 12&#x0202f;h light/dark cycle.

Existing olfaction-based learning and memory protocols offered a foundation, specifically in terms of scent formulation, training schedules, and reward choices; however, modifications were essential to ensure consistent mouse participation in training sessions (<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">Schellinck et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>Initially, our trials confirmed that sucrose was the optimal reward for C57BL/6&#x0202f;J mice, outperforming artificial sweeteners like sucralose and saccharin, as demonstrated by their higher passive preference in the sweetener preference test. This is in line with the current understanding of sucrose preference in mice (<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">Verharen et al., 2023</xref>; <xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">Markov, 2022</xref>; <xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2018</xref>). Attempts to utilize sucrose solutions as training rewards were unsuccessful, as the mice did not engage with water bottle areas or investigate cage-placed containers. However, placing sucrose paste directly on the cage floor beneath the scent paper successfully encouraged interaction. Mice would step into the sucrose paste while investigating the scent, subsequently grooming and consuming the sucrose on their paws, leading to improved training participation. Training trials were limited to 5&#x0202f;min to prevent overtraining behaviors, which included resting, remaining stationary, or engaging in excessive grooming without exploration.</p><p>On training day 1 of the protocol, mice began showing these signs during their third training trial. Limiting training trials to two trials of each smell (four trials total) a day resolved the issue. On test day, mice were kept in a separate room from the testing area and the smell prep station. This ensured that only the mouse being assessed for preference was being exposed to the smells at any given time. During acclimation, the mice were placed in the center chamber of the 3 chambered association chamber and monitored to ensure they discovered all 3 chambers. Due to the box being made out of clear acrylic, the mice often bumped their noses along the edge to find the opening between chambers. Video recordings of the 2-min exposure to the smells in a 3 chambered box allowed for blinded and accurate measurements of the time spent in each chamber. Using the sucrose paste to induce a passive smell preference worked, as the mice spent more time in the chamber containing the smell paired with sucrose. Thus, we achieved the first objective of this study, and established a learning assessment protocol that did not rely on visual cues, motor function, or motivational weight loss.</p><p>To validate this protocol, we used it to assess an LPS-induced learning deficit. Using previously published dosing strategies, we gave the mice an IP injection of LPS at a dose of 500ug/kg on training days 1 and 2 (<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">Jung et al., 2023</xref>). Mice lost weight similar to previously published LPS studies, and began recovering their body weight on day 4 (<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">Jung et al., 2023</xref>). Due to the weight loss effects of LPS administration, we limited LPS administration to only day 1 and day 2 of training, with no LPS administration on day 3 as described in section 5.3. During training, mice were monitored using the same criteria for over-training and participation as discussed earlier. LPS treated mice were observationally less energetic, but still active during training and explored the sucrose rewards when present. However, we were unable to quantify whether the treat was consumed due to the nature of the sucrose paste. On test day, PBS treated mice showed a preference for the S+ smell while LPS mice did not, and LPS mice had a lower preference score than PBS mice. In spite of weight loss being known to increase reward-seeking behavior, LPS-treated mice failed to learn the reward-based preference. Therefore, the LPS treated mice exhibited a deficit in learning capability compared to PBS treated mice. Thus, we achieved the second objective of this study and validated the utility of this olfaction-based learned preference assessment protocol to assess learning deficits due to LPS administration.</p><p>This study is limited by the number of animals assessed, as we could not assess for sex effects with the number of mice used. We also could not assess for the effects of age, as the males were older than the females, leading to the inability to separate age effects from sex differences. However, we believe that the ability of this protocol to show significant learning capabilities with low animal numbers and combined sexes to also be a potential strength. Future investigation into the limits of this protocol should assess sex and age differences using higher animal numbers to do so. Further limitations of this protocol are similar to the limitations seen in other learning assessment protocols. It is important to keep the same investigator throughout training and limit the use of personal fragrances during these assessments, as changes in personnel and scent can distract the mice from their tasks. It is also important to keep the training rooms and testing rooms free of any loud noises, changing smells, or visual disturbances as these can distract the mice and the investigator. There is also a limitation for how many mice can be run at a time. Due to the need for 3 rooms on test day (animal waiting room, testing, and scent preparation), 2 investigators at minimum (one to clean and prepare the chambers and smells, and one to run the tests), and the need to have the mice tested within the same 2-h window to avoid circadian rhythm confounds, only 9&#x02013;10 mice should be run at a time. This can be resolved with multiple testing rooms and additional personnel but is a large resource requirement in that regard.</p><p>Compared to current olfactory protocols, namely fear based and olfactory preference tests that require motivational weight loss, this protocol is less stressful on both the investigators and the mouse subjects (<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">Brown and Wong, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">Schellinck et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">Jones et al., 2005</xref>). This protocol also does not rely on visual cues or motor performance, unlike MWM and Rotarod tests, and avoids the inherent stress of MWM and Rotarod tests alleviating potential confounding variables in future studies (<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">Sankowski et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">Hung and Hsueh, 2021</xref>). This protocol avoids the visual cues needed in protocols assessing olfaction based spatiotemporal memory (<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">Aqrabawi and Kim, 2018</xref>). This protocol could be applied to other rodent models as well, and can be used in other models of learning deficits. However, this protocol is reliant on mice not having anhedonia, so it is necessary to assess preference ability in any model being assessed using this protocol. This protocol could be combined with metabolism centered treatments and assessments, as well as other learning assessments to enhance the understanding of various disease processes. For example, the mechanisms of olfaction signaling and learning are of great interest in the context of inflammation, neurodegeneration, and even in the development of cell lines derived from the olfactory neurosphere (<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">Orecchioni et al., 2022</xref>; <xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">Irfan et al., 2024</xref>; <xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">Bhatia-Dey and Heinbockel, 2021</xref>). This protocol could allow researchers to study the effects of these mechanisms learning and memory phenotypes without needing to use fear or motivational weight loss.</p><p>In conclusion, we have established an olfactory-based learned preference protocol is a viable tool for assessing learning abilities in preclinical models that overcomes the limitations of current olfactory-based learned preference protocols by not relying on fear or weight loss as motivation. This protocol is valuable for the field of behavioral neuroscience, as it allows for assessments of learning abilities in preclinical models with auditory or visual deficits, motor impairments, or an inability to tolerate motivational weight loss.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="sec28"><title>Data availability statement</title><p>The raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will be made available by the authors, without undue reservation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="ethics-statement" id="sec29"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>The animal study was approved by University of South Florida (USF) Institute for Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
