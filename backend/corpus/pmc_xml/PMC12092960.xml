Indigenous populations face significant barriers to healthcare, education, and sanitation, resulting in high rates of infant mortality and maternal deaths. This study explores the demographic characteristics and social determinants of health in five communities along the Amazon River, with a focus on women&#x02019;s access to healthcare. Understanding these barriers can help develop interventions specific to the needs of these communities.</p><p>Methods: Secondary data from a 2023 survey conducted by the Herbert Florida International University Wertheim College of Medicine&#x000a0;medical students and Project Amazonas were analyzed. The study was conducted in five remote river communities within the Tamshiyacu Tahuayo Regional Conservation Area: El Chino, El Charro, Esperanza, Buena Vista, and Huaysi. Participants (n = 32) were Spanish-speaking women aged 18-80 years residing in these communities. They were randomly selected during medical visits, where they provided consent to participate. The survey was administered verbally in Spanish by Spanish-speaking medical students. Additionally, the Project Amazonas representative verbally asked a series of demographic questions&#x000a0;in Spanish to the community leader in each village.&#x000a0;Descriptive statistics were used to summarize demographic characteristics, general pregnancy and labor attitudes and experiences, and contraceptive use.</p><p>Results: The long travel distance via boat to healthcare facilities, poor infrastructure, and limited education all restrict access to maternal care. Only 42% of women received prenatal care at local health posts, and 40% delivered at home. Contraceptive use, particularly medroxyprogesterone acetate (Depo-Provera) injections, is prevalent at 71%, though unplanned pregnancies (28%) and child mortality remain common (19%).</p><p>Conclusions: Geographic isolation has a significant impact on healthcare access, with education and transportation emerging as critical factors in maternal health outcomes. The findings highlight the need for culturally sensitive interventions that address these root causes. Proposed sustainable solutions include basic medical training for community members, emergency plans, and improved transportation to reduce maternal health disparities in these communities.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>amazon river</kwd><kwd>maternal health</kwd><kwd>peru</kwd><kwd>rural health</kwd><kwd>social determinants of health</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Approximately 1,000,000 individuals live within Loreto, Peru&#x02019;s most remote region, where the majority is covered by the Amazon Jungle [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Approximately 45% of the population resides in urban dwellings of Iquitos, while the remaining 55% inhabit approximately 2,000 remote, rural river-edge communities along the Amazon; these areas are secluded and only accessible by boat [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. These indigenous communities suffer greater social inequalities, including reduced access to healthcare services, lower education level, fewer employment opportunities, declined nutritional status, and a greater infant mortality rate compared to the general population in Peru [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>During 2020, there were 410 maternal deaths in Peru, with a maternal mortality ratio estimated at 69 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births [<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Even though there has been a reduction in maternal mortality compared to previous years, deaths and complications related to pregnancy and childbirth continue to be a public health problem, characterized by unequal geographic and socioeconomic distribution [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. According to the General Epidemiology Directorate of the Peruvian Ministry of Health, regions in Peru with the highest maternal mortality rates are Lima, La Libertad, Piura, Cajamarca, and Loreto [<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>The government-subsidized health insurance plan,&#x000a0;Seguro Integral de Salud,&#x000a0;was introduced in Peru in 2002 to provide free or low-cost health coverage to Peruvians living in poverty, particularly women and children, thereby helping to overcome barriers to healthcare access [<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. However, these interventions have largely focused on more populated urban areas, leading to a more significant reduction in maternal mortality in cities compared to rural regions. This disparity highlights the unequal distribution of health resources, further exacerbating social inequalities, particularly in remote communities like those along the Amazon [<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>Many social barriers are observed among families living in river-edge communities, including distance to healthcare facilities, lack of money and transportation, reluctance to travel alone, and women requiring permission to seek care from their partners [<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Indications of poverty within the Peruvian Amazon communities include overcrowded households, poor sanitation, and food insecurity [<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. This severe inequity leaves many of the poorest women without access to life-saving maternal health services. Maternal mortality could be greatly reduced if these barriers that prevent or delay women from accessing routine and emergency obstetric services were addressed.</p><p>Certain social determinants of health (SDOH) have been studied within Peruvian Amazon river communities, though much of the research remains limited.&#x000a0;Project Amazonas, a Peruvian-USA nonprofit, nonsectarian, and nonpolitical organization, has contributed to humanitarian, conservation, education, and research efforts in this region [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. However, there is a notable gap in the literature specifically examining how SDOH influences maternal health in these remote communities.</p><p>In collaboration with Florida International University medical students and Project Amazonas, this study sought to identify key SDOH impacting women's health during a medical outreach intervention in five river communities of the Tamshiyacu Tahuayo Regional Conservation Area&#x000a0;(ACRCTT) [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The objectives were as follows: 1) to examine SDOH within these communities and 2) to investigate women's accessibility to and utilization of healthcare services, including the cultural and social influences shaping maternal health practices. By better understanding the specific SDOH that influences maternal health outcomes, this study provides a foundation for the future development of long-term, sustainable interventions aimed at improving maternal care in these underserved communities. Ultimately, addressing these factors will help guide culturally sensitive solutions that target the root causes of maternal health disparities.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Setting</p><p>The study was conducted in the Tamshiyacu Tahuayo Regional Conservation Area (ACRCTT). This is a protected area located southeast of Iquitos, extending over the Peruvian department of Loreto [<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The Tamshiyacu Tahuayo Communal ACRCTT, which protects 420,080 hectares of forest, was established on May 16, 2009, as a result of the collaboration between the 35 communities that inhabit its zone [<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The Tahuayo River runs approximately 80 km and is characterized as being acidic and nutrient-poor [<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The communities along the river use the water from this river for drinking, fishing, cleaning, and bathing. This study focused on five river communities in the conservation area along the Tahuayo River: El Chino, El Charro, Esperanza, Buena Vista, and Huaysi (Figure <xref rid="FIG1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).</p><fig position="anchor" fig-type="figure" id="FIG1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Map of the five communities (El Charro, El Chino, Esperanza, Buena Vista, and Huaysi) and medical buildings (Health Post in Esperanza, Health Center in Tamshiyacu, Hospital in Iquitos) along the Tahuayo River</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="cureus-0017-00000082642-i01" position="float"/></fig><p>Participants</p><p>There were two groups of participants.&#x000a0;Participants in the survey were women between the ages of 18 and 80 years living in one of the five River Tahuayo communities, Spanish-speaking, and willing and able to provide verbal consent. We recruited the participants from a location where Project Amazonas created a temporary clinic within each community.

The organization has been working with the communities of ACRCTT for over 30 years.</p><p>Data collection</p><p>This research study used a secondary dataset from two sources: 1) a survey administered to women living in the five river communities: El Chino, El Charro, Esperanza, Buena Vista, and Huaysi, and 2) one-on-one interviews with community leaders.</p><p>A 20-question survey about maternal health outcomes was administered to women participants. Surveys were conducted by four Spanish-speaking medical students who were involved with Project Amazonas. An elementary level of Spanish was used to ensure that participants understood each question. A convenience sample was used to collect the answers. Interviewers from Project Amazonas read all 20 questions aloud to the participants and filled out the surveys in or near the building where medical care was provided for that community. All questions focused on birthing and prenatal care practices, family planning, and healthcare access.&#x000a0;The surveys were conducted verbally with responses recorded on paper due to a lack of internet access. The survey consisted of 18 multiple-choice questions and two open-ended questions. None of the questions were validated. The interviews took around 5-10 minutes to complete.</p><p>In addition, a group interview&#x000a0;consisting of 11 community leaders previously identified by Project Amazonas and who have a rich knowledge of their communities was implemented.&#x000a0;The community leaders' group interview lasted around 30 minutes and was semistructured. Around 10 questions were asked, and community leaders were able to add additional questions and make comments not related to the previously prepared questions.&#x000a0;Community leaders were asked about SDOHs, including the community population (i.e. number of families living in the community), internet and phone access, health care access (i.e., hospital, health post, and health center), transportation access, electricity access, water access, education access (i.e., types of schools), source of employment/income, and major health issues.</p><p>Data analysis</p><p>Quantitative data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 28 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). Descriptive analyses, including univariate and bivariate frequencies, means, and standard deviations, were used to describe the study population, as well as to describe the knowledge and practices of participants. Qualitative data were analyzed using content analysis to identify key patterns and themes.</p><p>Ethical approval</p><p>The research study received exemption from the Institutional Review Board at Florida International University.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The SDOH assessment for the five river communities is summarized in Table <xref rid="TAB1" ref-type="table">1</xref>.

This unique method of population estimation by families rather than individuals reflects local cultural norms and community structure, highlighting an important aspect of social organization within these river communities.</p><p>Access to potable water was limited; Esperanza was the only community with an established water system. Most communities relied on river water for drinking, fishing, bathing, cleaning, and cooking. Access to electricity and communication infrastructure, such as Wi-Fi and cellular networks, was also limited across all communities.</p><p>The most commonly reported health issues among these communities included respiratory tract infections and gastrointestinal infections.

Medroxyprogesterone acetate (Depo-Provera) was the most common method overall, with usage rates varying across communities. In Esperanza, where the health clinic is located, women utilized multiple contraceptive forms (oral, Depo, and intrauterine device); two women reported no birth control use. Similarly, in Huaysi, the closest community to the health clinic, women employed various methods. Conversely, in El Chino, the farthest community from the clinic, Depo was most prevalent (71%), with some women using no contraception.</p><p>Figure <xref rid="FIG2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref> illustrates the distribution of prenatal care locations across the different communities. All women reported receiving prenatal care in El Charro, Esperanza, and Huaysi; these are the three communities closest to Esperanza&#x02019;s health post. In all five communities, more women received prenatal care at a health facility than at home, with a higher proportion visiting the health post compared to the hospital.&#x000a0;Despite 42% of women receiving care from the health post, the majority of women gave birth at home (Figure <xref rid="FIG2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>). Over 40% gave birth at home, with the Buena Vista community having the highest percentage of home births. Eighty-seven percent of women in Buena Vista gave birth at home. The remaining communities demonstrated a uniform spread in birth locations, with one or two people giving birth at home, health post, hospital, or multiple places (Figure <xref rid="FIG2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>).&#x000a0;However, information on the presence or involvement of local midwives was not collected.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This study contributes to the existing literature by filling a critical gap in understanding the SDOH affecting maternal health in five remote river communities in the ACRCTT along the Amazon River. While there is some research on SDOH in Peru, this study specifically addresses the unique cultural and social factors influencing maternal health in this vulnerable region. By providing a detailed analysis of these determinants and their possible impact on healthcare access and utilization, the study offers valuable insights that can inform the development of targeted interventions. Issues such as water sanitation, education, transportation, electricity, and access to healthcare emerged as significant barriers that could impact health outcomes. This contribution helps to advance the knowledge base on maternal health disparities and supports the creation of effective strategies to improve health outcomes in these five underserved communities.</p><p>It has been shown that poor water sanitation is associated with an increased risk of diarrheal diseases and infant mortality [<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Our findings indicated that access to potable water is very limited across all five communities. Esperanza was the only community with an established water system, constructed by Water Mission, a nonprofit organization based in the United States. The other communities were using water sourced directly from the nearby river. While we cannot definitively conclude a direct causal relationship between inadequate water sanitation and infant mortality, research shows that increasing access to water and sanitation are significantly associated with decreases in the negative health outcomes of interest, namely under-five child mortality, under-five child mortality due to diarrhea, infant mortality rate, and maternal mortality rate&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The impact of inadequate water sanitation and healthcare access may have partially contributed to the reports of child mortality and maternal complications after childbirth found within our study. Specifically, the study revealed that 19% of women reported the death of a child, while another 19% reported complications within the first month after childbirth.</p><p>Maternal education has also been shown to be an important social determinant of maternal and child health [<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Schooling in itself has been a powerful tool to influence health; literate women tend to marry later and are more likely to use family planning methods [<xref rid="REF14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Mothers with primary education tend to take better care of their children and are more likely to seek medical care, such as immunization, than those who lack schooling [<xref rid="REF14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In 1993, Peru's education reform aimed to extend compulsory schooling in rural indigenous communities; however, enforcement challenges, insufficient public expenditure, and unaddressed preexisting disparities led to shortcomings [<xref rid="REF15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Many children in rural areas have to travel long distances to schools&#x000a0;and/or attend schools that lack well-trained teachers [<xref rid="REF16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Some findings within our study may reflect deficiencies that the amended constitution faced in rural indigenous communities. We observed that all communities have primary schools, with only Esperanza and El Chino also having secondary schools. Additionally, 59% of women had primary education, while only 34% had some secondary education. Early childbirth rates and maternal complications could be influenced by educational attainment and cultural factors.</p><p>Access to health education, medical facilities, family planning, and childcare is crucial alongside formal schooling. Figure <xref rid="FIG2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref> reveals that most women (93%) received prenatal care at a health facility, with 42% using the health post in Esperanza, the nearest community. One explanation for the availability of prenatal care and family planning services is the partnership between the Ministry of Health and Angels of the Amazon (AoA), a nonprofit founded in 2007. AoA collaborated with the health post in Esperanza, which serves as the primary healthcare provider for residents of the Tahuayo River basin [<xref rid="REF17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. This partnership resulted in significant improvements to the clinic's infrastructure, staffing, and medical equipment, elevating it to a Level 1 hospital recognized by the Ministry of Health. AoA also supports health and education initiatives through workshops at the clinic and local schools, including a health and sex education program launched in May 2023 [<xref rid="REF17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>Nearly half of the women opted for home births, a trend particularly notable in Buena Vista, the farthest community from Esperanza (Figure <xref rid="FIG2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>), possibly due to the fact that there is only one public boat that travels the river once a day. Transportation barriers, exacerbated by unreliable electricity, pose challenges to accessing healthcare facilities. Many travel in adverse weather conditions, sometimes at night, via slow boats or canoes [<xref rid="REF17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. This is a possible reason for the high percentage of home births seen in this study. In the remote river network of the Amazon, the distance from large cities and isolation helps to simultaneously protect the environment while also serving as a barrier to the social and economic development of its local communities [<xref rid="REF18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Medroxyprogesterone acetate (Depo-Provera) was the predominant contraceptive method, utilized by nearly 64% of respondents (Figure <xref rid="FIG2" ref-type="fig">2A</xref>). Similarly, a study by Westgard et al. found that 63% of women in Loreto used contraception, with 43% opting for modern methods [<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The reasons for its popularity, likely tied to accessibility and affordability, are complex to ascertain [<xref rid="REF19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="REF20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. This higher adoption rate of modern contraceptives in our communities, compared to Loreto, could be linked to the presence of the AoA clinic in Esperanza, which would highlight the benefits of family planning and improved medication access facilitated by organizations like AoA.</p><p>With the information gathered, we plan to create tailored interventions for the communities studied. The initial priorities will focus on addressing transportation challenges, health education, and water hygiene, three important health priorities reported in the study. The plan includes identifying and facilitating the training of a community health worker (CHW), in addition to building health literacy among community members, beginning with discussions on water hygiene and sun safety. Moreover, medical students and faculty will collaborate with community leaders to develop emergency plans specific to each area.</p><p>Study limitations</p><p>This study utilized a convenience sample of 32 women, which is a small sample size and may limit the generalizability of its findings to the broader population of women in the assessed communities. Furthermore, the survey of women who sought care from the clinic introduces selection bias, as their characteristics and experiences may differ from those of women who did not seek care. Therefore, the findings may not fully represent the experiences of all women of the community.&#x000a0;However, it begins to highlight some of the experiences of women in these locations.</p><p>Recall bias was apparent in many of the interviews. Most participants who were over the age of 60 years seemed to have trouble recalling their experiences with their pregnancies. Additionally, social desirability bias was observed in certain interviews. Several of the participants were shy and appeared to respond in a manner they thought was socially acceptable.</p><p>A language and cultural barrier also existed between the interviewers and the participants. All medical students who conducted the interview spoke Spanish. However, the medical students were not Peruvian and had limited cultural knowledge about the country. A local interpreter may have improved the rapport in interviews, but none was available. Despite the limitations, our study gives valuable insights into the SDOHs present and the future interventions needed.</p><p>Implications for policy and practice</p><p>This study, a collaboration between FIU HWCOM and Project Amazonas, established an ongoing partnership aimed at improving health access in river communities. Following the July 2023 trip, FIU HWCOM committed to returning annually to ensure continuity of care and education. The partnership's goal is to build a sustainable program that educates communities about their SDOH, thereby increasing knowledge and optimizing health access based on identified needs.</p><p>In July 2025, FIU HWCOM and Project Amazonas aim to work with the five community leaders to identify and begin to train CHWs. Education will initially focus on basic medical techniques, such as using automatic blood pressure machines, glucometers, and digital thermometers, along with discussions on water hygiene and sun safety. The team will also collaborate with leaders to help establish emergency plans, addressing critical needs such as transportation to health facilities.</p><p>Annual visits will continue to expand the CHWs' skills with new medical topics and community health strategies based on evolving needs. These efforts, guided by feedback and data collected during each visit, will foster a sustainable cycle of learning and improvement. The partnership's long-term goal is to enhance health access, outcomes, and resilience within these communities by ensuring interventions remain responsive to their changing health landscape.</p><p>Beyond healthcare education, the study's findings highlight additional challenges, including limited transportation, cell phone access, and access to potable water. Addressing these issues may require broader collaboration with local stakeholders, government agencies, and nonprofit organizations such as AoA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Surveying community leaders and women within five Amazon River communities in the ACRCTT was the initial step in understanding the complex factors that potentially influence maternal health disparities in this population. Our study revealed an interplay of socioeconomic factors, educational limitations, and geographical barriers that possibly contribute to the distinct health challenges faced by women in these communities. Health challenges observed in these communities can be broadly categorized into three areas: attitudinal and behavioral factors, such as apprehensions regarding childbirth and preferences for birthing outside healthcare facilities; physiological health issues, including gastrointestinal and respiratory infections, early-age pregnancies, and high rates of child mortality and morbidity; and SDOH, including water sanitation issues, electricity instability, limited access to education, and transportation barriers. These intersecting factors collectively contribute to the unique health disparities faced by women in these communities. While the Peruvian government has attempted to address some factors, such as mandating secondary education, limited resources have hindered its effectiveness. The presence of the nonprofit organization AoA&#x000a0;in these communities has enhanced access to primary medical care, family planning, prenatal care, and health education. However, transportation barriers continue to pose challenges to accessing these services, highlighting the ongoing need for intervention and support.</p><p>Our approach, focusing on&#x000a0;needs assessments and directly responding to community-specific challenges, can serve as a valuable model for mission-trip-based international programs. By prioritizing collaboration with local communities and being adaptable to their unique needs, we aim not only to address immediate health concerns but also to empower these populations for long-term improvement. This method fosters sustainable partnerships, enhances the effectiveness of interventions, and strengthens community resilience. Through continued engagement and adaptation, our goal is to create meaningful and sustainable change that can be replicated in similar contexts, thereby improving health outcomes and overall well-being in underserved communities.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank Devon Graham, the Chief Executive Officer of Project Amazonas, for his continued support and involvement in the research project.
