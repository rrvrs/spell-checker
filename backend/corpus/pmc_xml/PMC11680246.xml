However, the method is time-consuming, which limits its clinical applicability. Here, we investigated whether the manufacturing time of the adapted virus can be reduced by replacing the dose-based passaging with volume-based passaging. For this purpose, the murine colorectal carcinoma cell line MC38, resistant to PD-H-induced lysis, was initially infected with PD-H at 0.1 multiplicity of infection (MOI). For subsequent passages, 15&#x02013;30 &#x000b5;L of a 1:10 dilution of the cell culture supernatant was transferred to fresh MC38 cells early after virus-induced cell lysis became visible. By virus passage 10, complete cell lysis of MC38 cells was achieved. Sequencing of the passage 10 virus (P-10) revealed two nucleotide substitutions in the 5&#x02032; UTR and six amino acid changes in the viral polyprotein compared to the PD-H founder. P-10, however, consisted of a heterogeneous virus population. Therefore, the detected mutations were introduced into the cDNA of PD-H, from which the recombinant virus PD-MC38 was generated. PD-MC38 exhibited significantly enhanced replication and lytic activity in MC38 cells compared to PD-H, whereas its oncolytic activity in other colorectal cancer cell lines was comparable to or even lower than that of PD-H. These findings demonstrate that volume-based passaging is suitable to generate tumor cell-specific adapted PD-H. Moreover, compared to the dose-dependent passaging, volume-based passaging significantly reduced the time required to generate the adapted virus.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Coxsackievirus B3</kwd><kwd>PD-H</kwd><kwd>oncolytic virus</kwd><kwd>directed viral evolution</kwd><kwd>colorectal carcinoma</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>Deutsche Krebshilfe</funding-source><award-id>70115068</award-id><award-id>70115119</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>Wilhem Sander-Stiftung</funding-source><award-id>2021.049.1</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>The work was supported by the Wilhem Sander-Stiftung through the grant 2021.049.1 and by the Deutsche Krebshilfe through the grants 70115068 and 70115119.</funding-statement></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-viruses-16-01958"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Oncolytic virotherapy is an innovative cancer treatment whose effectiveness has been demonstrated in numerous clinical trials over the past two decades. Key milestones include the approval of T-Vec, a modified herpes simplex virus (HSV), for melanoma treatment [<xref rid="B1-viruses-16-01958" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]; Oncorine, an modified adenovirus for the treatment of nasopharyngeal and head and neck cancers [<xref rid="B2-viruses-16-01958" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-viruses-16-01958" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]; and Delytact, a HSV for the treatment of glioma [<xref rid="B4-viruses-16-01958" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The mechanism of oncolytic viruses (OVs) is based on the destruction of tumor cells through viral replication, accompanied by the stimulation of both the innate and adaptive immune responses, resulting in a systemic anti-tumor effect [<xref rid="B5-viruses-16-01958" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Despite the broad tropism exhibited by OVs, the effectiveness of treatment varies significantly, with only a small proportion of patients benefiting from OV monotherapy [<xref rid="B6-viruses-16-01958" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. This variability stems at least in part from differences in cancer cell sensitivity, ranging from highly susceptible to completely resistant [<xref rid="B7-viruses-16-01958" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-viruses-16-01958" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-viruses-16-01958" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-viruses-16-01958" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-viruses-16-01958" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The underlying reasons for the resistance of tumor cells to OVs are diverse and often poorly understood. They include inefficient virus uptake due to a lack of or low expression of virus receptors on the surface of the target cells, lack of support for the viral replication machinery due to dysregulated cellular signal cascades, and insufficient release of the OV from the infected tumor cell due to inefficient induction of cell death [<xref rid="B5-viruses-16-01958" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B12-viruses-16-01958" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>To enhance the efficacy of OVs, genetic engineering and the incorporation of transgenes into the virus genome are frequently employed [<xref rid="B13-viruses-16-01958" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. For instance, T-VEC has been engineered to express the transgene encoding granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. This modification enhances anti-tumor immunity by promoting the recruitment and activation of dendritic cells, thereby improving antigen presentation and eliciting a more potent immune response against tumor cells [<xref rid="B14-viruses-16-01958" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Directed virus evolution (DVE) is an alternative strategy to overcome cancer cell resistance to OVs and enhance their efficacy. It includes the adaptation of an OV to the specific cancer cells by passaging the virus on the resistant cancer cells [<xref rid="B15-viruses-16-01958" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The duration of this process can vary, but it usually requires between 10 and 50 virus transfers [<xref rid="B11-viruses-16-01958" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B16-viruses-16-01958" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-viruses-16-01958" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-viruses-16-01958" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-viruses-16-01958" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-viruses-16-01958" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-viruses-16-01958" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. This approach exploits the naturally high mutation rate of viruses during replication. Crucially, this method does not require extensive knowledge of virus&#x02013;cell interactions or the specific factors that negatively impact viral replication. Instead, it exploits the inherent ability of the virus to adapt to the environment provided by the tumor cell in an autonomous microevolutionary process [<xref rid="B15-viruses-16-01958" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B22-viruses-16-01958" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The resulting adapted viruses typically exhibit specificity for the cancer cells they were selected on [<xref rid="B23-viruses-16-01958" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] but can also show improved fitness across different cancer cells [<xref rid="B17-viruses-16-01958" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-viruses-16-01958" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Thus, OVs generated through DVE appear particularly well-suited for use in personalized cancer medicine, especially for treating cancer types where the tumor cells exhibit primary resistance to OVs [<xref rid="B23-viruses-16-01958" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. However, the practical implementation of the development of tumor cell-specific adapted OV in personalized medicine is complicated by the fact that its development takes a long time [<xref rid="B17-viruses-16-01958" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], which is often incompatible with the need for rapid availability of the OV in clinical practice.</p><p>Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) is a non-enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus of the genus <italic toggle="yes">Enterovirus</italic> within the family <italic toggle="yes">Picornaviridae</italic> [<xref rid="B24-viruses-16-01958" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Its oncolytic activity was first demonstrated in non-small cell lung carcinomas and subsequently in colorectal, breast, pancreas and cervical squamous cell carcinomas in vivo using various oncolytic CVB3 strains [<xref rid="B8-viruses-16-01958" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B25-viruses-16-01958" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-viruses-16-01958" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27-viruses-16-01958" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28-viruses-16-01958" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B29-viruses-16-01958" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B30-viruses-16-01958" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Certain oncolytic CVB3 strains have been shown to cause myocarditis and pancreatitis in vivo. However, this could be successfully mitigated by the incorporation of specific microRNA target sequences into the viral genome [<xref rid="B31-viruses-16-01958" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B32-viruses-16-01958" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B33-viruses-16-01958" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Recently published studies have shown that the efficacy of cancer therapy with oncolytic CVB3 can be enhanced by combining the oncolytic CVB3 treatment with other cancer therapies such as chemotherapy and immunotherapy [<xref rid="B25-viruses-16-01958" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B34-viruses-16-01958" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The adaptation of the virus to resistant tumor cells, as recently performed by our group, is another effective approach to increase the anti-cancer efficacy of oncolytic CVB3 [<xref rid="B23-viruses-16-01958" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. To this end, we have developed a protocol that enables the efficient and rapid generation of tumor cell-adapted oncolytic CVB3 from the CVB3 founder strain PD-H [<xref rid="B23-viruses-16-01958" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>In this study, we investigated whether and to what extent the generation of tumor cell-specific adapted PD-H can be further accelerated. For this purpose, we replaced the dose-dependent passaging used in our previous protocol with volume-based passaging to adapt PD-H to resistant colorectal MC38 tumor cells. We demonstrate that the adapted virus PD-MC38, produced using this method, exhibited significantly higher replication and lytic activity in MC-38 cells compared to PD-H. Moreover, the time required for the generation of the tumor cell-adapted virus could be significantly reduced.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-viruses-16-01958"><title>2.

Adaptation of PD-H to MC38 Cells</title><p>To assess the susceptibility of MC38 cells to PD-H, we first examined the replication and oncolytic activity of the virus in these cells. PD-H replicated strongly in MC38 cells (<xref rid="viruses-16-01958-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A) but had low oncolytic activity (<xref rid="viruses-16-01958-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>B). Even 72 h post-infection (p.i.) with a high MOI of 10, only a slight decrease in cell viability was observed. To improve the performance of PD-H in MC38 cells, we adapted the virus to the cells by serial passaging (<xref rid="viruses-16-01958-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>C). For this purpose, a defined volume of cell culture supernatant of infected MC38 cells was transferred to new MC38 cells. This approach eliminates the time-consuming repeated virus titration often used in protocols to adapt viruses to resistant cells [<xref rid="B17-viruses-16-01958" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B23-viruses-16-01958" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The initial infection of the cells was conducted with an MOI of 0.1 for 72 h. For all further infections, a volume between 15 and 30 &#x000b5;L of a 1:10 dilution of the previous passage was used. The virus-containing cell supernatant was collected early after cell lysis became visible, which typically occurred 48 or 72 h after the cells were infected (<xref rid="viruses-16-01958-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>C). Serial passage of PD-H into MC38 cells led to a continuous increase in viral titer, reaching a level approximately 10-fold higher than that of the PD-H founder. The maximum increase in virus titer was observed after passage 5, with no further increase observed up to passage 10, at which point passaging was terminated (<xref rid="viruses-16-01958-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>D). To assess how passaging influenced the oncolytic potential of PD-H, an XTT assay was performed, revealing a significant enhancement in cytolytic activity. This led to the complete lysis of MC38 cells after infection with the P-10 using an MOI of 1 and a 48 h incubation period (<xref rid="viruses-16-01958-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>E). The viral growth kinetics of the P-10 virus revealed a significant 10- to 100-fold increase in replication compared to the PD-H strain in MC38 cells (<xref rid="viruses-16-01958-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>F). Thus, the volume-based passaging approach facilitated the successful adaptation of PD-H to MC38 cells. Compared to our previous approach [<xref rid="B23-viruses-16-01958" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], the time required to generate tumor cell-adapted P-10 virus was reduced by more than 50%, from more than 60 days to less than 30 days.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot2-viruses-16-01958"><title>3.2. Sequence Analysis of P-10 and Comparison of P-10 with Other CVB3 Isolates</title><p>To determine which mutations lead to the adapted phenotype of P-10, the genomic RNA of P-10 was isolated, reverse transcribed, and sequenced. Eight nucleotide substitutions were detected (<xref rid="viruses-16-01958-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>A,B). Two of them were found in the 5&#x02032; UTR and a further six, leading to amino acid substitutions, were detected in the viral polyprotein. Four of them occurred in the viral capsid proteins VP1, VP2, and VP3 and two of them in the non-structural proteins 2A and 3A (<xref rid="viruses-16-01958-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>B). Sequencing revealed double signals in the electropherogram for seven out of the eight detected mutations, indicating that, in addition to the mutated PD-H variant, at least one other virus with a genome sequence closely resembling that of PD-H was present in P-10. Thus, P-10 consisted of a mixed virus population. To further investigate the significance of the detected mutations, we compared the mutations in P-10 with the corresponding nucleotide or amino acid sequences in known CVB3 isolates. The analysis revealed that the mutation t249c in the 5&#x02032; UTR and the mutation A661V in the VP1 protein were present in the majority of other CVB3 isolates, whereas the remaining mutations were specific to P-10 (<xref rid="viruses-16-01958-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>C). This indicates that the adaptation of PD-H to MC38 has produced a unique CVB3.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot3-viruses-16-01958"><title>3.3. Replication and Oncolytic Activity of PD-MC38</title><p>Based on our previous observation that mutations acquired during the adaptation of PD-H to tumor cells enhance viral activity when acting together [<xref rid="B23-viruses-16-01958" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], all mutations identified in P-10 were introduced into the genome of the PD-H strain. The virus PD-MC38, containing these mutations in its genome, was produced through transfection of the respective viral cDNA into HEK293T cells. To access the oncolytic properties of PD-MC38, we next compared its replication and oncolytic activity with that of PD-H and P-10 in MC38 cells. Following infection at MOI 0.1, PD-MC38 showed similar replication to P-10 but significantly stronger replication than PD-H, indicating that the insertion of the mutations was beneficial for viral replication (<xref rid="viruses-16-01958-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>A). To investigate the oncolytic activity of all three viruses, we infected MC38 cells with PD-MC38, PD-H, and P-10 at an MOI of 1, 0.1, and 0.01 and measured cell viability 48 h later by XTT assay. At a very low dose of 0.01 MOI, the three viruses did not show oncolytic activity. However, at higher doses of 0.1 and 1 MOI, treatment with PD-MC38 induced a pronounced decrease in MC38 cell viability, reducing it to 65% and 25%, respectively, whereas PD-H had no effect on cell viability. Nevertheless, PD-MC38 did not achieve the same level of activity as P-10, which reduced cell viability to 40% at 0.1 MOI and to 12% at 1 MOI (<xref rid="viruses-16-01958-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>B). A comparison of plaque morphology and plaque size between PD-H, P-10, and PD-MC38 showed no significant differences (<xref rid="viruses-16-01958-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>C,D), indicating that the acquired mutations did not affect these parameters.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot4-viruses-16-01958"><title>3.4. Oncolytic Efficiency of PD-MC38 in Different Colorectal Cancer Cell Lines</title><p>To verify whether the adaptation is specific only for MC38 cells, we infected six additional colorectal carcinoma cell lines with PD-M38 and PD-H at 0.01, 0.1, and 1 MOI and determined the cell viability 48 h later by XTT assay (<xref rid="viruses-16-01958-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). In four of the cell lines (Colo320, CT-26Luc, Colon-26, and CaCo-2), PD-MC38 showed similar cytotoxicity to PD-H, whereas in DLD-1 and Colo205 cells, the cytotoxicity of PD-MC38 was significantly lower than that of PD-H. These data demonstrate that the enhanced oncolytic activity of PD-MC38 is specific to MC38 cells.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec4-viruses-16-01958"><title>4. Discussion</title><p>Personalized cancer therapy represents a transformative approach in oncology, moving away from traditional one-size-fits-all solutions towards strategies that are tailored to the individual characteristics of each patient&#x02019;s cancer [<xref rid="B35-viruses-16-01958" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="B36-viruses-16-01958" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. This consideration is based on the fact that tumors are phenotypically and genotypically very heterogeneous, and therefore, individualized therapeutic approaches promise the best therapeutic success. This assessment also applies to cancer therapy with OVs. However, personalized virotherapy strategies are still largely undeveloped, although preclinical studies have often shown that tumor cells have different sensitivities and individual resistances to existing OVs [<xref rid="B10-viruses-16-01958" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B37-viruses-16-01958" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. One of the reasons for this is the complexity of virus&#x02013;tumor cell interactions, which makes it difficult to predict the efficacy of an OV based on selected tumor biomarkers.</p><p>An alternative approach for the personalized application of OVs is the development of tumor cell-adapted OVs that selectively and efficiently target a patient&#x02019;s tumors. In this context, several studies have demonstrated that OVs can be adapted to resistant tumor cells through repetitive virus passaging, enabling them to effectively target tumor cells [<xref rid="B15-viruses-16-01958" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-viruses-16-01958" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B38-viruses-16-01958" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="B39-viruses-16-01958" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. However, the protocols for developing the adapted OV vary widely, and the overall development process suffers from the fact that it generally takes a long time to produce the customized OV [<xref rid="B15-viruses-16-01958" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B17-viruses-16-01958" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The latter is a decisive disadvantage of this technology and crucial for its employment, as it is questionable whether a cancer patient could still benefit at all from the development of such an OV. Addressing this problem, we recently established a protocol enabling rapid generation of adapted oncolytic CVB3 PD-H [<xref rid="B23-viruses-16-01958" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. This was achieved by limiting the virus passaging to 10 cycles and by inserting all detected virus mutations directly into the cDNA of the founder virus PD-H. Here, we demonstrate that the time required for the generation of tumor cell-adapted PD-H can be further reduced. For this purpose, we replaced the dose-based passaging used in the protocol with a volume-based virus passaging procedure. The decisive advantage of this approach is that the time-consuming virus titration, which is necessary after each passaging cycle to determine the virus dose for the next infection, is replaced by the transfer of a defined volume of cell culture supernatant. Using this method, we show that PD-H can successfully be adapted to the murine colorectal cancer cell line MC38. Moreover, compared to the dose-based virus passaging, the volume-based virus passaging procedure reduced the time required for the generation of the adapted PD-H from more than 60 days to less than 30 days. Considering the total development time, which also includes genetic engineering of the founder PD-H and the final virus production, we assume that a tumor cell-adapted oncolytic PD-H variant can be produced in less than 2 months (<xref rid="viruses-16-01958-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). However, it appears feasible to reduce the incubation time of the cell culture in each passage, which was 48 or 72 h in our study, to 24 h or even less, potentially accelerating the production of tumor cell-adapted oncolytic PD-H.</p><p>Another critical step in shortening the development time of adapted OVs is to minimize the number of viral passages. Here, the number of virus passages was limited to 10. Genome sequencing of the resulting virus P-10 identified several mutations. The majority of these mutations exhibited double signals, indicating a heterogeneous viral population comprising both the mutated variant and the founder strain PD-H. In such a case, further virus passaging or isolation of the mutated variant by plaque purification is usually carried out until the mutated variant is present in pure form [<xref rid="B11-viruses-16-01958" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B17-viruses-16-01958" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B40-viruses-16-01958" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. We have shortened this process by inserting the detected mutations directly into the cDNA of PD-H. Upon generating the virus PD-MC38 via the transfection of HEK293T cells, the replication and lytic activity of PD-MC38 in MC38 cells were significantly enhanced compared to PD-H cells, confirming the successful generation of an adapted virus with our method. However, the cytotoxicity of PD-MC38 was somewhat lower than that of P-10, although the replication was similar. This presents some contrast to our previous study, in which the recombinant virus PD-SK, which was generated from P-10 after the adaptation of PD-H to the colorectal tumor cell line Colo320, showed even stronger replication and cytotoxicity than P-10 [<xref rid="B23-viruses-16-01958" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The reason for the difference in performance between the PD-SK and PD-MC38 viruses is not clear. However, it can be ruled out that the presence of a mixed viral population in P-10 in the presented study plays a crucial role, as such a population was also present in P-10 in our previous study.</p><p>We did not further investigate the impact of each mutation on the replication and cytotoxicity of PD-MC38, as this was not the primary focus of our study. Nevertheless, four of the eight mutations identified in the viral genome were located within the viral capsid proteins VP1, VP2, and VP3, suggesting that the adaptation of PD-H to MC-38 cells is likely associated with virus uptake into the cancer cells. This is supported by the observation that the Alanine &#x02192; Valine amino acid substitution at position 661 of the viral polyprotein (amino acid 91 in VP1) was present in the majority of known CVB3 strains. It highlights the significance of Valine at this position for the function of VP1 in CVB3. Moreover, footprint analysis demonstrated that this amino acid is involved in the interaction of the viral capsid with the coxsackie and adenovirus receptor (CAR), which mediates the attachment and binding of CVB3 to target cells [<xref rid="B41-viruses-16-01958" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="B42-viruses-16-01958" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. In PD-H strains, this interaction is weak [<xref rid="B43-viruses-16-01958" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Thus, it may be possible that the substitution of Alanine by Valin enhanced the binding of the adapted virus to CAR. The mutation t249c in the 5&#x02032; UTR could be similarly significant, as it has been found in the majority of CVB3 strains, but so far, it is uncharacterized regarding its function. Furthermore, the viral proteins 2A and 3A, which are involved in apoptosis induction and cellular replication, respectively [<xref rid="B44-viruses-16-01958" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="B45-viruses-16-01958" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], each acquired a single amino acid substitution during the adaption. The occurrence of the mutations in both proteins was closely correlated with our observation that the replication and lytic infection of P-10 and PD-MC38 were significantly enhanced in MC38 compared to PD-H, highlighting the importance of these mutations in improving the viral performance of the adapted virus.</p><p>Other colorectal cell lines investigated in this study showed equal or even worse susceptibility to PD-MC38 compared to PD-H, demonstrating that the adaptation of PD-H to MC38 cells is strictly tumor cell specific. A similar observation was made in an earlier study we conducted, in which PD-H was adapted to the human colon cancer cell line Colo320 [<xref rid="B23-viruses-16-01958" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. This confirms the personalized character of the adaptation of PD-H to colorectal cancer cells.</p><p>In conclusion, we demonstrate that the adaptation of PD-H to a resistant colorectal tumor cell line can be expedited through the application of a volume-based passaging procedure. By incorporating the acquired mutations into the PD-H founder, a viral clone that fixes the characteristics of the adapted virus can be efficiently and rapidly generated. This method may contribute to enhancing the feasibility of developing PD-H for personalized therapies in patients. Moreover, given its potential applicability to other oncolytic RNA viruses, the utility of this approach could extend well beyond the oncolytic CVB3 PD-H model investigated in this study.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclaimer/Publisher&#x02019;s Note:</bold> The statements, opinions and data contained in all publications are solely those of the individual author(s) and contributor(s) and not of MDPI and/or the editor(s).
