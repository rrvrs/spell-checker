It has been used in various surgical techniques, such as closing oroantral and oronasal communications and repairing defects due to trauma or malignancy. A few years ago, the buccal fat pad was utilized as a pedicle or free soft tissue graft to treat gingival recessions. Therefore, this randomized clinical trial (RCT) was conducted to assess the effectiveness of the free buccal fat pad graft (FBPFG) compared to the de-epithelialized free gingival graft (DFGG) in conjunction with coronally advanced flap (CAF) in localized gingival recession treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and methods</title><p id="Par6">This RCT included 39 participants, with 20 patients receiving a coronally advanced flap (CAF) with FBPFG (Group I) and 19 patients treated with CAF and DFGG (Group II). Clinical parameters such as probing depth (PD), clinical attachment level (CAL), recession depth (RD), width of keratinized gingiva (WKG), and gingival thickness (GT) were assessed after 3- and 6&#x000a0;months of surgical intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par7">After 3- and 6-month follow-ups, statistically significant changes were noted between the groups in all clinical parameters. At 1st and 2nd days of surgical intervention, there was a statistically significant decrease in the values of the visual analogue scale (VAS) in group I compared to group II. Regarding dentinal hypersensitivity, there were statistically significant variations of 3- and 6-month parameters compared to baseline in the two groups. However, there were no differences between the two after the therapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par8">It was proven that DFGG produces significantly better outcomes than FBPFG in treating localized gingival recession. However, FBPFG might serve as a viable alternative for mild to moderate gingival recession cases, where only a limited reduction in recession depth and modest increase in gingival thickness and width of keratinized tissues are required, with the benefit of lower donor site morbidity.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par9">This randomized controlled clinical trial was registered on the Pan African Clinical Trials Registry and approved on 22/06/2023 (Trial no: PACTR202307891237031).</p></sec><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12903-025-06150-8.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Free buccal pad fat graft</kwd><kwd> Coronally advanced flap</kwd><kwd>De-epithelialized free gingival graft</kwd><kwd>Localized gingival recession</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Mansoura University</institution></funding-source></award-group><open-access><p>Open access funding provided by The Science, Technology &#x00026; Innovation Funding Authority (STDF) in cooperation with The Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB).</p></open-access></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par10">Gingival recession (GR) refers to the marginal gingival tissue apical displacement below the cementoenamel junction (CEJ), causing root surface exposure. Hence, various sequelae might occur, such as esthetic concerns, root caries, dentin hypersensitivity, and challenges in maintaining proper oral hygiene. Moreover, severe pulpal exposure may result in significant pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. GR is a prevalent condition all over the world caused by several etiological factors, including faulty tooth brushing, plaque-induced inflammation, root prominence due to orthodontic tooth movement, bone dehiscence, frenal pull, and high muscle attachment, defective restorations extending subgingivally, and eventually destructive periodontal disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par11">Since 1968, GR has been classified by various investigators, beginning with Sullivan and Atkins, until Miller's classification (1985), the most widely accepted classification for over two decades [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Nevertheless, Miller&#x02019;s classification has gained popularity among clinicians, it has some evident drawbacks, such as reliance on MGJ as a reference, which might be challenging to identify[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Hence, Cairo et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] proposed a new GR classification based on interproximal and buccal attachment loss, which relies on a treatment-oriented background to overcome the previous limitations. It was categorized into three classes: RT1 (no attachment loss interproximally), RT2 (equal interproximal loss to or less than buccal loss), and RT3 (interproximal loss greater than loss buccally) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par12">Various treatment modalities for GR exist, including non-surgical and surgical options, with the coronally advanced flap (CAF) as one of the most recognized surgical techniques. CAF is often used alone or in conjunction with different biomaterials, such as the gold standard autologous connective tissue graft (CTG), which can be harvested as solely sub-epithelial CTG or de-epithelialized free gingival graft (DFGG) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Sub-epithelial CTG harvesting is encouraged in cases of adequate palatal fibromucosa thickness to allow for sufficient tissue grafting and remaining palatal soft tissue coverage.</p><p id="Par13">Although, in thin palatal tissues, it is impossible to harvest adequate soft tissue thickness without palatal necrosis and post-operative pain, so DFGG is used as an alternative for CTG, which allows for harvesting free gingival graft and then de-epithelialized with the blade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Additionally, DFGG involves the superficial denser, firmer, and more stable connective tissue closer to epithelium with better quality and promising root coverage results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. A recent systematic review has proposed a buccal fat pad graft as an alternative to CTG in GR treatment to overcome the shortcomings of pain, discomfort, and patient morbidity following palatal tissue harvesting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p id="Par14">The buccal fat pad (BFP) is a specialized adipose tissue on both sides of the buccal space. It is notable for its lipid content, which is not influenced by regular fat metabolism (lipolysis), and its role in facilitating intermuscular movement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Most importantly, it has been shown that the BFP contains undifferentiated mesenchymal stem cells, which have the potential for differentiation and regeneration, making it a promising site for adipose grafting and osteocartilage regeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Furthermore, adipocytes from the BFP exhibit increased osteoblastic activity, indicating their potential in regenerative applications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p id="Par15">Since its initial use by Egyedi for closing oro-antral communications, the BFP has been utilized in various surgical procedures, particularly for repairing defects from malignant or traumatic lesions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Few previous studies have explored applying BFP as pedicled or non-pedicled grafts in treating different Miller&#x02019;s classes of gingival recession [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Therefore, this study hypothesized that the free BFP graft (FBPFG) might serve as a viable and less invasive surgical treatment modality for GR when used in combination with coronally advanced flap (CAF), compared to the use of de-epithelialized free gingival graft (DFGG) harvested from the palate.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study populations</title><p id="Par16">This randomized controlled clinical trial was registered on the Pan African Clinical Trials Registry and approved on 17/07/2023 (Trial no: PACTR202307891237031).

The coronally advanced flap (CAF) is the most frequently used procedure for root coverage trials, with the connective tissue graft (CTG) being the gold standard autogenous graft. In this RCT, the free buccal pad fat graft (FBPFG) was evaluated as an alternative autogenous graft in comparison with the de-epithelialized free gingival graft (DFGG) for localized gingival recession RT1 (Cairo et al. classification) treatment. The FBPFG is frequently applied in numerous oral surgical interventions, such as oroantral and oronasal fistula closure, and in repairs after various malignant or traumatic lesions due to its rich blood supply, adequate tissue volume, consistent quality, ability to epithelialize, safety, elasticity, and its fat-derived stem cells that promote angiogenesis and osteogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]</p><p id="Par48">DFGG was considered an alternative to traditional CTG harvesting methods, such as the trap door technique [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. This approach enables precise control over graft thickness and avoids deeper tissues containing fatty and glandular components, reducing patient discomfort and morbidity. Notably, the depth and height of the graft harvest are more crucial to patient outcomes than the nature of wound healing (primary or secondary) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par49">In this trial, both DFGG and BPF were utilized in conjunction with CAF, which is regarded as the most effective technique for single and multiple root coverage procedures, as it maintains blood supply to the marginal gingiva [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] and has a greater possibility of achieving complete coverage of the root surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. The results indicated that the DFGG group had better outcomes in PD reduction, CAL gain, RD reduction, GT increase, and WKT increase at the 3- and 6-month follow-up compared to the BPF group.</p><p id="Par50">These findings may be attributed to the effectiveness of combining CAF with DFGG, as this approach is recognized as the gold standard in GR treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. This combination enhances the likelihood of complete coverage of the root surface, gingival margin stability over time, and increases in GT and WKT due to the realignment of the mucogingival junction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Conversely, in the FBPFG group, achieving consistent graft dimensions proved challenging, and stabilization on the root surface was complex due to the tissue's gliding nature. Initially, there was a bulging increase in tissue thickness. Still, subsequent healing led to tissue relapse in all dimensions, resulting in incomplete root coverage, increases in PD, CAL, and RD, and decreases in GT and WKT.</p><p id="Par51">Interestingly, these results contrast with those of Deliberador et al. (2015) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], who reported comparable outcomes for subepithelial connective tissue grafts (SCTG) and non-pedicled buccal fat pad grafts, particularly noting the advantages of SCTG in long-term root coverage maintenance. They also observed an initial WKT increase after one month, consistent with our findings. They highlighted that the buccal fat pad is a structured tissue that, unlike subcutaneous fat, is not influenced by lipid metabolism, maintaining its volume for a specific duration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Moreover, Kamal et al. (2021) demonstrated a significant increase in WKG in the buccal pad fat group at the 6-month follow-up after using the vestibular incision subperiosteal tunnel access technique, in comparison to the control group, which is consistent with our outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]</p><p id="Par52">This RCT also revealed a significant variance in pain perception between both groups, as measured by the VAS on the 1&#x02009;st and 2nd days (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). In the FBPFG group, the pain was minimal compared to the DFGG group, as the graft was taken from the cheek mucosa, sutured, and allowed to heal primarily, leading to little or no pain. However, no significant statistical change was found postoperatively on the 4&#x02009;th, 7&#x02009;th, and 14 th days, which may be attributed to the minimally invasive DFGG harvesting technique. This technique, involving shallow depth and small size, along with gel foam dressings and crossover sutures, helped reduce patient discomfort.</p><p id="Par53">Furthermore, there was no significant variance in DH between both groups. However, the two groups showed a significant statistical improvement at the 3-month and 6-month follow-ups compared to baseline (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). This improvement is likely attributed to proper oral hygiene practices, thorough root surface debridement during surgery, root surface bio-modification with EDTA gel, and the successful root coverage achieved through surgical procedures.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Conclusion and clinical significance</title><p id="Par54">In conclusion, the study emphasizes that combining CAF and DFGG remains the gold standard for treating localized GR, delivering superior aesthetics and adequate keratinized tissue gain in width (WKG) and thickness (GT). This approach supports the long-term stability of the gingival margin with minimal postoperative pain and discomfort. However, FBPFG could be a suitable alternative when only a moderate reduction in GR and a modest increase in WKG and GT are required, with the added benefit of lower donor site morbidity.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Limitations and recommendations</title><p id="Par55">Due to the short-term follow-up period (6 months), the focus has primarily been on localized GR defects, and a limited number of randomized clinical trials evaluating the use of FBPFG in GR treatment, as most reported studies in the literature were case reports and case series. Therefore, we recommend conducting further multicenter randomized clinical trials that consider both localized and multiple GR defects with longer follow-up periods and larger sample sizes to more thoroughly assess the clinical outcomes of FBPFG in treating GR.</p></sec><sec id="Sec99" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>
