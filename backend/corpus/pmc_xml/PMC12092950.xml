However, its effects on fertility remain unclear. We present the case of a 32-year-old woman who developed secondary infertility after undergoing UAE for severe PPH following a stillbirth at 37 weeks of gestation. Despite the resumption of regular menstruation, the endometrium remained persistently thin, and hysterosalpingography revealed narrowing of the uterine cavity. She underwent assisted reproductive technology (ART), but repeated frozen-thawed embryo transfer (FET) cycles resulted in implantation failure. Although she eventually conceived, she experienced a missed abortion at seven weeks. No specific causes for the miscarriage were identified. This case highlights that even in the absence of intrauterine adhesions or amenorrhea, endometrial thinning and uterine cavity narrowing after UAE can contribute to infertility and miscarriage. UAE should be carefully considered in women desiring future pregnancies, and alternative hemostatic measures should be prioritized when possible.

The causes of PPH are often categorized using &#x0201c;four Ts&#x0201d;: uterine atony (tone), birth canal laceration (trauma), retained placenta and placental abnormalities such as placenta accreta spectrum (tissue), and coagulation disorders (thrombin) [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Initial management involves assessing blood loss, stabilizing vital signs through fluid resuscitation and transfusion, administering uterotonic agents, and performing uterine fundal massage. Subsequent interventions, such as balloon tamponade, uterine compression sutures, manual removal of the placenta, laceration repair, and treatment for disseminated intravascular coagulation, are performed based on the underlying cause.</p><p>Hysterectomy has traditionally been the last resort for uncontrolled PPH. However, in recent years, uterine artery embolization (UAE) has become an increasingly popular minimally invasive treatment that does not require laparotomy or general anesthesia. In Japan, more than 100 medical institutions offer UAE for PPH [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. UAE has several advantages over hysterectomy, including reduced blood loss, shorter procedure time, and a shorter hospital stay [<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. It also preserves the uterus, making fertility preservation possible. There have been many reports of successful deliveries following UAE [<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>In contrast, UAE for PPH is associated with an increased risk of placenta accreta and recurrent PPH in subsequent pregnancies [<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Additionally, complications such as intrauterine adhesions and premature ovarian insufficiency can lead to amenorrhea and infertility [<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>-<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. However, the potential contribution of uterine ischemia-induced endometrial thinning to infertility and miscarriage remains unclear.</p><p>This report presents a patient who underwent UAE for PPH following stillbirth. Despite the resumption of menstruation, she developed endometrial thinning, which was strongly suspected to have contributed to infertility and miscarriage.</p></sec><sec sec-type="cases"><title>Case presentation</title><p>A 32-year-old woman was referred to Tohoku University Hospital, Japan, with suspected endometrial thinning after 10 months of attempting conception. She was gravida 1, para 1 (G1P1) and had conceived spontaneously at the age of 29. The pregnancy was managed at a local clinic and progressed without complications; however, she experienced a stillbirth at 37 weeks of gestation (birth weight: 2812 g) at the age of 30. The cause was presumed to be excessive umbilical cord twisting.</p><p>Thirteen hours postpartum, she experienced significant hemorrhage, losing 1270 mL of blood, and the bleeding persisted. On postpartum day 3, ultrasonography revealed a retained placenta, prompting a transfer to a regional hospital. The patient had no history of uterine fibroids or coagulation disorders. She developed anemia with a hemoglobin level of 4.7 g/dL, necessitating the transfusion of 8 units of red blood cells and 2 units of fresh frozen plasma. Computed tomography revealed extravasation in the uterine cavity (Figure <xref rid="FIG1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Consequently, bilateral UAE was performed using gelatin sponge fragments prepared by pumping. On postpartum day 5, after confirming by ultrasonography that there was no residual blood flow in the placenta and no findings suggestive of placenta accreta, 130 g of the retained placenta was removed using placental forceps. Her white blood cell count rose to 16.36 &#x000d7; 10&#x02079;/L, and C-reactive protein levels peaked at 244.6 mg/L, suggesting an intrauterine infection. The patient was treated with intravenous cefmetazole, followed by oral amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, and was discharged on postpartum day 8.</p><fig position="anchor" fig-type="figure" id="FIG1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Contrast-enhanced computed tomography image before uterine artery embolization at a regional hospital</title><p>Computed tomography shows a retained placenta and extravasation (arrowheads) into the uterine cavity.</p><p>A) Sagittal view; B) Coronal view;&#x000a0;C) Axial view</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="cureus-0017-00000082609-i01" position="float"/></fig><p>Her menstruation resumed regularly in a 29-day cycle, with flow subjectively reduced from pre-pregnancy levels. Following her physician&#x02019;s advice, she avoided pregnancy for one year postpartum. She did not use oral contraceptives, a contraceptive implant, or an intrauterine device during this period. At the age of 31 years, she began trying to conceive but was unable to after eight months. She visited a local gynecological clinic at the age of 32 years, where evaluation revealed a small uterus and a thin endometrium measuring only 5 mm in the secretory phase. The physician determined that specialized reproductive treatment was necessary and referred the patient to our hospital&#x02019;s reproductive medicine clinic.</p><p>Infertility screening was performed, and laboratory tests revealed no abnormalities in basal hormone levels, luteal phase progesterone, anti-M&#x000fc;llerian hormone, thyroid function, or Chlamydia trachomatis antibody levels (Table <xref rid="TAB1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The results of her husband's semen analysis were normal (Table <xref rid="TAB2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Ultrasonography, hysterosalpingography, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a small uterine body, thin endometrium, and narrowed uterine cavity (Figure <xref rid="FIG2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The fallopian tubes were normal, and hysteroscopic examination revealed no intrauterine adhesions.

Given its minimally invasive nature and potential for fertility preservation, UAE has become a particularly prevalent alternative to hysterectomy in Japan. However, a known complication is an increased risk of placenta accreta and recurrent PPH in subsequent pregnancies [<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Despite its widespread use, the effect of UAE on fertility remains insufficiently studied [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>-<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. This case suggests that endometrial thinning following UAE may contribute to infertility and miscarriage, warranting further investigation to clarify the relationship between UAE, endometrial thinning, and fertility outcomes.</p><p>In ART, a thin endometrium is associated with lower clinical pregnancy and live birth rates [<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In this case, the significant degree of uterine atrophy indicated that the ischemia caused by UAE was severe. It has been hypothesized that uterine ischemia leads to endometrial thinning, which impairs fertility. Additionally, while a relatively high number of oocytes were retrieved in this case, the number of blastocysts obtained was low. Hypoxic conditions in vivo impair embryonic development [<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], and UAE-induced ovarian hypoxia may result in oocyte damage, reducing embryonic developmental potential.</p><p>Although there are few studies on endometrial thinning caused by UAE, research on uterine necrosis - another ischemic complication - may provide valuable insights [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="REF14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The use of gelatin sponge for embolization is generally considered safe [<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], and fragments of gelatin sponge were used in this case. However, the use of microembolic agents such as gelatin sponge powder has been linked to an increased risk of uterine necrosis [<xref rid="REF14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]; this was not the case for our patient. The method used to prepare gelatin sponge fragments can also impact embolization. The pumping method produces a higher proportion of smaller particles, while the cutting method results in more uniform particle sizes [<xref rid="REF15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Consequently, Japanese guidelines recommend the cutting method over the pumping method [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Future research should carefully evaluate the type, preparation method, and quantity of embolic agents used in UAE procedures.</p><p>Treatments for endometrial thinning are actively being studied in reproductive medicine. Recent meta-analyses suggest that PRP therapy [<xref rid="REF16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and G-CSF therapy [<xref rid="REF17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] may improve endometrial thickness and clinical pregnancy rates.</p><p>While recent studies have suggested that UAE offers advantages over hysterectomy in treating PPH, particularly due to its minimally invasive nature and strong hemostatic efficacy, the effect of UAE on fertility remains unclear [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>-<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Careful consideration of its indications is essential, especially for women who may desire future pregnancies. In these cases, low-invasive alternatives - such as maximizing the use of multiple uterotonic agents, performing bimanual uterine compression, using balloon tamponade, applying uterine compression sutures, and aggressively administering blood transfusions while attempting to remove retained products of conception - should be prioritized. As demonstrated in this case, some patients may not achieve live births after UAE. Therefore, UAE should be viewed as an alternative to hysterectomy rather than a definitive fertility-preserving treatment. Further research is required to refine UAE techniques to better preserve fertility potential.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This case highlights that even in the absence of intrauterine adhesions or amenorrhea, endometrial thinning after UAE for PPH can lead to infertility and miscarriage. Although UAE is expected to preserve fertility, it may contribute to infertility and pregnancy loss. When managing PPH, hemostatic methods such as uterotonic agents, bimanual uterine compression, balloon tamponade, and uterine compression sutures should be prioritized. If vital signs can be stabilized with transfusion and fertility preservation is a high priority, UAE should be considered as a last resort, similar to laparotomic hysterectomy.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group content-type="conflict"><title>Disclosures</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Human subjects:</bold> Consent for treatment and open access publication was obtained or waived by all participants in this study.
