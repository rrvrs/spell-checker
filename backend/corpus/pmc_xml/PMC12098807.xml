In addition to traditional in-person lectures or grand rounds, education may be supplemented by online or asynchronous content. The preferences of EM physicians for faculty education content and format are not well understood.&#x000a0;We sought to determine barriers and facilitating factors for EM faculty to participate in educational sessions and/or content, as well as faculty preferences on subject matter, content delivery methods, and personnel.</p><p>Methods</p><p>We performed a cross-sectional&#x000a0;survey of EM faculty physicians from 18 US academic medical centers. Survey invitations were delivered by a site representative at each institution using a Qualtrics survey instrument (Qualtrics, Provo, US). Quantitative data were analyzed with descriptive statistics via percentiles. Qualitative data were analyzed using thematic analysis.</p><p>Results</p><p>A total of 230 individuals from 18 academic departments across the US responded to the survey. Clinical experience ranged from 0-5 years (25%) to 21+ years (20%).

Traditionally, department-sponsored education was termed &#x0201c;grand rounds&#x0201d; and consisted of an in-person lecture delivered in an auditorium [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The advancement of adult pedagogy has shifted the sole reliance on medical lecture-based material [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] to other effective teaching methods, such as skill-based simulation [<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].&#x000a0;In addition, following the COVID-19 pandemic, the format of delivery has changed, with many institutions offering virtual, hybrid, or recorded sessions. In-person sessions also limit participation in healthcare systems that have geographically dispersed facilities and physicians/staff. The contemporary definition of &#x0201c;grand rounds&#x0201d; could be considered any regularly offered department-sponsored faculty education [<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].&#x000a0;</p><p>Although there are an abundance of continuing medical education opportunities for physicians, department-sponsored faculty education can provide unique benefits. These benefits include convenient continuing medical education (CME) hours, promotion of collegiality, interprofessional collaboration, resident learner participation, linkage of hospital care systems, departmental research updates, consistency of practice and knowledge across different emergency departments (EDs)&#x000a0;within a system, and alignment of department practices [<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] with evidence. The goals for this education may vary by institution. As departmental leaders plan their faculty education programs, they should consider their desired outcomes as well as faculty preferences and interests.</p><p>There is minimal research on the preferences of EM physicians concerning faculty education. Academic medical literature does suggest various improvements for contemporary grand rounds, but the unique schedules, interests, and practice patterns in EM must be considered when implementing changes. Preferences for the mode of delivery of CME for EM faculty have been studied [<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], but were not specific to department-based education. Similarly, motivation for attending resident-specific but not faculty-focused educational sessions has been evaluated [<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Furthermore, faculty preferences have likely changed since the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>During the pandemic, there was an increase in online, synchronous, asynchronous, and hybrid delivery of faculty education [<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In-person meetings decreased significantly, with multiple studies assessing this experience among EM faculty and residents [<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>-<xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], as well as the cost-effectiveness of virtual grand rounds [<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Since COVID-19, EM residency programs have returned to an in-person format, with a majority also utilizing a hybrid model [<xref rid="REF14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. However, now that in-person meetings have resumed to varying degrees, the current educational preferences of EM faculty remain unknown.</p><p>We sought to discover EM faculty preferences, needs, and interests related to faculty education. The specific objectives of this study were to determine what motivates EM faculty to attend departmental grand rounds (faculty education) sessions, the barriers they face to attending, the best delivery methods, and the preferred content and speaker types.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>We conducted a multi-institutional, cross-sectional, survey-based study aimed at understanding the experiences and perspectives of EM faculty physicians from 18 academic medical centers across the US. The study was designed to gather comprehensive data through a structured survey distributed via a Qualtrics platform (Qualtrics, Provo, US). Invitations to participate in the survey were sent by faculty site representatives at each of the 18 institutions. These representatives were part of a network of EM&#x000a0;faculty, all of whom were alumni of the American College of Emergency Physicians' Teaching Fellowship [<xref rid="REF15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. This network of experienced physicians collectively formed the EM Faculty Education Research Team, which played a pivotal role in facilitating the study across multiple institutions.</p><p>The survey included both quantitative and qualitative data components. For the quantitative data, descriptive statistics, including percentiles and Likert scale responses, were employed to provide a detailed analysis of trends and patterns across various aspects of EM faculty development. Qualitative data were analyzed through descriptive analysis, allowing for an&#x000a0;exploration of the nuanced experiences and insights of the faculty members. This combination of methodologies ensured a robust and comprehensive understanding of the subject matter.</p><p>Participation in the study was voluntary, and all responses were anonymous. No identifying information was collected from the participants, preserving their privacy throughout the process. The study was reviewed and deemed Institutional Review Board (IRB)-exempt by the IRB of the University of North Carolina (UNC) under protocol number #24-0732. This exemption was granted due to the nature of the study, which involved anonymous survey data without any identifiable personal information.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>A total of 230 individuals from 18 different departments across the US&#x000a0;responded to the survey.

Considering this, they prefer hybrid options to allow for more flexible attendance opportunities, consistent with recent studies exploring virtual and hybrid grand rounds formats in the wake of COVID-19 [<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>-<xref rid="REF14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>Finally, as organizers are selecting speakers, they should keep in mind the areas that the faculty most want to learn about or that are most memorable. In this survey, we brought to light the key areas in which faculty want more education. The topics tended to cluster around high acuity or procedural skills&#x000a0;as well as teaching and professional development topics.</p><p>This study has several limitations. As a survey-based study, there may be a potential survey response bias. The focus of this study was academic medical faculty, which may limit its generalizability to non-academic sites. In addition, while we successfully surveyed over 200 faculty members from 18 institutions, there may be additional variability across the more than 200 academic medical centers in the US, which could limit generalizability. Future research can further hone the broad interests of EM faculty and assess the effectiveness of educational sessions through outcomes or quality improvements.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Given the busy schedules of academic EM physicians and the necessity of regular continuing education, faculty grand rounds sessions provide an important opportunity to contribute to faculty development, engagement, and ultimately, high-quality patient care. Faculty will be more engaged and motivated to attend when the topics, speakers,&#x000a0;format, and schedule&#x000a0;optimally meet their needs and interests. This study can help guide faculty development efforts. We also hope it will serve as inspiration to survey faculty at a site to determine their needs and interests in order to better inform faculty development programming.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We appreciate all the faculty members who completed the survey and the EM Faculty Education Research Team members at each institution who helped disseminate the survey and collect data.
