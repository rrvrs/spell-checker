It is a slow-growing soft tissue tumor of low to intermediate grade. The risk of&#x000a0;metastasis is low, but its likelihood of local recurrence is significant.</p><p>Objective: Our study aims to present the clinical and histological features of DFSP of breast and follow-up.</p><p>Material and methods: Patients with histologically proven DFSP&#x000a0;between 01 January 2010 and 31 October 2023 were identified from a prospectively maintained pathology database. Two senior pathologists reviewed the clinical data and histological slides, and a follow-up was obtained.</p><p>Results: Twenty-six&#x000a0;cases of DFSP breast were diagnosed between 01 January 2010 and 31 October 2023. Out of 26, 10 (38.5%) were male and 16 (61.5%) were female. The mean age of presentation was 37.2 years in females and&#x000a0;40.7 years in males. The mean tumor size in females was 4.7 cm and in males was 5.4 cm. Histologically, the 15 DFSP cases (58%) showed spindle cells arranged in a storiform pattern with honeycomb-type fat infiltration. Fibrosarcomatous transformation was noted in 11 (42%) cases comprising a fascicular pattern. The median follow-up period was 6.1 years. Three (12%) patients experienced recurrence. No recurrence was observed in 23 (88%) patients with complete surgical resection.</p><p>Conclusions: We present the largest series of breast DFSP. The recurrence rate of 12% aligns with&#x000a0;the DFSP of other common sites. Fibrosarcomatous transformation in breast DFSP (42%) is higher as compared to DFSP in other common locations and its long-term clinical behavior cannot be reliably predicted due to lack of long-term follow-up.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>breast</kwd><kwd>dermal lesion</kwd><kwd>dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans</kwd><kwd>low grade</kwd><kwd>sarcoma</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) is a rare soft-tissue sarcoma accounting for 1% to 6% of all soft-tissue sarcomas [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. DFSP is a low-to-intermediate-grade soft tissue tumor that grows slowly and has a high rate of local recurrence but a low risk of metastasis [<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. It is characterized by translocation of the <italic>COLlAl and PDGFRB </italic>genes [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. DFSP can involve any part of the body, with a predilection for the trunk and limbs followed by the genital tract, and rarely the breast. It occurs most frequently between the second and fifth decades of life [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Clinically, it presents as a slow-growing, painless cutaneous mass. It appears as a small, blue-reddish subcutaneous lump that invades the surrounding fascia and subcutaneous tissue, growing slowly [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>Microscopically, DFSP is usually characterized by spindle cells arranged predominantly in a storiform pattern with little nuclear pleomorphism and mitosis. Approximately 85-90% of DFSPs are low-grade, while the remaining cases have a high-grade sarcomatous component, which is typically identified as fibrosarcoma and considered an intermediate-grade sarcoma [<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Fibrosarcomatous DFSP is a rare pathologic variant with more aggressive infiltrative growth and a higher rate of metastasis. Microscopically, fibrosarcomatous DFSP shows fascicular to herringbone growth with a higher degree of pleomorphism and mitotic activity [<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Immunohistochemically, CD34 is positive in 90% of the cases and S100, actin, and desmin are negative [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>Due to the rarity of breast DFSP cases, the data is still under study [<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. We present the largest case series of breast DFSP, including clinicopathological features, and follow-up of patients. The objective of our study is to present the clinical and histological features of DFSP of the breast. Follow-up of patients including history of any post-operative therapy and recurrence was taken.</p><p>This article was previously presented at the 111th United States and Canadian Academy of Pathologists (USCAP) Annual Meeting, held on March 19-24, 2022, and its&#x000a0;abstract was published [<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Study design, inclusion, and exclusion criteria</p><p>This is a descriptive observational study.

It accounts for &#x0003c;0.1% of all malignancies and about 1% to 6% of all soft-tissue sarcomas [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The trunk is the most common site involved (50-60%), followed by limbs (25%), head and neck (10-15%), and rarely breast [<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>The molecular studies showed translocation involving chromosomes 17q22 and 22q13 leading to a fusion protein that promotes the continuous activation of PDGF receptor beta (PDGFR-beta) protein-tyrosine kinase, found in more than 90% of DFSP. It provides the rationale for the use of imatinib mesylate (IM) and other tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) currently used in the treatment of DFSP [<xref rid="REF14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="REF15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Though Wang et al. published a single review in 2020, there are very few cases in the literature, most of them as case reports [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>Breast DFSP presents a well-circumscribed, oval-shaped lesion that is skin-based or intra-mammary&#x000a0;without speculation or microcalcification on mammography. Due to their lack of specificity, these mammography results can be mistaken for benign breast tumors including fibroadenoma, sebaceous cysts, or abscesses. Owing to its infiltrative nature, DFSP frequently spreads beyond the clinical margin [<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>-<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Histologically, DFSP exhibits monomorphous spindle-shaped cells on a background of fibrous stroma arranged in a storiform pattern, with few mitotic figures and mild nuclear pleomorphism. It infiltrates subcutaneous adipose tissue, exhibiting a distinctive "honeycomb" pattern. Immunohistochemically, it is diffusely and strongly CD34 positive as seen in our cases (58%), and negative for keratin, smooth muscle actin (SMA), desmin, and S100 [<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. DFSP has several subtypes including pigmented (Bednar), atrophic, sclerosing, fibrosarcomatous,&#x000a0;giant cell fibroblast-like, granular cell variant, and myxoid DFSP. Fibrosarcomatous dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP-FS) is an aggressive subtype of DFSP, characterized by intermediate-to-high-grade sarcoma, with cytological atypia and increased mitotic rates as compared to DFSP. IHC also revealed a decreased level of CD34 expression in DFSP-FS [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In our study of 9 out of 11 fibrosarcomatous DFSP cases, CD34 staining was weak in the fascicular areas and completely negative in two cases.</p><p>Phyllodes tumor of the breast, nodular fasciitis, classic-type myofibroblastoma, solitary fibrous tumor, and desmoid-type fibromatosis are among the differential diagnoses for DFSP in the breast&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Nodular fasciitis presents clinically as a rapidly growing mass and is composed of fibroblasts and/or myofibroblasts with no significant cytological atypia or pleomorphism. They are positive for SMA; can have focal desmin positivity; and are negative for keratins, CD34, S100, and beta-catenin. Myofibroblastomas are typically slow-growing and exhibit short intersecting fascicles with interspersed variably hyalinized collagen bundles. In contrast to DFSP, they are typically positive for desmin and CD34, along with the estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and androgen receptor. Breast fibromatosis exhibits a more infiltrative pattern, entraps lobules and mammary ducts, and is nuclear positive for beta-catenin. Phyllodes tumors have a biphasic growth pattern with both stromal and epithelial components. It is possible to confuse fibrosarcomatous transformation of DFSP with significant stromal overgrowth with malignant phyllodes tumors. In these cases, immunohistochemical stains are not helpful; instead, the identification of remaining epithelial structures through thorough sampling is necessary for the diagnosis of phyllode&#x000a0;tumors [<xref rid="REF15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>Wide local surgical excision (WLE) is the standard treatment for localized DFSP tumors. The safe resection margin is still uncertain, although an excision of at least 2 to 3 cm, including skin, subcutaneous tissue, and fascia, is widely recognized because histologically tumor-free margins differ greatly from clinically free ones. Mohs Micrographic Surgery (MMS) produces improved tridimensional margin control by allowing the extent of excision to be tailored to the microscopic extent of the tumor [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. When compared to WLE, MMS provides comparable but reduced local recurrence rates. The prognosis of the disease is not improved by elective lymph node excision [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="REF16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>-<xref rid="REF21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Three patients who had recurrence had margins involved at the time of initial biopsy, in our study. The remaining patients had a mean distance of 1.5 cm from the resection margin.</p><p>The response of DFSP to adjuvant treatment including chemotherapy and radiotherapy is studied by various studies. For recurrent tumors or unresectable residual lesions, adjuvant radiotherapy is recommended to control the progression of the disease. Furthermore, Chen et al. [<xref rid="REF22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] showed that adjuvant radiation therapy might be taken into consideration for all patients undergoing surgical excision, regardless of the surgical margin, in a meta-analysis involving 167 DFSP patients treated with adjuvant radiation [<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Furthermore, studies showing a decrease in DFSP tumor size and the response rates of neoadjuvant imatinib are reported. In a phase II trial with two-month neoadjuvant imatinib therapy, 36% of patients showed a clinical response [<xref rid="REF15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In a separate trial, Han et al. [<xref rid="REF20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] noted clinical response rates with an average preoperative tumor size decrease of 36.9% [<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="REF20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="REF21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. No patient received any adjuvant therapy in our case series.</p><p>DFSP has a low propensity for metastasis and a significant probability of local recurrence. Although late recurrences have also been seen, most local recurrences occur within three years after surgery. Therefore, it is advised that long-term follow-up should be done for breast DFSP cases. In our series, three individuals had recurrences, with a mean interval of about 10 years. The poor prognostic characteristics of DFSP include&#x000a0;advanced age, a large tumor size, the DFSP-FS subtype, and inadequate resection [<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Rarely, 1-4% of systemic metastasis is seen after several local recurrences. Hematogenous metastases most frequently occur in the lungs [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="REF16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In our study, metastasis to systemic sites was not reported in any patient.&#x000a0;Breast DFSP is difficult to diagnose because of its rarity, capacity to resemble a range of benign and malignant breast diseases, and increased readiness for precise identification and treatment [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>The main limitations of this study include the single-center design and small sample size. A multicenter study would increase the sample size and add the experience of more histopathologists.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We present the clinicopathological features of a large cohort of breast DFSP. The recurrence rate was 12%, which is similar to the recurrence rate seen in DFSP occurring at more common sites. Inadequate surgery with margin involvement was the main cause of recurrence. The fibrosarcomatous transformation in breast DFSP (42%) was higher as compared to DFSP in other common locations including the trunk and proximal extremity. The behavior of fibrosarcomatous DFSP in the breast cannot be reliably assessed as most of these cases have short follow-ups. Long-term follow-up and other clinical studies including molecular studies in the future are recommended.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group content-type="conflict"><title>Disclosures</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Human subjects:</bold> Consent for treatment and open access publication was obtained or waived by all participants in this study.
