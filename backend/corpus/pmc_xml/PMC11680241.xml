MARCH8 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that has been identified as a host restriction factor that inhibits the replication of various viruses. This study elucidated the mechanism by which MARCH8 restricts respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) replication through selective degradation of the viral small hydrophobic (SH) protein. We demonstrated that MARCH8 directly interacts with RSV-SH and catalyzes its ubiquitination at lysine 13, leading to SH degradation via the ubiquitin-lysosomal pathway. Functionally, MARCH8 expression enhances RSV-induced apoptosis through SH degradation, ultimately reducing viral titers. Conversely, an RSV strain harboring the SH-K13R mutation exhibited prolonged SH protein stability and attenuated apoptosis in infected cells, even in the presence of MARCH8. Targeted depletion of MARCH8 enhances cellular survival and potentially increases viral persistence. These findings demonstrate that MARCH8 promotes the early elimination of virus-infected cells by abrogating the anti-apoptotic function of SH, thereby reducing viral transmission. Our study provides novel insights into the interplay between host restriction factors and viral evasion strategies, potentially providing new therapeutic approaches for RSV infections.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>respiratory syncytial virus</kwd><kwd>small hydrophobic protein</kwd><kwd>MARCH8</kwd><kwd>ubiquitination</kwd><kwd>apoptosis</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)</funding-source><award-id>KAKENHI 22K08616</award-id><award-id>23K27641</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by a Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research [KAKENHI 22K08616 to T.O. and 23K27641 to A.R.].</funding-statement></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-viruses-16-01935"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a significant pathogen that primarily infects infants and young children and causes acute respiratory infections characterized by symptoms of bronchitis and pneumonia. Premature infants and those with underlying medical conditions are at a particularly high risk of severe complications, with an estimated 100,000&#x02013;200,000 deaths reported annually [<xref rid="B1-viruses-16-01935" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In recent years, RSV has emerged as a serious threat to even adults and elderly with chronic respiratory diseases, with mortality rates comparable to those of seasonal influenza viruses [<xref rid="B2-viruses-16-01935" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Currently, two RSV vaccines are available: GSK Arexvy and Pfizer Abrysvo, which are used in elderly and pregnant women [<xref rid="B3-viruses-16-01935" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Additionally, humanized neutralizing antibodies, such as nilcevimab and palivizumab, are employed for prophylactic use in high-risk infants. However, these antibodies are expensive and require multiple administrations [<xref rid="B4-viruses-16-01935" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-viruses-16-01935" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Despite the availability of RSV vaccines and prophylactic antibodies, the establishment of multiple treatment and prevention strategies to effectively control this highly pathogenic and infectious virus is crucial.</p><p>RSV belongs to the genus Orthopneumovirus within the family Pneumoviridae and possesses a non-segmented negative-sense single-stranded RNA genome of approximately 15 kbp [<xref rid="B6-viruses-16-01935" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The viral genome encodes 11 viral proteins, including viral membrane glycoproteins (G), fusion proteins (F), and small hydrophobic proteins (SH) [<xref rid="B7-viruses-16-01935" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. RSV is classified into subgroups A and B based on their G gene sequence [<xref rid="B8-viruses-16-01935" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Of these, the G, F, and SH proteins are present as membrane proteins on the surface of infectious virus particles. The SH protein is a pentameric glycoprotein comprising approximately 64 amino acids that exhibit pH-dependent ion channel activity and function as a viroporin [<xref rid="B9-viruses-16-01935" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], although the precise role in viral replication remains unclear. Several studies have suggested that SH protein is involved in viral virulence, as SH-deficient viruses have demonstrated attenuated severity in animal models [<xref rid="B10-viruses-16-01935" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Another crucial function of the SH protein is the inhibition of apoptosis through inhibiting TNF-alpha signaling, leading to the attenuation of caspase-8 activity [<xref rid="B11-viruses-16-01935" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-viruses-16-01935" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Cell death plays a vital role in the eradication of infected viruses, suppression of viral proliferation, and prevention of viral spread to the surrounding non-infected cells [<xref rid="B13-viruses-16-01935" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, it remains to be elucidated how SH-mediated inhibition of apoptosis affects viral proliferation and whether host factors counteract this function.</p><p>MARCH8 is a member of the Membrane-Associated RING-CH (MARCH) family of E3 ubiquitin ligases and has emerged as a significant player in innate antiviral immunity. Some viral membrane proteins are ubiquitinated by MARCH8, and the ubiquitinated viral proteins are endocytosed from the cell membrane and subsequently degraded in lysosomes. Therefore, this mechanism can serve as a host defense strategy, reducing the presence of viral components in infected cells and potentially limiting viral spread. [<xref rid="B14-viruses-16-01935" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Several studies unveiled MARCH8&#x02032;s potent antiviral properties, particularly against enveloped viruses [<xref rid="B15-viruses-16-01935" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-viruses-16-01935" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The antiviral activity of MARCH8 was first prominently demonstrated against HIV-1 [<xref rid="B17-viruses-16-01935" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. MARCH8 also exhibits inhibitory effects against other enveloped viruses, including influenza A virus (IAV), Ebola virus (EBOV), and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) [<xref rid="B17-viruses-16-01935" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-viruses-16-01935" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-viruses-16-01935" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The broad-spectrum antiviral activity of MARCH8 suggests a conserved mechanism that potentially targets the common features of enveloped viruses. However, there are no reports that MARCH8 suppresses RSV, a clinically important respiratory enveloped virus.</p><p>In this study, we report that MARCH8 specifically targets the RSV-SH protein for ubiquitination and promotes its degradation through the ubiquitin-lysosomal pathway. We propose that SH degradation serves as a host defense mechanism to efficiently eliminate infected cells by attenuating the apoptosis-inhibitory activity of SH. Furthermore, we identified a novel SH mutant capable of evading suppression by MARCH8, revealing a previously unknown virus&#x02013;host antagonism. These findings provide important insights that may contribute to the development of novel therapeutic strategies against RSV infections.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-viruses-16-01935"><title>2.

MARCH Family Proteins Target RSV-SH</title><p>Previous studies have demonstrated that the MARCH family proteins target the M2 protein of influenza viruses, leading to lysosomal degradation and inhibition of viral replication [<xref rid="B19-viruses-16-01935" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Given that M2 is a pentameric membrane protein structurally and functionally similar to the SH protein of RSV, we hypothesized that RSV-SH may also be a target of MARCH proteins. To test this hypothesis, we screened representative MARCH proteins for their ability to promote SH degradation (<xref rid="viruses-16-01935-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A). Co-expression experiments revealed significant down-regulation of SH in cells expressing MARCH1 and MARCH8, whereas the expression of MARCH4 resulted in a slight increase in the SH level compared to that of mStrawberry as a control. (<xref rid="viruses-16-01935-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>B,C). RSV primarily infects epithelial cells in the bronchi and alveoli, where MARCH8 is predominantly expressed.

MARCH8 Downregulates RSV-SH via the Ubiquitin-Lysosome Pathway</title><p>To elucidate the mechanism of MARCH8-mediated RSV-SH degradation, we first investigated the interaction between MARCH8 and SH using RSV-infected cells using immunofluorescence assay and co-immunoprecipitation analysis. Our results demonstrated that SH and MARCH8 co-localized in the cytoplasm in the virus-infected cells (<xref rid="viruses-16-01935-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>A) and SH co-immunoprecipitated with MARCH8 (<xref rid="viruses-16-01935-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>B). We then generated a W114A mutant of MARCH8, which is unable to bind E2 enzymes and lacks the E3 ligase activity. While wild-type MARCH8 effectively degraded RSV-SH, the W114A mutant did not (<xref rid="viruses-16-01935-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>C), indicating that the E3 ligase activity of MARCH8 is crucial for RSV-SH degradation.</p><p>To further investigate the degradation pathway, we conducted an immunofluorescence analysis using Rab7 as a late endosomal/lysosomal marker. In cells co-expressing SH and MARCH8, both proteins co-localized with Rab7-positive puncta, which coincided with reduced SH expression (<xref rid="viruses-16-01935-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>D). However, in cells co-expressing RSV-SH and MARCH8-W114A mutant, the protein was localized in the perinuclear region and plasma membrane, with minimal co-localization in Rab7-positive compartments. This observation is consistent with the inability to ubiquitinate substrate proteins for subsequent endocytosis, resulting in the accumulation of MARCH8-W114A at the plasma membrane. The fluorescence intensity profiles of SH, MARCH8, and Rab7 confirmed that these peaks were often correlated, but less correlation was observed between the fluorescence peaks of SH, MARCH8-W114A, and Rab7 (<xref rid="viruses-16-01935-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>D). To determine the fate of the ubiquitinated RSV-SH, we treated SH and MARCH8 co-transfected cells with either the proteasome inhibitor MG132 or the lysosomal inhibitor chloroquine.

MARCH8 Ubiquitinates RSV-SH on Lysine 13</title><p>Next, we sought to identify the ubiquitination sites of RSV-SH. Initially, we predicted the joint structure of RSV-SH and MARCH8 protein complexes using AlphaFold 3. The predicted biomolecular structures revealed that RSV-SH and MARCH8 interacted via their respective transmembrane domains, with the RING domain of MARCH8 in close proximity to the N-terminal region of pentameric RSV-SH on the cytoplasmic side (<xref rid="viruses-16-01935-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>A). A detailed examination of the cytoplasmic side of RSV-SH revealed that the lysine residue at position 13 of SH protein (K13) was the only lysine residue present in this region (<xref rid="viruses-16-01935-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>A). Amino acid alignment analysis showed that this residue was conserved in RSV-A, RSV-B, and bovine RSVs (<xref rid="viruses-16-01935-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>B). In addition, analysis of over 100 RSV clinical isolates confirmed that K13 in the SH was highly conserved among RSV strains (<xref rid="app1-viruses-16-01935" ref-type="app">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>).</p><p>To test whether K13 was the target of MARCH8-mediated ubiquitination, we constructed an SH-K13R mutant in which lysine was substituted for arginine.

Consistently, immunoprecipitation-based ubiquitination assay showed that wild-type SH, but not the SH-K13R mutant, underwent poly-ubiquitination by MARCH8 (<xref rid="viruses-16-01935-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>D). In addition, it was also shown that the MARCH8-W114A mutant did not ubiquitinate wild-type SH (<xref rid="viruses-16-01935-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>D). Immunofluorescence analysis further demonstrated that wild-type SH localized to Rab7-positive perinuclear puncta with MARCH8, whereas the SH-K13R mutant did not co-localize with Rab7 even with MARCH8 overexpression (<xref rid="viruses-16-01935-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>E).</p><p>Collectively, these results indicate that K13 is the primary ubiquitination site of RSV-SH targeted by MARCH8.

Degradation of SH by MARCH8 Promotes Apoptosis of Infected Cells and Inhibits Virus Replication</title><p>Given previous reports that RSV-SH inhibits cell apoptosis by suppressing TNF-alpha signaling [<xref rid="B12-viruses-16-01935" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], we investigated whether MARCH8-mediated SH degradation affects cellular apoptosis and viral replication. We transfected HEp-2 cells with MARCH8 and subsequently infected them with either the wild-type RSV or the SH-K13R mutant virus at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1. In wild-type RSV-infected cells, MARCH8 overexpression resulted in a significant decline in viral titers at 8 dpi.

This reduction was not observed in SH-K13R mutant virus-infected cells (<xref rid="viruses-16-01935-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>B).

Discussion</title><p>The innate immune system plays a crucial role in the initial defense against viral infections. Among the various components of this system, the Membrane-Associated RING-CH (MARCH) family of proteins has emerged as a significant player in the regulation of immune response. Among the MARCH family proteins, MARCH8 is a potent suppressor of the replication of a broad spectrum of viruses, and its functional role and detailed molecular mechanisms are being elucidated. Understanding the antiviral functions of MARCH8 not only provides insights into host&#x02013;pathogen interactions but also opens new avenues for therapeutic interventions. In this study, we reveal a novel mechanism of MARCH8-mediated antiviral defense against RSV. We demonstrated that MARCH8 specifically targets the RSV-SH protein for degradation via the ubiquitin-lysosome pathway. This mechanism not only restricts viral replication but also influences virus-induced apoptosis, potentially limiting viral spread. Our study unveils a critical host&#x02013;pathogen interaction by highlighting the role of MARCH8 in SH protein degradation and opens new avenues for exploring host-directed antiviral therapies.</p><p>Recent studies have revealed that the MARCH family proteins possess direct antiviral properties, extending their role beyond immune modulation [<xref rid="B14-viruses-16-01935" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-viruses-16-01935" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-viruses-16-01935" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-viruses-16-01935" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-viruses-16-01935" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-viruses-16-01935" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The MARCH family proteins are E3 ubiquitin ligases that primarily function by modulating the surface expression of various immune-related proteins via ubiquitination-mediated degradation or trafficking alterations [<xref rid="B23-viruses-16-01935" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The MARCH family comprises 11 human members, each with distinct but often overlapping functions in immune regulation and cellular homeostasis [<xref rid="B24-viruses-16-01935" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In particular, MARCH8 is a potent antiviral factor against a range of viral species; the molecular basis of the antiviral function of MARCH8 generally lies in its ability to regulate protein trafficking and degradation. By targeting viral envelope proteins for ubiquitination, MARCH8 can alter their cellular localization and direct them toward proteasomal degradation, thereby preventing viral assembly and release [<xref rid="B19-viruses-16-01935" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. MARCH8 inhibits HIV-1 infection by downregulating the viral envelope glycoprotein and reducing its incorporation into virions [<xref rid="B17-viruses-16-01935" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Additionally, MARCH8 has also been identified as a host restriction factor for SARS-CoV-2, where it inhibits viral replication through the degradation of the viral nucleocapsid protein [<xref rid="B25-viruses-16-01935" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The mechanisms by which MARCH proteins exert their antiviral effects are varied and often virus-specific. In some cases, they directly target viral proteins for degradation, while in others, they modulate host factors essential for viral replication [<xref rid="B18-viruses-16-01935" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B26-viruses-16-01935" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. For example, furin-mediated cleavage, which is crucial for viral glycoprotein activation, is inhibited by MARCH8, which further blocks the maturation and entry of avian Influenza Virus H5N1 [<xref rid="B18-viruses-16-01935" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. It is important to note that the antiviral effects of MARCH proteins are not universal. Some viruses have evolved mechanisms to counteract or exploit MARCH proteins for their benefit. For instance, Kaposi&#x02019;s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) encodes viral MARCH proteins that mimic host MARCH functions and potentially subvert the antiviral response [<xref rid="B26-viruses-16-01935" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The present results also show that RSVs harboring the K13 mutation in SH can escape from the MARCH8 suppression. Such virus&#x02013;host antagonism may have implications for virus evolution and epidemics. On the other hand, RS viruses with a mutation in the K13 residues have not yet been found in the viral genome database. This may be because the conservation of this amino acid is essential for SH function. More detailed molecular and genetic analyses will be needed to answer these intriguing questions.</p><p>The intricate interplay between viral infection and host cell apoptosis is a critical aspect of viral pathogenesis and host defense mechanisms [<xref rid="B27-viruses-16-01935" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Although apoptosis of infected cells can serve as a host defense mechanism to limit viral spread, many viruses have evolved strategies to inhibit this process. For example, human papillomavirus (HPV) expresses the E6 protein, which targets the tumor suppressor p53 for degradation, thereby preventing apoptosis [<xref rid="B28-viruses-16-01935" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Similarly, the adenovirus E1B-19K protein functions as a Bcl-2 homolog, inhibiting pro-apoptotic proteins such as Bax and Bak [<xref rid="B29-viruses-16-01935" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Furthermore, the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) produces BHRF1, another Bcl-2 mimic, which blocks the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria [<xref rid="B30-viruses-16-01935" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. These examples illustrate the diverse mechanisms used by viruses to prolong the survival of infected cells, thereby facilitating their replication and spread. Our findings suggest that the RSV-SH protein functions as an anti-apoptotic factor, potentially promoting viral persistence and spread within the host, consequently enhancing pathogenicity. Notably, our current study identified a novel host counteraction to this viral strategy, in which the host protein MARCH8 appeared to target the SH protein for ubiquitin-dependent degradation, effectively neutralizing its anti-apoptotic activity. This host-mediated degradation of the SH protein may facilitate the rapid elimination of virus-infected cells through apoptosis, thereby limiting viral replication and mitigating tissue damage.</p><p>RSV is the major pathogen of respiratory tract infections worldwide, often causing severe respiratory infections in infants and the elderly. The role of RSV-SH in virus pathogenicity and infectivity has not been fully understood. SH proteins can form pentameric ion channels in lipid bilayers [<xref rid="B9-viruses-16-01935" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B12-viruses-16-01935" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Although this ion channel function was initially thought to be essential for viral replication, studies with RSV lacking the SH gene (RSV&#x00394;SH) have overturned this theory. Rather, evidence is accumulating to suggest that SH plays an important role in RSV pathogenicity and immune evasion, independent of its ion channel function. Studies using recombinant RSV&#x00394;SH have demonstrated attenuated viral growth in vivo and reduced lung pathology in animal models [<xref rid="B10-viruses-16-01935" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Indeed, SH can activate the NLRP3 inflammasome, leading to IL-1&#x003b2; production, which may contribute to RSV-induced inflammation [<xref rid="B31-viruses-16-01935" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. These data suggest that SH plays an important role in the inflammatory response in RSV infection. Also, SH protein inhibits apoptosis of infected cells by blocking TNF-&#x003b1; signaling [<xref rid="B12-viruses-16-01935" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. As TNF-&#x003b1; is a major inflammatory cytokine and is involved in inflammation and pathogenesis in infected hosts, MARCH8 may also be involved in the suppression of disease progression and severity via SH degradation. To clarify the anti-inflammatory function of MARCH8, further detailed in vivo analysis using animal models is needed.</p><p>Our findings demonstrate that MARCH8 acts as a potent restriction factor against RSV through selective degradation of the SH protein. These results not only advance our understanding of host&#x02013;pathogen interactions but also raise intriguing possibilities for therapeutic applications. Currently, no specific small molecule modulators directly targeting MARCH8 have been identified, although several physiological factors are known to regulate its expression and activity. For instance, the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 has been reported to upregulate MARCH8 expression in immune cells, particularly in monocytes and dendritic cells [<xref rid="B32-viruses-16-01935" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. This regulation suggests that the activity of MARCH8 is integrated within broader immune regulatory networks. Moreover, MARCH8 represents a promising therapeutic target for several reasons. First, as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, it belongs to a protein family that has proven amenable to drug development, as exemplified by successful therapeutic targeting of other E3 ligases in various disease contexts [<xref rid="B33-viruses-16-01935" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B34-viruses-16-01935" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Second, its broad-spectrum antiviral activity suggests that MARCH8-based therapeutics might be effective against multiple viral pathogens [<xref rid="B18-viruses-16-01935" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-viruses-16-01935" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B35-viruses-16-01935" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Third, its cellular localization and structure could potentially allow for small molecule intervention [<xref rid="B35-viruses-16-01935" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="B36-viruses-16-01935" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. However, therapeutic manipulation of MARCH8 requires careful consideration of potential side effects. MARCH8 regulates multiple cellular proteins, including important immune receptors such as IL-1RAP and CD44, as well as trafficking proteins like VAMP3 and CD166 [<xref rid="B37-viruses-16-01935" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="B38-viruses-16-01935" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="B39-viruses-16-01935" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Enhanced MARCH8 activity could, therefore, impact various cellular processes, including immune responses and cellular trafficking pathways, resulting in the potential disruption of normal cell&#x02013;cell communication. Future studies should focus on developing specific MARCH8 modulators while carefully evaluating their effects on cellular homeostasis. The development of tissue-specific or activation-dependent MARCH8 modulators might help minimize potential side effects while maintaining therapeutic efficacy. Additionally, a detailed investigation of the regulatory mechanisms of MARCH8 could reveal more subtle intervention points that allow for fine-tuned therapeutic approaches.</p><p>In conclusion, we have demonstrated that MARCH8 restricts RSV replication by degrading the viral SH protein and enhancing cellular apoptosis, which is a significant component of the host antiviral defense system. Their diverse mechanisms of action and the ability of MARCH family proteins to target multiple stages of the viral lifecycle make them promising subjects for further research in the field of antiviral immunity. As our understanding of these proteins increases, so does the potential for the development of novel antiviral therapies that exploit their functions.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank Naomi Shiomatsu for technical support.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclaimer/Publisher&#x02019;s Note:</bold> The statements, opinions and data contained in all publications are solely those of the individual author(s) and contributor(s) and not of MDPI and/or the editor(s).

MARCH8 mRNA expression levels in control (sh-control) and MARCH8-knockdown (KD) (sh-MARCH8#1 and sh-MARCH8#2) A549 cell lines were examined by conventional RT-PCR using primers specific for MARCH8 (<bold>A</bold>). Control and MARCH8-KD A549 cells were infected with wt-RSVand the cells were collected and subjected to western blotting with the appropriate antibodies to detect each protein (<bold>B</bold>). Control and MARCH8-KD A549 cells were infected with wt-RSV. At various time points (indicated), aliquots of the cell culture medium were collected, and the viral titer was measured as TCID<sub>50</sub> (<bold>C</bold>). The virus-infected cells were fixed and stained with Hoechst stain, and the number of viable cells from more than 10 images was counted (<bold>D</bold>). The TUNEL assay was performed to quantify cell death by apoptosis. Representative images in TUNEL assays of control and MARCH8-KD cells (<bold>E</bold>). Viral titers and the number of viable MARCH8-KD cells were compared with those in control cells.
