To confirm the location, a peroral cholangioscopy was performed. The connection with the cyst was detected in the right hepatic duct and a villous tumor mucosa protruded through the conduit lumen. Since we found that the lesion communicated with the right hepatic duct, a right hepatectomy was subsequently performed. The postoperative pathological diagnosis was an intraductal papillary neoplasm of the blie duct&#x000a0;with associated invasive carcinoma. The postoperative course was good, and the patient experienced no recurrence.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-generated"><kwd id="deo270001-kwd-0001">bile duct</kwd><kwd id="deo270001-kwd-0002">intraductal papillary neoplasm of the bile duct</kwd><kwd id="deo270001-kwd-0003">mucobilia</kwd><kwd id="deo270001-kwd-0004">peribiliary glands</kwd><kwd id="deo270001-kwd-0005">peroral cholangioscopy</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="funding-0001"><funding-source>None.</funding-source></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="4"/><table-count count="0"/><page-count count="6"/><word-count count="2347"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>source-schema-version-number</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>cover-date</meta-name><meta-value>April 2025</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>details-of-publishers-convertor</meta-name><meta-value>Converter:WILEY_ML3GV2_TO_JATSPMC version:6.5.4 mode:remove_FC converted:27.02.2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="deo270001-sec-0010"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Peribiliary glands exist around the large bile ducts and secrete mucinous glycoprotein.<xref rid="deo270001-bib-0001" ref-type="bibr">

</xref> IPNB is pathologically defined as a biliary neoplasm with papillary growth and includes low&#x02010;grade dysplasia to invasive carcinoma. It has delicate fibrovascular stalks and papillary epithelium covers the surface. Most IPNBs arise from large bile ducts, and dilated bile ducts filled with a papillary neoplasm are the diagnostic feature. IPNB is considered a precancerous condition of cholangiocarcinoma; therefore, surgery is generally performed. In the present case, the IPNB bordered both hepatic ducts extensively, and it was necessary to confirm the bile duct connection with the IPNB to determine accurate hepatic resection. We report a case of IPNB suspected to be of peribiliary glands origin for which we were able to obtain the accurate localization and the preoperative pathological diagnosis using peroral cholangioscopy (POCS).</p></sec><sec id="deo270001-sec-0020"><title>CASE REPORT</title><p>An 80&#x02010;year&#x02010;old Japanese man without any symptoms or history was referred to our hospital for a hepatic mass.

Blood tests at the first visit showed no elevation in hepatobiliary enzymes or inflammatory response markers. The results of tumor markers were as follows: CEA, 0.9 ng/mL; CA19&#x02010;9, 43.8 U/mL; AFP,2.6 ng/mL; PIVKA2, 3 mAU/mL; DUPAN2, &#x0003c;25 U/mL; and Span&#x02010;1, 13.4 U/mL.</p><p>Transabdominal ultrasound (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="deo270001-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>) revealed a 38 &#x000d7; 30 mm cystic lesion with a hyperechoic lobulated component in S1/4.

The IPNB consisted of the tumor epithelium lining the cyst and the papillary mucosa in the lumen. The tumor epithelium was accompanied by large, clear cells and papillary growth on the surface of fibrovascular stalks, and mucus production was observed. These findings suggested gastric type IPNB. Low&#x02010;grade and high&#x02010;grade dysplasia were also observed within the IPNB, and a tiny part of the lesion invaded the liver beyond the cyst. The tubular structure was maintained, and the invaded area was well&#x02010;differentiated adenocarcinoma. The final pathological diagnosis was IPNB with associated invasive carcinoma, suspected to be of peribiliary glands origin.

In addition, IPNB is classified as type 1 or 2, which was suggested by a Japanese&#x02013;Korean study group; type 1 is considered a classical IPNB and corresponds to a tumor similar to IPMN, and type 2 corresponds to conventional papillary cholangiocarcinoma. Type 1 IPNB, which is considered the counterpart of IPMN, is characterized by dilated bile ducts filled with papillary neoplasm&#x02010;producing mucobilia. Therefore, the present case was considered a type 1 IPNB. IPMNs can be classified into the following three types: main duct type, branch duct type, and mixed type. Nakanuma et&#x000a0;al.<xref rid="deo270001-bib-0006" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>6</sup>
</xref> applied this classification to type 1 IPNB and reported that IPNB originating from peribiliary glands was considered branch duct IPNB.</p><p>Generally, biliary tract tumors are speculated to be derived from the transformation of biliary stem cells.<xref rid="deo270001-bib-0007" ref-type="bibr">

</xref> Cardinale et&#x000a0;al.<xref rid="deo270001-bib-0008" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>8</sup>
</xref> reported that peribiliary glands contain stem cells that can differentiate into biliary and pancreatic cells. These findings are supported by the fact that, embryologically, the biliary and pancreatic primordia develop from the foregut at approximately the same time and are highly plastic. The presence of stem cells within the peribiliary glands suggests that type 1 IPNBs, similar to IPMNs, may originate from the peribiliary glands, and several studies have indicated this.<xref rid="deo270001-bib-0003" ref-type="bibr">

<sup>5</sup>
</xref> In IPNBs originating from peribiliary grands, neoplastic papillary lesions develop from the glandular epithelium, and peribiliary glands enlarge in a cystic shape while producing mucus.<xref rid="deo270001-bib-0009" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>9</sup>
</xref> Therefore, unlike ordinary IPNBs, there is no dilation or neoplastic changes in the bile duct, and it is observed as a cystic lesion that communicates with the bile duct.</p><p>In the present case, the lesion was connected to the right hepatic duct through the conduit, with no mucosal changes observed in the large bile duct itself. The characteristics of the lesion were secreted mucus and cystic shape with no distal bile duct dilation. Furthermore, the lesion was located in the perihilar bile duct, an area with abundant peribiliary glands, and there were non&#x02010;neoplastic peribiliary glands nearby. Therefore, the lesion was considered an IPNB suspected to be of peribiliary glands origin.</p><p>Usually, branch duct IPNBs have a connection with bile ducts. However in the present case, the IPNB was widely bordered by both hepatic ducts, and it was difficult to identify accurate localization. Furthermore, mucobilia caused contrast defects, and we might overestimate the extent of progression via ERC. Therefore, it was difficult to determine whether right or left hepatic resection should be performed. POCS allowed direct observation of the bile ducts, and we were able to detect accurate connection sites and superficial progression.</p><p>In addition, because POCS can be used to perform biopsies under direct vision, we were able to collect tumor tissue reliably. Draganov et&#x000a0;al.<xref rid="deo270001-bib-0010" ref-type="bibr">

</xref> reported that the positive diagnosis rate of biopsy under direct visualization was greater than that of biopsy under fluoroscopy. Particularly in the present case, we assumed that it would be difficult to press the biopsy forceps against the tumor under fluoroscopy because a tiny portion of the IPNB protruded from the conduit. Furthermore, POCS can detect superficial progression, which may contribute to improving the diagnostic process.</p><p>In conclusion, POCS played a central role in the treatment of the IPNB and enabled an accurate surgical approach based on the location of the IPNB.</p></sec><sec sec-type="COI-statement" id="deo270001-sec-0050"><title>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT</title><p>None.</p></sec><sec id="deo270001-sec-0060"><title>ETHICS STATEMENT</title><p>All procedures were performed in accordance with the ethical standards of the Declaration of Helsinki and its later amendments.</p></sec><sec id="deo270001-sec-0070"><title>PATIENT CONSENT STATEMENT</title><p>Informed consent was obtained from the patient for the publication of this case report.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="deo270001-sec-0040"><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>We are grateful to the previous and present staff of the gastroenterology and pathology laboratories at Toyohashi Municipal Hospital.</p></ack><ref-list id="deo270001-bibl-0001"><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="deo270001-bib-0001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal" id="deo270001-cit-0001">
