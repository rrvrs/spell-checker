In Tunisia, factors like working hours, the frequency of monthly shifts, and the physical and emotional abuse that physicians face from patients have collectively led to a significant incidence of burnout among medical professionals.</p></sec><sec id="sec9480"><title>Objectives</title><p>To evaluate the prevalence of burnout syndrome among medical residents working in healthcare facilities in Tunisia and to pinpoint the contributing factors.</p></sec><sec id="sec9481"><title>Methods</title><p>This study is a descriptive cross-sectional survey conducted among medical residents completing their training in various healthcare facilities in Tunisia. The study employed an online self-administered questionnaire and assessed burnout across three dimensions: personal burnout, professional burnout, and relational burnout, using the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory (CBI).</p></sec><sec id="sec9482"><title>Results</title><p>A total of 50 physicians took part in the survey. Among them, 72% were female, 80% were single, and the average age at the time of the study was 27.72 years. Concerning their professional status, 84% worked in university hospitals, 16% specialized in surgery, 40% specialized in medicine, and 44% were family physicians. The majority were students from the Faculty of Medicine in Sfax (56%), with 30% in Monastir, 8% in Tunis, and 6% in Sousse. Regarding their work hours, more than 40 hours per week were reported by 32% of participants. According to the CBI scale, 12% of participants had scores indicating severe personal burnout, while 20% had scores indicating moderate personal burnout. Additionally,16% reported severe professional burnout, and 12% had scores suggesting severe relational burnout. In contrast, only 8% had scores indicating moderate relational burnout. The sociodemographic and professional factors that were studied, such as weekly working hours, monthly shifts, specialty, and workplace, did not show a significant correlation with the presence of burnout syndrome.</p></sec><sec id="sec9483"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Burnout syndrome among medical resident physicians not only impacts their physical and mental well-being but also reduces their effectiveness and motivation at work. It is essential to introduce stress management strategies within hospitals to foster a healthier work-life balance.</p></sec><sec id="sec9484"><title>Disclosure of Interest</title><p>None Declared</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="1"/></counts></article-meta></front></article>
