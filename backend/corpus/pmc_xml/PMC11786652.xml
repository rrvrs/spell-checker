They are typically identified in childhood, with approximately 80&#x000a0;% of cases diagnosed early. Adult presentations are rare and are often associated with complications, including cholangitis, choledocholithiasis, cyst rupture, secondary biliary cirrhosis, obstructive jaundice, and an increased risk of bile duct cancer [<xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Todani (1977) classified choledochal cysts into five types, with Type IA being the most common, typically presenting in children, and Type IV-A being the second most common [<xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. This case report discusses a 22-year-old female patient with a large Type IV-A choledochal cyst mimicking a hydatid cyst of the liver and its successful surgical management.</p><p id="p0030">This case has been reported in line with the SCARE criteria [<xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="s0010"><label>2</label><title>Case presentation</title><p id="p0035">A 22-year-old female presented to the surgical outpatient department (OPD) with a 3-month history of intermittent light yellowish discoloration of her eyes. Two weeks prior to her visit, the discoloration became deep and constant. She also reported a 5-month history of epigastric and right upper quadrant pain, which was colicky in nature, worsened with food intake, and radiated to her back. Additionally, she experienced intermittent dark urine, clay-colored stools, generalized skin itching, loss of appetite, and significant, unquantified weight loss. She denied fever or any relevant family history. The patient recalled one prior admission to the Emergency Department for cholangitis, which was treated with antibiotics.</p><p id="p0040">On physical examination, her vital signs were stable, with icteric sclerae. Abdominal examination revealed tenderness on deep palpation of the right upper quadrant. On integumentary system examination, scratch marks were noted across her body.

A subsequent CT scan showed a unilocular cystic mass in segment 4 of the liver, measuring 8&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;7.6&#x000a0;cm, with no internal septations. The mass compressed the common hepatic duct, with tortuous dilation and multiple cystic dilations of the intrahepatic biliary ducts, leading to a preliminary diagnosis of hydatid cyst of the liver with intraductal rupture.</p><p id="p0050">Due to diagnostic uncertainty, an MRCP was performed. MRCP revealed dilated intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary ducts, including the common hepatic duct, cystic duct, and common bile duct (CBD), with the CBD being the largest. The dilation spared segment 7. Central dot signs were noted, indicating dilated intrahepatic bile ducts surrounding portal vein branches suggesting a type IV-A choledochal cyst. No filling defects or biliary stenosis were identified. The gallbladder was free of abnormalities, and the ampullary region and pancreatic ducts appeared normal (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>).<fig id="f0005"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Coronal (A) and axial (B) T2-weighted MRI images demonstrating dilated intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary ducts (arrows), with marked dilation of the common bile duct (CBD).</p></caption><alt-text id="al0005">Fig. 1</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="gr1" id="lk0005"/></fig><fig id="f0010"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>MRCP demonstrating dilated intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary ducts (arrows), with marked dilation of the CBD and central dot signs, consistent with a Type IV-A choledochal cyst.</p></caption><alt-text id="al0010">Fig. 2</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="gr2" id="lk0010"/></fig></p><p id="p0055">With a preoperative diagnosis of a type IV-A choledochal cyst, the patient was taken to the OR with informed consent. The abdomen was entered through a right subcostal incision. Intraoperative findings revealed a hugely dilated extrahepatic bile duct extending from the junction of the right and left hepatic ducts to the intrapancreatic portion. The liver appeared bluish but without any palpable or visible masses. The dilated extrahepatic bile duct was carefully dissected from the pancreas and portal vein. At the liver hilum, the cyst involved both the right and left hepatic ducts. A cholecystectomy was performed, and the cyst was opened to identify the trifurcation of the hepatic ducts. The bile duct cyst was resected distal to this point. A Roux-en-Y cysto-jejunostomy was performed in an end-to-side fashion, followed by a side-to-side jejunojejunostomy. The peritoneal cavity was lavaged with warm saline, and a subhepatic drain was placed. The abdomen was closed in layers, and biopsy specimens were sent for histopathological analysis. The patient was transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) with stable vital signs.</p><p id="p0060">Histopathological analysis of the excised cyst revealed a biliary epithelial lining with areas of fibrosis and mild chronic inflammation, consistent with a type IV-A choledochal cyst. No evidence of dysplasia or malignancy was identified.</p><p id="p0065">The patient remained in the ward for 13&#x000a0;days postoperatively, during which she received routine postoperative care and monitoring. She demonstrated steady improvement without any complications or complaints and was subsequently discharged in stable condition. Over the following 6&#x000a0;months, she was regularly followed up in the OPD, during which she reported no new complaints or complications, and her recovery remained uneventful.</p></sec><sec id="s0015"><label>3</label><title>Discussion</title><p id="p0070">The term choledochal cyst refers to a range of congenital biliary tract abnormalities, previously known as idiopathic common hepatic duct dilatation, characterized by abnormal dilation of the biliary ducts [<xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Choledochal cysts are uncommon, occurring in 1:100,000 to 1:150,000 people, and are more prevalent in Asian populations (approximately 1:13,000 individuals). Although they are commonly diagnosed in the pediatric age group, choledochal cysts can present for the first time in adults in 20&#x000a0;% of cases [<xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. While multiple theories have been proposed to explain their development, the most widely accepted is the abnormal union of the pancreaticobiliary duct [<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p id="p0075">Choledochal cysts are classified into five subtypes according to the Todani classification. Type I bile duct cysts consist of Type I-A (cystic dilation of the CBD), Type I&#x02014;B (saccular dilation of the CBD), and Type I&#x02014;C (fusiform dilation extending to the common hepatic duct). Type II cysts are extrahepatic duct diverticula. Type III cysts involve cystic dilation of the intraduodenal portion of the common bile duct (choledochocele). Type IV is subdivided into Type IV-A, characterized by common bile duct cysts with intrahepatic bile duct dilation, and Type IV-B, which involves multiple extrahepatic bile duct cysts without intrahepatic bile duct dilation. Type V is isolated intrahepatic cystic disease (Caroli disease) [<xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In our patient, MRCP findings revealed dilated intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary ducts with a large cystic dilation in the common bile duct, consistent with a Type IV-A choledochal cyst.</p><p id="p0080">The diagnosis and classification of choledochal cysts are established through imaging studies, including ultrasonography (USG), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), and computed tomography (CT). USG is often the preferred initial imaging method for assessing the intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts, as well as the gallbladder, but it may not always clearly identify the cyst's exact origin within the bile duct [<xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. MRCP is regarded as the diagnostic gold standard, with a sensitivity of 90&#x02013;100&#x000a0;% for detecting biliary cysts [<xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p id="p0085">In our case, the findings strongly suggest that the level of obstruction was at the CBD. The patient presented with classic symptoms of obstructive jaundice, including jaundice, dark urine, pale stools, and pruritus, alongside significantly elevated bilirubin levels, which are consistent with bile flow obstruction at the level of the CBD. Imaging studies, particularly MRCP, revealed dilated intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts, with the CBD being the most prominently dilated. The presence of the central dot sign, indicating dilated intrahepatic bile ducts surrounding portal vein branches, further supported the likelihood of obstruction at the CBD. Intraoperative findings also aligned with this, showing a hugely dilated extrahepatic bile duct extending from the hepatic duct junction to the intrapancreatic portion of the CBD.</p><p id="p0090">In regions where echinococcosis is endemic, cystic liver lesions are often presumed to be hydatid cysts, which can lead to misdiagnosis of other conditions with similar presentations, such as Type IV-A choledochal cysts. A study conducted at the University of Istanbul, Cerrahpasa Medical Faculty, reviewed 12 patients diagnosed with choledochal cysts between 1981 and 2000. The study found that three patients (25&#x000a0;%) were initially operated on under the assumption they had liver hydatid cysts; however, intraoperative findings revealed these were actually choledochal cysts [<xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In our patient, the initial ultrasound and CT findings were suggestive of a hydatid cyst of the liver. However, further imaging with MRCP established the correct diagnosis of a Type IV-A choledochal cyst, highlighting the diagnostic challenges in such cases.</p><p id="p0095">Choledochal cysts can result in several complications, including cholecystitis, biliary strictures, cholangitis, recurrent pancreatitis, cholelithiasis, choledocholithiasis, and, occasionally, malignancy. It is particularly important to monitor adults with choledochal cysts, as they have a higher risk of biliary malignancy compared to children. Although there is a risk of cancer development at the residual stump following resection, removal of the cyst significantly reduces this risk [<xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p id="p0100">The recommended management for choledochal cysts is definitive surgical intervention. In a study by Richa et al. involving 35 patients with Type IV-A choledochal cysts, removal of the extrahepatic cyst with drainage of the intrahepatic portion through a wide hilar or sub-hilar anastomosis showed excellent outcomes. For cases with symptomatic intrahepatic involvement, such as cholangitis or biliary cirrhosis, treatment protocols similar to those for Type V cysts are followed, which may involve hepatic resection for localized disease or liver transplantation for widespread involvement [<xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. While hepaticoduodenostomy and Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy are both viable options for biliary reconstruction, the latter is generally preferred [<xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In our patient, a cholecystectomy with extrahepatic bile duct excision and Roux-en-Y cysto-jejunostomy was performed, resulting in excellent postoperative outcomes, as evidenced by the patient's uneventful recovery and lack of complications during the 6-month follow-up period.</p></sec><sec id="s0020"><label>4</label><title>Conclusion</title><p id="p0105">Diagnostic challenges are often faced in differentiating choledochal cysts from other cystic liver lesions, such as hydatid cysts. This is especially true in regions where echinococcal infection is prevalent. This case marks the importance of advanced imaging techniques, particularly MRCP, in accurately identifying and classifying choledochal cysts to guide appropriate management.</p></sec><sec id="s0025"><title>CRediT authorship contribution statement</title><p id="p0110"><bold>Fitsum A.
