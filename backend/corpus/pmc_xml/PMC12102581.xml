Hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S), a signaling gas transmitter, is involved in carbohydrate metabolism. The pathophysiology of &#x003b2;-cell dysfunction in type 1 and 2 diabetes may be significantly affected by alterations in the H<sub>2</sub>S&#x000a0;balance.

Hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S) is endogenously produced from the amino acid L-cysteine by the enzymes cystathionine beta synthase (CBS), cystathionine gamma lyase (CSE), and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfur transferase in mammalian tissues. Alterations in the levels of these enzymes can have a marked effect on the pathophysiology of &#x003b2;-cell dysfunction in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes [<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Alterations in H<sub>2</sub>S homeostasis also influence the endothelial damage caused by persistently or intermittently high blood glucose levels in diabetes [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. It has been suggested by other studies that H<sub>2</sub>S deficiency leads to diabetic nephropathy and cardiomyopathy through oxidative stress modulation [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Ferritin is a 24-subunit protein found throughout the body and is the soluble, nontoxic form of iron, which is the total iron storage in the body. Nonspecifically, ferritin levels rise, and it is recognized as an indicator of both acute and chronic inflammation and acts as an acute phase reactant [<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>-<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Our previous study showed a positive correlation between serum ferritin levels and total oxidative stress (TOS) and a negative correlation with total antioxidant defense (TAD) levels [<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>The clinical importance of understanding this inverse relationship between ferritin and&#x000a0;H<sub>2</sub>S&#x000a0;biomarkers becomes significant because of their fundamental roles in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) pathophysiology. Research shows ferritin functions as an iron-storage protein, yet medical experts now identify it as a pro-inflammatory marker that contributes to insulin resistance and diabetic complication development [<xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. H<sub>2</sub>S protects endothelial function as well as oxidative stress and protects from damage to mitochondria, which contributes to the development of diabetic nephropathy, cardiomyopathy, and neuropathy [<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The negative correlation between these measurements suggests widespread inflammation and redox imbalances occur in diabetic patients. The combination of ferritin and H<sub>2</sub>S measurements shows potential for better predicting vascular and microvascular complications, according to diagnostic research [<xref rid="REF14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Stratification of patients for preventive interventions would become more effective because of this ability. Endogenous H<sub>2</sub>S levels could be pharmacologically or enzymatically increased via supplements and regulators as a new supportive treatment method to fight diabetes-induced inflammation and oxidative damage [<xref rid="REF15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The early discovery of H<sub>2</sub>S imbalances in T2DM patients combined with proper treatment adjustments can potentially reduce disease severity and control complication development to improve both short-term outcomes and long-term life quality for people managing T2DM [<xref rid="REF16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The experimental findings establish an essential biochemical link that provides a basis for future medical research in individualized diabetes management.</p><p>Objectives</p><p>The goal was to determine whether ferritin and serum H<sub>2</sub>S&#x000a0;levels in patients with type 2 diabetes were correlated in any way, with the broader aim of assessing whether this relationship could serve as a potential biomarker profile for early detection of metabolic dysregulation, stratification of inflammatory burden, or identification of patients at higher risk for complications. Establishing such a correlation could inform the development of novel diagnostic tools or therapeutic strategies that target oxidative stress and inflammation in diabetes management.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>The study enrolled 40 patients who had T2DM between 20 and 50 years old alongside 40 control participants who matched the diabetic patients regarding age and sex yet had normal fasting blood glucose levels. The study recruited participants through convenience sampling at Nilratan Sircar (NRS) Medical College, Kolkata's outpatient and inpatient departments, throughout six months of 2015. A pilot investigation determined the sample size through practical constraints and previous exploratory studies about biochemical changes in metabolic conditions. The research sought to establish a connection between H<sub>2</sub>S levels in serum and ferritin measurements in diabetic patients while examining TOS&#x000a0;and TAD&#x000a0;markers for diagnostic or prognostic value assessment.</p><p>The research excluded patients who had medical conditions that could independently affect oxidative stress or inflammatory markers. Research participants were excluded if they had polycystic ovarian syndrome, malignant diseases, chronic renal failure, pregnancy, other endocrine disorders, or were taking antioxidant supplements or medications affecting endogenous H<sub>2</sub>S metabolism.&#x000a0;The study excluded these conditions and interventions because they independently modify oxidative stress and inflammatory pathways that could distort the analysis of serum ferritin and H<sub>2</sub>S levels. The hormonal changes in PCOS and pregnancy affect metabolic and redox homeostasis, while malignancies and chronic renal failure lead to chronic inflammation and iron metabolism disturbances, and antioxidants or H<sub>2</sub>S-altering agents could affect the biochemical markers, which weakens the internal validity of the correlation analysis. Moreover, the study received approval from the Institutional Ethics Committee of NRS Medical College through their decision NMC/490 during their 24-01-2013 meeting. Each participant signed written informed consent before joining the study. The research followed institutional ethical guidelines precisely while reporting study progress updates to the ethics committee according to their requirements.</p><p>Ferritin, TOS, and TAD levels in patients with type 2 diabetes were further investigated as a pilot project in this research. The study excluded patients with conditions such as polycystic ovarian syndrome, malignant diseases, renal failure, pregnant women, other endocrine disorders, and patients taking antioxidant or H<sub>2</sub>S-modifying medications.</p><p>Collection of samples</p><p>Five ml of whole blood was drawn aseptically from a superficial vein following an overnight fast of 8 to 10 hours. Three ml was taken in a plain vial with a clot activator, and 2 ml was taken in a fluoride vial and centrifuged for five minutes at 2500 rpm. Different biochemical parameters were estimated using separated serum, while fasting plasma glucose was estimated using plasma.</p><p>Measurement of H<sub>2</sub>S concentration in serum</p><p>Methods previously described were modified and standardized in our laboratory to assess serum H<sub>2</sub>S [<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].

After that, the mixture was centrifuged for 30 minutes at 3000 rpm.

After being sealed, this tube was allowed to sit at room temperature for 10 minutes. Every sample was analyzed three times, and a calibration curve made using sodium sulfide (NaHS, Sigma-Aldrich, MO, USA) was used to determine the serum H<sub>2</sub>S levels ranging from 25 to 250 &#x000b5;mol/l. The maximum sensitivity of this technique was 25 &#x000b5;mol/l, and its intra- and inter-assay variances were 7.576 and 3.944, respectively [<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Assay of serum ferritin levels and additional parameters</p><p>Conventional enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits (BioRad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) were used to assess serum ferritin.

These findings are in line with earlier studies. Oxidative stress, which is caused by hyperferritinemia, damages pancreatic &#x003b2;-cells. This damage prevents the liver from getting insulin and from insulin effectively reducing hepatic glucose production [<xref rid="REF14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In red blood cells, hyperglycemia leads to an irreversible, non-enzymatic contact between glucose and hemoglobin, and the glycation process releases free iron [<xref rid="REF15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. This process often triggers reduction-oxidation processes that generate free radicals such as reactive oxygen species (ROS). These radicals can injure pancreatic &#x003b2;-cells, exacerbate the inflammatory response, oxidatively damage macromolecules, and cause serum ferritin levels to rise [<xref rid="REF16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="REF17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>The results of this study showed that people with T2DM had much lower amounts of H<sub>2</sub>S&#x000a0;in their blood compared to healthy people. Hyperglycemia and oxidative stress were suggested to be involved in this deficiency by some research. The reduced H<sub>2</sub>S levels may be due to increased H<sub>2</sub>S consumption by hyperglycemic cells, which is caused by ROS produced by the mitochondria [<xref rid="REF18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Another underlying cause could be the downregulation or inactivation of enzymes that are responsible for the synthesis of H<sub>2</sub>S [<xref rid="REF19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Diabetes is related to increased ROS-linked H<sub>2</sub>S consumption and CSE-mediated H<sub>2</sub>S reduction when combined. Nevertheless, the exact mechanism is still unknown and needs to be further investigated for clarification. Serum ferritin levels in T2DM could be used as a predictor of their oxidative state. Our study supported these conclusions, given the negative relationship between ferritin and H<sub>2</sub>S levels. Excessive generation of ROS and progression of oxidative stress occur as a result of chronic hyperglycemia [<xref rid="REF20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>-<xref rid="REF22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The H<sub>2</sub>S deficit in T2DM patients compared to healthy individuals [<xref rid="REF23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] may lead to oxidative stress and complications of diabetes.</p><p>This study indicated that oxidative stress is an important pathogenic factor in T2DM, according to the inverse correlation between H<sub>2</sub>S&#x000a0;and ferritin levels. In T2DM patients, the elevated ferritin levels, as a part of the inflammatory response, caused oxidative insult, &#x003b2;-cell dysfunction, and insulin resistance [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="REF16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In addition, the rise in ROS&#x000a0;due to hyperglycemia aggravated this oxidative stress, and ferritin levels were a good indicator of the disease progression. These findings of an increase in oxidative stress indicated a need to manipulate this process for the effective management of T2DM.</p><p>The deleterious effects of oxidative stress were also shown by the reduced levels of H<sub>2</sub>S in T2DM patients. The protective role of the antioxidant gas transmitter H<sub>2</sub>S is to neutralize ROS and prevent cellular damage. Many complications, such as diabetic nephropathy and cardiomyopathy, have been associated with H<sub>2</sub>S deficiency, and it increases oxidative stress in tissues [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="REF18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. These findings suggest that restoring H<sub>2</sub>S levels may alleviate oxidative damage and improve insulin sensitivity, and thus may be a promising therapeutic target for oxidative stress in T2DM patients.</p><p>Study limitations</p><p>This was an initial study of a small sample size, and the authors hope to involve more participants and conduct the study with a larger sample size over a longer period.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The negative correlation between ferritin and H<sub>2</sub>S levels in type 2 diabetes suggests that oxidative stress plays a crucial role in the disease's development. Increased ferritin levels indicate chronic inflammation and oxidative damage, which impair insulin production and action. The reduced H<sub>2</sub>S levels further support the notion of compromised antioxidant defense, worsening the oxidative stress. Together, these findings highlight the importance of oxidative stress in T2D progression and its potential as a therapeutic target.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group content-type="conflict"><title>Disclosures</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Human subjects:</bold> Consent for treatment and open access publication was obtained or waived by all participants in this study.
