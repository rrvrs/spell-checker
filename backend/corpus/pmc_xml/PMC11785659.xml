In this analysis, the efficacy and safety of mosunetuzumab monotherapy were evaluated in an expansion cohort, FLMOON-1, in Japanese patients with R/R FL who had received &#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;2 prior lines of therapy in a phase I study (JO40295, jRCT2080223801).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">Mosunetuzumab was administered intravenously at the recommended phase II dose (with cycle 1 step-up dosing) for eight cycles or up to 17 cycles, or until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Grade 3&#x02013;4 adverse events (AEs) were observed in 89.5% of patients, with a low incidence of AEs leading to mosunetuzumab discontinuation (10.5%) and one fatal AE unrelated to mosunetuzumab.

In Japan, FL is the second most common subtype of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL), representing 13.5% of all cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The proportion of FL among B-cell neoplasms in Japan has gradually increased from 6% in 1996&#x02012;2000 to 22.4% in 2007&#x02012;2014, approaching the rates seen in Western countries (28&#x02013;31%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">FL is often characterized by relapsing disease, increasing refractoriness to anti-CD20 antibodies and chemotherapy, and decreasing progression-free survival (PFS) with each subsequent therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. There is no standard of care for relapsed/refractory (R/R) FL. Systemic treatments include a combination of antibody and chemotherapy, and high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem-cell transplantation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Further treatments, such as chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy (CAR-T), tazemetostat and rituximab&#x02013;lenalidomide were recently approved in Japan; however, no reports confirm the relative superiority of these treatments. The introduction of CD19-targeted CAR-T showed encouraging efficacy in patients with R/R FL; however, its use may be limited by potentially severe toxicities and logistical challenges [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], limiting applicability for patients with rapidly progressive disease or high tumor burden. Effective new therapies with novel mechanisms of action are needed to improve outcomes for patients with R/R FL.</p><p id="Par7">Mosunetuzumab is a CD20xCD3 T cell engaging bispecific antibody that redirects T cells to eliminate B cells, including those that cause malignant disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].

The duration of follow-up in this study was relatively short (8.0&#x000a0;months); however, results from the global phase I/II GO29781 study, with longer follow-up, demonstrate efficacy of mosunetuzumab treatment with a long DoR and manageable safety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par36">Given the lack of clear evidence for treating 3L&#x02009;+&#x02009;FL with various treatments, including CAR-T, in clinical practice, prolonged follow-up of mosunetuzumab may be considered for future studies to extend upon the efficacy findings of this analysis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par37">Findings from FLMOON-1 demonstrate a high CRR with mosunetuzumab monotherapy, a fixed-duration and off-the-shelf treatment, in Japanese patients with R/R FL and &#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;2 prior lines of therapy. A trend toward higher treatment exposure than that in the global Phase I/II GO29781 study was observed.
