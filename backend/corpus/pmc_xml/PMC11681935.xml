While typically a slow-growing tumour found in the extremities of children and young adults, extra-somatic soft tissue sites of AFH, like the mediastinum, have a higher mean age of 35 at presentation and are more frequently associated with systemic symptoms such as pyrexia, anaemia and malaise [<xref rid="ivae214-B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Here, we describe a challenging but successful resection of a deep mediastinal AFH located behind the aortic root with invasion of the right pulmonary artery. Due to the rarity and surgical challenges of mediastinal AFH, this case highlights the need for a multidisciplinary approach, including cardiopulmonary bypass.</p></sec><sec sec-type="cases"><title>CASE REPORT</title><p>A 39-year-old woman presented with a 5-year history of progressive generalized weakness, periodic fevers, night sweats and sporadic episodes of hypertension, ultimately rendering her unable to work. Lab results revealed an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 72&#x02009;mm/h (reference &#x0003c;20&#x02009;mm/h), raising concerns for vasculitis. Subsequent positron emission tomography and computed tomography scans illuminated a hypermetabolic mass within the middle mediastinum located posterior to the aortic root, between the left atrium and the main trunk of the pulmonary artery (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="ivae214-F1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Furthermore, this well-defined 2.4&#x000d7;2.7&#x02009;cm mass was adjacent to the left coronary ostium and the left main stem; however, it demonstrated no enhancement on cardiac computed tomography with contrast. A magnetic resonance imaging showed that the tumour moved with the right pulmonary artery pulsation, raising suspicion of potential infiltration. Because of a high risk of bleeding from the pulmonary artery, left atrial wall and aorta, a biopsy was avoided by transthoracic puncture or mediastinoscopy. Preoperatively, neurogenic tumours such as paraganglioma or schwannoma were considered the most likely diagnosis. With the aim of symptom relief and ruling out malignancy, she was offered surgical resection, which she accepted.</p><fig position="float" id="ivae214-F1"><label>Figure 1:</label><caption><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A PET scan illustrating a hypermetabolic tumour.

Given the potential for malignancy and the prospect of curative resection with symptom relief, it was decided to aim for complete resection. The tumour adhered to the posterior aortic wall and aortic root, invading the right pulmonary artery. This necessitated the establishment of cardiopulmonary bypass with standard arterial cannulation of the upper ascending aorta and double-stage venous cannula via the right atrial auricle, followed by cardiac arrest using cold blood cardioplegia. The ascending aorta was transected completely 2&#x02009;cm above the right coronary ostium, and the tumour was dissected from surrounding structures (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Material, Fig. S1</xref>). This included resection of the anterior wall of the right pulmonary artery to obtain complete tumour removal, which was then repaired with a 3 &#x000d7; 2&#x02009;cm bovine patch. The cross-clamp and cardiopulmonary bypass times were 104 and 140&#x02009;min, respectively. The patient was not actively cooled, the lowest temperature being 34.8&#x000b0;C, and intraoperative bleeding was minimal.</p><p>Postoperatively, pathologic analysis revealed a spindle cell tumour with focal nodular patterns, bland nuclei, few mitoses and necrosis absent but a fibrous pseudo-capsule associated with lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate and nerve bundle that demarcated the tumour (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="ivae214-F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The immunohistochemical stains were positive for CD99, EMA, ALK-protein, Desmin and S100. Negative stains were myogenin, CD34, SMA, SOX10, HMB45, and AE1/AE3. The diagnosis of AFH was then finally confirmed with a positive FISH analysis revealing rearrangement for EWSR1 (22q12). Resection margins were tumour-free, confirming a radical resection. At the 1-year follow-up, the patient continued to show resolution of symptoms, and computed tomography imaging at 16&#x02009;months postoperatively confirmed no signs of recurrence. In addition, erythrocyte sedimentation rate had resolved from 72&#x02009;mm/h preoperatively to 12&#x02009;mm/h postoperatively. No postoperative chemo- or radiotherapy was administered.</p><fig position="float" id="ivae214-F2"><label>Figure 2:</label><caption><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Histology demonstrating nodular growth, lymphoplasmacytic cuffing and pseudo vascular spaces (H&#x00026;E stain; 1&#x02009;mm).

A conventional median sternotomy was chosen instead of a minimally invasive approach due to the tumour&#x02019;s location and the risk of significant intraoperative bleeding, as has been reported in previous studies on middle mediastinal paraganglioma tumours with a similar mediastinal position [<xref rid="ivae214-B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In addition, the decision to use CPB was made intraoperatively to ensure a safe resection from the pulmonary artery, atrial wall, posterior aorta and left coronary main stem. Complete aortic dissection was a key step of the operation and provided optimal access to these structures for radical and controlled resection.</p><p>To our knowledge, this is the second mediastinal AFH case documented in the literature, 1st reported by Asakura <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> in 2001 [<xref rid="ivae214-B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Unlike the current case, that tumour did not invade any nearby structures but was prone to bleeding. Although AFH is characterized as a low-grade malignancy, it can demonstrate local invasive growth, including infiltration into vessel walls such as the pulmonary artery. Furthermore, radical resection of mediastinal AFH tumours seems key to alleviating symptoms and improving quality of life. Therefore, we think these tumours should be operated on, even with complex surgery, if the patient is deemed fit for such a procedure.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="sup1" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>ivae214_Supplementary_Data</label><media xlink:href="ivae214_supplementary_data.docx"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL</title><p>
