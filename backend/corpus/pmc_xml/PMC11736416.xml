Anastomotic stricture can severely compromise patients' quality of life by leading to difficulties in food intake. Although endoscopic balloon dilation has become a standard treatment for gastrointestinal strictures, its efficacy is often limited due to the risk of perforation and the potential for recurrent stricture, necessitating multiple interventions. Recent advancements have introduced endoscopic radial incision and cutting methods, which aim to enhance patency by excising scar tissue. We experienced a case resistant to the radial incision and cutting therapy, necessitating further intervention strategies. This report details our experience utilizing a novel technique, endoscopic incisional balloon dilation, which combines endoscopic incisional technique and balloon dilation therapy with anti&#x02010;scarring medications, in cases of refractory anastomotic strictures following esophageal cancer resection. We present three challenging cases in which endoscopic incisional balloon dilation yielded significant clinical improvements, alongside supportive literature. Our findings suggest that endoscopic incisional balloon dilation is an effective and safer alternative to conventional methods, capable of addressing complex stricture scenarios while potentially enhancing patient outcomes and quality of life.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-generated"><kwd id="deo270062-kwd-0001">anastomotic stricture</kwd><kwd id="deo270062-kwd-0002">benign stricture</kwd><kwd id="deo270062-kwd-0003">endoscopic balloon dilation</kwd><kwd id="deo270062-kwd-0004">esophageal stricture</kwd><kwd id="deo270062-kwd-0005">triamcinolone acetonide</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="funding-0001"><funding-source>None</funding-source></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="5"/><table-count count="0"/><page-count count="7"/><word-count count="3508"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>source-schema-version-number</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>cover-date</meta-name><meta-value>April 2025</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>details-of-publishers-convertor</meta-name><meta-value>Converter:WILEY_ML3GV2_TO_JATSPMC version:6.5.4 mode:remove_FC converted:27.02.2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="deo270062-sec-0010"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The standard treatment for locally advanced esophageal cancer is esophagectomy.

</xref> Anastomotic stricture can result in impaired food intake, leading to dietary restrictions, nutritional decline, and the potential for food impaction, which increases the risk of aspiration pneumonia and choking. Therefore, it constitutes a significant complication that profoundly affects patients&#x02019; quality of life. Surgical revision is often avoided in cases of gastrointestinal stricture, particularly because the underlying cause is frequently related to anastomotic leakage, and the risk of restenosis remains high.<xref rid="deo270062-bib-0002" ref-type="bibr">

When performing incisions with a reusable needle knife, the knife was inserted shallowly below the muscularis mucosa, and cutting was conducted from the outer side toward the inner side of the lumen to prevent deep incisions. In contrast, when using a disposable knife equipped with an insulated tip at its distal end, incisions were performed from the inner side toward the outer side of the lumen. The length of the incision was determined to appropriately match the length of the anastomotic stricture, without excess or deficiency. Subsequently, a controlled radial expansion (CRE) balloon was filled with tap water to dilate the stricture to 18 mm and maintained for 2 min while the mucosal surface was observed through the endoscope (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="deo270062-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1g</xref>). After deflating the balloon, the passage of the endoscope was confirmed, and triamcinolone (50 mg/5 mL) was injected in 0.5 mL increments around the surrounding mucosa before completing the procedure (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="deo270062-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1h</xref>). A normal diet was initiated from the evening of the treatment day.</p><p>In both procedures, a high&#x02010;frequency electrosurgical device was set using VIO3 (ERBE), configured to the Endocut I effect 1.</p></sec></sec><sec id="deo270062-sec-0050"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The subjects included patients who underwent robotic&#x02010;assisted thoracoscopic esophagectomy for esophageal cancer, followed by gastric tube reconstruction and hand&#x02010;sewn cervical anastomosis through the retrosternal route. All patients in the cohort experienced postoperative anastomotic leakage, leading to inflammatory anastomotic strictures. While the degree of stricture varied, all cases were resistant to EBD and presented as clinically difficult cases, resulting in an inability to intake food.</p><sec id="deo270062-sec-0060"><title>Case 1</title><p>A 66&#x02010;year&#x02010;old male presented with dysphagia, and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed pinhole&#x02010;like anastomotic stricture (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="deo270062-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). EBD was initially attempted using a 10 mm CRE balloon; however, the procedure was discontinued due to the laceration of a muscular layer. Subsequently, nine additional EBD sessions were performed, but no improvement was observed. (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="deo270062-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). Following thorough explanation and consent, RIC was performed as previously described, with the procedure taking 43 min, which included the time from the start of the incision to the successful passage through the stricture (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="deo270062-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>). The patient resumed a normal diet on the night of the procedure, resulting in a dramatic improvement in oral intake. However, 2 weeks later, there was rapid granulation tissue formation leading to restenosis. During the period leading up to the next RIC, EBD was performed to alleviate symptoms. The second RIC was performed 9 weeks after the initial procedure and took 60 min to complete. The patient was prescribed oral prednisolone at a dose of 25 mg daily, and good granulation tissue was observed at the ulcer surface 2 weeks post&#x02010;RIC; however, by 3 weeks, restenosis and dysphagia reemerged (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="deo270062-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>). It was concluded that RIC, which creates circumferential ulcers, often results in restenosis during the healing process.</p><fig position="float" fig-type="FIGURE" id="deo270062-fig-0002"><label>FIGURE 2</label><caption><p>Endoscopic images over time associated with the procedures in Case 1.

This approach was intended to increase the number of weak points and distribute dilation forces more evenly, thereby preventing excessive concentration of pressure. Dilation to 18 mm was then performed using a CRE balloon. As anticipated, no perforations occurred, and the endoscope easily passed through the dilation site (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="deo270062-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>). The patient resumed a normal diet on the same evening and was prescribed oral prednisolone at a dose of 30 mg daily for 1 month. Eight weeks later, although dysphagia recurred, the lumen exhibited significant widening compared to the outcomes of EBD and RIC. Subsequently, an additional EIBD with eight incisions was performed. The patient resumed a normal diet that evening; however, obstructive symptoms reappeared 7 weeks later. A further EIBD using a 20 mm CRE balloon was then performed after six radial incisions were made in advance, followed by the local injection of 5 mg of triamcinolone. The patient resumed a normal diet that evening, and no further recurrence has been observed to date (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="deo270062-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2f</xref>).</p><p>Given the significant therapeutic effects observed with EIBD and the combination of triamcinolone compared to EBD alone or RIC, we proceeded to treat two additional patients with triamcinolone&#x02010;combined EIBD, along with tranilast administration, aiming to enhance the effects of triamcinolone through the antifibrotic action of tranilast.</p></sec><sec id="deo270062-sec-0070"><title>Case 2</title><p>A 66&#x02010;year&#x02010;old male presented with dysphagia, and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed anastomotic stricture and reflux esophagitis, attributed to retained food in the proximal lumen (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="deo270062-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). Three sessions of EBD alone yielded no improvement, leading to the implementation of EIBD with triamcinolone. Initially, due to esophageal deformity and reflux esophagitis, ten incisions were mistakenly placed at a site distinct from the suture line (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="deo270062-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>); balloon dilation to 18 mm and triamcinolone injection was achieved (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="deo270062-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>). However, 12 weeks later, the patient required emergency hospitalization due to poor oral intake, and endoscopy revealed persistent stricture and reflux esophagitis. The endoscope was fitted with a transparent hood to better visualize the anastomotic site, and six radial incisions were made above the anastomotic site before dilation to 18 mm with CRE (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="deo270062-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3d,e</xref>). The procedure time from the incision to the end of the examination was 10 min. Successful passage of the endoscope was confirmed, and triamcinolone was administered. Subsequently, the patient resumed a normal diet, with excellent improvement observed. A 1&#x02010;month supply of tranilast was prescribed for the patient prior to discharge.

The patient resumed a normal diet that evening, and a 1&#x02010;month supply of tranilast was prescribed for the patient prior to discharge. A follow&#x02010;up endoscopy 1 month later confirmed a significant widening of the anastomosis, with no evidence of stricture (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="deo270062-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4f</xref>). The patient has subsequently remained asymptomatic for more than 9 months.</p><fig position="float" fig-type="FIGURE" id="deo270062-fig-0004"><label>FIGURE 4</label><caption><p>Endoscopic images over time associated with the procedures in Case 3.

Specifically, we posited that it is crucial to avoid creating a wide ulcer by stripping the mucosa; instead, preserving as much mucosa as possible is essential to prevent re&#x02010;contraction. Additionally, retaining the epithelium near the wound is important, as it serves as the source of cells that migrate to the ulcer, while also suppressing the scar contraction process. Furthermore, the uneven hardness of the stenotic area may contribute to inadequate dilation during balloon expansion. When the balloon is inflated beyond a certain pressure, lacerations are initially observed at one or two weak points within the stenosis (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="deo270062-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5a,b</xref>). These lacerations increase local fragility, causing the expansion force to concentrate on these specific areas, which deepens the lacerations (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="deo270062-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5c,d</xref>). Consequently, the operator may need to interrupt the procedure without further expansion to prevent perforation of the muscular layer, particularly in cases with a narrow stenotic diameter. This situation often necessitates multiple balloon dilation attempts. By creating several mild lacerations in advance, the inflation pressure of the balloon can be dispersed, allowing for an increase in dilation diameter without leading to perforation (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="deo270062-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5e&#x02013;h</xref>). Similar to conventional EBD, EIBD enables real&#x02010;time endoscopic visualization of the lumen during dilation, allowing the procedure to be safely terminated before perforation occurs. Given that conventional EBD is routinely performed in an outpatient setting, it is reasonable to consider that EIBD can also be safely conducted in an outpatient setting.</p><fig position="float" fig-type="FIGURE" id="deo270062-fig-0005"><label>FIGURE 5</label><caption><p>Comparison of ulcer formation and restenosis between conventional and incisional balloon dilation.

</p><p>By combining these approaches, we successfully addressed refractory esophageal stenosis. In Case 1, we demonstrated that the stenosis, which was difficult to resolve with EBD or RIC, could be effectively treated with EIBD in the same patient. This finding demonstrates that EIBD is highly effective, as it enhances treatment outcomes and reduces the number of required sessions, ultimately lowering overall treatment costs. In Case 2, also involving multiple sessions with the same patient, it was shown that EBD combined with incision at an inappropriate location was ineffective. It is crucial to create multiple incision lines in the stenotic area to effectively distribute the balloon's expansion pressure. This approach not only facilitates the disruption of deep fibrous tissue but also allows the newly formed mucosal defect to be covered by the epithelium before contraction occurs. This process increases the epithelial surface area, which is essential for achieving effective dilation. Additionally, delaying contraction with anti&#x02010;scarring medications may further enhance this effect. In Case 3, building on the experiences from the previous two cases, we achieved a significant treatment effect in a single session and demonstrated reproducibility.</p><p>The combination of EIBD with triamcinolone and tranilast is thought to enhance efficacy through the following synergistic mechanisms, thereby contributing to the rapid improvement of patient quality of life compared to the incision or EBD alone: it creates multiple mucosal defects to expand the total mucosal surface area without excessively damaging healthy mucosa; it facilitates uniform distribution of balloon pressure, maximizing the diameter of dilation in a single attempt and allowing for further expansion of the mucosal defects; and the combined use of triamcinolone and tranilast inhibits collagen synthesis and fibrotic scar formation,<xref rid="deo270062-bib-0017" ref-type="bibr">

</xref> thereby suppressing scar contraction and preventing luminal re&#x02010;narrowing associated with healing. The significant importance of this treatment lies in its potential to reduce the duration of symptoms, such as dysphagia and chest pain, associated with refractory anastomotic strictures of the esophagus, which typically require repeated interventions like EBD and RIC. In the treatment of strictures following subtotal esophagectomy, epithelialization is often completed within 1 month following dilation. In this study, the administration period for tranilast was set at four weeks, and the decision to perform additional EIBD, if necessary, was made 1 month after the initial EIBD based on endoscopic evaluation.</p><p>However, there are limitations to this study, including the small number of reports and the lack of subgroup analysis regarding the presence or absence of triamcinolone and tranilast, which prevents us from determining their individual contributions. Furthermore, the optimal number of incision lines to form during incision for maximum efficiency has not been evaluated. In addition, there is no information regarding the efficacy of this treatment compared to EBD and steroid local injection combination therapy, highlighting the need for studies comparing the effectiveness of both approaches. Therefore, further comparative studies regarding the presence of tranilast, the number of incision lines, and the comparison between this treatment and other therapeutic modalities are warranted.</p></sec><sec sec-type="COI-statement" id="deo270062-sec-0100"><title>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT</title><p>None.</p></sec><sec id="deo270062-sec-0110"><title>ETHICS STATEMENT</title><p>The research protocol for this study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Kobe City Nishi&#x02010;Kobe Medical Center on October 15.</p></sec><sec id="deo270062-sec-0120"><title>PATIENT CONSENT STATEMENT</title><p>Informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to their involvement in the study.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="deo270062-bibl-0001"><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="deo270062-bib-0001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal" id="deo270062-cit-0001">
