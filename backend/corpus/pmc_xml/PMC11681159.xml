In this research, the tyrosinase (TYR) inhibiting abilities of the peptides derived from bee pollen protein hydrolysates are investigated. Various proteases were utilized to generate these peptides, followed by testing at different concentrations. Tyrosinase inhibition activity was detected in all cases, while the hydrolysate drawn from 5.0% w/v neutrase exhibited the best IC<sub>50</sub> value and was thus investigated further via ultrafiltration to separate the active fractions. The highest potential for tyrosinase inhibition was recorded for the fractions below 0.65&#x000a0;kDa. Subsequent purification steps via SEC and RP-HPLC led to the identification of the VDGYPAAGY (named VY-9) peptide via LC-Q-TOF-MS/MS in fraction F<sub>1&#x02013;2</sub>, known for its non-toxic and hydrophobic characteristics albeit poor water solubility. The synthesized VY-9 peptide demonstrated competitive inhibition, with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 0.55&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.03 &#x000b5;M for mono-phenolase and 2.54&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.06 &#x000b5;M for di-phenolase activities, as confirmed by molecular docking analysis revealing dominant hydrogen bond interactions with TYR. Effective concentrations of 0.2&#x02013;1.6 &#x000b5;M of VY-9 showed negligible cytotoxicity in B16F10 cells. Melanin synthesis suppression was examined via qRT-PCR, and western blot in MITF, TYR, TRP-1, and TRP-2. Cell death in zebrafish embryos was evaluated in vivo using a toxicity assay which revealed no significant influence from VY-9, while anti-melanogenic effects were observed when the concentration was 4 &#x000b5;M, suggesting bee pollen-derived peptides&#x02019; potential in cosmetic and pharmaceutical depigmentation applications.</p><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1038/s41598-024-81495-8.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Bee pollen</kwd><kwd>Protein hydrolysate</kwd><kwd>Tyrosinase inhibitory peptides</kwd><kwd>Melanogenesis</kwd><kwd>B16F10 mouse melanoma cells</kwd><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Biochemistry</kwd><kwd>Biotechnology</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>The Thailand Science Research and Innovation Fund Chulalongkorn University</institution></funding-source><award-id>BCG66610030</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer Nature Limited 2024</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Quality of life can be adversely affected by cosmetic skin problems, and one common remedy involves lightening through the use of either synthetic or natural substances which lighten the skin tone, or in some cases even the skin complexion by lowering the melanin levels in the skin. Accordingly, skin lightening can be used to address problems with freckles, discolored skin, or scars resulting from acne. Skin lightening products typically promise perfect glowing skin, and have long been popular with women, and also today with men<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. In Asia there is significant demand for products to whiten the skin. Since Asian skin tends to be naturally more hydrated, problems of hyperpigmentation or hypopigmentation are more frequently observed. As Asian people age, they are less likely to wrinkle but more likely to exhibit an uneven skin tone. Furthermore, many Asians want to look more western, so try to whiten their skin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. In mammals, melanin is the predominant skin pigment, and it is formed from melanocytes as tyrosine undergoes enzymatic oxidation. Melanin offers protection against ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, DNA damage, and oxidative stress, all of which are harmful to the skin. Protection against UV irradiation also helps in preventing skin cancer. Melanin also has the negative effect, however, of causing mottled or sunburned skin, so substances capable of blocking the synthesis of melanin are likely to be effective as cosmetic products to whiten the skin. The synthesis of melanin takes place in melanosomes whereupon it moves to the nearby epidermal keratinocytes. There are a number of melanocyte-specific enzymes such as tyrosinase (TYR), TYR-related protein 1 (TRP-1), and TYR-related protein 2 (TRP-2) which serve to regulate the process of melanogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">One role of TYR, which is a binuclear copper enzyme, is to regulate melanogenesis. It acts as a catalyst for the hydroxylation of tyrosine and the oxidation of 3, 4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) to o-dopaquinone which are the rate limiting reactions which occur during the synthesis of melanin. Skin color is dependent upon the level of melanin synthesis as well as the type of melanin and the way it is distributed through the keratinocytes. Achieving effective inhibition of TYR with minimal adverse side effects has remained a longstanding challenge within the realms of dermatological and cosmetological sciences. Despite the existence of various potent TYR inhibitors, such as sulfite or kojic acid, their utilization is limited. However, these substances are not utilized due to their high degree of toxicity towards cells and instability in the presence of water or oxygen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. It is vital that inhibitors used in the food or cosmetics sectors meet the highest safety standards, so while various synthetic and natural TYR inhibitors are known, they are largely unsuitable for use as skin whiteners due to their cytotoxicity, poor solubility, or lack of suitability in terms of cutaneous absorption. Some of the TYR inhibitors which have found application in skin whitening products have been shown to be carcinogenic; the WHO has advised that some skin lightening agents can lead to cancer, and notes that mercury, which is a harmful toxin, is sometimes used in skin whitening products in order to inhibit the production of melanin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. In this context, natural or organic products are likely to become increasingly popular, so researchers have sought to focus on natural peptides since they are relatively safe and can be very effective. Accordingly, various studies have been carried out to examine TYR inhibitor peptides derived from synthetic peptides as well as proteins and protein hydrolysates to determine their mechanisms and efficacy. Natural compounds have drawn the greatest attention since they are perceived to lack undesirable side effects. In addition, they offer the advantages of peptides with protein mimicking and high biocompatibility, and therefore have potential to serve as active ingredients in newly developed products for the cosmetic and pharmaceutical sectors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Accordingly, it appears that TYR activity can be inhibited by peptides and proteins from common sources including milk<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, split gill mushrooms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, honey<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, silk<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, feather<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, spotted babylon<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, and the jellyfish<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Bee pollen is produced in hives from nectar, the saliva of the bees, and flower pollen grains. It can be safely harvested from the hive by beekeepers. It is rich in nutrition, providing lipids, carbs, proteins, and dietary fibers along with minerals, vitamins, and both phenolic and volatile compounds. Around 200 different substances have been found in the pollen from various plant species, but bee pollen remains notable due to its biologically active components. From a nutritional perspective it can be classified as a functional food, which has invited studies to examine its potential in both the medical and food industries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. In recent years, studies have investigated the possibility of improving upon the capabilities of bee pollen via the process of enzymatic hydrolysis. The bee pollen protein hydrolysate (BPPH) can undergo hydrolysis to create natural bioactive peptides, as reported by Saisavoey et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. who showed that the enzymatic hydrolysates derived from bee pollen are effective in NO scavenging, while the neutrase hydrolysate can produce peptides which have anti-inflammatory properties. The production of NO is inhibited by the smallest peptide fraction (&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.65&#x000a0;kDa), which can also counteract the LPS-induced expression of IL-6, COX-2, iNOS, and TNF-&#x003b1; transcripts in RAW264.7 macrophage cells, confirming that enzymatic hydrolysis can lead to better anti-inflammatory activity. Saisavoey et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. reported that bee pollen treated with alcalase could serve as an antioxidant, while antiproliferation activity was exhibited towards lung cancer cells (ChaGo-K1) by the BPPH, thus promoting apoptosis. The production of TIPs (tyrosinase inhibitory peptides) from BPPH has not, however, been widely reported. It is claimed that these bioactivities result from the greater variety and overall numbers of bioactive peptides which can be generated through enzymatic hydrolysis. The role of bioactive peptides in human nutrition has attracted widespread interest, but this study focuses on bee pollen bioactive peptides derived from enzymatic hydrolysis and investigates their ability to inhibit melanogenesis. We took the view that bee pollen might be a potential source of TIPs with the capacity to inhibit the expression of TYR in B16F10 mouse melanoma cells through disruption of the melanogenesis signaling cascades. In addition, in vivo testing of the ability of peptides to inhibit melanin generation was performed in zebrafish embryos. It can thus be concluded that bee pollen may be a source of valuable bioactive peptides which can find useful applications in the cosmetic sector as an important ingredient.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Enrichment of bee pollen peptides treated with different proteases</title><p id="Par5">TIPs are now widely prepared via enzymatic hydrolysis, due to the ease of controlling the process and the absence of extreme reaction conditions. There are many commercially produced enzymes which are available to support TIP production, among which are trypsin, chymotrypsin, flavourzyme, alkaline protease, neutral protease, papain, and so forth. It is understood that different enzymes can differ in their hydrolytic impact upon a given material because the binding specificity between substrate and enzymes will vary. However, in the case of the enzymolytic effect of an enzyme, the same enzyme will produce different results on different materials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. In this study, the enzymes under investigation included neutrase, alcalase, flavourzyme, papain, and pepsin-pancresin. Hydrolysis of the bee pollen powder was conducted with various proteases at three specific concentrations before comparisons were drawn to consider the TYR inhibition of the bee pollen hydrolysates, with findings shown in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. The lowest IC<sub>50</sub> values for the mono-phenolase activity (50.01&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.15&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g/mL) and di-phenolase activity (39.93&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.60&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g/mL) were recorded for the protein hydrolysate which was prepared using 5% (w/v) neutrase. The hydrolysates comprise a number of peptides, and thus differ from kojic acid, which is a single molecule and a very potent standard TYR inhibitor. For this reason, the true concentration of the active compound is not as high as that stated for the IC<sub>50</sub> value. This study therefore places emphasis upon those hydrolysates which offer the greatest enzyme inhibition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. A similar example can be found in the work of Zhao et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. whose hydrolysis of the &#x0201c;Fengdan&#x0201d; peony (<italic>Paeonia ostii</italic>) seed meal protein with neutrase (at 1&#x000a0;mg/mL) revealed hydrolysates achieving 59.7% TYR inhibition. Before carrying out the process of enzymatic hydrolysis it is essential to select the appropriate proteases and raw materials, because the protein amino acid compositions vary and this leads to different sized peptides being released, which offer different levels of bioactivity.</p><p id="Par6">

</p><p id="Par7">Those proteins offering strong TYR inhibition typically contain high levels of hydrophobic amino acids, such as Trp, Phe, Gly, Val, Leu, Ile, Ala, Pro, and Met, and also aromatic amino acids including Tyr, Trp, and Phe. Neutrase, which can be described as a type of neutral protease has a tendency to hydrolyze proteins to generate peptides which have hydrophobic amino acids including Tyr, Trp, or Phe as <italic>C</italic>-terminals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Accordingly, neutrase could serve as an appropriate protease for the preparation of high-activity TIPs. Reactions take place between hydrogen donor hydrophobic amino acids and the various residues, free radicals, or metal ions, while the aromatic amino acids possess conjugated planar rings, which are able to absorb ultraviolet rays while also engaging in &#x003c0;-&#x003c0; interactions with the copper ions of TYR. The oxidative activity of TYR tends to be disrupted by the conjugation with Cu<sup>2+</sup>, which in turn limits melanin synthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. To summarize, the current approach to obtain TIPs involves the screening of enzyme species followed by optimization of the enzymolytic process along with efficacious purification. This study employed neutrase in sequence since this was the approach which provided the highest levels of TYR inhibition. These findings were then taken forward to guide the ultrafiltration (UF) stage.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>UF of the prepared BPPH</title><p id="Par8">Having obtained the enzymatic hydrolysates from protein fractions and peptides, it is necessary to perform further filtration in order to separate these peptides prior to carrying out additional experimentation. The peptides must be purified isolated from other substances before it is possible to determine their abilities in melanogenesis inhibition in cell culture or to assess their anti-TYR properties through in vitro assay. This is because impurities could affect the outcomes of these analyses. Most research into bioactive peptides makes use of membrane fractionation techniques to commence the analysis. The purification stage begins by filtering the protein hydrolysates and peptides using membranes which are able to separate the fractions by molecular size. The food sector normally requires UF in which the sub-fractions fall within a range of 1 to 100&#x000a0;kDa for molecular size<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. The initial screening for bioactivity can then be carried out by comparing the activity levels of the different sub-fractions. The most promising protein hydrolysate can be separated by membranes to form different peptide sizes, typically of MW&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;10&#x000a0;kDa, MW 5&#x02013;10&#x000a0;kDa, MW 3&#x02013;5&#x000a0;kDa, MW 3-0.65, and MW&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.65&#x000a0;kDa. Assays can then be conducted for in vitro TYR inhibition to determine the capacity to serve as TYR inhibitors in mono-phenolase and di-phenolase contexts, as explained in the section describing the experimental procedures. Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> presents the findings.

Deng et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. reported similar findings, noting that greater TYR inhibition was exhibited by the smaller molecular weight fractions of the protein hydrolysates from Chinese quince seeds following UF. In line with this trend, the 0&#x02013;3&#x000a0;kDa fraction was chosen to undergo additional purification. Pongkai et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. confirmed the benefits of using the UF membrane to enhance the activity of a peptide fraction in terms of TYR inhibition, since the inhibitory activity of a peptide is closely related to its molecular weight.

The differences observed might be attributable to the susceptible bonds in the amino acid sequences, which might have been dependent on the mechanism for catalysis of the immobilized enzyme, the breaking point preference in the protein sequence, and protein isolates composition. The fraction with molecular weight&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.65&#x000a0;kDa which offered strong mono-phenolase and di-phenolase inhibition was selected to be purified further using size exclusion chromatography <bold>(</bold>SEC) and reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC).</p><p id="Par9">

It is then possible to monitor the various peptide bonds, proteins, peptides, or amino acids with aromatic rings through the use of A<sub>280</sub>, which revealed two individual peaks (F<sub>1</sub> and F<sub>2</sub>), confirming that aromatic peptide or amino acid side chains were present.

However, it was not possible to calculate such values for F<sub>2</sub>. On the basis of these outcomes, the F<sub>1</sub> fraction was chosen for subsequent analysis. This lyophilized active F<sub>1</sub> fraction underwent additional separation using RP-HPLC to create the five sub-fractions indicated as F<sub>1&#x02013;1</sub>, F<sub>1&#x02013;2</sub>, F<sub>1&#x02013;3</sub>, F<sub>1&#x02013;4</sub> and F<sub>1&#x02013;5</sub> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b).

</p><p id="Par15">The peptide VY-9 comprises 44.44% hydrophobic amino acid residues. It is normally the case that low molecular weight protein hydrolysates exhibit greater hydrophobicity as well as superior dispersion which leads to stronger overall bioactivity. Where hydrophobic amino acids appear at each end of the peptide chain, this increases the interactivity with the copper active sites of TYR. Furthermore, it was reported by Wang et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. that a low-molecular-weight (700-1,700 Da) gelatin hydrolysate derived from the sea cucumber wall offered 55.7% hydrophobic amino acids. While the exterior environment of TYR is hydrophilic, the inner core forms a hydrophobic cavity such that those amino acids which contain a hydrophobic side chain will tend to bind more readily to the hydrophobic pocket close to the active site of TYR. Aromatic amino acids have benzene rings which can be buried at the active site as they bind to TYR, and since they are hydrophobic, this stabilizes the binding, increasing the inhibitory effects against TYR. According to Ge et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. three new peptides offering notable inhibitory activity against TYR include ILFTLL (IC<sub>50</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;9.25&#x000a0;mg/mL), TIPPPT (IC<sub>50</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;7.59&#x000a0;mg/mL), and IIPFIF (IC<sub>50</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;6.16&#x000a0;mg/mL). However, the peptide IIPFIF stands out through its aromatic amino acid located at the <italic>C</italic>-terminal enabling entry to the active pocket from the <italic>C</italic>-terminal, whereas in contrast there is no aromatic amino acid at either end of the peptide chain in the case of TIPPPT or ILFTLL. Instead, the IIPFIF peptide comprises solely hydrophobic amino acids and its larger portion enters the active pocket, whereas TIPPPT and ILFTLL only have one or two hydrophilic amino acids and the smaller portion enters the active pocket.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Validation of synthetic peptide VY-9 activity</title><p id="Par16">In order to check our own hypothesis concerning the ability of the peptide VY-9 to inhibit TYR, we created a synthetic peptide with a matching sequence to test the inhibition in the case of both mono-phenolase and di-phenolase forms. Our synthetic version of the peptide VY-9 demonstrated good TYR inhibition, for which the IC<sub>50</sub> values of 0.55&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.03, and 2.54&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.06 &#x000b5;M were recorded in the case of the respective mono-phenolase and di-phenolase activities. The results indicated that the peptide VY-9 was more effective in the inhibition of mono-phenolase than di-phenolase, possibly because the inhibitory concentration threshold for the di-phenolase reaction could exceed that of the mono-phenolase reaction. In earlier research the protein from rice bran underwent enzymatic digestion with the simultaneous use of chymotrypsin and trypsin to create peptides. From the rice bran protein hydrolysates, six bioactive peptides were isolated and determined to exhibit TYR inhibitory activity. These peptides were classified as CT-1-6, and the amino acid sequence analysis determined that three of these peptides possessed tyrosine residue at the <italic>C</italic>-terminus side of the peptides (CT-1: HGGEGGRPY, CT-2: LQPSHY, and CT-3: HPTSEVY). These three peptides produced notable TYR inhibition in the mono-phenolase tyrosine substrate reaction, but importantly did not do so in the di-phenolase L-DOPA substrate reaction. Moreover, melanogenesis in melanoma cells was shown to be inhibited by the peptide CT-2 (&#x0003e;&#x02009;50% at 500 &#x000b5;M) while no cytotoxic effects were recorded<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. On the basis of these data, it could be argued that protein hydrolysates from rice bran might serve as an excellent source of TYR inhibitory bioactive peptides. The inhibitory activity was shown to be lower for the di-phenolase when compared to the mono-phenolase in a majority of the substances examined<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. Meanwhile, Li et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. reported significant differences in the measured IC<sub>50</sub> values between mono-phenolase and di-phenolase inhibitory activity towards mushroom TYR. Where such differences occur between the mono-phenolase and di-phenolase activity for a particular compound, it can most commonly be attributed to differences in the catalytic cycle mechanisms of monophenol (L-tyrosine) and diphenol (L-DOPA) oxidation by the mushroom TYR. It is not, however, possible to rule out the significant inhibition of mono-phenolase steady-state activity with no extension of the lag time. For TYR activity in the context of L-tyrosine as a monophenol substrate it is necessary to implement a lag-phase in order to achieve the transformation to diphenol, which acts as a substrate to di-phenolase.</p><p id="Par17">VY-9 has <italic>C</italic>-terminal tyrosine residue which supports the TYR inhibition, possibly as a consequence of the aromatic ring structures in the amino acid Tyr residues. Ge et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. noting that hydrophobic interactions with hydrophobic side chains located at the active sites of TYR could be increased by inhibitors which have aromatic ring structures. Furthermore, a number of researchers have suggested that the tyrosine residue makes an important contribution to TYR inhibition. For instance, Schurink et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. performed the screening of seven different peptides offering TYR inhibition from protein-based peptide libraries via SPOT synthesis, with the results indicating that peptides which contained tyrosine were able to activate TYR since it was possible for them to undergo conversion by TYR. In addition, Ochiai et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. examined TH10 (MRSRERSSWY), synthesizing it following a search of the rice DNA database. The peptide TH10 was found to have an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 102 &#x000b5;M. This peptide can be considered homologous to peptide P4 (YRSRKYSSWY) from an earlier study which achieved an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 123 &#x000b5;M where tyrosine was a substrate of TYR. These peptides both have sequences containing tyrosine on the <italic>C</italic>-terminal, while peptide P4 has an additional two tyrosine residues, located in the middle of the peptide and at the <italic>N</italic>-terminal. Simulations were performed to assess the sequence-shuffled variants of peptide P4 and the molecular docking of variants of peptide TH10, revealing that the peptide P4 inhibitory activity was not linked to the presence of tyrosine residues at the center of the peptide sequence and in the <italic>N</italic>-terminal position, although the tyrosine residue at the <italic>C</italic>-terminal in both of the peptides is important in TYR inhibition because tyrosine residue on both peptides plays very important role in the inhibition activity of TYR by acting as a substrate analogue at the TYR active site and coordinating with the copper ions of the TYR enzyme. Most peptides offering TYR inhibition have Tyr residue at the <italic>C</italic>-terminal.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Inhibition type and constant determination for the VY-9 peptide</title><p id="Par18">In order to understand the VY-9 peptide mechanism for TYR inhibition, the inhibition mode was investigated through the analysis of Lineweaver-Burk plots.

When comparing the findings, it was evident that the VY-9 formed effective bonds to the peripheral residues of TYR via hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interactions, van der Waals forces, and &#x003c0;-&#x003c3; bonds. In another study, Ismaya examined the crystal structure of the mushroom TYR (abTYR) obtained from <italic>Agaricus bisporus</italic>, revealing that abTYR has a crystal structure which is an H2L2 tetramer comprising two H subunits and two L subunits. There are 150 subunits in the L subunit which is the result of an unrelated gene which plays an undetermined role. In contrast, the H subunit may derive from the TYR ppo3 gene since it comprises 391 amino acid residues which perfectly match the residues 2-392 of ppo3. The H subunit has an active binding site for abTYR which has two copper atoms (Cu400 and Cu401) along with six histidines (His). CuA will bind to the His61, His85, and His94 ligands, while CuB will bind to the His259, His263, and His296 ligands<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. As a consequence of these histidine residues undergoing ligation with copper ions, the rotational freedom is restricted. The integrity of the binding site, Phe90, located between His94, His259, and His296, and Phe292, located between His61, His263, and His296, is maintained through constraining the histidine side chain conformation. Accordingly, it is clear that His61, His85, His94, His259, His263, His296, Phe90, and Phe292 are vital amino acid residues which affect TYR activity.</p><p id="Par21">In order to predict the potential protein&#x02013;peptide binding interactions, AutoDock Vina molecular docking analysis was first conducted.

Direct chelation with the copper ions is observed for the residue His85, and when the tyrosine residue oxygen atom on the peptide VY-9 bonds with the His85 hydrogen atom, this will influence enzyme activity, placing the tyrosine residue near to the copper ions, indicating that the peptide VY-9 binds to TYR as a substrate analogue, preventing melanin production.</p><p id="Par22">The VY-9 peptide contains tyrosine which has a benzene ring that performs powerful hydrophobic interactions with Pro277 and Phe192, potentially blocking the TYR hydrophobic pocket, and lowering its hydrophobicity. In addition, the docking simulation reveals that the tyrosine residues of CRY and RCY interact with the Trp227 and Met257 side chains via hydrophobic interactions which serve to cover the TYR active pocket. While the exterior environment of TYR is hydrophilic, the inner core forms a hydrophobic cavity such that those amino acids which contain a hydrophobic side chain will tend to bind more readily to the hydrophobic pocket close to the active site of TYR. Furthermore, aromatic amino acids have benzene rings which can be buried at the active site as they bind to TYR, and since they are hydrophobic, this stabilizes the binding, increasing the inhibitory effects against TYR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. When comparing the binding of arbutin and the VY-9 peptide with TYR, the VY-9 peptide exhibited the lowest binding energy at -8.3&#x000a0;kcal/mol, while arbutin showed a binding energy of -6.5&#x000a0;kcal/mol (S2 Figure, and S3 Table). Furthermore, the VY-9 peptide engages with seven binding residues: Tyr65, Asn81, His85, His244, Asn260, Ser282, and Val283. In contrast, Arbutin interacts with only four residues: Gln144, Glu173, Asn174, and His178. This result suggests that the VY-9 peptide binds to TYR more strongly than arbutin. In previous research there was a proposal for the inhibition mechanism for &#x0201c;tyrosine-type&#x0201d; TYR inhibitory peptides, including those similar to TH10. Furthermore, docking simulation has indicated that these peptides serve as substrate analogues which block access to the TYR active site for L-tyrosine. A simulation was also carried out using the mushroom TYR structure to determine the peptide CT-2 binding mode. These investigations revealed that the <italic>C</italic>-terminal tyrosine residue of CT-2 is bound to TYR active site with its copper through a mechanism similar to that of TH10, which would indicate that there is a strong affinity for CT-2 to the TYR active site, while CT-2 also serves as a substrate analogue. It is not, however, clear exactly why CT-2 proved more effective than the other isolated peptides in terms of inhibitory activity. Previous reports have suggested that while the tyrosine residue at the <italic>C</italic>-terminal plays a major inhibitory role in &#x0201c;tyrosine-type&#x0201d; TYR inhibitory peptides, there may also be a significant contribution made by the nearby amino acid residues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par23">

For instance, while hydroquinone is widely used in the treatment of hyperpigmentation and serves as a common skin-whitening treatment, it is known to induce a number of undesirable side effects such as contact dermatitis, irritation of the skin, and exogenous ochronosis in individuals of a darker skin tone. For these reasons, hydroquinone cannot be used as a cosmetic component in the European Union, and is strictly supervised by the Food and Drug Administration in the USA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. Accordingly, this study commenced by assessing the cell viability of the peptide VY-9 in order to estimate the safety. The cells investigated in vitro included B16F10 melanoma cells from mice. Many studies focusing on pigmentation make use of the B16F10 melanoma cell line, since TYRs in humans and mice tend to be homologous with 86% identity at the protein level and 84% at the cDNA level. Moreover, these cell lines regulate the mechanisms of melanin synthesis in a similar manner to that of human melanocytes. Also, the cells are able to become attached to the culture flask and will create homogenous cell populations. It can then be feasible to observe the cellular differentiation from the perspectives of both morphology and melanogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. The cytotoxicity of the various concentrations of the peptide VY-9 was evaluated using the MTT colorimetric assay, and comparisons were drawn with arbutin (0.2 mM).

We are not aware of any previous studies examining mono-phenolase activity which make use of TYR derived from cell models. The lack of research in this area may be due to the need to initially accumulate L-DOPA <italic>via</italic> di-phenolase activity in order to stabilize TYR so that its catalytic capabilities can be fully activated. TYR can be found in three different oxidation forms, which in turn present different capabilities in phenol catalysis or the catalysis of catechol substrates.

As a consequence, we did not examine the mono-phenolase reaction in this work. As the concentration of the peptide VY-9 was increased, the TYR activity began a steady decline, suggesting that TYR inhibition was increasing. This rate of inhibition was measured at 44.88% using 1.6 &#x000b5;M of VY-9, exceeding the performance of arbutin which offered 50.45% inhibition at 0.2 mM. Although molecular docking predicted that VY-9 interacts with the tyrosinase catalytic site, further experimental validation is required to confirm the peptide&#x02019;s ability to penetrate cell membranes and reach intracellular tyrosinase.

It is understood that melanin is produced when tyrosine is oxidized to form DOPA due to the action of TYR, whereupon DOPA undergoes further oxidization to DOPA-quinone, which in turn undergoes a number of reactions which create eumelanin. The TYR enzyme is therefore crucial in producing melanin.

Furthermore, in melanin production, TYR was an oxidase serving as the rate-limiting enzyme which controlled the production of melanin, while TRP-1 was a melanocyte-specific gene associated with melanin synthesis.

</p><p id="Par32">During the course of our experiments, the highest concentration used was 1.6 &#x000b5;M, which reduced cell toxicity and effectively restricted the production of melanin and gene expression. Treatment with 1.6 &#x000b5;M resulted in a reduction in the gene and protein expression levels of MITF, TYR, TRP-1, and TRP-2, aligning with the findings for melanin content at that same concentration, as shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>c. Notably, at the lowest peptide concentration (0.2 &#x000b5;M), TRP-2 mRNA and protein levels decreased slightly compared to the control.

That is, TRP-2 activity could be influenced by additional physiological factors as well as the peptide itself. The main role of TRP-2 lies in converting L-dopachrome to DHICA in the melanogenesis pathway. The peptide examined in this study was able to inhibit the upstream transcription factor of TRP-2, but when the concentration of the peptide was increased, there was a fall in TRP-2 expression. This might arise as a consequence of MITF inhibition, and it could significantly change both TYR and TRP-1. We believed this was because the peptide could inhibit TYR and TRP-1 transcription, while a further possibility was that declining MITF expression might prevent TRP-2 from expressing normally. However, it was not possible to establish the precise reason for TRP-2 alterations which might allow the VY-9 peptide mechanism to be determined. While the peptide was capable of promoting TRP-2 expression, TYR was still significant as the rate-determining step. Furthermore, melanin synthesis must also occur <italic>via</italic> TRP-1, which was inhibited. We therefore take the view that this peptide would be capable of inhibiting the production of melanin. The peptide has also shown strong inhibitory capability based upon the dosage used in the inhibition of mushroom TYR, so enzyme activity inhibition may potentially be another outcome.

For instance, the B16F10 model is inexpensive and allows the rapid assessment of de-pigmentation capabilities in an assay which permits high throughput, yet there are differences in the post-translational modification of TYRs when compared to the situation in humans, while the lack of metabolic activity which would typically be enriched in the epidermal layer can lead to inaccuracies in assessing the de-pigmentation efficacy. In such scenarios it would be necessary to carry out further investigation in human melanocytes and in models which more accurately represent the human metabolism.

Surprisingly, VY-9 successfully reduced the amount of melanin and repressed the expression of critical genes and proteins involved in melanogenesis (MITF, TYR, TRP-1, and TRP-2) in B16F10 cells, with no negative impacts on the cells. An examination on animal testing using a zebrafish model indicated that VY-9 has the ability to inhibit melanin formation, indicating its potential as a powerful element in cosmetic and medical sectors. Nevertheless, more research is needed to demonstrate its practical application in commercial products. These investigations necessitate thorough assessments of long-term toxicity and safety, rigorous testing of formulation stability, and diligent clinical trials to determine both effectiveness and safety in humans.</p></sec><sec id="Sec37" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.</p><p>
