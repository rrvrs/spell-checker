Canine retraction is the initial phase of the two-step technique for space closure.<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>1</sup>
</xref> Various techniques for canine retraction are currently widely utilized, in which force can be exerted by means of various designs of elastics and closed coil springs. Conversely, frictionless mechanics involve the application of the sectional approach, such as Burstone&#x02019;s T-loop, Rickett&#x02019;s spring, or PG (Poul Gjessing) spring.</p><p>Pre-adjusted Edgewise mechanics for retraction uses the following two categories of principles: (i) the friction-based mechanics aims to distally slide the canine along a continuous archwire; (ii) the friction-less mechanics, which integrate loops (springs) into a continuous or segmented archwire, is designed to retract the tooth. There are two inherent drawbacks with any mechanics that uses a sliding mechanism instead of a simple tipping movement: friction and the magnitudes of forces cannot be readily determined, due to the relatively unknown and unpredictable nature of friction.<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>2</sup>
</xref>
</p><p>The segmented arch mechanics recommends the division of the dental arch into three primary segments, particularly in cases involving extractions. These three segments consist of two posterior segments (teeth posterior to the extraction site) and one anterior segment (incisors and canines, in cases of first premolar extraction, which is the common tooth extraction pattern in Orthodontics).<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>3</sup>
</xref>
</p><p>Segmented arch mechanics introduced two techniques for extraction spaces closure. The first technique involves canine retraction into the extraction spaces, followed by retracting the incisors or aligning the crowded incisors, in situations in which extraction was used to relieve the crowding of incisors or front teeth. The objective of this approach is to reduce the anterior displacement of posterior teeth, sometimes referred to as maximum anchorage.<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>3</sup>
</xref> The second technique involve en masse retraction, in which all anterior teeth including the canines, are retracted into the first premolar extraction space as one unit. This method typically compromises anchorage, causing posterior teeth to move mesially.</p><p>Extensive studies have been conducted on the T-loop design for orthodontic space closure, with a specific focus on loops constructed with titanium-molybdenum alloy (TMA).<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>4</sup>
</xref> The T-loop design typically ensures a consistent moment-to-force ratio (M:F), a uniform force intensity across the whole activation range of a closing loop, and a consistent low load-deflection rate.<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">

</xref>
</p><p>In response to the ongoing debate about the best mechanics for canine retraction, the present randomized clinical trial was conducted to evaluate the efficiency and suitability of Burstone T-loop (frictionless mechanics) and elastomeric power chain (friction mechanics) as segmented arch techniques for maxillary canine retraction. </p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIAL AND METHODS</title><sec><title>STUDY DESIGN</title><p>This study was a randomized trial with a split-mouth design, with an allocation ratio of 1:1 between the two quadrants. There were no changes after trial initiation.</p></sec><sec><title>REGISTRATION</title><p>This study was registered and approved by the Dental Research Ethics Committee of the faculty of dentistry at Mansoura University, Mansoura, Egypt (reference number: A01040230R) in April 2023. In addition, the trial (NCT05882526) has been registered on ClinicalTrials.gov. Enrollment of patients began in Jun 2023 and finished in March 2024. Every patient was included with information regarding the treatment procedures, and subsequently signed an informed consent. </p></sec><sec><title>SAMPLE SIZE, PARTICIPANTS, ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, AND SETTING</title><sec><title>Calculation of the sample size</title><p>The sample size for this study was determined using the software G*power v. 3.1.9.7 (Universit&#x000e4;t D&#x000fc;sseldorf, D&#x000fc;sseldorf, Germany). The calculation was based on the data reported from a previous study.<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>5</sup>
</xref> The assumptions for the analysis were a paired t-test with a 95% power and a significance level of 0.05. Therefore, the determined sample size was 14 patients. The sample size has been increased by including 16 patients (32 canines), to deal with potential dropout during the study period. Thus, a total of 16 patients (8 men and 8 women) with an average age of 19.06 &#x000b1; 2.22 years were selected from the outpatient clinic of the orthodontics department of Mansoura University School of Dentistry.</p><p>The following inclusion criteria were used: Class I malocclusion, with severe dental crowding or Class I bimaxillary dentoalveolar protrusion, age range of 17 to 23 years, fully erupted permanent canines, indication for both maxillary and mandibular first premolars extraction, no prior history of orthodontic treatment, good oral hygiene, and absence of any deleterious oral habits.</p><p>The exclusion criteria were as follows: poor oral hygiene, systemic diseases, preliminary signs of root resorption prior to orthodontic treatment, history of trauma or damage to the facial structures.</p></sec><sec><title>Randomization</title><p>The T-loops and power chains were allocated to either the right or left side, in a simple random manner, using random computer-generated numbers (Minitab v. 20 statistical software), with a 1:1 allocation ratio, by an academic staff member from the Department of Orthodontics, who was not involved in this research.</p><p>Identical opaque sealed envelopes, numbered in order, were used to conceal the allocation sequence, being opened only prior to the onset of maxillary canine retraction.</p></sec><sec><title>Blinding</title><p>The design of this study did not incorporate blinding for either the clinician or the patients. Nevertheless, the measurements (data collections) and statistical analysis phases involved blinding the researcher, to prevent bias in the investigation.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>INTERVENTIONS</title><p>One researcher treated all patients with a fixed, pre-adjusted Edgewise appliance (Roth prescription, 0.022 to 0.028-in slots) for the canines and second premolars, excluding bonding to the incisors.</p><p>Transpalatal arches with Nance buttons were utilized as anchorage for all patients, along with banding of the first molars using an Edgewise tube with a 0.022-in slot. The molars and premolars were secured together using a 0.016&#x000d7;0.022-in stainless steel wire, or they were anchored with stainless steel ligatures, or both methods were used simultaneously. Extraction of the first premolars was carried out in both arches without any prior leveling and alignment. Canine retraction was started at same time on both sides, using either power chains or T-loops (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>).</p><p>

</xref> (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). Passive springs were adjusted in the molar auxiliary tube and the canine bracket. The anterior vertical arm, with 5-mm length, was placed in the bracket of the canine, and tied with ligature wire. Additionally, a 4-mm long posterior vertical arm was engaged into the first molar tube&#x02019;s auxiliary slot, and was cinched back. The T-loop springs were positioned at the center of the extraction space. Pre-activation bends with 30&#x000b0; were incorporated into the T-loop at six different points, for a total pre-activation of 180&#x000b0;. To minimize disto-palatal canine rotation and adjust the inter-canine width during retraction, 35&#x000b0; anti-rotation bends were created in the anterior arms. By using a digital caliper with 0.01-mm accuracy (Mitutoyo, Sakado, Japan), a 3-mm activation was obtained. </p><p>

</p></sec><sec><title>SECTIONAL WIRE GUIDED RETRACTION USING POWER CHAIN</title><p>The sectional wire on the contralateral side was made of 0.016 &#x000d7; 0.022-in stainless steel (Dentaurum, Ispringen, Germany). The sectional wire was placed in the first molar band, the second premolar and the canine. The canine was additionally fixed to the sectional wire with a ligature tie, to minimize rotation during movement. It was cut mesial to the canine with stop coil bend, to prevent dislodgement of the wire. Artistic bends were made to adapt the sectional wire to a passive fit, in cases of malpositioned teeth away from the distal sliding path of canines. A continuous (closed) elastomeric power chain was attached to the molar tube hook on one end, and was then stretched twice its original size, to generate 200 g of force, measured with a Dontrix gauge (American Orthodontics, Sheboygan, WI, USA), while the other end was attached to the canine hook (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>).</p><p>

</p><p>Control visits took place over a four-week period, to monitor canine retraction. During these follow-up appointments, the progress of tooth movement was assessed, the retraction spring was activated, and the power chain was replaced.</p></sec><sec><title>OUTCOME ASSESSMENT</title><p>Outcomes evaluation was carried out using model analysis and radiographic assessment in panoramic radiographs. Rate of canine retraction, canine rotation, and mesiodistal axial inclination (tipping) were the primary outcomes measured. Changes in the position of the first molar (anchorage loss) were the secondary outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>MODEL ANALYSIS</title><p>Each patient performed two maxillary dental impressions: one immediately before canine retraction (T0), and another after the study period (T4), which lasted for four months. A Medit T710 scanner (Seoul, South Korea), known for its high accuracy (11 microns), was used to obtain digital models, by laser scanning plaster models.</p><p>The measurements were obtained using the 3Shape Analyzer computer software. The difference between the pre-retraction model (T0) and the model obtained after the four-month retraction period (T4) was used to calculate all measurements.</p><p>Digital models of the maxillary arch at T0 and T4 and superimposed models were used for the measurements. In the 3Shape software, the T0 and T4 models were chosen to carry out the superimpositions. An overlay of the two images was made possible by the selection of three stable reference points (palatal rugae region) from the T0 model, and their coordination with the reference points from the T4 model.<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">

Total canine retraction was measured at the cusp tip level (distance between two cusps) for both sides, from the cusp tip of the maxillary canine in T0 to the same point in T4 (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). The rate of canine retraction was calculated by dividing the millimeter-measured amount of retraction by the four-month time interval.</p><p>

The canine angulation was measured as the mesial angle created by the canine&#x02019;s long axis on the infraorbital line. The infraorbital line was drawn at the most inferior points of the left and right orbits (<xref rid="f7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). The difference between the degree of tipping in the pre-retraction and post-retraction panoramic radiographs was used to calculate the amount of canine tipping.</p><p>

To achieve the closure of these spaces in goal-oriented orthodontics, it is necessary to have a comprehensive understanding of the mechanical systems used. Either friction mechanics, which involves sliding, or frictionless mechanics, which uses loops, can accomplish space closure. Hence, clinicians consistently strive to identify and assess the superiority of one technique over another in retracting canines.</p><p>The current study used a split-mouth technique to standardize variables such as patient cooperation, oral hygiene, and bone thickness. Canine retraction started following extraction, to avoid any asymmetry between the two quadrants.</p><p>The selection of the elastomeric power chain for this study was based on the property of force degradation, which enables the uprighting of the canine during retraction.

<sup>11</sup>
</xref> a force of 150 to 200g is considered reasonable for tipping canines. In the present study, the T-loop spring was activated by 3 mm every four weeks, in order to apply a force of approximately 150g, as the activation protocol suggested by Keng et al.<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">

</xref> no significant difference in canine retraction was observed when applying either 100g or 200g of force. In the sliding side, the elastomeric chain applied 200g during insertion, but, after 8 hours, it dropped to 100g and, after four weeks, to 40-50g, while maintaining the same length.<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">

<sup>15</sup>
</xref> This can be due to the lack of binding and the application of a more constant force during the control visits by T-loops. On contrast, the lower amount of tooth movement on the side with sliding mechanics was most likely caused by mechanical rather than biologic factors. These mechanical factors include frictional binding and temporary or permanent stops in the movement of the teeth, caused by deformation and irregularities in the arch. </p><p>The retraction rate measurements obtained using the T-loops in the present study were nearly in agreement with Mehta and Sable<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">

<sup>19</sup>
</xref> It has been found that the retraction spring is not more effective than sliding mechanics in controlling canine rotation. There are multiple potential justifications for this outcome. In this study, the rotation in the loops was caused by a decrease in the angle of anti-rotation bends, which was 35&#x000b0;, as recommended by Burstone, and this is in contrast to the 90&#x000b0; anti-rotation bends proposed by Marcotte<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">

</p><p>Regarding tipping, the comparison of the tipping degree during canine movement in the present study favors the retraction spring, in approximately 7.5&#x000b0; distal tipping, as compared with approximately 8.61&#x000b0; with the sliding mechanics, and this coincides with Ziegler et al<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">

</xref> studies. The degree of tipping with the sliding mechanics would probably have been smaller if a stiffer archwire had been used. The more flexible wires will deflect, allowing more distal tipping, compared to stiff wires. Also, when force is applied away from the center of resistance during tooth movement, it leads to undesired tipping and rotation.</p><p>The tipping on the T-loops side was lower than that reported by Nandan et al.<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">
