Several ligands targeting the PSMA extracellular domain have been developed and complexed with diagnostic radionuclides for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of PCa. The best-characterized diagnostic PSMA radioligands for PET imaging of PCa include <sup>68</sup>Ga-PSMA-11, <sup>18</sup>F-DCFPyL, <sup>18</sup>F-rhPSMA-7.3, and <sup>18</sup>F-PSMA-1007. The diagnostic performance and superiority of <sup>68</sup>Ga-PSMA-11, <sup>18</sup>F-DCFPyL, and <sup>18</sup>F-rhPSMA-7.3 over conventional imaging in PCa initial staging and recurrence detection have been confirmed in several phase III trials [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. PSMA-targeted imaging is currently the diagnostic imaging of choice in PCa management.</p><p id="P6">All PSMA radioligands are excreted in the urine to a varying extent. The proximity of the prostate gland to the urinary bladder presents a challenge due to the potential of urinary bladder activity from the excreted radiotracer obscuring the visualization of PCa lesions adjacent to bladder luminal activity. This challenge is particularly important in early PCa recurrence post-prostatectomy, where most PCa recurrence occur as a small lesion in the prostate bed where visualization may be obscured by bladder activity. Detection of local prostate gland/bed recurrence contributes significantly to the overall detection rate of PSMA-targeted PET imaging of PCa at all PSA levels [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The closer the lesion is to the urinary bladder with high urine activity, the less likely it is to be detected with PSMA-targeted PET imaging [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p id="P7">In phase III trials, PSMA-targeted PET imaging has an excellent lesion detection rate with increasing PSA levels [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. At PSA below 0.5 ng/mL, detection rates range between 38% and 64% [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], indicating that the approved PSMA radioligands will fail to localize the site of PCa recurrence in 1/3rd to 2/3rd of patients with PSA below 0.5 ng/mL. Therefore, there is a clinical need for strategies to improve PCa lesion detection, especially at low PSA. Also, it is important to understand the differences in biokinetics of the different PSMA radioligands viz-a-viz their urinary excretion rate and explore avenues to utilize this understanding in interpreting PSMA PET findings and selecting the appropriate PSMA radioligand for a given clinical scenario.</p><p id="P8">Due to the critical impact of bladder activity level on the visualization of PCa lesions in the prostate bed, several avenues aimed at reducing urinary activity level at the time of PET imaging have been explored, including furosemide administration, early imaging, delayed imaging, dynamic imaging, and dual-timepoint imaging [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].

We also have cohorts imaged with <sup>68</sup>Ga-PSMA-11 and <sup>18</sup>F-rhPSMA-7.3 who were imaged with and without use of diuretic.</p><p id="P18">We found that <sup>18</sup>F-PSMA-1007 demonstrated the lowest bladder activity with a median bladder SUVmean of 1.75 [range: 0.4&#x02013;6.4] compared to 10.00 (1.9&#x02013;140), 15.92 (2.0&#x02013;106.0), and 25.7 (7.9&#x02013;87.6) for <sup>18</sup>F-rhPSMA-7.3, <sup>68</sup>Ga-PSMA-11, and <sup>18</sup>F-DCFPyL, respectively. Twenty mg furosemide co-administered with the radiotracer led to a 71% and 36% reduction in bladder activity of <sup>18</sup>F-rhPSMA-7.3 and <sup>68</sup>Ga-PSMA-11 with resultant median SUVmean of 2.95 and 10.21, respectively. As expected, furosemide administration led to increased bladder volume, and the bladder volume, in turn, demonstrated an inverse relationship with bladder activity.</p><p id="P19">Despite their high diagnostic performance for staging and re-staging of PCa, the urinary excretion of most PSMA radioligands presents a challenge, potentially limiting the localization of small lesions with subtle radiotracer avidity in the prostate bed as detection of recurrent disease on PET is adversely influenced by proximity to the bladder [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. With the availability of multiple PSMA radioligands for routine clinical use, it is important to understand the nuances in their biodistribution and how these may affect lesion detection. Our results are therefore important in that we present data demonstrating the differences in bladder activity levels of different PSMA radioligand and the influence of furosemide administration.</p><p id="P20">The values we report for <sup>18</sup>F-PSMA-1007 with a median bladder SUVmean of 1.75 (range = 0.4&#x02013;6.4), was similar to a median SUVmean of 3.08 (IQR = 1.66&#x02013;4.74) at 60 minutes post-injection without diuresis reported by Rahbar et al. [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. <sup>18</sup>F-PSMA-1007 has an inherent low rate of urinary excretion among common PSMA radioligands [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In the biodistribution study of <sup>18</sup>F-PSMA-1007 by Giesel et al., 1.2% of the administered radiotracer was excreted into the urinary bladder within the first 2 hours post-tracer administration [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. This is lower than the 2-hour bladder excretory rates of 7.2% for <sup>18</sup>F-rhPSMA-7.3 and 11% for <sup>18</sup>F-DCFPyL and <sup>68</sup>Ga-PSMA-11, respectively [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. However, <sup>18</sup>F-PSMA-1007 is not FDA-approved and is unavailable for routine clinical use in the United States.</p><p id="P21"><sup>18</sup>F-rhPSMA-7.3 has the next lowest bladder activity with a median SUVmean of 10 (range = 1.9&#x02013;140) but which may be reduced to a median SUVmean of 2.95 (range = 0.8&#x02013;17.6) by the use of 20 mg furosemide at the time of radiotracer administration. With this diuretic strategy, the FDA-approved <sup>18</sup>F-rhPSMA-7.3 bladder activity approaches that of <sup>18</sup>F-PSMA-1007. This median SUVmean of the non-diuretic cohort in our study of 10.00 was similar to median SUVmean 12.5 (0.7&#x02013;887) in the LIGHTHOUSE and SPOTLIGHT trial cohorts [<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p id="P22"><sup>68</sup>Ga-PSMA-11 without diuresis had a median SUV mean of 15.92 and was reduced with furosemide to 10.21 in our series. In the study by Uprimny et al., a group who have done extensive work with forced diuresis with <sup>68</sup>Ga-PSMA-11, 20 mg intravenous furosemide reduced bladder activity from a median SUVmean of 41.9 to 5.3 [<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In the study by Uprimmy et al., the median SUVmean of <sup>68</sup>Ga-PSMA-11 without furosemide was higher, and the median SUVmean of <sup>68</sup>Ga-PSMA-11 with furosemide was lower than in our study. These differences may be due to variance in patient population including renal function and chronic diuretic use which was not controlled for in our analysis. Most importantly the lower post-diuretic activity in the study by Uprimny is likely due to more robust forced diuresis utilizing 500 ml IV saline which was also reported in a separate manuscript [<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] to result in 40% urinary urgency as compared to our <sup>68</sup>Ga-PSMA-11 diuretic protocol without IV saline which was overall well tolerated.</p><p id="P23"><sup>18</sup>F-DCFPyL had the highest median SUVmean of 25.7 on our study. We could not find published data on median SUVmean on this radiotracer, but median SUVmax was reported to be 61.7 in the study by Donswijk et al and 79.32 by Giesel et al which is similar to the median SUVmax in our series of 51.42 [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Ferreira and coworkers reported a mean SUVpeak of 57.3, which is also not dissimilar to our findings of mean SUVmax of 66.07, as SUV peak would have slightly lower intensity [<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Yet, the higher the baseline bladder activity, the more difficult it may be to reduce the activity to less interfering levels with diuretic as reported by numerous authors [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. It has been our experience that diuresis is not widely utilized with <sup>18</sup>F-DCFPyL including in our center, and therefore, we do not have clinical data on its use with furosemide. Because <sup>68</sup>Ga-PSMA-11 baseline activity is significantly greater than that of <sup>18</sup>F-rhPSMA-7.3, there was only a 36% reduction with use of furosemide coadministered with <sup>68</sup>Ga-PSMA-11 versus a 71% reduction with use of a diuretic workflow with <sup>18</sup>F-rhPSMA-7.3.</p><p id="P24">We hypothesized that bladder distention may influence bladder activity levels due to relative dilution of radiotracer. Considering all 210 included studies, bladder volume showed a negative association with bladder activity, regardless of furosemide use. The negative association between bladder activity and bladder volume was most pronounced for <sup>18</sup>F-rhPSMA-7.3 with/without furosemide and, to a lesser extent, for <sup>18</sup>F-DCFPyL and <sup>18</sup>F-PSMA-1007 (Table 2). We found no significant association between the bladder activity of <sup>68</sup>Ga-PSMA-11 administered with/without furosemide and bladder volume. A higher bladder volume of dilute urine (less activity) not only reduces the obscuring effect of bladder activity but also allows the urinary bladder to lift away from the prostate bed, allowing better visualization of the prostate bed or intraprostatic lesions. As shown in the study of Freitag et al., lesions closest to the urinary bladder stand the highest risk of being missed on PSMA PET imaging [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. A full bladder with a lower radioactivity level is also desirable as it mimics the bladder condition during radiotherapy planning, allowing for more accurate PSMA PET and CT simulation image fusion for radiotherapy planning.</p><p id="P25">Our study has many strengths, including evaluating multiple PSMA radioligands in real world clinical and clinical trial use for PCa staging and restaging. We also investigated the association between bladder volume and bladder activity of these PSMA. Limitations of our study include a relatively heterogenous cohort of clinical and research studies. Three of the radiotracers, <sup>18</sup>F-rhPSMA-7.3, <sup>18</sup>F-DCFPyL, and <sup>68</sup>Ga-PSMA-11 were utilized at multiple hospitals at one university system, while <sup>18</sup>F-PSMA-1007 data was from only one hospital at a different university. Diuresis was only utilized with <sup>68</sup>Ga-PSMA-11 and rhPSMA-7.3 as diuresis was not necessary with <sup>18</sup>F-PSMA-1007 and considered futile with <sup>18</sup>F-DCFPyL. Our analysis did not investigate the impact of bladder activity level on lesion detection as this has been reported elsewhere [<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], suggesting a lower bladder activity level improves lesion detection in the prostate bed region in a subset of patients.</p></sec><sec id="S13"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="P26">There is variation in the bladder activity between the different PSMA radioligands. <sup>18</sup>F-PSMA-1007 has the lowest baseline bladder activity level, intermediate for <sup>18</sup>F-rhPSMA-7.3, while bladder activity is highest for <sup>68</sup>Ga-PSMA-11 and <sup>18</sup>F-DCFPyL. Administration of 20 mg furosemide produces a higher reduction in bladder activity for <sup>18</sup>F-rhPSMA-7.3 versus <sup>68</sup>Ga-PSMA-11. In fact, coadministered with 20 mg furosemide, bladder activity of <sup>18</sup>F-rhPSMA-7.3 approaches that of baseline <sup>18</sup>F-PSMA-1007. Finally, as an independent factor, there is an inverse relationship between bladder volume and bladder activity for most PSMA radioligands such that bladder activity reduces with increasing bladder volume.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="S14"><title>Research Funding</title><p id="P27">This study included data from the EMPIRE-2 trial, a phase II/III clinical trial (<ext-link xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03762759" ext-link-type="uri">NCT03762759</ext-link>) sponsored by the National Institute Health ((R01CA226992) that also received research support from Telix Pharmaceuticals (US) Inc.
