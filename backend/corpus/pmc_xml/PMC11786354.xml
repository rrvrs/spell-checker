Knowledge of specific situations impacts professionals&#x02019; opinion on legalization of MAID.</p></sec><sec id="FPar20"><title>How this study might affect research, practice or policy</title><p id="Par10">Training in palliative care is a major issue in haematology departments, which are faced with many complex end-of-life situations. Correctly identifying the different end-of-life care situations is an essential step to offering patients a high-quality palliative care, while strengthening their access to rights guaranteed by a changing legal framework.</p></sec><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par11">Laws allowing patients who meet specific eligibility criteria to request medical assistance in dying (MAID) are increasingly being adopted in various countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. MAID may refer to euthanasia, physician assisted dying or voluntary assisted dying, depending on the country. They may describe different situations such as the prescription of an oral lethal treatment that the patient administers himself, or the infusion by a physician of a lethal product at the patient&#x02019;s request [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].This trend confronts healthcare professionals and facilities with complex ethical and clinical issues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par12">Around the world, several jurisdictions have taken a stand against MAID. For example, Switzerland decriminalises assisted suicide under certain conditions. Oregon has authorised MAID since 1994. The Netherlands has decriminalised euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide since 2001. Belgium has only decriminalised euthanasia since 2002. Canada has authorised euthanasia and assisted suicide since 2016, Australia since 2017 and Spain since 2021 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].In France, the latest law of 2016 on patients&#x02019; rights at the end of life made it possible to access deep and continuous sedation until death in the event of refractory suffering at the end of life. A societal and parliamentary debate on legalizing MAID began in 2023, following the 139 public note by the National Consultative Committee of Ethics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In this notice, the experts raised the possibility of MAID because of shortcomings in current French legislation, subject to accelerated development of palliative care (PC) throughout the country.</p><p id="Par13">Haematology is a discipline frequently confronted with end-of-life situations, where patients have considerable needs in terms of PC and overall management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However, collaboration with PC teams is more difficult for haematologists than for oncologists treating patients with solid tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par14">Barriers to the integration of PC into haematology care are numerous and well described in the medical literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. These include obstacles stemming from the cultural model of haematologists: on the one hand, their preference for an individual relationship right up to the end of the patient&#x02019;s life, without referral to a third party team; on the other hand, their desire to preserve the patient&#x02019;s hope by pursuing specific therapeutic proposals shortly before death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. It therefore seems foreseeable that haematology teams in France will be particularly concerned by the question of their patients&#x02019; access to MAID.</p><p id="Par15">Indeed, there is a fear that this request may be a &#x0201c;default&#x0201d; solution for vulnerable patients and families with limited access to PC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Another apprehension concerns the risk of societal pressure in favor of MAID on the frailest people, who may be considered a &#x0201c;burden on society&#x0201d; because of their dependence, vulnerability and/or the seriousness of their illness. Yet this pressure would only exacerbate the existential suffering of patients at the end of life, that PC teams seek to alleviate, in particular by recognizing the value of others, whatever their situation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par16">The institutions and people involved in MAID seem to have adapted over time, following the introduction of new laws [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. For example, MAID is not only carried out in specialized or PC facilities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. This is why there is a huge need for training and support for all clinicians in all specialties, so that these new experiments can be used to improve thinking, practice and skills.</p><p id="Par17">Differentiating and identifying end-of-life&#x000a0;(EOL) situations is an essential foundation for ethical clinical practice. The role of palliative care has been to enrich the vocabulary and language of EOL care, in order to clarify prescribers&#x02019; intentions and better adjust management. For instance, sedative practices have long been confused with euthanasia, and thus remain controversial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. How much do hematology teams know about recognizing these EOL situations, at a time when legislation is likely to move towards legalizing MAID?</p><p id="Par18">In order to provide haematology teams with a basis for ethical reflection on this issue, the Ethics Committee of the French Society of Haematology (SFH) aimed to investigate the understanding of Law-defined complex EOL situations and the way they are perceived among health care providers working in hematology in France.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Design</title><p id="Par19">We constructed an cross-sectional online survey with a series of open-ended questions of hematology professionals in France. Our mixed-method survey study has been performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Sample</title><p id="Par20">The sample consisted of health professionals working or having worked in an inpatient hematology unit in France. They were informed about study through newsletters from the SFH (about 1000 members), the French Association of Residents in Hematology (about 250 members), the AFITCH-OR (French Association of Nurses working in cell therapy, hematology, oncology and radiotherapy )(about 70 members).</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Procedure</title><p id="Par21">Participants were invited by email in February 2023 to participate in the survey anonymously. A reminder was sent 2 weeks later. After that, a visual information about the survey was displayed in all the rooms of the SFH national congress in March 2023 for 3 days. Participants were self-recruited after being informed (voluntary sampling). The survey was conducted on the internet. It was open from February 10th, 2023, to April 30th, 2023.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Survey</title><p id="Par22">The study-specific questionnaire was developed by physicians in haematology and PC (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;8), based on clinical and educational experience. Clinical situations described in the survey were defined according to recommendations of French society of palliative care, French health authority and National Consultative Ethics Committee. After that, 10 professionals in hematology and members of the ethics committee of the SFH (psychologist, physicians and nurses) tested the questionnaire. It has been improved to make it easier for all healthcare professionals to understand and tested again by all the professionals (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;18).</p><p id="Par23">The comprehensive online questionnaire contained 55 questions and addressed respondents&#x02019; experience of complex EOL situations in hematology, i.e., treatment limitation and discontinuation, double-effect treatment, sedation for distress, deep and continuous sedation maintained until death, euthanasia and assisted suicide. Seven clinical vignettes described all these situations (euthanasia was described in two vignettes) (The English translation of the questionnaire is provided in the supplementary data <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). Firstly, respondents were asked to identify each situation (only one possible choice and one good answer), before describing its lawfulness and its routine practice. Then, if the situation was illegal in France, they were asked to give their opinion on whether it should be legalized and whether they would agree to carry out these acts. Justifications were then requested (open-ended answers). The questionnaire ended with the collection of socio-demographic data.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Ethical considerations</title><p id="Par24">The study was approved and promoted by the ethics committee of the SFH, which implied that individual informed written consent from participants was unnecessary. Answers were collected through the RedCap software. The information transmitted has been secured in compliance with French National Commission on Information and Liberty regulations.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Quantitative analysis</title><p id="Par25">Incomplete questionnaires were ruled out. Descriptive methods were used to present quantitative data. Since there was only one good answer by situation, the raw scores could range from 0 to 7, which were standardized using a linear transformation into scores ranging from 0 to 10. The overall knowledge was based on answers given to both &#x0201c;identification&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;lawfulness&#x0201d; questions, Respondents were divided into three categories, according to their overall knowledge standardized score: extensive overall knowledge if&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;7.5/10, average overall knowledge if 5-7.5/10, limited overall knowledge if&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;5/10. Results were analyzed according to overall knowledge category, age category, professional category, and to ethics or PC training. Respondents&#x02019; scores were compared between categories using Chi-square test of independence, Fisher&#x02019;s exact test or Kruskal-Wallis test, depending on the nature of variables to be compared. Univariate analysis were conducted using generalized linear models and subsequent multivariate analysis using stepwise selection among candidate variables were derived to evaluate the effect of these variables on the knowledge score. We explicitly asked the sub-group of respondents who correctly recognized the different situations if they encountered these cases in their department. After that, opinions on legalization of euthanasia and assisted suicide were compared according to their knowledge of these very practices.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Qualitative analysis</title><p id="Par26">The purpose of the 6 open-ended questions (2 questions by clinical vignette corresponding to MAID practices) was to explore the arguments put forward by the participants to justify the positions they had taken on euthanasia and assisted suicide.</p><p id="Par27">The thematic analysis was based on the guide proposed by Braun and Clarke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. All analyses were carried out by two authors with experience in qualitative research. The verbatims were first analysed by floating reading, which made it possible to read all the verbatims (CP, AP and LF). This step made it possible to identify the main themes contained in the verbatims (CP, AP and LF). Each verbatim was then freely coded by key words and key concepts by two reviewers who reread all the verbatims (CP and AP). The results were pooled. Any discrepancies in the coding of key words or concepts were resolved by discussion and consensus (CP, AP, LF, CB).</p><p id="Par28">The categorical data were presented as numbers and percentages.</p><p id="Par30">The thematic analysis of the responses to the questions relating to the justification for legalizing MAID added other sub-themes to the initial coding that had not been measured in terms of occurrences: they are illustrated by the verbatim statements deemed most significant (either those that occur most often or those that make it possible to clarify the data analysis) in order to illustrate the issue under study. The results of the thematic analysis were reviewed and validated by the various authors.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>Sample characteristics</title><p id="Par31">Of the 182 respondents, 133 (73%) were women, 106 (58%) were aged 30&#x02013;50, and 161 (88%) were working in a hematology unit at the time of the questionnaire.

There is lower knowledge of situations involving double effect, euthanasia and sedation for distress. Haematology healthcare professionals have a better knowledge of LATA situations. Training in PC stood for the main driver of carers&#x02019; knowledge of complex EOL situations, as well as being a physician. Training in PC is a major issue in haematology departments, which face many complex EOL situations. More frequent collaboration with PC teams could improve hematology teams&#x02019; knowledge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Accurate identification of the different EOL care situations represents an essential step in offering patients high-quality PC, while strengthening their access to rights guaranteed by a changing legal framework [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p><p id="Par55">Knowledge was associated with the opinion on assisted suicide and euthanasia: those with good knowledge of euthanasia definition were less in favour of legalization and would be less inclined to carry it out, whereas this relationship was less significant for assisted suicide.</p><p id="Par56">Participants with a good knowledge of these situations had often encountered them in their clinical practice (over 90% for LATA and double effect situations and over 80% for sedation for distress). The deep and continuous sedation was only carried out by 70% of participants who recognize it, while almost one professional in four believed they had already been confronted with a situation of euthanasia or assisted suicide, even though these situations are illegal in France.</p><p id="Par57">Euthanasia and assisted suicide carried out clandestinely are, by their very nature, particularly difficult to quantify, and seem to persist even in the event of legalization, as various reports in Belgium and the Netherlands have shown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. We may question what these clinical practices really are: given the nature of EOL situations, which are emotionally intense and require regular therapeutic adaptations, they may not be interpreted and identified in the same way by the different members of the same team, or by patients and their relatives. Yet this seems to be a major challenge in terms of training and support for the teams who carry them out, in order to improve the experience and quality of care in these EOL situations.</p><p id="Par58">Opinions of healthcare professionals regarding the legalization of MAID in France were diverse and well-founded. The arguments for and against legalizing MAID refered to common principles, such as beneficence (relieving suffering): a first conception attached to the principle of non-maleficence, where the relief of the patient&#x02019;s suffering is limited by the prohibition on &#x0201c;giving death&#x0201d;; and a second guided by the principle of autonomy, where respect for the patient&#x02019;s expressed wishes and the desire to put an end to his suffering come together. The MAID decision seemed to be strongly linked to the medical function, although the principle of collegiality, which has been present in French legislation for nearly 20 years in EOL situations, was very often evoked. The question of who performs these procedures was also not clear-cut, with some preferring the referral haematology team and others a third party team, such as PC. Finally, it is worth noting that, in the participants&#x02019; opinion, the patients&#x02019; experience of incurability and the cessation of specific treatments were considered a sufficient reason to justify MAID. This corroborates numerous qualitative studies highlighting the difficulty for haematologists in stopping specific treatments and thus destroying the patient&#x02019;s hope [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].</p><p id="Par59">Another qualitative study has explored the French oncologists&#x02019; position on euthanasia and their experiences in dealing with patients who request it [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In this study, most of the 24 oncologists or haematologists interviewed were opposed to legalizing euthanasia, citing concerns about the societal, medical and ethical implications of this practice. They refused physician-assisted suicide based on their ethical duty to preserve life, avoid harm and uphold the Hippocratic Oath. According to participants, patient requests for euthanasia were rare. Our study seemed to be more nuanced with regard to the opinion of healthcare professionals, who seemed less homogeneous in our survey.</p><p id="Par60">In addition, another recent survey was carried out in France on the opinion of healthcare professionals regarding the legalization of MAID [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. In this study, 1439 PC stakeholders (19% volunteers, 33% nurses and 26% physicians) took part and expressed an opinion about the legalization of MAID. 1053 (69.7%) were against the legalization of MAID. When forced to choose which option should be privileged if the law had to change, 3.7% favoured euthanasia, 10.1% favoured assisted suicide with provision of lethal drug by a professional, 27.5% favoured assisted suicide with prescription of a lethal drug and 29.5% favoured assisted suicide with provision of a lethal drug by an association. The opinion regarding legalization of MAID was statistically different depending on the participant profession (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001). Nurses and physicians were statistically more reticent about MAID than other professionals, and there was no relationship with age or number of years&#x02019; experience in PC. Compared with our study, PC stakeholders appeared to be more reticent than haematology professionals about changes to the legal framework. The survey did not assess participants&#x02019; level of knowledge about EOL situations.</p><sec id="Sec20"><title>Strengths</title><p id="Par61">To the best of our knowledge, our study was the first to have specifically questioned haematology healthcare professionals, analyzing their opinions in relation to their knowledge of the EOL situations. In this way, we were attempting to establish training priorities, as well as keys to understanding and providing support for French healthcare professionals faced with changes in the legal framework in which they work. The Ethics Committee of the French Society of Haematology will thus be able to adapt its online training courses and the themes of its training days to the results of this survey.</p><p id="Par62">The multi-professional profile of our sample was a strength, in an area where it is sometimes difficult for teams to share their views. The design of our study was a mixed methodology making it possible to interpret the quantitative data using qualitative results, according to the definition of mixed studies proposed by Pluye and Vedel (Mc Gill University) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. This design allowed for a more in-depth interpretation of the links between training and opinion, and a better understanding of the results obtained.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Limitations</title><p id="Par63">Given the current legislative situation in France, it was relevant to gain a better understanding of clinicians&#x02019; knowledge and opinions regarding possible changes to the legal framework. In the absence of a validated tool on this subject, we designed a targeted questionnaire, based on clinical vignettes, to assess health care professionals&#x02019; knowledge of the latest EOL legislation and its application on the specific hematology context. Due to the time constraints, it was not possible to go through all the validation and reliability stages required to make it a rigorous research tool. Therefore, external validation of this survey should be treated with caution.</p><p id="Par64">Our results are based on a transversal survey collecting only the opinions of participants who consented to participate in the study. Given the size of the overall target population (haematology healthcare professionals in France), this study could not claim to be representative of the whole population. Furthermore, due to the sampling method, non-respondents could not be studied or compared to respondents.</p><p id="Par65">Regarding qualitative data, we observed a successive loss of responses as the survey progressed. It was also difficult to analyze very short responses with numerous contradictions, limiting the qualitative analysis. Semi-structured interviews should be performed to complete the results.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par66">French hematology healthcare professionals have lesser knowledge of situations involving double effect, euthanasia and sedation for distress than of situations involving limiting or stopping treatment. Knowledge of specific EOL situations has a different influence on opinion of legalization of MAID.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.</p><p>
