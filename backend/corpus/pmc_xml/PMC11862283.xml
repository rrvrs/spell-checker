Essential molecular markers, in addition to IDH mutations, include alpha-thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome X-linked (ATRX) loss and p53 expression, which significantly influence their classification and prognosis.

A total of 67 patients with high-grade gliomas (43 GBM, 24 ASTROG4) were analyzed using IHC for IDH1, ATRX, p53, and PKM2.

A key characteristic of gliomas is the presence or absence of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) enzyme expression. The most common IDH mutation in gliomas is IDH1 R132H, which accounts for up to 91% of IDH mutations. The current WHO 2021 classification of adult gliomas relies heavily on IDH expression. It is well established that the presence of an IDH mutation is associated with slower tumor growth, while IDH wild-type tumors tend to be more aggressive. Thus, according to the WHO 2021 classification, a diffuse glioma exhibiting microvascular proliferation or necrosis, along with an IDH mutation, is classified not as glioblastoma (GBM), but as grade 4 astrocytoma (ASTROG4) [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>In addition to IDH expression, the mutation of tumor protein p53 and the inactivation of the alpha-thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome X-linked (ATRX) pathway are also significant in gliomas. Studies have shown that ATRX expression often accompanies IDH mutation and frequently co-occurs with p53 mutation, suggesting a cooperative pathogenic mechanism between these three proteins essential for oncogenesis. ATRX facilitates the incorporation of the histone variant H3.3 into heterochromatin, leading to telomere length alterations and genomic instability. The TP53 gene plays a critical role in cell regulating cycle arrest, differentiation, apoptosis, senescence, and DNA damage repair. Mutant p53 protein interacts with other oncoproteins, promoting tumorigenesis. P53 is upregulated in many cancers and plays a significant role in the development and progression of astrocytic tumors. The frequency of p53 mutations in astrocytoma is estimated to be between 50-70%. Research continues into the relationship between ATRX and p53 mutations, particularly their prognostic significance and influence on patient survival rates [<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>-<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>For high-grade glioma, the standard treatment consists of maximal surgical resection followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy, primarily temozolomide. However, overall one-year survival (OS) is 53.7% for GBM, compared to 98.0%, 92.4%, and 76.3% for grade 2, 3, and 4 astrocytomas, respectively. Thus, there is a pressing need to identify new therapeutic approaches to improve survival rates [<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>-<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Tumor metabolism has become a promising target for cancer treatment, including in astrocytic tumors, which exhibit significant metabolic remodeling to support survival, proliferation, and invasion. Understanding the mechanisms and protumorigenic metabolic pathways is essential in identifying relevant therapeutic targets. Since the primary energy source for rapidly growing tissues is glycolytic oxidation of glucose, enzymes involved in glycolysis, such as pyruvate kinases, may serve as important therapeutic targets. During glycolysis, each glucose molecule is converted into two pyruvate molecules and two ATP molecules in the cytoplasm. Pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) catalyzes the final irreversible step of glycolysis and serves as a key rate-limiting enzyme in cancer cell metabolism [<xref rid="REF14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>-<xref rid="REF19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>PKM2 overexpression has been observed in various cancers, providing tumor cells with selective growth advantages and contributing to metabolic reprogramming by increasing glucose uptake, inhibiting autophagy, and promoting lactate production. Conversely, downregulation of PKM2 induces cell death and reduces tumor cell proliferation by suppressing aerobic glycolysis. Disrupting glycolysis is considered a promising strategy for eliminating tumor cells, with PKM2 emerging as a potential therapeutic target. In gliomas, increased PKM2 expression has been observed in tumor tissue as well as in the adjacent normal brain tissue, highlighting PKM2&#x02019;s crucial role in tumorigenesis. While various studies have explored strategies to regulate PKM2 and its therapeutic potential, its precise role in glioma progression and its prognostic significance in astrocytic-origin tumors remain unclear [<xref rid="REF20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>-<xref rid="REF23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>This study aimed to quantitatively measure PKM2 IHC expression in GBM (IDH wildtype) versus ASTROG4 (IDH R132H mutant), to assess the correlation between PKM2 expression and prognosis in these two patient groups, and to investigate the prognostic significance of ATRX and p53 expression in relation to PKM2 levels.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Sample source and collection</p><p>This prospective, single-center study was conducted in the Department of Neurosurgery and the Department of Pathology at the County Emergency Clinical Hospital in Targu Mures, Romania, between January 2021 and December 2023. The patients were divided into two groups based on IHC classification: subjects presenting the IDH R132H mutation were classified as ASTROG4, while those with IDH wildtype expression were classified as GBM.</p><p>During the study period, 144 cases with clinical and imaging suspicions of high-grade gliomas underwent surgical treatment. Of these, 67 cases (43 GBM and 24 ASTROG4) met the inclusion criteria, which were as follows: histopathological confirmation of grade 4 astrocytic-origin glial tumors, newly diagnosed (de novo) tumors, patients who had not received prior oncological treatment, complete tumor resection (defined as the absence of contrast enhancement on postoperative imaging within 72 hours of surgery, MRI T1+c), signed informed consent for study participation, successful histopathological slide analysis using designated software.</p><p>The exclusion criteria for the study included the following: patients with incomplete clinical or pathological data, glial tumors of non-astrocytic origin, Grade 2 or 3 astrocytoma, recurrent tumors, subtotal or partial resection, biopsy-only cases, loss of patients to follow-up, refusal to participate in the study, errors in slide readings by the software.</p><p>Histology and IHC were both performed according to the WHO 2021 [<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] criteria for all included cases (n=67) before the cohorts were divided into GBM (n=43) and ASTROG4 (n=24). This approach ensured that the histological evaluations adhered to standardized guidelines, allowing for reliable comparisons between the groups. The division of the cohorts into these two groups was then based on the IHC results.</p><p>Postoperative imaging, performed within the first 72 hours after surgery to evaluate the completeness of tumor resection, followed a standardized MRI protocol. Scans were conducted using a 1.5T Siemens Sonata or Avanto system (Siemens Medical Systems, Erlangen, Germany). The protocol included axial T1-weighted and T2-weighted sequences with a 5-mm section thickness, sagittal fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images with a 1.3 mm section thickness, and axial diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) images with a 5 mm section thickness. Diffusion gradients were applied using b-values of 0, 500, and 1000 s/mm&#x000b2;, with apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps subsequently calculated. Post-contrast imaging consisted of sagittal 3D T1-weighted gradient-echo (MPRAGE) sequences with a section thickness of 1-1.5 mm.</p><p>All participants included in the study provided informed consent. This study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and the protocol was approved by the Hospital&#x02019;s Ethics Committee (No. 30 291 from 08.12.2020). Each patient underwent clinical evaluation at multiple time points: before surgery, 24 hours postoperatively, at discharge, and every three months thereafter. Clinical data were recorded on individual evaluation sheets, which were used throughout the follow-up period. Cognitive function was assessed using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment Test [<xref rid="REF24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], motor function using the Medical Research Council (MRC) scale [<xref rid="REF25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], and aphasia using the Kaplan score [<xref rid="REF26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Major motor deficits were defined as an MRC score &#x02264;3.</p><p>Immunohistochemistry</p><p>The IHC reactions were performed on paraffin-embedded tissue sections with a thickness of 4 &#x003bc;m. For deparaffinization, rehydration, and antigen retrieval, the sections were treated with EnVision FLEX Target Retrieval Solution (pH 9, 20 min, 97&#x000b0;C; Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) using the PTLink platform (Dako). Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked by a five-minute incubation with EnVision FLEX Peroxidase Blocking Reagent (Dako). Subsequently, the slides were incubated for one hour at 37&#x000b0;C with specific primary antibodies: IDH1-R132H (clone IHC 132, dilution 1:25; Bio SB Inc., Goleta, CA, USA), ATRX (clone BSB 108, dilution 1:50; Bio SB; p53: clone DO7, dilution 1:800; Bio SB), PKM2 (polyclonal antibody, unconjugated, RRID: AB_2546815). The EnVision Flex/horseradish peroxidase (HRP) secondary system (Dako, 30 min) was used for signal amplification, and the chromogen 3,3&#x02032;-diaminobenzidine (DAB) was used for primary antibody detection. The slides were then counterstained with hematoxylin. IHC reactions for each antibody were performed separately for each patient on a distinct slide.</p><p>The evaluation of the IHC reactions was carried out independently by two qualified pathologists for the following reactions: IDH1, ATRX, p53, and Ki-67. Furthermore, to assess potential sources of interobserver bias, a standardized protocol was used for the evaluation of IHC reactions, and discrepancies between the two qualified pathologists were resolved through consultations and consensus. A preliminary examination of the sections was conducted using a Zeiss (Oberkochen, Germany) Axiolab 5 optical microscope equipped with an Axiocam 208 color digital camera. The Ki-67 proliferation index was determined as the percentage of tumor cells with positive nuclear staining (regardless of intensity) in 1,000 cells, while p53 evaluation was based on the percentage of cells showing nuclear immunostaining in 200 cells across five fields. Immunoexpression was considered negative if the immunostaining was &#x0003c;10% (wild-type) and positive if &#x0003e;10% of the examined cells were stained (mutant). IDH mutation expression was determined by assessing tumor cells with positive cytoplasmic immunostaining, regardless of intensity. Cases where at least 10% of cells were stained were considered positive (mutant IDH), while cases with staining in &#x02264;10% of tumor cells were considered negative (wild-type IDH), as shown in Figure <xref rid="FIG1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. For the ATRX marker, ATRX gene mutations result in the loss of nuclear immunoexpression in tumor cells, whereas ATRX immunoexpression remains preserved in non-mutated ATRX cells or endothelial cells, which also serve as an endogenous positive control. Cases with nuclear staining in more than 50% of cells were defined as ATRX-positive, while cases with &#x0003c;50% stained cells were defined as ATRX-negative (loss of ATRX expression).</p><fig position="anchor" fig-type="figure" id="FIG1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>IHC Expression of Key Markers (IDH1-R132H, ATRX, p53, and Ki67) in the ASTROG4 and GBM</title><p>a, c, e, g) Case No. 2, diagnosed with ASTROG4, OS: 26 months; b, d, f, h) Case No. 18, diagnosed with GBM, OS: 21 months.

From each specimen, three areas of 1 mm2 each (resolution 20x), containing only tumor tissue, were identified, with each region containing over 700 tumor cells. To objectively evaluate IHC staining, we used the quantification module (CellQuant), which quantifies both the number and intensity of the immunostaining. Within the 3DHISTECH image analysis software, the H-score provides a more detailed assessment than simple positive cell counting, as it combines both the proportion of positive cells and their staining intensity, thereby quantifying variability in expression based on intensity.</p><p>Immunostaining was quantified using the CellQuant module from 3DHISTECH for digital image analysis. The quantification process involved selecting the &#x0201c;Quant Detection&#x0201d; option, which enabled color deconvolution to separate the specific signals of the chromogen in the plasma and the counterstain used to highlight the nuclei. Settings for the cell nuclei were adjusted with a minimum size of 6.0 and intensity at 1, while for the cytoplasm, the width was set to 3.0, with intensity at 1. Additionally, intensity for the membrane was set to 1. The analysis was performed on a region selected from the images, previously marked with Annotation1, 2, 3 using a 20x objective, which included tumor tissue. These settings allowed precise quantification of the intensity and the number of immunolabeled cells in each selected region.</p><p>The H-score for each region was calculated using the default setting, which is determined by the percentage of positive cells and their intensity. The formula for H-score is: H-score = &#x003a3;pi(i+1), where &#x0201c;pi&#x0201d; represents the percentage of positive cells out of the total number of cells, and &#x0201c;i&#x0201d; represents the intensity. The intensity score &#x0201c;i&#x0201d; can range from 0 to 3, where: 0- no staining, 1- weak staining, 2- moderate staining, 3- strong staining. The final H-score ranges from 0 to 300, where 0 indicates the absence of staining and 300 indicates staining present in 100% of cells. Regarding the interpretation of the H-score, a value between 0-100 suggests low or absent expression of the marker, a value between 100-200 indicates moderate expression, and a value between 200-300 suggests high expression of the marker. The Proportion Score quantifies the proportion of positive cells, representing the percentage of positive cells relative to the total cells in the tissue section. A proportion score of 0 indicates that 0% of cells are positive, a score of 1 indicates positivity between 1-10%, a score of 2 indicates positivity between 11-25%, a score of 3 indicates positivity between 26-50%, a score of 4 indicates positivity between 51-75%, while a score of 5 indicates positivity between 76-100% (Figure <xref rid="FIG2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).</p><fig position="anchor" fig-type="figure" id="FIG2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Immunohistochemical Quantification of PKM2 Expression in GBM and ASTROG4 Cohorts</title><p>From the GBM cohort: a, b, c) Case No. 2: 50 years old, Female.

Additionally, we investigated the relationship between PKM2 expression and commonly used IHC markers in astrocytic tumors, ATRX and p53, to evaluate their prognostic significance in the context of PKM2 expression.</p><p>Negative ATRX status in tumor cells, coupled with concurrent positive status in normal cells, suggests an ATRX mutation. Diffuse immunopositivity for p53, on the other hand, is indicative of a TP53 mutation. Loss of ATRX expression (negative status) due to mutations, deletions, gene fusions, or other molecular alterations leads to DNA damage. ATRX status has been associated with patient age and prognosis. ATRX mutations have been identified in children with pilocytic astrocytoma that occasionally exhibit signs of anaplasia. In adults, negative ATRX status has been observed in 71% of grade 2 and 3 astrocytoma, in up to 57% of grade 4 astrocytoma, and in only 4% of GBM cases. Negative ATRX status is thus more common in younger patients and is presumed to be a positive prognostic factor. Furthermore, ATRX mutations are specific to astrocytoma and help differentiate them from oligodendrogliomas, where 1p19q codeletion rarely co-occurs with ATRX mutations. Another critical aspect is the involvement of ATRX loss (negative status) in immune response, potentially increasing cytokine secretion, inflammatory infiltrates, and even tumor cell growth inhibition by immune cell effectors [<xref rid="REF27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Our findings support these observations. Negative ATRX status was found in only 13.96% of the GBM lot and in 41.67% of the ASTROG4 lot, aligning with the distinct genetic alteration patterns characteristic of IDH-mutant astrocytoma. Similarly, p53 expression was more frequent in the ASTROG4 group (83.33%) compared to the GBM group (53.48%). These differences confirm the correlation between IDH mutations and more stable tumor progression. Our results align with literature findings suggesting that p53 expression is frequently associated with IDH mutations (Table <xref rid="TAB2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). According to the literature, the combined IDH/p53 mutation is characteristic of astrocytoma, implying more stable tumor evolution and greater sensitivity to specific therapies. In GBM, p53 is a less specific marker, but is thought to be associated with more aggressive progression and should be interpreted alongside other molecular biomarkers for a more comprehensive profile [<xref rid="REF28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>-<xref rid="REF30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p>PKM2 overexpression has been noted in various cancer types. Park et al. provided detailed insights into the IHC expression of PKM2 in glioma tissue samples, adjacent non-tumorous tissues, and normal brain tissue. Their findings demonstrated that PKM2 overexpression is characteristic of tumor tissue and is correlated with glioma development. PKM2, a key regulator of cellular energy metabolism, is significantly overexpressed in tumor tissues compared to normal brain tissues. This suggests its significant role in the initiation and progression of brain tumors. Notably, the study also reported increased PKM2 expression in normal tissues adjacent to tumors, though less pronounced than in glioma tissues. This finding hints at the possibility of genetic alterations occurring in the peripheral regions surrounding the tumor [<xref rid="REF20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>In our study, we employed digital quantitative measurement for slide visualization and analysis to minimize interobserver variability. The analyzed area included over 700 cells/mm2. Digital analysis provides both a binary assessment (positive or negative) of PKM2 expression and detailed scoring evaluations. This approach allowed for precise and reproducible measurements of PKM2 expression, which is crucial in understanding its potential role in tumor metabolism. Comparing PKM2 expression with IDH mutation status revealed no significant differences between IDH-mutant (ASTROG4) and IDH-wild type (GBM) cases. Intensity scores, proportion scores, and H-scores were similar across both groups, with no statistically significant differences (p &#x0003e; 0.05, Table <xref rid="TAB2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, Figure <xref rid="FIG3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). These findings suggest that PKM2 expression is independent of IDH status in high-grade astrocytic tumors. Regardless of whether a tumor is IDH-mutant or IDH-wild type, PKM2 expression remains consistent, indicating that PKM2 may not be directly influenced by the IDH mutation in the context of GBM and ASTROG4. Thus, PKM2&#x02019;s role in tumor metabolism and progression may involve distinct molecular pathways, such as those related to glycolysis or alternative metabolic reprogramming mechanisms, warranting further investigation into its potential as a therapeutic target in both IDH-mutant and IDH-wild type tumors.</p><p>On the other hand, when examining the relationship between PKM2 and ATRX expression, significant differences were observed. ATRX-negative cases exhibited higher PKM2 expression compared to ATRX-positive cases. This difference was statistically significant for medium-positive (p = 0.041) and intensely positive PKM2 expression (p = 0.004), as well as for calculated scores (p = 0.004 for intensity score and p = 0.019 for H-score, Table <xref rid="TAB2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). This observation raises the hypothesis that ATRX and PKM2 are interconnected through cellular regulatory mechanisms. ATRX is a key marker for genomic stability. Its loss may increase energy demands in tumor cells, driving greater PKM2 activity in glycolytic processes to meet metabolic needs. Although ATRX itself is not directly involved in glycolysis, its role in maintaining chromatin stability and preventing telomere dysfunction is crucial for preserving cellular integrity. Loss of ATRX function may lead to metabolic shifts, favoring alternative pathways such as aerobic glycolysis to support tumor growth and invasiveness. These findings suggest that, in the absence of ATRX, tumor cells may develop an increased dependence on PKM2 activity. This relationship underscores their significance in oncogenesis and identifies new avenues for research into the metabolic mechanisms underlying glioma genesis. Further investigation into the ATRX-PKM2 axis could reveal novel therapeutic strategies targeting tumor metabolism.</p><p>We also examined the relationship between PKM2 and p53, finding no statistically significant correlation between these two markers. Regardless of p53 status (positive or negative), PKM2 expression levels remained similar, with no significant statistical differences (p &#x0003e; 0.05 for all categories). This result suggests that PKM2 activity is not influenced by p53 in high-grade astrocytoma, even though p53 is recognized as a major regulator of the cell cycle and apoptosis in this pathology. It is possible that PKM2 operates via pathways independent of those controlled by p53, potentially involving alternative cellular survival mechanisms. Additionally, correlating PKM2 with the proliferation marker Ki67 yielded statistically insignificant results. Although PKM2 is frequently associated with increased metabolic activity in tumors, its expression levels were not closely correlated with the cellular proliferation rate marked by Ki67 (p &#x0003e; 0.05, with a correlation coefficient of r = 0.230 for strong expression), as shown in Table <xref rid="TAB2" ref-type="table">2</xref>. This finding suggests that PKM2 may play a more critical role in the metabolic adaptation of tumor cells rather than directly driving their growth. PKM2 might support tumor development by fulfilling energy demands rather than by directly stimulating cellular division. This metabolic-focused function makes PKM2 a unique therapeutic target for inhibiting tumor metabolism without affecting the proliferation of normal cells. The weak relationship between PKM2 and Ki67 supports the notion that PKM2 predominantly plays a metabolic role rather than a proliferative one. This distinction could inform therapeutic strategies targeting PKM2 to disrupt tumor metabolism selectively while sparing normal tissue functions.</p><p>Comparing survival outcomes between GBM and ASTROG4 is essential for understanding the prognostic differences between these two types of malignant brain tumors. Mortality within 12 months of diagnosis shows similar trend in both groups. A higher proportion of GBM patients (39.5%) succumbed within this period compared to ASTROG4 patients (20.8%). However, this difference is not statistically significant (p = 0.118). Both groups face a substantial risk of death within the first year, but this difference lacks statistical confirmation. In contrast, survival beyond 24 months reveals a statistically significant difference (p = 0.001). Approximately two-thirds (66.7%) of ASTROG4 patients survived more than 24 months, compared to only 25.6% of GBM patients. Further analysis using the coefficient B (negative), indicates that ASTROG4 patients have a 36.7% lower risk of death than GBM patients. However, this finding does not achieve statistical significance (p = 0.275), highlighting the need for cautious interpretation (Figure <xref rid="FIG4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). These findings reinforce the well-documented notion that GBM is a significantly more aggressive tumor with a much poorer prognosis compared to ASTROG4. Differentiating these tumor types is crucial for discussing patient prognosis and tailoring treatment strategies effectively.</p><p>Cox regression analysis of survival data reveals a statistically significant effect of the PKM2 intensity score on patient survival (p = 0.041). The coefficient B = 2.028 indicates a positive association between the intensity score and mortality risk. For each unit increase in the PKM2 intensity score, the risk of death increases approximately 7.6 times (Exp(B) = 7.596, Table <xref rid="TAB3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). This finding suggests that higher PKM2 intensity scores, indicative of elevated metabolic activity, are associated with more aggressive tumor behavior and faster disease progression. As the original aim of this study was to assess the differences in PKM2 expression between GBM (IDH wild type) and ASTROG4 (IDH R132H mutant), our findings suggest that PKM2 expression, particularly the intensity score, could serve as a prognostic marker of disease severity across both groups. Moreover, while no significant differences were found in PKM2 expression based on IDH mutation status, the intensity score might still provide valuable insights for patient stratification and personalized treatment planning.</p><p>An independent predictor of survival was the presence of significant motor deficit (MRC &#x02264; 3). The Stepwise Cox Regression analysis identified motor deficit as a statistically significant factor, with a coefficient B = 1.165 (p = 0.011). Patients with significant motor deficits had a hazard ratio (Exp(B) = 3.205), meaning they were approximately 3.2 times more likely to die within a given period compared to those without such deficits. This underscores the substantial impact of motor deficits on survival outcomes.</p><p>The global significance of the regression model was confirmed by the Omnibus Tests of Model Coefficients (Figure <xref rid="FIG5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>), which yielded a Chi-square value of 7.248 and a p-value of 0.007. Furthermore, the Stepwise Cox Regression analysis (p = 0.020) demonstrated that including motor deficits as a variable significantly improved the model's explanatory power for survival variability. These findings emphasize the prognostic importance of both the PKM2 intensity score and motor deficits in GBM and ASTROG4 patients. The PKM2 intensity score reflects tumor aggressiveness, supporting its use in risk stratification. Meanwhile, motor deficits emerge as a robust predictor of poor survival, highlighting the need for early intervention and tailored rehabilitation to improve patient quality of life and potentially enhance survival outcomes. Together, these insights offer valuable guidance for clinical decision-making and risk management in glioma care.</p><p>Although we have uncovered important data regarding the role of PKM2 in high-grade astrocytic tumors, this study has some notable limitations. The classification of high-grade astrocytic tumors was based exclusively on histopathological and IHC criteria, and the absence of genetic analyses could limit the overall accuracy of the findings. Genetic analyses would have provided a more comprehensive understanding of the tumor's molecular landscape, enhancing the interpretation of PKM2 as a potential prognostic marker. We acknowledge that this limitation may affect the reproducibility and generalizability of the study, as genetic mutations or alterations could influence PKM2 expression and tumor behavior in ways that were not captured by the current methodology. Furthermore, the histopathological evaluations were validated solely by our internal research team, which may have introduced a degree of subjectivity. We have made efforts to mitigate this potential bias by ensuring rigorous internal quality control measures. However, future studies would benefit from validation by an external team to further reduce any subjectivity. In addition, the study relied solely on IHC techniques to investigate the role of PKM2. While IHC is a valuable tool, incorporating other methods such as genomic or proteomic analyses could have provided more robust and complementary data, leading to a better understanding of PKM2's role in tumor progression. The relatively small cohort size is another limitation that could impact the statistical power of the study. Future research should include larger sample sizes to validate our findings and improve the reliability of the results.</p><p>To address these limitations, we implemented strategies to ensure the consistency of IHC staining. These included rigorous standardization of protocols and careful validation of antibody specificity, as well as the use of automated digital image analysis tools to reduce inter-observer variability. Furthermore, we made efforts to minimize selection bias during patient recruitment by employing clear inclusion and exclusion criteria. These strategies were crucial in enhancing the transparency of our methodology and the robustness of our findings. We recognize that these limitations highlight areas for improvement in future studies. Expanding the scope of research to include genetic profiling, larger sample sizes, and multi-modal analytical approaches would provide a more holistic understanding of PKM2's potential as a prognostic marker. Additionally, exploring strategies to further minimize bias and enhance reproducibility would strengthen the overall reliability of the results.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Elevated PKM2 levels in ATRX-negative cases suggest a compensatory response to genomic instability associated with ATRX loss, while higher PKM2 intensity scores are linked to an increased risk of mortality.
