These processes are facilitated by lymphatic networks present in the meninges that drain cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Age-related impairments to meningeal lymphatic drainage contribute to CNS waste accumulation and immune dysfunction, yet the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we identify extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling in the aged dura as a key driver of CSF clearance deficits, demonstrating that peri-lymphatic collagen accumulation disrupts lymphatic function. Exploring immune-derived factors contributing to this ECM remodeling, we identify transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF&#x003b2;1) as a major regulator using primary human dural fibroblasts. Using a novel mouse model with constitutively active TGF&#x003b2; receptor 1 (TGF&#x003b2;R1) signaling in dural fibroblasts, we show that excessive peri-lymphatic collagen deposition impairs meningeal lymphatic drainage and alters meningeal immunity. Mechanistically, we reveal that ECM-associated matrix stiffness disrupts lymphatic junction integrity and impairs lymphangiogenesis in human lymphatic endothelial cells. These findings establish dural immune cell and fibroblast-mediated ECM remodeling as a critical regulator of CSF clearance and highlight it as a potential therapeutic target for restoring brain waste clearance in aging.</p><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12974-025-03436-0.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Fibrosis</kwd><kwd>Lymphatics</kwd><kwd>Aging</kwd><kwd>Traumatic brain injury</kwd><kwd>Extracellular matrix</kwd><kwd>Meninges</kwd><kwd>Meningeal immunity</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100001511</institution-id><institution>Auckland Medical Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100001543</institution-id><institution>Neurological Foundation of New Zealand</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/100016905</institution-id><institution>Hugh Green Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100009193</institution-id><institution>Marsden Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100001509</institution-id><institution>Royal Society Te Ap&#x00101;rangi</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par2">Efficient clearance of metabolic waste and neurotoxic proteins from the central nervous system (CNS) is crucial for maintaining brain health and function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In peripheral tissues, waste removal is achieved by tissue-resident lymphatic systems that maintain homeostatic functions by draining interstitial fluid and facilitating immune surveillance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The brain is distinct in that it lacks a parenchymal lymphatic network. Instead, fluid and waste removal from the CNS is facilitated by two connected systems, the glymphatic system and lymphatic networks in the brain border tissues&#x02014;the meninges [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Together, these CNS clearance routes shuttle waste-laden interstitial fluid out of the brain, into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), to the dural layer of the meninges via discontinuities in the arachnoid layer, and then to deep cervical lymph nodes (dCLNs) via a dural lymphatic network [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Recently, an additional site for CSF drainage via a lymphatic plexus in the nasopharynx was described that also permits drainage of CSF to dCLNs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Collectively, these networks enable effective CNS waste clearance.</p><p id="Par3">While clearance of CSF, and by extension, the removal of brain interstitial fluid, is crucial for homeostatic CNS function, it is even more important during varied insults which generate excessive pathological waste. These conditions include age-related neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson&#x02019;s and Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease, which are characterized by the accumulation of misfolded proteins within the CNS and CSF that drive neuroinflammation and neuronal loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Similarly, traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) result in the generation of hyperphosphorylated tau species, cellular debris, and toxic blood-derived products which can also disrupt neuronal function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Critically, aging, age-related neurodegenerative diseases, and TBIs are all associated with compromised CNS-draining lymphatic function, further exacerbating neurological dysfunction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. While the exact cause(s) of these CSF clearance deficits are unclear, restoring CSF drainage improved neurological outcomes in both age-related neurodegenerative diseases and TBIs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. However, such approaches use proof-of-concept interventions that do not target the underlying pathology and are not amendable to rapid clinical translation or acute deployment. Understanding the mechanisms driving CSF clearance failure is needed to develop effective therapeutics.</p><p id="Par4">Recently, we and others described a common pathology across TBIs and aging that could contribute to meningeal lymphatic decline, namely dural extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. This remodeling is marked by excessive deposition of ECM components&#x02014;particularly type 1 collagen&#x02014;around dural lymphatic networks in aging and TBIs. In peripheral tissues, such fibrosis or ECM remodeling impairs lymphatic function by disrupting parenchymal tissue architecture and increasing ECM rigidity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The ECM is a complex network of structural and bioactive molecules, including collagens, glycoproteins, and proteoglycans. Excessive ECM remodeling can lead to fibrosis, characterized by the accumulation of connective tissue, stromal hardening, and scar formation. Similarly, desmoplasia, refers to the proliferation of fibrous tissue in response to tissue injury such as cancer or infection. These processes involve increased ECM protein deposition, cross-linking, and structural reorganization, which contribute to tissue stiffening and functional impairment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Different collagen subtypes have distinct roles in tissue mechanics and fibrosis. Type I collagen, including Col1a1&#x02014;primarily produced by fibroblasts&#x02014;is the main structural protein in connective tissues, providing tensile strength and contributing to tissue stiffness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In contrast, type III collagen is more flexible, affecting elasticity, while type IV collagen is a major component of basement membranes supporting cellular adhesion and filtration. Col1a1 expression strongly correlates with tissue stiffness, enhancing matrix rigidity and impairing cellular functions and tissue homeostasis in fibrotic and aged tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Other ECM components, such as fibronectin and laminin, also undergo remodeling during fibrosis, influencing cellular adhesion, signaling, and matrix organization.</p><p id="Par5">Here, we demonstrate that age-related ECM remodeling hinders the functionality of meningeal lymphatic vessels and exacerbates waste clearance deficits. We find that the aged dura mater displays collagen reorganization to peri-lymphatic regions, analogous to that seen in the aged skin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Investigating age-related immune changes driving this phenotype, we identify TGF&#x003b2;1 as a key factor in driving collagen deposition from human dural fibroblasts. Using a novel mouse model of dural fibrosis through delivery of a mutated constitutively active TGF&#x003b2; receptor to dural fibroblasts&#x02014;via CSF-delivered adeno-associated viruses (AAVs)&#x02014;we demonstrate that enhanced collagen deposition around the meningeal lymphatics impairs lymphatic function and alters meningeal immune populations. Finally, using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC)-derived lymphatic endothelial cell (LEC) models, we demonstrate that ECM-related elevations in tissue stiffness hinders key lymphatic phenotypes critical to CSF drainage, including disrupting junctional proteins and impairing lymphangiogenesis. Collectively, these data highlight how ECM changes in the dura mater can compromise CSF clearance and suggest the exploration of anti-fibrotic therapies or immunomodulatory strategies as promising interventions to normalize CSF clearance in neurological disorders.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>ECM alterations in the aged dura mater</title><p id="Par6">To identify whether ECM alterations may contribute to CSF clearance deficits, we first sought to better characterize the homeostatic ECM environment of the dura mater. Because collagens, and particularly type 1 collagen, are major regulators of tissue stiffness and fibrosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], we chose to focus on collagen components. Under steady state conditions the dura mater is highly collagenous, providing physical support to the brain parenchyma. Using Fast Green (a collagen-binding dye) on mouse dural whole mounts, collagen fibers were observed in all regions of the dura mater but were particularly enriched around the dural sinuses where the meningeal lymphatics are located [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A). Next, we used Sirius Red staining&#x02014;which enables the visualization of different collagen types under polarized light&#x02014;to reveal an enrichment of type 1 collagen around the dural sinuses (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B). Using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) we observed dense networks of aligned and disorganized collagen fibers surrounding the dural sinus lumen (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>C). Finally, using unlabeled liquid-chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), we observed 36 distinct collagen isoforms in the young mouse dura, 30 of which were conserved in the human dura (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>D), and ECM-related proteins were responsible for 39.1% of all peptides observed in mouse dura homogenates (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>E). <fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p><bold>Collagen alterations in the aged dura.

While an increase in dural sinus-associated collagen type I was previously reported in the dura of aged mice or those suffering a TBI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], the full complexity of ECM alterations during aging remains unclear. To quantify the relative abundance of all dural collagen components, we conducted tandem mass tag (TMT)-labeled LC-MS of dural homogenates from young and aged mice. Dimensionality reduction of these data via Principal Component Analysis (PCA), demonstrated segregation of the overall dural proteome by age (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>F). Collagen peptides demonstrated a heterogeneous response in collagen protein abundance between old (20&#x02013;24 months) and young (2&#x02013;3 months) dural samples (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>G), with 15 being upregulated&#x02014;including Col1a1&#x02014;and 5 displaying a downregulation.</p><p id="Par8">While LC-MS analysis is beneficial for determining holistic changes in ECM quantities, it is less useful for understanding spatial distributions. For example, during aging, the skin dermis shows a loss of collagen abundance, but an elevated expression around lymphatic networks, partially because of elevated immune cell infiltration or retention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. As we previously demonstrated age-related accumulation of immune cells around the dural sinuses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], we hypothesized these may drive collagen accumulation in these regions which would have the greatest impact on CSF drainage. As such, we analyzed collagen distribution around lymphatic networks in the transverse sinus&#x02014;sites where CSF access to the dura is observed&#x02014;in young and aged mice injected with 40&#x000a0;kDa fluorescent ovalbumin (OVA-A594) into the CSF. Analogous to that seen in the aged skin, a redistribution of Col1a1 was observed, displaying increased abundance in peri-lymphatic regions (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>H and I). Elevated expression of <italic>Col1a1</italic> transcripts were also observed in the aged dura mater (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>J). Finally, to determine age-related transcriptional changes in fibrosis pathways within the dura mater that may be responsible for these changes, we performed differential expression analysis of fibrosis-related genes&#x02014;using a curated list from FibroAtlas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]&#x02014;across various cell types in aged versus young mouse dura single cell RNA-sequencing (sc-RNA-seq) datasets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Macrophages and mural cells exhibited the highest number of fibrosis-related differentially expressed genes, indicating significant age-related transcriptional changes in these cell types (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>K).

</p><p id="Par11">Fibrosis is a complex phenomenon consisting of multiple diverging pathways and cellular contributors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. One important contribution comes from the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system, particularly via cytokine secretion. Peri-lymphatic T cell accumulation has been suggested to contribute to the altered collagen abundance in the skin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], and indeed we previously described T cell accumulation in the aged dura, particularly around the dural sinuses. These cells are a source of multiple cytokines which can participate in fibrotic responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In the meninges, all classical Th1, Th2, Th17, and Treg subsets are present [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>D) and as such we queried whether T cell-derived cytokines were an important contributor to age-related dural fibrosis. To achieve this, human dural fibroblasts were treated with cytokine cocktails corresponding to the different secretion patterns of T cell polarized states (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>E) and ECM proteins Col1a1, fibronectin, and total collagen deposition via Sirius Red, was examined (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>F). Interestingly, despite evidence for Th2 and Th17-derived cytokines driving fibrotic responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], only TGF&#x003b2;1 induced significant changes in ECM production (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>G-J). Expansion of Tregs, which are major producers of TGF&#x003b2;1 is observed in the aged meninges [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], though it should be noted numerous other immune and stromal cells can also contribute to this production. In agreement with these findings, reanalyzing age-related transcriptional responses in mouse dural fibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] revealed a significant enrichment of gene ontology pathways relating to biological response to TGF&#x003b2;1 (Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>, E and F). Similar findings were observed previously in TBI models, where ligand-receptor interaction networks predicted TGF&#x003b2;1 as the major driver of TBI-induced fibrosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] and CSF levels of TGF&#x003b2;1 are positively correlated with biological age in human proteomic datasets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. These results suggest that specific cytokine-driven polarization states&#x02014;particularly TGF&#x003b2;1&#x02014;can modulate ECM production from dural fibroblasts, indicating potential mechanistic pathways for dural fibrosis and immune interactions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Modeling dural ECM deposition in mice</title><p id="Par12">To determine whether dural ECM deposition around meningeal lymphatics contributes to age-related CSF clearance deficits, we sought to model this process in mice. Given prior evidence implicating TGF&#x003b2;1 in aging and TBI-related dural fibrosis, we targeted this pathway. However, to distinguish the direct effects of fibrosis from indirect effects of TGF&#x003b2;1 signaling on lymphatics, we opted to not simply overexpress TGF&#x003b2;1, but instead deliver a mutated constitutively active TGF&#x003b2;1 receptor (muT) to dural fibroblasts. This receptor carries three missense mutations: T204D that constitutively activates the TGF&#x003b2;R1 kinase and L193A/P194A which restrict binding of FKBP12, an endogenous TGF&#x003b2;R1 inhibitor, resulting in constitutively activated TGF&#x003b2;R1 signaling in cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. This enabled us to drive downstream signaling independently of the endogenous ligand (Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>, A-C). To validate this model, we first cultured mouse dural fibroblasts and constructed AAVs with serotype 9 carrying either green florescent protein (GFP) or muT under the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter. In vitro analysis confirmed efficient transduction of mouse dural fibroblasts with AAV9-GFP (Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref> D-H). To assess whether this approach enabled transduction of dural fibroblasts in vivo, we delivered the AAV9-GFP or muT into the CSF via an intra-cisterna magna injection (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A). One month following AAV9 delivery, GFP expression was restricted to the CSF access points (CAPs)&#x02014;specific sites that allow CSF to access the dura from the subarachnoid space due to discontinuities in the otherwise impermeable arachnoid barrier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B-C). To determine the specificity of cell transduction, we utilized immunostaining to cell-specific markers, including IL33 for dural fibroblasts, IBA1 for dural macrophages, CD31 (<italic>Pecam1</italic>) for dural endothelial cells, or Lyve1 for dural lymphatics (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>D-F and Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref> I). GFP transduction was observed in dural fibroblasts, but not blood or lymphatic vasculature, specifically confined to dural sinus regions. Flow cytometry further confirmed this pattern, showing GFP expression predominantly in dural fibroblasts, with a smaller number of macrophages also showing transduction (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>G-I and Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>J).

To achieve this, we performed CSF injections of AAV9-GFP or muT and one month later, glymphatic influx into the brain, CSF efflux to the dura mater, and CSF drainage to dCLNs was examined via CSF delivery of OVA-A594 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A). AAV9-muT-mediated transduction was efficient at driving Col1a1 induction in dural fibroblasts after seven days in vitro (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>J), however, the one-month time point in vivo was required to probe the effects of chronic collagen deposition on lymphatic vessels, the dural immune environment, and CSF clearance, more comparable to what would be observed in aging.

TGF&#x003b2;1 has a myriad of pro-fibrotic functions including promoting chemotaxis and proliferation of fibroblasts, differentiation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts, as well as suppressing ECM degradation and promoting ECM deposition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Myofibroblasts, which play a crucial role in ECM production, contribute to the continuous generation of TGF&#x003b2;1, thereby sustaining the fibrotic response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. TGF&#x003b2;1 activation in dural fibroblasts, parallels its well-documented roles in peripheral fibrosis and systemic diseases. These effects are particularly relevant in the context of aging, where we observed significant transcriptional and structural changes in the dura, including signatures of response to TGF&#x003b2;1 in aged dural fibroblasts and collagen reorganization around lymphatic networks&#x02014;mirroring fibrotic patterns seen in peripheral tissues such as the skin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. These parallels further suggest that the mechanisms underlying systemic and CNS fibrosis may share overlapping therapeutic targets.</p><p id="Par25">Using our novel AAV model for dural-specific induction of ECM, we were able to isolate the effects of this from the broader consequences of aging and TBI. This model revealed that ECM deposition alone is sufficient to impair meningeal lymphatic drainage, highlighting its direct impact on CSF clearance and establishing it as a critical factor that not only arises from injury or disease but actively drives pathological processes. While our study primarily focuses on Col1a1 changes, it is important to recognize that TGF&#x003b2;1 signaling regulates multiple downstream pathways that may influence ECM-driven pathology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Given the complexity of ECM remodeling we opted for TGF&#x003b2;R1 activation rather than direct overexpression of a single collagen (e.g., Col1a1). Our approach may reflect the broader ECM changes observed in aging and after injury, as TGF&#x003b2;1 signaling can induce a diverse range of ECM components beyond Col1a1, including other collagen subtypes and fibronectin. We believe our approach provides a more physiologically relevant model for studying ECM accumulation and its impact on CSF clearance. Future studies will be necessary to dissect the specific contributions of individual ECM components and further delineate the potential broader effects of TGF&#x003b2;R1 activation.</p><p id="Par26">Importantly, our findings suggest that therapeutic strategies targeting ECM deposition could have significant utility in alleviating neurological dysfunction. Anti-fibrotic treatments may improve cognitive outcomes in both aging populations and TBI patients by enhancing meningeal lymphatic function, as lymphatic augmentation has already demonstrated benefits in these conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Furthermore, the dura&#x02019;s location outside the blood-brain barrier (BBB) provides a unique advantage for therapeutic targeting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. This accessibility simplifies drug discovery efforts and enhances the feasibility of translating anti-fibrotic therapies into clinical practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>].</p><p id="Par27">Our study focused on a specific region of the dura looking at the dorsal and lateral aspects; however, other sites of CSF drainage, such as lymphatics in the basal regions and the recently described nasopharyngeal lymphatic plexus, likely contribute to the observed clearance deficits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The observed ECM deposition in the muT mice may not be exclusively attributable to fibrotic changes in the dorsal/lateral lymphatics and any changes in lymphatic drainage deficits may represent a cumulative effect across all the targeted sites by the AAVs. Despite the complexity of the various CSF pathways, all routes ultimately converge to the dCLNs, which was assessed to explore functional CSF drainage. Nevertheless, future studies should assess the fibrotic impact across these regions to provide a more comprehensive understanding of CNS-wide clearance mechanisms, though it would be expected that fibroblasts in these regions would be similarly targeted by our CSF-delivered AAV, and therefore fibrosis in these regions likely contributes to our observed effects. In addition to the aforementioned lymphatic routes, other CSF efflux routes exist, for example surrounding perineural sheathes, which could contribute to compensatory CSF clearance upon disruptions of meningeal lymphatics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. Further, recent works demonstrated that other lymphatic routes&#x02014;particularly the nasopharyngeal route&#x02014;can partially compensate for lymphatic outflow during altered physiological states [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. The exact consequences of these altered CSF dynamics remain unclear, but impaired meningeal lymphatic drainage led to elevated CSF outflow resistance and delayed CSF-to-blood efflux despite the recruitment of the nasopharyngeal pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. This suggests that CSF retention of tracers and impaired removal from this compartment occurs when CNS draining meningeal lymphatics are perturbed.</p><p id="Par28">Importantly, our iPSC-derived model also does not differentiate between lymphatics networks that would be affected by fibrosis-related tissue stiffness. While known transcriptional differences exist in lymphatics between tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], no protocols or isolation techniques exist to specifically culture meningeal and/or nasopharyngeal lymphatics&#x02014;especially from humans. Another important consideration is the use of iPSC models compared to primary or immortalized primary LECs lines that are typically cultured from the skin or lymph nodes. We chose an iPSC approach as it provided the scalability, reproducibility, and purity to perform and interpret lymphangiogenesis assays (compared to primary cells) without the potential for unrestricted growth (from immortalized lines) that would limit our interpretations of VEGF-C signaling in lymphangiogenesis assays. These models have the additional benefit of being able to generate the required number of cells for particular experiments on demand, which can alleviate difficulties present in receiving primary cell lines from commercial suppliers, and enable an alternative model for researchers who cannot access human tissue sources.</p><p id="Par29">Our findings underscore the need to further investigate the signaling pathways driving fibrosis in the CNS, particularly in the context of neurodegenerative and trauma-related CNS disorders. While TGF&#x003b2;1 emerges as a central mediator, other pathways likely contribute to dural fibrosis and warrant exploration. For example, the roles of inflammatory cytokines, immune cell infiltration, and mechanical stress on ECM remodeling are areas of growing interest and may uncover novel therapeutic targets. Identifying additional upstream regulators of fibrosis and downstream consequences on meningeal lymphatic function will be crucial for designing targeted interventions that restore CSF clearance and improve neurological outcomes. Such efforts may also reveal broader connections between dural fibrosis and other fibrotic conditions throughout the body, further guiding therapeutic strategies that address systemic drivers of disease. Additionally, exploring potential additive or synergistic effects of targeting ECM remodeling with additional approaches that can enhance age-related lymphatic deficits, including targeting T cell-derived cytokines, or viral mediated overexpression of lymphangiogenic growth factor VEGF-C may further augment CSF clearance.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par30">Our study establishes peri-lymphatic dural collagen deposition as a key pathological feature that significantly impairs meningeal lymphatic function and CSF clearance. By demonstrating that collagen deposition is sufficient to disrupt these essential processes, we highlight its potential role in driving pathological changes associated with aging, TBIs and neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson&#x02019;s and Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease. These findings broaden our understanding of the mechanisms underlying CSF clearance impairment and underscore the importance of investigating fibrosis as a therapeutic target. Importantly, as we highlight collagen accumulation around lymphatic networks as a detrimental factor in CSF drainage this could suggest exploring anti-fibrotic therapies, including targeting immune-derived factors, as possible interventions. In acute settings such as TBIs, these interventions could prevent the onset of fibrosis, while in chronic conditions and aging, they may reverse fibrotic remodeling to restore normal meningeal lymphatic function and improve neurological outcomes. Given the dura&#x02019;s accessibility outside the BBB, targeting fibrosis directly offers a unique advantage, bypassing many of the delivery challenges associated with CNS drug development.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec227"><title>Animals</title><p id="Par31">Male or female wild-type mice (C57BL/6J background) were bred in-house, purchased from the Jackson Laboratory (JAX000664; WT) or provided by the National Institute of Health/National Institute of Aging.

These explants were then transplanted into a 6-well tissue culture plate containing a low volume of Dulbecco&#x02019;s modified Eagle medium (DMEM)/F12, supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin, streptomycin, glutamine (PSG), herein referred to as fibroblast media. The low volume of fibroblast media facilitates the attachment of the tissue explants. The tissue explants were incubated overnight at 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C with a 95% air/5% CO<sub>2</sub> atmosphere. The following day, once the explants had attached to the surface, a small amount of fibroblast media was added to prevent dehydration. The growth rate of human dural fibroblasts is case dependent; however, it typically takes one week for cells to initiate growth and an additional two weeks to reach a confluent monolayer. After reaching 90% confluence, the explants were carefully removed and transferred onto a new 6-well plate. Subsequently, the cells were trypsinized (0.25% trypsin-1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) (EDTA) at 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for approximately 5&#x000a0;min to facilitate detachment and then transferred to a flask to promote cell expansion. Cell cultures were grown in fibroblast media and incubated at 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C, in an atmosphere containing 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Prior to utilization, all solutions were pre-warmed to 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C. Every two days, half of the cell culture media was changed until cells reached 90% confluency. All work was done aseptically in a cell culture biosafety cabinet. To harvest cells for experimental procedures, the fibroblast media was removed and flasks containing cells were washed twice with PBS before trypsinization at 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for 5&#x000a0;min. Subsequently, an equal volume of medium was introduced into the flask and gently mixed to dislodge any remaining adherent cells. The resulting suspension was then transferred to a Falcon tube and centrifuged at 300 x g for 5&#x000a0;min. The cell pellet was re-suspended in fibroblast media. Viable cell quantification was carried out by Trypan Blue exclusion with the aid of a haemocytometer. For a 96-well plate (Nunclon&#x000ae; delta, 0.33 cm<sup>2</sup> per well) cells were seeded at a density of 10,000 cells per well. Cells were incubated overnight to allow attachment before experimental use. To establish a bank of dural fibroblast cells, cell expansion and cryopreservation was conducted by resuspending cell pellets in 90% FBS and 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The resulting cell suspension was aliquoted in vials, each containing 1 mL, at a final concentration of 1&#x000a0;million cells/mL. These vials were slowly cooled to -80&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C using a Mr. Frosty&#x02122; Freezing Container, before being transferred to liquid nitrogen for extended storage. When thawing, a cryovial was rapidly thawed in a 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C water bath. Subsequently, 10 mL of pre-warmed fibroblast media was gently added in a dropwise manner. The cell suspension was transferred to a T75 flask and incubated overnight at 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C to facilitate fibroblast attachment. The following day, a complete media change was carried out to remove non-adherent cells and to provide fresh media, enabling cell expansion and growth before using in future experiments.</p></sec><sec id="Sec240"><title>Mouse dural fibroblast culture</title><p id="Par44">Adult female/male wild-type mice (2&#x02013;3 months old) were euthanized humanely by CO<sub>2</sub> inhalation. Mice were decapitated just posterior to the occipital bone, and the overlying skin and muscle were removed from the skull. Using fine surgical scissors, the skull cap was then carefully removed by clockwise incisions, beginning and ending at the occipital bone. The dural mater of the meninges were isolated by carefully peeling away from the skull cap using fine forceps and washed in fibroblast media. All procedures were performed in cell culture biosafety cabinet. The meninges then underwent a 15-minute digestion at 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C using 1 mL of pre-warmed digestion buffer (DMEM/F12 with 2% FBS, 1&#x000a0;mg/mL collagenase VIII from Sigma Aldrich, and 0.5&#x000a0;mg/mL DNase I from Sigma Aldrich). The digested material was triturated 5 times with a 1 mL pipette then filtered through a 70&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m cell strainer, and the collagenase was neutralized with 1 mL of fibroblast media. The resulting cell suspension was centrifuged at 300 x g for 5&#x000a0;min, and the cell pellet was resuspended and plated into a 6-well plate, with one meninge per well, in fibroblast media. The culture medium was changed every 3&#x02013;4 days, and after 2-2.5 weeks, confluent cultures were observed. For passage or plating, cells were washed with PBS, dissociated using 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA for 5&#x02013;10&#x000a0;min at 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C. The trypsin was neutralized with twice the volume of fibroblast media and centrifuged at 300 x g for 5&#x000a0;min. The cell pellet was then resuspended in fibroblast media and cells were counted using a haemocytometer and Trypan Blue exclusion.

The quantitative analysis of image measurements was conducted with the FIJI package for ImageJ. For the coverage measurements of Col1a1, fibronectin and Sirius red data, positive signals were identified by thresholding of images, and quantified as area of signal/total area of site, resulting in a percentage area measurement. The same parameters were applied for across all groups during imaging and threshold settings, to mitigate experimental bias. The average percentage area for each condition was normalized relative to the average cell count, determined by the number of DAPI positive cells. Given the varied baseline expression of each parameter across individual cases, data was normalized based on the vehicle control within each respective case. Cell scoring analysis was carried out using the MetaXpress in-built cell scoring software (version 6.5.5). Briefly, images from the DAPI channel served as a reference and scoring was conducted in comparison to the corresponding FITC image. The GFP signal&#x02019;s minimum and maximum width were adjusted to exclude any auto-fluorescent debris while ensuring cells were counted individually.
