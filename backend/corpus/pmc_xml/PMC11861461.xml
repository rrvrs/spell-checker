Ensuring efficacy and safety remains paramount in transvenous lead extraction (TLE), given the complex nature of the procedure. The purpose of this study is to assess the outcomes of relatively low-cost mechanical TLE, including mid-term clinical follow-up, and to develop a predictive model for post-TLE survival. This study included all consecutive patients admitted for TLE at two tertiary medical centers between 2016 and 2021. Baseline characteristics, TLE procedure details complications occurring during and/or after the procedure and follow-up outcomes were collected.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par2">During the 5-year period, 100 consecutive patients underwent TLE. The mean age of the subjects was 61&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;3 years. The average time from lead implantation to TLE was 69.34&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;9.36 months, with a total of 216 leads extracted. The most common indication for TLE was infection observed in 87% of subjects with pocket infection seen in the majority (84%). Complete clinical success was achieved in 98% of patients, with major complications occurred in 5% of cases and only one case of peri-procedural death. Proposed experimental model showed that near 50% of the patients will live less than 73.29 months.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par3">TLE demonstrated a high level of safety with low mortality and morbidity rates.

These devices have improved morbidity and mortality in patients with a wide range of cardiovascular diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Evidently this development is accompanied by complications such as local and systemic infections, lead dysfunction and many more which necessitate lead extraction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The most widely accepted indication for lead extraction is infection. Bacteria can colonize all surfaces of CIED, rendering it impossible to eradicate infection solely with antibiotic therapy, so removal of all CIED components is crucial for resolving the infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. TLE, although being superior to surgical methods, is considered a complex procedure that is still under-utilized in many countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Our goal was to report the safety, efficacy and outcomes of TLE in patients referred to two tertiary centers for TLE with mechanical tools from 2016 to 2021 and their follow-up and propose an experimental model for survival in these patients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study population</title><p id="Par13">We conducted a retrospective study of involving all patients who underwent TLE at IKHC and Pars general hospital in Tehran, Iran, between 2016 and March 2021.

Non-infection causes for TLE were lead dysfunction, lead-related complications (e.g., thromboembolic events, superior vena cava syndrome, arrhythmias, perforation and lead&#x02013;lead interaction), abandoned non-functional lead and venous access issues (e.g., stenosis) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Different images of CIED infection: <bold>A</bold>: lead erosion, <bold>B</bold>: generator erosion, <bold>C</bold>: fistulous formation, <bold>D</bold>: wound dehiscence due to recurrent pocket revision, <bold>E</bold>: breast hematoma and necrosis and <bold>F</bold>: lead vegetation removed surgically</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="43044_2025_617_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p id="Par16">All procedures were performed by expert electrophysiologists in catheterization laboratory with cardiac surgery back-up in hospital or on site (Hybrid room). TLE was approached in a stepwise manner: Unscrewing via standard stylets and simple manual traction via the initial entry site was used to extract the leads. If unsuccessful, assisted manual traction with a locking stylet and mechanical dilator sheath (Extor sheath, Biotronik, Berlin, Germany or Cook Medical LLC, Bloomington, IN, USA) and simultaneous traction&#x02013;countertraction was utilized. Under circumstances that mechanical dilator sheaths fail, hand-powered mechanical Evolution RL controlled-rotation dilator sheath (Cook Medical LLC, Bloomington, IN, USA) was used in an attempt to break the fibrous adhesions and help disconnect lead-to-endocardial and lead-to-lead adhesions. If all else failed, a femoral approach was used to retrieve the leads (via conventional snares and Eye snare (Cook Medical LLC, Bloomington, IN, USA)) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>Example of stepwise approach: <bold>A</bold>: TLE in a patient with four leads in heart (right atrium, right ventricle pacing, high voltage and coronary sinus leads). <bold>B</bold>: Right atrium, right ventricle pacing and high-voltage leads could be extracted with locking stylet and hand-powered sheath. <bold>C</bold>: Coronary sinus lead was torn away during traction, countertraction and sheath advancement, so femoral approach using large deflectable sheath (Agilis&#x02122; NxT (Abbott, Chicago, IL, USA)) and Eye snare (Cook Medical LLC, Bloomington, IN, USA).

To date, this is the first report of the multicenter study of safety and efficacy of mechanical TLE in our country. Finally, in this study, we presented an experimental model for the survival time after TLE.</p><p id="Par28">Patients in this study had similar demographics to the previous reports, with mostly male patients and an average age of 61.38 years. Additionally, like the previous studies, HF (67%), ischemia heart disease (50%), chronic kidney disease (31%) (one patient had end-stage renal disease and on regular hemodialysis) and diabetes (31%) were common comorbidities seen in patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Most patients had multiple comorbidities, which as expected increases with age.</p><p id="Par29">Similar to the previous studies, infection, specifically pocket infection, was the most common indication for TLE, although much higher than ELECTRa registry (87% compared to 54%). This finding was also affected by the fact that health insurance companies in our country only reimburse TLE costs indicated due to CIED infection.</p><p id="Par30">The clinical success rate of 98% in the present study was in-line with the previous large studies ranging from 96.7% to 99.4% clinical success [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Earlier studies (PLEXES and LExICon) that incorporate laser TLE reports significant higher success rates especially compared to simple dilator sheaths (94% vs. 64%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], but with emergence of hand-powered bidirectional rotational sheath, this difference was minimized to 1&#x02013;2% (PROMET and RELEASE studies) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par31">In the ELECTRa registry, 41 (1.2%) major complications, and in a comprehensive study by Brunner et al., 54 (1.8%) major complications occurred [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In our study, we had higher major complication rate (5%). We assume that it is due to more complex nature of the procedure. TLE program was started in our country in 2016, before that physician in charge performed several times of pocket revisions by themselves or cardiothoracic surgeons. Meanwhile as previously stated, higher percentage of our patients underwent TLE due to infection and higher rate of complications in TLE procedures among patients with infection were anticipated and observed in the previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Another fact is the delay in referral of the patients to our canters from far away local hospitals, this is as previously addressed is associated with increased in-hospital mortality and major adverse events especially in patients with systemic infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Fortunately, in this study, we had only one intra-procedural death (1%) that was comparable to the previous literature with procedural mortality up to 0.6% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Other probable reason for higher rate of complications in our study is that near 70 percent of procedures included ICD leads that majority were dual-coil ICD leads (including superior vena cava (SVC) coil). Adhesion of SVC coil to endothelium and higher chance of SVC rupture in case of trauma to vessel wall in case of inadvertent force/push is a well-known challenge in TLE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p id="Par32">The average number of leads extracted for each patient were 2.16 which is a bit higher than the ELECTRa study with an average of 1.8 leads [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. This is probably due to the underdeveloped TLE practice in our country, which means most electrophysiologists implanted new leads in the event of lead dysfunction without removing the prior leads. Still, this is current in our country. In our country (like many developing countries), TLE is limited to few centers and actually it is not fully re-imbursed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Therefore, upon referral of the patient for TLE, higher number of leads were removed per patient.</p><p id="Par33">Follow-up of our patients revealed that TLE due to infection was significantly associated with higher long-term mortality, which was compatible with the previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Deckx et al. who investigated mortality after TLE in a single-center retrospective cohort revealed that systemic infection significantly increased 30-day, 1-year and long-term mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Maytin et al. witnessed an increase from 2.1% to 10% in 30-day mortality in patients with CIED systemic infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Gould et al. similarly reported a significantly higher 30-day all-cause mortality and all-cause major complications in patients undergoing TLE in the infective group. Their study also stated that patients with systemic infections were at a higher 30-day mortality risk compared to local infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p id="Par34">In the present study, patients without CIED infection lived more than twice as longer after lead extraction compared to subjects with infection (26.5 vs. 12.2 months P-value&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05). Due to low number of patients, it was not plausible to perform subgroup analysis to evaluate different types of infection (local (lead or generator erosion, pocket abscess) or systemic (bacteremia, lead or valve vegetation)).</p><p id="Par35">We proposed experimental model for long term (more than 10 years) after TLE in both groups of patients with and without infection etiology. This figure is based on Weibull statistical model if similar survival rate remains post-TLE. Patients with CIED infection undergoing TLE already had multiple comorbidities (heart failure, diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease) which already poses them to higher baseline mortality rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. So long-term survival in experimental model is expectable and would be much lower than general population.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par36">This study confirms the safety and appropriateness of using mechanical TLE with limited major and minor complications and acceptable risk&#x02013;benefit ratios. This is also confirmed in the newer studies by an Italian group with good expertise in TLE using mechanical sheaths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Although TLE for CIED-related systemic infection has been demonstrated to be associated with a significantly higher mortality rate.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Limitations</title><p id="Par37">The findings of our study are mainly limited by the two-center design of the study and small sample size. Secondly, due to the observational nature of the study, it was susceptible to unknown bias and confounders. Due to the retrospective design of study, unmeasured significant confounders could not be excluded. The final limitation was the presence of the COVID-19 pandemic, and IKHC being the main center to treat affected patients. This partially hindered the referral of patients for TLE during this time and limited the study population size. Noteworthy that due to small sample size, subgroup analysis could not be performed.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>CIED</term><def><p id="Par4">Cardiac implantable electronic device</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CONS</term><def><p id="Par5">Coagulase-negative staphylococci</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CRP</term><def><p id="Par6">C-reactive protein</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ICD</term><def><p id="Par7">Implantable cardioverter defibrillator</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HF</term><def><p id="Par8">Heart failure</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MRSA</term><def><p id="Par9">Methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PPM</term><def><p id="Par10">Permanent pacemakers</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TLE</term><def><p id="Par11">Transvenous lead extraction</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher's Note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We wish to express our appreciation toward the catheterization laboratory and healthcare personal of IKHC and Pars hospital.
