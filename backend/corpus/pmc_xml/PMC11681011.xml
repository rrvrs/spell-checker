The clinical progression of SARS-CoV-2 infection involves an initial phase with detectable viral RNA (vRNA) and antigen in clinical samples, followed by a convalescent phase marked by the presence of antibodies in both saliva and serum. Therefore, concurrently analyzing these varied biomarkers in clinical samples throughout the disease&#x02019;s course offers more precise insights for disease monitoring and management. This holistic approach would enhance our understanding of infection, infectivity stages, and the host immune response, ultimately aiding in more accurate diagnostic and therapeutic decision-making<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Saliva is a conveniently accessible bio sample that has been explored for diagnostics of COVID-19 and other diseases. Electric Field Induced Released and Measurement (EFIRM) platform is an electrochemical, plate-based, liquid biopsy platform (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) which we have optimized for direct detection of SARS-CoV-2 biomarkers in saliva. This platform can detect multiple viral and host targets without sample processing and yields performance that meets or exceeds current Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) COVID-19 diagnostic tests.</p><p id="Par79">
<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Schema and biorecognition elements of saliva SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA, N antigen, binding antibody, and neutralizing antibody assay.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41598_2024_81019_Fig1_HTML" id="d33e298"/></fig>
</p><p id="Par5">Nasopharyngeal swabbing, followed by reverse transcription of the extracted RNA and quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), is the gold standard for detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, this approach poses various challenges, such as the requirement for skilled medical professionals and a vast supply of protective equipment. Additionally, the method causes discomfort for patients and exposes healthcare staff to a high risk of infection. Saliva as a simpler and less invasive alternative has been used successfully as a diagnostic tool for SARS-CoV-2 and other various viral infections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Notably, one study has demonstrated that the SARS-CoV-2 virus can be detected earlier in saliva samples<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">Loop-mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP) is a rapid, cost-effective, and sensitive RNA detection method that has gained attention during the COVID-19 pandemic. Unlike RT-PCR, LAMP amplifies viral RNA at a constant temperature, eliminating the need for sophisticated thermal cyclers. LAMP assays can be performed in a shorter timeframe and with minimal equipment, making them suitable for point-of-care testing and resource-limited settings. However, the analytical sensitivity of Reverse Transcription Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (RT-LAMP) assay with SARS-CoV-2 RNA is around 50 copies/reaction which is below that of the standard RT-qPCR tests<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Building upon the advantages of LAMP assays in terms of simplicity, rapidity, and suitability for resource-limited settings, we optimized and enhanced the analytical sensitivity of the RT-LAMP assay and developed a highly sensitive and highly specific assay with multiplex and point-of-care potential for SARS-CoV-2 direct detection using self-collected saliva specimen. By addressing this limitation, we aim to bridge the sensitivity gap between RT-LAMP and standard RT-qPCR tests, ultimately enabling the reliable and accurate detection of low viral loads.</p><p id="Par7">COVID-19 antigen assay is a diagnostic test that detects the presence of specific viral proteins in a person&#x02019;s respiratory or nasal secretions. It is a rapid test that can provide results within minutes, making it a useful tool for screening and diagnosing COVID-19 infections. The antigen test uses a swab specimen taken from the nasal passages, and the results are based on the reaction between the antigen in the test kit. One limitation of current COVID-19 antigen assays is that the sensitivity and specificity of the test can vary depending on the quality and timing of the sample collection, the type of swab used, and the viral load in the patient&#x02019;s body. False negatives may occur with asymptomatic or lower viral load infections. As a result, it is suggested that a negative test result should be validated through a more sensitive and specific molecular test such as PCR. Additionally, antigen testing has not been validated for screening asymptomatic individuals. We developed a highly sensitive and specific saliva-based nucleocapsid (N) antigen assay with an improved LOD. The successful development of such an assay would make a significant contribution to the field of diagnostics, providing a non-invasive and efficient method to detect individuals with lower viral loads who might otherwise be overlooked by existing diagnostic approaches.</p><p id="Par8">The detection of specific antibodies following SARS-CoV-2 infection enables various applications such as evaluating the seroprevalence, identifying potential convalescent plasma donors, monitoring herd immunity, generating risk prediction models, and playing a crucial role in global vaccination strategies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Previously, we have introduced the innovative, quantitative, diagnostic EFIRM platform for anti-SARS-CoV-2 Spike IgG that tracked vaccinated patients to assess the kinetics of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies following inoculation. This platform utilizes a unique cyclic electric field to enhance sensitivity and specificity of saliva antibody detection, which overcame the low sensitivities and specificities of multiple serological tests with ELISA and lateral flow methods<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. To push the limit of sensitivity and specificity further, we have expanded the antibody assays to detect IgG, IgM, and IgA to increase the range of time frame of detectable antibodies as IgA appearing slightly earlier than IgG and IgM. Recent findings suggest mucosal IgA to SARS-CoV-2 dominates early neutralizing activities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Mucosal IgA is the major immunoglobulin in saliva, elicited by mucosal epithelial and salivary glands<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Thus, the saliva-based EFIRM anti-RBD assay was developed to detect IgA in addition to IgG and IgM targets.</p><p id="Par9">Among host antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) are particularly significant because they inhibit the binding of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the surface spike (S) protein to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) receptor. The complex formed between the virus S protein and hACE2 is responsible for the virus entry into host cells, and inhibiting the formation of this complex may prevent infection and reduce disease severity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Standard SARS-CoV-2 serology assays, which primarily detect binding antibodies (BAbs) like IgG and total antibody, are unable to distinguish between general binding antibodies and neutralizing antibodies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Therefore, neutralizing antibody (NAb) assays are the only reliable method for assessing the true protective immunity of antibodies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par10">The current gold standard for measuring NAb is the conventional virus neutralization test known as Plaque Reducing Neutralization Test (PRNT), which requires a live pathogen and a biosafety level 3 (BSL3) laboratory. cPass SARS-CoV-2 Neutralization Antibody Detection Kit was developed as a surrogate virus neutralization test that can detect total NAbs in plasma in 1&#x02013;2&#x000a0;h in a BSL2 laboratory without the use of any live virus or cells. The cPass Neutralization Antibody Detection Kit results have shown 95.7% positive percent agreement (PPA) and 97.8% negative percent agreement (NPA) with the gold standard PRNT in clinical study. However, PRNT and cPass assays exclusively detect NAbs in plasma and serum and there is no test for measuring NAbs in saliva. Due to the lower antibody levels in saliva compared to plasma, the measurement of antibodies in saliva necessitates a more sensitive assay<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. We developed the EFIRM NAb assay that can detect NAbs in saliva samples by successfully replicating the virus-host interaction within an EFIRM plate well. The development of a highly sensitive and specific non-invasive saliva based NAb assay would be of great value for large-scale applications, such as predicting the efficacy of vaccines and estimating the requirement for booster doses.</p><p id="Par11">EUA approved molecular tests for SARS-CoV-2 are single plex platforms, conveying a single dimension of SARS-CoV-2 infection in an individual. The high precision and sensitivity of EFIRM platform enabled us to develop a novel, cost-effective, and highly sensitive and specific diagnostic assay with the capability to simultaneously detect 4-dimensions of SARS-CoV-2 including RNA, antigen, BAbs, and NAbs against the virus directly from saliva samples.</p><p id="Par12">The successful development of such assay would make a significant contribution to the field of diagnostics by detecting infected individuals with lower viral loads and assessing individuals&#x02019; immunization status. This versatile platform lays the foundation for tackling potential future pandemics, thanks to its ability to easily develop EFIRM assays for any emerging infectious diseases.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study cohorts</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Pre-pandemic SMC saliva samples</title><p id="Par13">Saliva was collected from patients admitted to Samsung Medical Center in Korea from 2014 to 2018 using the described standard of operation (SOP).

The technology involves immobilizing capture moieties on an electrode structure, enabling the capture of target analytes. Quantification of the target analyte is accomplished through electrochemical measurements of the oxidation-reduction reaction between hydrogen peroxide and a tetramethylbenzidine substrate, along with the involvement of a peroxidase enzyme in a completed assay sandwich. This assay is performed on electrodes packaged in a traditional 96-well microtiter plate format (EZLife Bio, Woodland Hills, CA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>.

The most favorable results were obtained when targeting two genomic regions within the N gene of SARS-CoV-2, namely N2 and NL. These regions were identified to confer highest specificity to SARS-CoV-2 detection. The N2 and NL RT-LAMP targeting sequences are highly conserved among different SARS-CoV-2 variants. An in-silico inclusivity analysis was performed aligning the assay primers to 20,329 SARS-CoV-2 sequences from GISAID&#x02019;s EpiCov database, including all defined variants. Analysis demonstrated only one out of six primers to include one mismatch to each targeted sequence. Among 20K variant sequences, 99.97% and 99.92% of the mismatches are not located in the last 3 nucleotides near the 3&#x02019; end. This analysis suggested that N2 and NL primer designs not only have the capability to detect SARS-CoV-2 but also its variants. While one primer set of N2 or NL alone only reaches 99.18% and 98.81% variant matches, respectively, the dual combination of N2 and NL primer sets achieved 100% match to all of the tested SARS-CoV-2 variant strains. Therefore, this LAMP-based assay has the capability to maintain high level detection even with the continued rise in variants. Furthermore, RT-LAMP of N2 and NL led to amplicons that can be cleaved by two sets of restriction enzymes to yield 60-bp (HaeII and HincII) and 48-bp (Pst I and BcoD I) short DNA fragments that are optimal lengths for EFIRM detection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par21">The virus in saliva samples from patients were inactivated by incubation for 15&#x000a0;min at 92&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C.

The assay has an LOD of 3.5 TCID&#x02085;&#x02080;/mL, which is 7 times more sensitive than the highest performance EUA test at LOD of 22.5 TCID&#x02085;&#x02080;/mL (nasal swab)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. For clinical samples, EFIRM demonstrated 100% specificity and 100% sensitivity when samples were collected within 15 days of symptom onset. In addition, EFIRM is a quantitative assay as other antigen assays are qualitative. The EFIRM antigen test is a non-invasive and easily accessible saliva-based test. It eliminates the need for sample pre-treatment, utilizing the whole saliva sample with 3 &#x000b5;L saliva required for each assay. Since COVID-19 antigen level is very time sensitive, the antigen assay developed here is easy for long time monitoring of the viral load.</p><p id="Par58">Current EUA serology assays only include IgG and IgM analytes. EFIRM BAb assay is the only quantitative SARS-CoV-2 anti-RBD assay in saliva with comparable sensitivity and specificity to existing EUA serology assays that include IgA detection. Our goal was to create a quantitative saliva-based antibody assay with enhanced sensitivity and specificity by combining detection of IgG/M/A and a reference range of 5 sigma greater than the mean to overcome false positives. The anti-RBD antibody test is plate-based and high-throughput that performs with an AUC greater than 0.94. With healthcare workers at high risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and mandatory immunization, this test can serve as an appropriate longitudinal assessment of antibody levels.</p><p id="Par59">Our exclusive electrochemical saliva-based assay for quantifying SARS-CoV-2 functional neutralizing antibodies is multiplexable, quantitative, and non-invasive. It stands as the only testing method capable of accurately assessing neutralizing antibodies in saliva samples. The saliva NAb assay demonstrates sufficient sensitivity and specificity, making it valuable for population-based monitoring and individual monitoring post-vaccination. To explore the potential diagnostic utility of saliva in measuring systemic neutralizing antibodies, we investigated the correlation between NAb levels in saliva and plasma. The findings revealed a significant positive correlation in neutralizing antibody titers, suggesting that saliva could serve as a surrogate measure of systemic immunity to SARS-CoV-2. This study marked the first comparison of neutralizing antibody levels in saliva and plasma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par60">In this paper, the 4 SARS-CoV-2 tests (vRNA, antigen, immunoglobulin and NAb) are separate and independent singleplex tests at this time. Multiplexing would be a desirable translational goal. What this paper demonstrated and supported is that EFIRM can be designed to detect the 4 dimensions of the SARS-CoV-2 from a droplet of saliva and the performance of each SARS-CoV-2 assay is at par or better than EUA approved tests. The clinical impact and utility of deciphering these 4 dimensions of SARS-CoV-2 in any individual, infected or not, is that the 4 tests will provide the real-time personal/host status to the pathogen: infectivity (vRNA), infectiousness (antigen), antibody levels (all IgG, IgM, and IgA isotypes) and neutralizing antibody. Each of these are actionable and would permit each individual, upon knowing the SARS-CoV-2 status, to take the appropriate action item/s against SARS-CoV-2.</p><p id="Par61">One of the primary advantages of this assay is its cost-effectiveness. As indicated in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, the total expense for the assay is $30. Furthermore, if the assay is automated, the cost could be reduced even further. The EFIRM assay has the potential for full automation, as demonstrated in our preliminary study where an EFIRM-COVID-19 automation system was successfully integrated with the TECAN Freedom Evo. Since the EFIRM plate is perfectly aligned with the standard 96-well format, all liquid handling steps are seamlessly managed by the TECAN system, allowing for high-throughput processing of up to 50 plates simultaneously. Given that the EFIRM assay has a turnaround time of approximately 2&#x02013;3&#x000a0;h, this automated system is capable of running several hundred plates daily, significantly enhancing efficiency and scalability. This scale makes it highly suitable for large-volume diagnostic or screening applications.</p><p id="Par62">Previous studies have found that the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and viral RNA, as well as reduced or lacking production of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, are associated with post-acute sequelae of COVID (PASC) and might contribute to its development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. Our non-invasive combo test offers potential for use in future large-scale studies, enabling the longitudinal monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 VRNA, antigens, and antibodies throughout the disease and convalescent phases. This could aid in diagnosing and differentiating PASC from non-PASC phenotypes.</p><p id="Par63">The 4 EFIRM SARS-CoV-2 tests data can be integrated, and AI/ML algorithm/s can be developed for best clinical performance for SARS-CoV-2 detection, treatment monitoring and prognostication. We will aim to develop these algorithms in future studies where the sample size of the cohorts will be significantly larger for proper algorithms development.</p><p id="Par64">This study has a few limitations that should be considered. The main goal of this manuscript is set on the technological development and pilot testing of EFIRM-based multi-parametric detection system without much intention of its evaluation for a clinical decision-making tool at this point. Thus, we have focused on anti-RBD and S protein antibody detection as a proof-of-concept model and haven&#x02019;t incorporated anti-N IgG which could discriminate between infected and most vaccinated patients. However, leveraging on its versatile applicability of our developed platform, the addition of anti-N antibody detection or other targets is highly achievable as the platform is further developed into a system to meet any clinical needs.</p><p id="Par65">Furthermore, since our sample collection occurred during the first wave of COVID-19, our initial development of the combo test targeted the first strain of SARS-CoV-2 (USA-WA1/2020 stain). However, this platform is inherently adaptable to various strains by incorporating probes specific to each variant. Future studies can focus on adapting our EFIRM assays to detect and quantify RNA, antigens, binding antibodies, and neutralizing antibodies for different SARS-CoV-2 variants. Such a comprehensive approach would be instrumental in assessing immune escape, as it allows for a more detailed understanding of how the immune response to one variant might differ from another, particularly in the context of vaccination and natural infection.</p><p id="Par66">Moreover, in the analysis of our study with a small cohort of clinical samples, an AUC of 1 is observed, indicating perfect discrimination between positive and negative cases. While this result demonstrates excellent model performance within this specific dataset, we would like to interpret it with caution. The small sample size may not adequately represent the broader population. Therefore, to ensure the robustness and generalizability of these findings, we are planning to validate the model on larger and more diverse cohorts in the future. This validation will help confirm whether the model&#x02019;s high accuracy is truly reflective of its performance in broader clinical settings.</p><p id="Par67">In this study, the cohorts used in the analysis of saliva NAb assay were from two different countries, serving as the pre-pandemic and vaccinated recovered COVID-19 outpatient and vaccinated infection na&#x000ef;ve patient cohorts. Ideally, it would have been preferable for the cohorts to be from the same country to minimize potential confounding factors.</p></sec><sec id="Sec42" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par68">Our non-invasive combo assay detects SARS-CoV-2 vRNA, antigen, BAb and functional NAb levels from a drop of saliva with performance that equals or surpasses current EUA-approved tests.

Its capability for the rapid development of EFIRM tests for various antigens makes it a valuable tool for early identification and monitoring of emerging infectious diseases.
