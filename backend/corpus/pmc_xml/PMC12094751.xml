</self-uri><abstract><p>Surplus distribution is at the core of cooperative systems. This study examines the impact of the surplus distribution principle on the development of agricultural cooperatives. We utilize panel data on cooperative development and surplus distribution for 30 provinces in China from 2008 to 2021 to identify the development pattern and surplus distribution status of cooperatives. A two-way fixed effects model is used as a benchmark to examine the impact of the surplus distribution principle on the development of cooperatives. The empirical analysis shows that the surplus distribution method, which strictly adheres to a trading return of more than 60% of the distributable surplus, has a significant negative impact on cooperative membership size but a significant positive impact on cooperative income. These results remain robust after controlling for the estimation method, replacing the core explanatory variables, shrinking the tails, and conducting endogeneity tests. This study contributes to a macro-level understanding of the impact of the surplus distribution principle on the performance and scale of cooperatives and provides important policy insights for promoting surplus distribution standardization in farmers&#x02019; cooperatives and guiding members to establish a stable benefit-linkage mechanism within cooperatives.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>Anhui Normal University Talent Cultivation Fund Project</institution>

A cooperative is an association of self-governing farmers who voluntarily unite to meet common social, economic, and cultural needs through collective ownership and democratic control. Globally, cooperatives have contributed to long-term economic growth by providing quality employment to 280 million people and facilitating social governance, technology adoption, and risk management [<xref rid="pone.0323876.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0323876.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Furthermore, cooperatives help reduce transaction costs, mitigate market risks [<xref rid="pone.0323876.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], and promote economies of scale [<xref rid="pone.0323876.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Thus, cooperatives play an increasingly important role in agriculture in developing countries [<xref rid="pone.0323876.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323876.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Compared to developed countries, cooperatives in developing countries tend to be small, with fewer members, lower levels of mechanization and specialization, and are mostly village-based [<xref rid="pone.0323876.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, as a new organizational form to promote agricultural modernization [<xref rid="pone.0323876.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], agricultural cooperatives play an increasingly important role in agriculture in developing countries [<xref rid="pone.0323876.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323876.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. As political, economic, and sociocultural conditions vary among countries, the development trajectories of cooperatives are quite different, and cooperative development models and distribution patterns have shown significant heterogeneity.</p><p>Kumar et al. [<xref rid="pone.0323876.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] modeled the membership of local dairy cooperatives in India to demonstrate that the benefits of cooperatives have a greater impact on small farmers. Montero [<xref rid="pone.0323876.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] showed that cooperatives in EI Salvador are biased toward growing food crops over haciendas. This is because cooperative members have the option to consume some of their staple crops, creating greater incentives to participate. Vietnam&#x02019;s Cooperative Law stipulates that surplus income must be distributed primarily according to the proportion of members&#x02019; use of products and services, as well as the labor members&#x02019; contribution to the job-creating cooperative, with the remainder distributed according to the amount of capital contributed. Furthermore, Vietnam&#x02019;s Law on Cooperatives provides for the division of responsibilities and obligations according to the amount of capital contributed, meaning that members who contribute more have greater obligations. However, Trach [<xref rid="pone.0323876.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] has argued that Vietnamese cooperations distributing surpluses primarily to members who use the products and services is unreasonable and does not guarantee contributor ownership.</p><p>China&#x02019;s first Cooperative Law was enacted in 2007, marking a significant milestone in formalizing cooperative principles. This legislation mandates that cooperatives prioritize farmer membership, voluntary participation, democratic management, and surplus distribution based on transaction volume. The surplus (revenue minus costs) of farmers&#x02019; professional cooperatives differs from the profits of enterprises because the goal of cooperatives is to serve their members and ensure that they receive the best service at the lowest cost rather than to maximize surplus. China&#x02019;s Law on Farmers&#x02019; Specialized Cooperatives stipulates that the current year&#x02019;s surplus is the distributable surplus of farmers&#x02019; specialized cooperatives after compensating for losses and withdrawing the provident funds.</p><p>Agricultural cooperatives have become pivotal to agricultural modernization in China, which is the largest developing country worldwide and has a substantial rural population. By September 2023, the number of agricultural cooperatives in China exceeded 2.22 million, covering nearly half of the country&#x02019;s agricultural households. Despite this impressive growth, Chinese cooperatives face persistent challenges, such as low overall development levels and uneven regional progress [<xref rid="pone.0323876.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323876.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323876.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. These bottlenecks highlight the need for more effective governance mechanisms and strategic policy interventions.</p><p>Surplus distribution is central to the institutional construction of farmers&#x02019; professional cooperatives and crucial for maintaining member relationships and organizational stability [<xref rid="pone.0323876.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Academic discourse on surplus distribution in cooperatives has presented divergent perspectives. Some scholars have argued that strict adherence to standardized distribution principles may hinder performance because cooperatives will struggle to balance standardization with financial outcomes [<xref rid="pone.0323876.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323876.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In contrast, others have posited that governance rules and central policies can enhance accountability [<xref rid="pone.0323876.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0323876.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The lack of a regulated surplus distribution system can undermine cooperative performance, leading to elite capture and the potential dissolution of cooperatives [<xref rid="pone.0323876.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Thus, an elite orientation undermines the longevity and sustainability of cooperatives [<xref rid="pone.0323876.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323876.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>However, empirical research on the relationship between surplus distribution principles and cooperative development remains limited, especially in the context of Chinese agricultural cooperatives. This study aims to narrow these gaps by investigating the impact of the surplus distribution principle stipulated in China&#x02019;s Cooperative Law on agricultural cooperative development. Specifically, we focus on two key dimensions: the size and income of cooperatives. Using panel data from 30 provinces in China over 14 years (2008&#x02013;2021), we employ a two-way fixed effects model to assess the effects of surplus distribution based on transaction returns.</p><p>This study makes three main contributions to the literature. First, we extend the research on new institutional economics by examining the role of surplus distribution in the development of farmers&#x02019; cooperatives, an organizational form that has received limited attention in this context. Second, our empirical analysis provides robust evidence of the effects of surplus distribution on both cooperative size and income, offering new insights into the trade-offs involved in adhering to standardized distribution principles. Third, the findings of this study are of practical significance to policymakers and cooperative leaders in developing countries and provide important policy insights for promoting the standardization of surplus distribution in developing countries and guiding members to establish a stable mechanism for linking interests with cooperatives.</p><p>The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents the theoretical framework and research hypotheses. Section 3 describes the data, model, and variables used in the analysis. Section 4 provides an overview of Chinese cooperatives&#x02019; development trends and surplus distribution practices. Section 5 presents the empirical results. Finally, Section 6 concludes the paper with policy implications and suggestions for future research.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>2 Theoretical analysis and research hypotheses</title><sec id="sec003"><title>2.1 Theoretical analysis</title><p>Coase&#x02019;s &#x0201c;The Nature of the Firm,&#x0201d; published in 1937, is regarded as the founding work of new institutional economics, which has developed four basic theories: transaction cost theory, property rights theory, firm theory, and institutional change theory. Furthermore, the analysis scope has been extended to almost all social science fields. Property rights are the core content and main research object of new institutional economics. New institutional economists generally believe that property rights are the behavioral relationships between people recognized by the existence of things and their use [<xref rid="pone.0323876.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. First, property rights are an exclusive combination of rights including exclusive ownership, exclusive use, income exclusivity, and free transfer. Second, property rights are a set of legal constraints based on a contractual relationship between people as a result of their relationship with things. Third, property law defines people&#x02019;s expected benefits, places strict limits on the boundaries of individual responsibilities and obligations in exchange, and governs people&#x02019;s behavior toward each other. Coase&#x02019;s third theorem states that the system for the supply of property rights is the basis on which people conduct transactions and optimize resource allocation. Through a unique institutional design, property rights can promote economic development, which is the basic pathway through which property rights generate economic benefits.</p><p>Cooperatives are member-owned; therefore, their governance structures and mechanisms may differ from those of other types of investor-owned organizations [<xref rid="pone.0323876.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The type of distribution system adopted by the cooperative is related to the residual control versus residual claim rights of the cooperative [<xref rid="pone.0323876.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The surplus distribution principle is the refraction and embodiment of cooperatives&#x02019; property rights and governance structures and the essential difference between cooperatives and corporations. According to the theory of property rights, the ownership and income rights of cooperatives belong to all members, and this interest is exclusive. From the perspective of new institutional economics, surplus distribution is considered a property right in which all community members enjoy ownership and residual claim rights. The surplus distribution system owned by the members of a cooperative society allocates residual claim rights to each member and provides a property right basis for members to participate in surplus distribution. The practical necessity of surplus distribution also lies in improving member cohesion, protecting the interests of small and weak members, encouraging members to pay attention to the cooperative&#x02019;s sustainable operation, and forming a benefit- and risk-sharing mechanism. In a cooperative property rights system, granting ownership to members may have an incentive effect. However, the distribution of benefits and surpluses among members may also lead to free-rider problems, which can negate the incentive effects of cooperative ownership [<xref rid="pone.0323876.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Regarding the specific distribution method for cooperative surpluses, since the establishment of the Rovindale principle, the secondary rebate has become a classic principle of cooperatives. This means that when members trade their products, in addition to receiving part of the profits (primary concessions), they also receive a share of the final surplus based on transaction volume (amount). The Law of the People&#x02019;s Republic of China on Farmers&#x02019; Cooperatives also stipulates that &#x0201c;the surplus shall be returned mainly in proportion to the volume (amount) of transactions between the members and the farmers&#x02019; cooperative, and the total amount of return shall not be less than 60 percent of the distributable surplus.&#x0201d; This type of distribution method has a deep practical foundation and meaning, and most cooperative surpluses are generated from transactions between members and cooperatives.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>2.2 Research hypotheses</title><sec id="sec005"><title>2.2.1 Impact of the surplus distribution principle on cooperative size.</title><p>In a collective, if the total number of members increases excessively, each member receives less of the common good. As the cooperative continues to expand, an otherwise loose organizational structure reduces the likelihood of direct supervision among members. This lack of supervision makes it difficult for managers to make accurate and timely determinations of whether members consciously fulfil their obligations and comply with the rules. This objectively indulges cooperative members who wish to pursue benefits alone without being willing to pay for them accordingly, thus contributing to the phenomenon of free-riding members, which may result in a collective organizational dilemma [<xref rid="pone.0323876.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>Therefore, when members receive the same benefits as others, despite not paying the same amount to the cooperative, the motivation of those who pay more will decrease, which is inconducive to scale growth [<xref rid="pone.0323876.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Furthermore, compared to large producers, small farmers trade small amounts of agricultural products and generate lower benefits for cooperatives. According to the theory of new institutional economics, the essence of surplus distribution is a type of property right, and all members are the subject of property rights, enjoying the rights of ownership and income. Therefore, when heterogeneity exists among cooperative members, the principle of surplus distribution, which is mainly based on the return on transaction volume (amount), affects the incentives for relatively capital-rich farmers to join cooperatives.</p><p>Furthermore, cooperatives should have a moderate membership size, as excessive scale may affect members&#x02019; commitment to the cooperative. Increasing membership size reduces average costs and improves the bargaining power of cooperatives in trading with other market entities. However, a large member presence may result in excessive organizational costs, leading to collective action dilemmas. Expanding membership size may lead to an oversupply of products and difficulties for cooperatives in marketing their products, thus undermining their overall production efficiency [<xref rid="pone.0323876.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Liang [<xref rid="pone.0323876.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] found that the relationship between size and performance in cooperatives follows an inverted &#x0201c;U&#x0201d; shape, as shown in <bold><xref rid="pone.0323876.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref></bold>.</p><fig position="float" id="pone.0323876.g001"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0323876.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Inverted U-shaped relationship between cooperative size and performance.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0323876.g001" position="float"/></fig><p>A surplus distribution system based on the return of transactions requires a linkage mechanism of &#x0201c;benefit and risk sharing&#x0201d; to be established, thus limiting the number of &#x0201c;free-rider&#x0201d; members to a certain extent and controlling the size of cooperatives within a reasonable range. Therefore, we propose the following:</p><p>Hypothesis 1: The principle of surplus distribution on a trade basis has a dampening effect on the size of cooperatives compared to cooperatives that do not return on a trade basis.</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>2.2.2 Impact of the surplus distribution principle on cooperative income.</title><p>Cooperatives should establish a rational distribution system, as an irrational distribution system often leads to &#x0201c;free-riding&#x0201d; and slack work, which are inconducive to their healthy development. If the surplus distribution of cooperatives considers the residual claims of different types of members, it can help alleviate conflicts of interest within cooperatives and increase the enthusiasm of members with different resource endowments to join cooperatives [<xref rid="pone.0323876.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Patronage, which mainly refers to the volume of transactions between members and the cooperative through which the degree of members&#x02019; contributions can be determined, is crucial in the distribution of surpluses to cooperative members.</p><p>The Coase theorem shows that property rights are the true essence of the market. Clear property rights are necessary to realize optimal resource allocation and promote factor input by playing an incentive role [<xref rid="pone.0323876.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], which in turn has a positive impact on cooperative business performance. The benefit distribution method of returns according to transactions can enhance members&#x02019; patronage and encourage them to use the cooperative more frequently to buy and sell agricultural products. Furthermore, the higher the degree and proportion of their use, the greater the surplus members receive, and the higher the income of the cooperative. Simultaneously, it allows members to have the spirit of &#x0201c;mastery&#x0201d; and improves the performance rate and quality of agricultural products, thereby promoting the cooperative&#x02019;s business performance. Furthermore, the return of surplus according to the transaction volume is conducive to establishing a benefit linkage mechanism of &#x0201c;benefit and risk sharing&#x0201d; between cooperatives and their members, which will focus more on cooperatives&#x02019; operating conditions and strengthen their supervision and management. This will reduce the risk-bearing pressure on cooperative leaders and shares the business risks of the cooperative. Kenkel [<xref rid="pone.0323876.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] has opposed the retention of some members&#x02019; profits as undistributed equity by some agricultural cooperatives, arguing that without the ability to take advantage of tax credits such as DPAD (Domestic Production Activities Deduction), retaining funds as undistributed reserves is the least desirable strategy. Bijman et al. [<xref rid="pone.0323876.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] argued that a proportional distribution of earnings generated by internal members and earnings generated from transactions with non-insiders is conducive to the stable growth of the cooperative. Therefore, we propose the following:</p><p>Hypothesis 2: The principle of surplus distribution on a trade basis has a catalytic effect on the income of cooperatives compared to cooperatives that do not return on a trade basis.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>3 Methodology and data</title><sec id="sec008"><title>3.1 Empirical model</title><p>To empirically test the effect of the surplus distribution principle on cooperative development, we construct the following benchmark regression model:</p><disp-formula id="pone.0323876.e001">

In addition, the gap between the maximum and minimum values of surplus distribution is clear, indicating the existence of various distribution systems among different cooperatives across provinces.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="pone.0323876.t003"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0323876.t003</object-id><label>Table 3</label><caption><title>Descriptive statistics of the sample.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="pone.0323876.t003" id="pone.0323876.t003g" position="float"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Variables</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Obs.</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mean</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Std. dev.</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Min</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Max</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">SIZE</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">420</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">53.230</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">45.500</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7.699</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">339.200</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">INCOME</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">420</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">60.190</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">66.830</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3.110</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">458.700</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">SURPLUS</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">420</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">15.660</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8.429</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.470</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">65.020</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">SALE</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">420</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">31.400</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">26.570</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6.442</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">442.200</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">SUPPLY</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">420</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">22.160</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">20.190</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.033</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">297.200</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">BRAND</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">420</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7.162</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.502</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.705</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">40.950</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">FIRM</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">420</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3.721</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3.404</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.179</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">25.380</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">FINANCE</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">420</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5.882</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6.600</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.142</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">48.690</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">LAND</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">420</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.277</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.023</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.104</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5.031</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">AGRPOP</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">420</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">724.200</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">523.600</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7.600</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1981.000</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">AGRPRO</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">420</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">10.070</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5.359</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.231</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">29.990</td></tr></tbody></table></alternatives></table-wrap></sec></sec></sec><sec id="sec014"><title>4 Analysis of the development of farmers&#x02019; cooperatives</title><p><bold><xref rid="pone.0323876.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref></bold> shows the number and size of cooperatives between 2008 and 2021.

Columns (3) and (4) show the effects of the normalization of surplus distribution on the average income of cooperatives. The regression results are significant and positively correlated, with a regression coefficient of 2.022, indicating that as the percentage of cooperatives that return on trade based on more than 60% of the distributable surplus increases, the average income of cooperatives increases.

However, potential endogeneity issues still require further investigation and primarily stem from two factors. First, reverse causality might lead to estimation bias, in which cooperative membership scale and income growth could conversely drive adjustments in profit distribution policies. Second, unobserved provincial-level heterogeneity (e.g., regional cultural differences) might influence the explanatory and explained variables simultaneously. Thus, this study employs an instrumental variable (IV) approach to mitigate the influence of endogeneity on the estimation results.</p><p>We select the historical surplus from the previous year as the IV. First, the IV satisfies the relevance condition with core explanatory variables. A cooperative&#x02019;s historical surplus level directly influences management decisions on distribution rules, with cooperatives demonstrating strong past surpluses being more likely to maintain high-proportion transaction volume return policies. <xref rid="pone.0323876.t007" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref> shows the significant explanatory power of IV in the first-stage regression (F-statistic&#x02009;=&#x02009;28.98), thus rejecting the weak instrument hypothesis. Second, the IV meets the exclusion restriction. The previous year&#x02019;s surplus primarily affects cooperative development through its impact on current distribution policy selection, with a low likelihood of directly influencing the membership scale or income through alternative mechanisms. Specifically, the economic effects of the historical surplus are absorbed by model-controlled fixed assets and regional and time fixed effects, whereas reputation effects are constrained by short-term fluctuations and captured by brand variables.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="pone.0323876.t007"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0323876.t007</object-id><label>Table

Accordingly, the impact of the principle of surplus distribution on the development of cooperatives is examined using data on cooperatives in 30 provinces and cities in China from 2008 to 2021. Referring to existing studies, the number and average income of members are chosen as measures of the development level of cooperatives, and the proportion of cooperatives that return more than 60% of their distributable surplus on a transaction-by-transaction basis is selected as a measure of the surplus distribution principle. The results show that the surplus distribution method of transaction-by-transaction returns limits membership growth and promotes increases in cooperative income. These empirical results are shown to be robustness.</p><p>Our findings provide three insights into the development of cooperative organizations. First, we provide an evolutionary map of the development of Chinese cooperatives and analyze the trends in and reasons for the development of cooperatives in terms of their number, size, income, and surplus distribution. The results show that agricultural cooperatives in China are characterized by a large number of small cooperatives. The total income of cooperatives has been increasing annually; however, the average income has declined and gradually leveled off. The number of cooperatives trading back more than 60% of their distributable surplus has been increasing, yet the overall proportion remains low. Our findings also provide lessons for cooperative development in other developing and agricultural countries. Second, we use provincial panel data from 30 provinces in China to extend the macro-empirical analysis between the surplus distribution system and cooperative development. Finally, we explain why the strict per-transaction return distribution principle has a significant negative effect on cooperative membership size and a significant positive effect on cooperative income.</p><p>The biggest difference between Chinese farmers&#x02019; cooperatives and those in other developing countries is the heterogeneity in the cooperative membership system. To harmonize the interests of capital and labor, China&#x02019;s Law on Farmers&#x02019; Specialized Cooperatives allows capital to share a portion of the surplus, but not more than 40%, which takes care of capital interests while allowing laborers to hold the majority of the surplus claim. Our findings also provide important insights into the development of agricultural cooperatives in developing countries that are in transition.</p></sec><sec id="sec023"><title>6.2 Policy implications</title><p>Several policy insights can be drawn based on the findings of this study. First, it is necessary to follow the principle of surplus distribution and strengthen its standardization of surplus distribution. In actual management, we recommend strengthening the training of cooperative leaders, explaining the importance of the surplus distribution system of return according to the volume (amount) of transactions for cooperative development, and encouraging cooperatives to return transactions according to the proportion prescribed by the Cooperative Law.</p><p>Second, a property rights system should be built, with producer members as the main body. Regardless of the form of capital, labor, and technology, cooperatives should establish and improve members&#x02019; account management systems in accordance with the law in specific practice; build a set of rights, responsibilities, and benefits for the property rights system to match and reciprocate intrinsic incentives; and protect the economic interests of members.</p><p>Third, it is important to strengthen the linkage of interests between cooperatives and their members and between members and their members to ensure that what members pay for matches what they receive. Cooperatives should guide and encourage their members to establish a model of &#x0201c;shared benefits and risks&#x0201d; and make the return of patronage the main surplus distribution method to reduce the number of &#x0201c;free-riders&#x0201d;.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec024"><title>7 Limitations and future recommendations</title><p>Although this study provides some encouraging conclusions and findings, it also has limitations that offer potential for future research. First, the impact of surplus distribution principles on cooperative development is interesting. However, we only focus on the dimension of surplus distribution and do not include democratic management, education and training, or risk and value perception. For example, as the duration of education and training increases, does the productive capacity and willingness of community members to specialize increase as their professional capital accumulates [<xref rid="pone.0323876.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]? Owing to a lack of data, we cannot currently include these supports in our model. However, more comprehensive data may become available as database construction develops, and further conclusions could then be drawn from examining each cooperative development principle.</p><p>Second, we must explore the impact of surplus distribution principles on cooperative development at the micro level. The data in this study are from panel data of each province; however, a micro-level investigation is lacking. In the future, cooperatives can be categorized in more detail, and general patterns can be analyzed by conducting research on several different types of cooperatives. Furthermore, whether the principle of surplus distribution yields different results for the development of different types of cooperatives can be explored.</p></sec><sec id="sec025" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material id="pone.0323876.s001" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S1 Data</label><caption><title>Experimental measurements and source data for figures in&#x000a0;Impact of the surplus distribution principle on the development of agricultural cooperatives in China.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0323876.s001.xlsx"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0323876.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Channa</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Ricker-Gilbert</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Feleke</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Abdoulaye</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name>. <article-title>Overcoming smallholder farmers&#x02019; post-harvest constraints through harvest loans and storage technology: insights from a randomized controlled trial in Tanzania</article-title>. <source>J Dev Econ</source>. <year>2022</year>;<volume>157</volume>:<fpage>102851</fpage>. <comment>doi: </comment><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/j.jdeveco.2022.102851</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0323876.ref002"><label>2</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Ma</surname><given-names>W</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Renwick</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Yuan</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Ratna</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name>. <article-title>Agricultural cooperative membership and technical efficiency of apple farmers in China: an analysis accounting for selectivity bias</article-title>. <source>Food Policy</source>. <year>2018</year>;<volume>81</volume>:<fpage>122</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>32</lpage>. <comment>doi: </comment><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/j.foodpol.2018.10.009</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0323876.ref003"><label>3</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Sun</surname><given-names>Z</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Ma</surname><given-names>W</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Valentinov</surname><given-names>V</given-names></name>. <article-title>The effect of cooperative membership on agricultural technology adoption in Sichuan, China</article-title>. <source>China Econ Rev</source>. <year>2020</year>;<volume>62</volume>:<fpage>101334</fpage>. <comment>doi: </comment><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/j.chieco.2019.101334</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0323876.ref004"><label>4</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Sokchea</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Culas</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name>. <article-title>Impact of contract farming with farmer organizations on farmers&#x02019; income: a case study of Reasmey Stung Sen agricultural development cooperative in Cambodia</article-title>. <source>Aust Agribusiness Rev</source>. <year>2015</year>;<volume>23</volume>.</mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0323876.ref005"><label>5</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Bachke</surname><given-names>ME</given-names></name>. <article-title>Do farmers&#x02019; organizations enhance the welfare of smallholders?

Why are these findings useful and important? The current style of writing has little impact. Although the author emphasizes the important influence of earnings distribution, we cannot get a preliminary definition from the abstract. Is earnings distribution the surplus of unified operation or the surplus of product profit difference?

The similarities, differences and innovative findings of this paper with previous studies. I suggest the authors develop a new section called "Limitations and Future recommendations".

Based on this, the data of cooperatives from 2008-2021 are used to depict the development pattern and surplus distribution status of cooperatives, and the two-way fixed utility model is used as a benchmark to study the impact of the surplus distribution principle on the development of cooperatives.</p><p>Comments</p><p>1. Introduction and Research Hypothesis:</p><p>According to what I've read in the paper, you wish to assess how surplus affects the "development of farmers' cooperatives." The literature you cited regarding the significance of surplus is very broad and sections 1 and 2.1 provide an overview of it.</p><p>I have some concerns about several aspects.</p><p>2. Methodology and Data</p><p>1) I suggest to better explain the computation of your main independent variables: &#x0201c;surplus" defined as &#x0201c;number of cooperatives with more than 60% of distributable surplus on a transaction basis/total number of cooperatives (%)&#x0201d; - see Table 1.</p><p>2) I also have a concern about the dependent variable since I believe it could be more appropriate considerer other dependent variables in the equation. &#x0201c;Size "(total number of cooperative members/total number of cooperatives (persons)) is obviously a key variable in the analysis but the Number of Cooperatives is included among the different independent variables&#x0201d; sales; delivery; brand; business; finance" as the denominator. Because of this, I don't think that this represents a good indicator.</p><p>3) Revenue (Total income from cooperatives/total number of cooperatives (10,000RMB)) is a proxy of development, but it could be that costs are very high and therefore this affects development and performance and consequently welfare.</p><p>I am not familiar with your dataset and the information it contains, but it might be interesting to add other proxies of cooperatives development, depending on the availability of data, for example:</p><p>&#x02022;Sales Growth rate (you included &#x0201c;the sales rate of agricultural products (sales)&#x0201d; as control)</p><p>&#x02022;Sales/N Members (you included &#x0201c;the sales rate of agricultural products (sales)&#x0201d; as control)</p><p>&#x02022;Profit</p><p>&#x02022;Profit/N Members</p><p>Or -If available:</p><p>&#x02022;Average Value Added</p><p>Of course, considering the lagged independent variables</p><p>4) In addition, given the high correlation between the variables, I suggest adding the correlation matrix in the text.</p><p>3. Econometric approach</p><p>1) My concern is related to Section 5.3 about the endogeneity. As I read &#x0201c;In this paper, the explanatory variables are lagged by one period as instrumental variables, and regression analyses are conducted using two-stage least squares (2SLS) with the reduced-form data&#x0201d;.</p><p>I appreciate your efforts to explain the empirical approach, the IV, and other details, but given the issue that you also highlighted, I believe that in this case, an instrument different from lag variable is required to address the endogeneity.</p><p>4. Additional points</p><p>&#x02022;Comparison -from a descriptive point of view -with other countries.</p><p>&#x02022;Compute a map that illustrates China's agricultural cooperative distribution system.</p><p>&#x02022;Think about how the geographical area or regions differ from one another.</p><p>**********</p><p>6.

</p><p>Dear Editors and Reviewers:</p><p>Thank you for giving us the opportunity to submit a revised manuscript entitled "A Study on the Impact of the Principle of Surplus Distribution on the Development of peasant Cooperatives in China" for publication in PLOS ONE.We appreciate the time and effort that you and the reviewers dedicated to providing feedback on our manuscript and are grateful for the insightful comments on and valuable improvements to our paper. All suggestions made by you and the reviewers have been incorporated into the manuscript. Those changes are marked in red within the manuscript. Please see below a point-by-point response to your and the reviewers' comments and concerns. The authors welcome further constructive comments if any.</p><p>Response to Associate Editor</p><p># Comment 1. Thank you for your contribution to PLOS ONE. After careful consideration, we believe it has merit, but does not currently fully meet PLOS ONE's criteria for publication. We therefore invite you to submit a revised manuscript to address the issues raised during the review process.One of the reviewers suggested only minor changes and was generally satisfied with the paper. However, the second reviewer suggests significant changes and raises a number of questions that you need to address correctly in order to finally consider publishing.</p><p># Response 1. Thank you very much for your time and consideration. While we did not receive your specific comments about the article, we appreciate the reviewers for their valuable input. We have carefully considered their suggestions and made the necessary changes to address their concerns. If you have any other feedback or suggestions, we would appreciate it.</p><p>Response to Reviewer 1</p><p>This paper studies the impact of normalized earnings distribution on the development of cooperatives based on the two-way fixed utility model, aiming to evaluate the validity of the surplus distribution method based on transaction income. The results show that the distribution of surplus strictly according to the distributable surplus of more than 60% has a significant negative impact on the scale of members of cooperatives, but has a significant positive impact on cooperative income. This study helps to understand the impact of the principle of surplus distribution on the performance and scale of farmers' cooperatives from the macro level, and provides important policy implications for promoting the standardized construction of farmers' surplus distribution and guiding members to establish a stable interest linkage mechanism with cooperatives.</p><p>Here are some comments:</p><p># Comment 1. The abstract should answer why your research is necessary? Why are these findings useful and important? The current style of writing has little impact. Although the author emphasizes the important influence of earnings distribution, we cannot get a preliminary definition from the abstract. Is earnings distribution the surplus of unified operation or the surplus of product profit difference? In addition, the summary does not indicate the size of the survey sample.</p><p># Response 1. Thank you very much for this great comment!After modification, we indicate in the abstract that the survey data of this paper comes from &#x0201c;Provincial Panel Data on Cooperative Development and Surplus Distribution in 30 Provinces in China, 2008-2021&#x0201d;&#x0fffd;<!-- &#x0ff08; -->Line 9&#x02013;10&#x0fffd;<!-- &#x0ff09; -->. The analysis of the results shows that, theoretically, the surplus distribution method, which is strictly based on the trading return of more than 60% of the distributable surplus, has a significant negative effect on the membership size of cooperatives, while it has a significant positive effect on the income of cooperatives. In terms of practice&#x0fffd;<!-- &#x0ff08; -->Line 18&#x02013;22&#x0fffd;<!-- &#x0ff09; -->&#x0fffd;<!-- &#x0ff1a; -->&#x0201c;this study helps to understand the impact of surplus distribution principles on the performance and size of farmers' cooperatives at the macro level, and provides important policy insights for promoting the standardization of surplus distribution in farmers' cooperatives and guiding members to establish a stable benefit linkage mechanism with cooperatives&#x0201d;.In the introduction&#x0fffd;<!-- &#x0ff08; -->Line 62&#x02013;68&#x0fffd;<!-- &#x0ff09; -->, we add the definition of distributable surplus from China's Law on Farmers' Specialized Cooperatives.</p><p># Comment 2. This Cooperative surplus distribution problems in India are indeed worthy of study, and could be raised to the level of the developing countries' presentation in the introduction to enhance the generality of the article's conclusions.</p><p># Response 2. Thank you very much for this great comment!In the introduction&#x0fffd;<!-- &#x0ff08; -->Line36&#x02013;38&#x0fffd;<!-- &#x0ff09; -->, we add a comparison of farmers' professional cooperatives in developing and developed countries and provide an overview of the characteristics of farmers' professional cooperatives in developing countries. At the same time, we enriched the article with a description of the development of farmers' specialized cooperatives in developing countries&#x0fffd;<!-- &#x0ff08; -->Line 38&#x02013;43&#x0fffd;<!-- &#x0ff09; -->: &#x0201c;Because of the diverse political, economic, and socio-cultural conditions in each country, the trajectory of cooperative development has been quite different, and the patterns of cooperative development and distribution have shown significant variability&#x0201d;. Following this, we have selected relevant studies of agricultural cooperatives in India, El Salvador, Peru and Viet Nam with regard to the distribution of earnings or surpluses to enhance the generality of the findings of the article&#x0fffd;<!-- &#x0ff08; -->Line 44&#x02013;58&#x0fffd;<!-- &#x0ff09; -->.</p><p># Comment 3. The literature citations are very old&#x0fffd;<!-- &#x0ff0c; -->and some literatures before 2015 do not belong to the important authoritative literatures and should be replaced. may refer&#x0fffd;<!-- &#x0ff1a; --><ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19106255" ext-link-type="uri">https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19106255</ext-link>.<ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10668-022-02744-2" ext-link-type="uri">https://doi.org/10.1007/s10668-022-02744-2</ext-link>.<ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.3390/agriculture12081145" ext-link-type="uri">https://doi.org/10.3390/agriculture12081145</ext-link>.<ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.135068" ext-link-type="uri">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.135068</ext-link>.</p><p># Response 3. Thank you very much for this great comment&#x0fffd;<!-- &#x0ff01; -->In response to your request, we have removed eleven non-authoritative citations and retained only four relatively important pre-2015 citations. At the same time, we have added fifteen post-2015 cited literatures, including four provided by the reviewers, based on adjustments to the content of the article.</p><p># Comment 4. In line 97-106, the author argues that no one has studied the effect of surplus distribution on the scale of cooperation and membership dynamics. Generally speaking, no one's research direction may lack significance. The author should elaborate more on why this topic research is meaningful and what reference suggestions it provides for policy making.</p><p># Response 4. Thank you very much for this valuable Comment! We have added a discussion of the significance of this study&#x0fffd;<!-- &#x0ff08; -->Line 90&#x02013;93&#x0fffd;<!-- &#x0ff09; -->: &#x0201c;This paper aims to narrow these gaps by investigating the impact of the surplus distribution principle, as stipulated in China&#x02019;s Cooperative Law, on the development of agricultural cooperatives. Specifically, we focus on two key dimensions: the size and income of cooperatives.&#x0201d; In the third part of the research contribution, we add the implications of this study for policy making:&#x0fffd;<!-- &#x0ff08; -->Line 104&#x02013;106&#x0fffd;<!-- &#x0ff09; -->: &#x0201c;This study provides important policy insights for promoting the standardization of surplus distribution in developing countries, and for guiding members to establish a stable mechanism for linking interests with cooperatives.&#x0201d;.</p><p># Comment 5. In the theoretical analysis, the author introduced the concept of property rights system, and spent a lot of space from the company to the cooperative society, which is very good. However, when it comes to the cooperative property rights surplus distribution system, there is a lack of corresponding literature support, and the elaboration is less.</p><p># Response 5. Thank you very much for this great comment! First, we add a discourse on the nature of surplus distribution systems and property rights in cooperatives: &#x0201c;The type of distribution system adopted by cooperatives is essentially related to the issue of surplus control and surplus claim rights in cooperatives&#x0201d;&#x0fffd;<!-- &#x0ff08; -->Line 134&#x02013;136&#x0fffd;<!-- &#x0ff09; -->. Secondly, the issue based on cooperative member ownership is added (Line 189&#x02013;193): &#x0201c;In a cooperative property rights system, granting ownership to cooperative members may have beneficial incentive effects, but the distribution of benefits and surpluses among members may also lead to free-rider problems within the firm, which can negate the incentive effects of cooperative ownership.&#x0201d; And we add Kenkel and Bijman's views on the distribution of cooperative surpluses (Line 236&#x02013;242).</p><p># Comment 6. 160 lines of discussion on the size of cooperative members, I suggest that we can draw an optimal size graph, which will be more vivid.</p><p># Response 6. Following the reviewers' comments, we have added a plot of the relationship between cooperative size and performance. This relationship graph is an inverted U-shaped curve (Line 190&#x02013;190).</p><p># Comment 7. The formulation of hypothesis 1 is too cumbersome and should be condensed</p><p># Response 7. Thank you for pointing this out! In accordance with the reviewer's suggestion, we have simplified hypothesis 1 to read (Line 204&#x02013;206): &#x0201c;The principle of surplus distribution on a trade basis will have a dampening effect on the size of cooperatives compared to cooperatives that do not return on a trade basis&#x0201d;. In addition, in order to maintain the balance between hypotheses 1 and 2, we simplified hypothesis 2 to read: &#x0201c;The principle of surplus distribution on a trade basis has a catalytic effect on the income of cooperatives compared to cooperatives that do not return on a trade basis&#x0201d;&#x0fffd;<!-- &#x0ff08; -->Line 244&#x02013;246&#x0fffd;<!-- &#x0ff09; --></p><p># Comment 8. The endogeneity test part can be advanced.</p><p># Response 8. Thank you for your valuable suggestions on our paper, especially your attention to the issue of endogeneity. Based on your feedback, we will further consider using alternative instrumental variables to address the endogeneity problem. Following your suggestion, we will use the cooperative's historical surplus from the previous year as a new instrument to replace the lagged explanatory variable in Section 5.3, in order to effectively resolve the endogeneity issue (Line 410&#x02013;418): &#x0201c;To avoid serious endogeneity problems that could have biased and inconsistent effects on the estimated coefficients, this paper takes measures to deal with endogeneity. In this paper, the historical surplus of the cooperative in the previous year was used as an instrumental variable and regression analysis was conducted using two-stage least squares (2SLS) method using the reduced-form data. The regression results are presented in Table 7 and show that the sign and significance level of the coefficients of the parameter estimates of cooperative size and income are unchanged by strictly trading back more than 60% of the distributable surplus, indicating that the results of the benchmark regression are robust.&#x0201d; We have also updated the results of the endogeneity test, as shown in Table 7 (Line 419).</p><p># Comment 9. The author needs to design and write a &#x0201c;Discussion&#x0201d; section, where the author shows how the work advances the field from its current state of knowledge. The similarities, differences and innovative findings of this paper with previous studies. I suggest the authors develop a new section called "Limitations and Future recommendations". Study limitations are the constraints placed on the ability to generalize from the results, to describe applications further to practice.</p><p># Response 9. We thank the authors for their interest in the concluding section of the paper! At the suggestion of the authors, the title of section VI has been changed from &#x0201c;Conclusions and Policy Implications&#x0201d; to &#x0201c;Discussion and Policy Implications&#x0201d;. Furthermore, we have divided section VI into two parts: &#x0201c;Discussion&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;Policy Implications&#x0201d;. In the second paragraph of the &#x0201c;Discussion&#x0201d; section (Line 436), we show that the results of the study provide three research perspectives on the development of cooperative organizations. In the fourth paragraph of the &#x0201c;Policy Implications&#x0201d; section, we have added a third policy implication (Line 478-479): &#x0201c;Thirdly, it is important to strengthen the linkage of interests between cooperatives and their members, and between members and their members, to ensure that members get what they pay for.&#x0201d;. On this basis, we have added a section 7 entitled &#x0201c;Limitations and Future Recommendations&#x0201d; (Line 491) in order to summarize the limitations of this study and suggest future directions for research and practice. In the second paragraph of this section, we describe one of the directions for future research with a real-world example (Line 478-479): &#x0201c;For example, as the duration of education and training increases, does the productive capacity and willingness of community members to specialize increase as their professional capital accumulation becomes richer?&#x0201d; Second, in the third paragraph, we also suggest some directions for future research (Line 507&#x02013;510): &#x0201c;In the future, the types of cooperatives can be categorized in more detail, and by conducting research on a number of cooperatives of different types, general patterns can be analyzed and whether the principle of surplus distribution has different results for the development of different types of cooperatives can be explored.&#x0201d;.</p><p>Response to Reviewer 2</p><p># Comment 1. Introduction and Research Hypothesis:According to what I've read in the paper, you wish to assess how surplus affects the "development of farmers' cooperatives." The literature you cited regarding the significance of surplus is very broad and sections 1 and 2.1 provide an overview of it.</p><p># Response 1. Thank you very much for your recognition! However, since you did not put forward any specific modification suggestions for this part, it was only partially modified according to the opinions of the first reviewer.</p><p># Comment 2. Methodology and Data</p><p># Comment 2.1. I suggest to better explain the computation of your main independent variables: &#x0201c;surplus" defined as &#x0201c;number of cooperatives with more than 60% of distributable surplus on a transaction basis/total number of cooperatives (%)&#x0201d; - see Table 1.</p><p># Response 2.1. Thank you for your valuable comments, especially regarding the calculation method of the "surplus" variable. We greatly appreciate your attention to this detail. Regarding the calculation method you mentioned for the "surplus" variable, specifically, this variable represents the proportion of cooperatives in which the surplus allocated exceeds 60% of total cooperatives. We first calculate the surplus allocated by each cooperative in each trading period, then identify how many of these cooperatives allocate more than 60% of their surplus. Finally, we divide the number of cooperatives meeting this criterion by the total number of cooperatives to obtain the percentage of this variable. To ensure that readers can clearly understand the calculation process of this variable, we will further clarify this point in the paper and add the corresponding explanation in Table 1 (Line 306). We sincerely thank you again for your careful review of the paper's details and look forward to your further feedback.</p><p># Comment 2.2. I also have a concern about the dependent variable since I believe it could be more appropriate considerer other dependent variables in the equation. "Size" (total number of cooperative members/total number of cooperatives (persons)) is obviously a key variable in the analysis but the Number of Cooperatives is included among the different independent variables&#x0201d; sales; delivery; brand; business; finance" as the denominator. Because of this, I don't think that this represents a good indicator.</p><p># Response 2.2. Thank you for your detailed review of our paper, particularly your valuable comments regarding the choice of the dependent variable. Regarding your concern about the dependent variable "Size" we believe that, within the current research framework, "Size" (the ratio of total cooperative members to the number of cooperatives) is an appropriate key variable. It reflects the scale of cooperatives and serves as a summary of other critical variables when analyzing the overall performance of cooperatives. We understand your concern that "Number of Cooperatives " is already considered in the denominator of an independent variable. However, we still believe that the use of "Cooperative Size" in our model remains justified, as it independently provides informati</p><supplementary-material id="pone.0323876.s003" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>Attachment</label><caption><p>Submitted filename: <named-content content-type="submitted-filename">Response to Reviewers.docx</named-content></p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0323876.s003.docx"/></supplementary-material></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="aggregated-review-documents" id="pone.0323876.r004" specific-use="decision-letter"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0323876.r004</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision Letter 1</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Sorge</surname><given-names>Marco Maria</given-names></name><role>Academic Editor</role></contrib></contrib-group><permissions><copyright-statement>&#x000a9; 2025 Marco Maria Sorge</copyright-statement><copyright-year>2025</copyright-year><copyright-holder>Marco Maria Sorge</copyright-holder><license><ali:license_ref xmlns:ali="http://www.niso.org/schemas/ali/1.0/" specific-use="textmining" content-type="ccbylicense">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</ali:license_ref><license-p>This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution License</ext-link> , which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.</license-p></license></permissions><related-article ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.1371/journal.pone.0323876" id="rel-obj004" related-article-type="reviewed-article"/><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>Submission Version</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></front-stub><body><p>

</p><p>Dear Editors and Reviewers:</p><p>Thank you very much for giving us the opportunity to submit a revised draft of the manuscript entitled "Impact of the surplus distribution principle on the development of agricultural cooperatives in China " (ID: HSSCOMMS-19456R1) for publication in PLOS ONE. We appreciate the time and effort that you and the reviewers dedicated to providing feedback on our manuscript. All suggestions made by you and the reviewers have been incorporated into the manuscript. Please see below a point-by-point response to your and the reviewers' comments and concerns.</p><p>Response to Associate Editor</p><p># Comment 1. I would like you to provide some further discussion about the endogeneity issues involved in the empirical analysis as well as in support of the IV strategy adopted to address those, as suggested by Reviewer #2.</p><p># Response 1.

We would like to thank you for your valuable comments, which have significantly improved the quality of the manuscript. Please let us know if there are any errors in the revision of the manuscript. The authors will revise it as soon as possible.</p><p>Response to Reviewer 2</p><p># Comment 1. Thank you for the opportunity to read the manuscript revised version. I appreciated the authors effort in improve the paper contents and I understand the difficult to obtain additional data. However, I feel greater attention should be given to the issue of endogeneity presented by the author in section 5.3. In particular, I would recommend expanding the discussion on the use of instrumental variable and the exclusion restriction, providing additional details and argument on the reason for employing the aforementioned instrument. Finally, I suggest showing the first stage findings.</p><p># Response 1. Thank you very much for pointing this out. We have expanded the discussion on the use of the instrumental variable and the exclusion restriction as suggested by the reviewer: "We select the historical surplus from the previous year as the IV. First, the IV satisfies the relevance condition with core explanatory variables. A cooperative's historical surplus level directly influences management decisions on distribution rules, with cooperatives demonstrating strong past surpluses being more likely to maintain high-proportion transaction volume return policies. Table 7 shows the significant explanatory power of IV in the first-stage regression (F-statistic = 28.98), thus rejecting the weak instrument hypothesis. Second, the IV meets the exclusion restriction. The previous year's surplus primarily affects cooperative development through its impact on current distribution policy selection, with a low likelihood of directly influencing the membership scale or income through alternative mechanisms. Specifically, the economic effects of the historical surplus are absorbed by model-controlled fixed assets and regional and time fixed effects, whereas reputation effects are constrained by short-term fluctuations and captured by brand variables. The two-stage least squares regression results in Table 7 demonstrate that after controlling for endogeneity, the sign and significance level of the estimated coefficients of the core explanatory variables remain robust. Notably, the absolute coefficient values of the core variables increase compared with the baseline regression, suggesting that the ordinary least squares estimates might suffer from downward bias owing to measurement errors or omitted variables. The IV approach not only confirms the robustness of the baseline conclusions but also reveals that conventional regression may underestimate the actual impact of surplus distribution principles."</p><p>Thank you again for your valuable suggestions to improve the quality of our manuscript. If there any other modifications we could make, we would like very much to modify them and we really appreciate your help.</p><supplementary-material id="pone.0323876.s004" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>Attachment</label><caption><p>Submitted filename: <named-content content-type="submitted-filename">Response_to_Reviewers.docx</named-content></p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0323876.s004.docx"/></supplementary-material></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="editor-report" id="pone.0323876.r006" specific-use="decision-letter"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0323876.r006</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision Letter 2</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Sorge</surname><given-names>Marco Maria</given-names></name><role>Academic Editor</role></contrib></contrib-group><permissions><copyright-statement>&#x000a9; 2025 Marco Maria Sorge</copyright-statement><copyright-year>2025</copyright-year><copyright-holder>Marco Maria Sorge</copyright-holder><license><ali:license_ref xmlns:ali="http://www.niso.org/schemas/ali/1.0/" specific-use="textmining" content-type="ccbylicense">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</ali:license_ref><license-p>This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution License</ext-link> , which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.</license-p></license></permissions><related-article ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.1371/journal.pone.0323876" id="rel-obj006" related-article-type="reviewed-article"/><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>Submission Version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></front-stub><body><p>
