A majority of the immigrants and their descendants in the Nordic countries, live in Sweden [<xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The Nordic countries have shared features in several political areas: one of them is a universal and predominantly publicly financed healthcare [<xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Notably, with globalisation, language barriers have become more prevalent in healthcare settings, and healthcare personnel (HCP) more frequently encounter patients with whom they do not share a common language. Research demonstrates that lack of language skills, in the majority language, is a barrier to healthcare services and contributes to a compromised quality of care [<xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Especially for children, language barriers may impact various areas of the delivery and quality of their care [<xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Children whose parents have limited proficiency in the country's majority language have an increased risk for prolonged hospital stay, medical errors, adverse events [<xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], and reduced access to beneficial care [<xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p id="p0030">Language barriers can be a challenge as they hinder effective communication. HCP are responsible for taking appropriate measures to overcome language barriers in order to provide high-quality care [<xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In the Nordic countries, legislations have been established to ensure that patients, understand healthcare information, with Denmark, Iceland, Finland, and Sweden explicitly requiring interpreters [<xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>]. The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child guarantees children's right to receive and impart information, participate, and influence matters concerning them [<xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Children should be encouraged to ask questions [<xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], and parents must receive information and support to participate in their child's care [<xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. An interpreter may be required to uphold these rights [<xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p id="p0035">When caring for children, the communication with parents is important in creating a trusting relationship and also to facilitate their understanding of their child's care and treatment [<xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>]. The child depends on the parents' ability to understand and comprehend information as well as to communicate the child's needs and wishes [<xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The child's dependence of their parents for communication is even greater in paediatric oncology care, which is a highly specialized field with advanced healthcare information and communication. Accurate information and an honest, clear communication between parents and the HCP are crucial for children's treatment and recovery in paediatric oncology setting. [<xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p id="p0040">Essentially, it is not language barriers per se that creates risks for negative consequences, but rather the substandard way language barriers are managed by HCP and the insufficient use of language support [<xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The interpreter's role is important in delivering appropriate care and in improving communication between HCP and families [<xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>]. Research shows that interpreters are often underused, and it has been suggested that in order to improve patient-safe care, HCP need to use interpreters more often [<xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p id="p0045">Prior research in Sweden and Denmark has indicated that both siblings and the child itself are often used as language brokers when HCP care for families with limited proficiency in the majority language (LPML), resulting in a heavy responsibility for their own care and treatment [<xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. When children are used as language brokers, it not only poses risk to the child's clinical course but also disrupts the family relationship. Furthermore, the child is required to translate matters beyond its age and understanding, along with complicated medical terms [<xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In a report from the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare, it has been highlighted that using children as language brokers, endangers patient safety and legal certainty [<xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. To our knowledge, there have not been any previous Nordic studies on language barriers in the Nordic countries. To improve the care for children whose parents have limited proficiency in a country's majority language, we need to understand how this type of communication operates in a larger context. Therefore, in this study, our objective was to investigate how HCP communicate with families when experiencing language barriers, and the use of interpreters in Nordic paediatric oncology care.</p></sec><sec id="s0010"><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><sec id="s0015"><label>2.1</label><title>Design</title><p id="p0050">A cross sectional, multicentre survey study.</p></sec><sec id="s0020"><label>2.2</label><title>Instrument</title><p id="p0055">The survey consisted of 10 demographic/background questions followed by the Communication over Language Barriers questionnaire (CoLB-q) [<xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. To protect participants' privacy, the number of demographic questions about identifying details were restricted to profession, sex, level of education, length of work experience in paediatrics, and workplace. CoLB-q is a reliable and validated instrument which addresses HCP's experiences regarding communication over language barriers as well as the use of interpreters in paediatric healthcare. The questionnaire consists of 17 questions, 14 closed questions and three open-ended questions. Some of the questions present <italic>Yes</italic> or <italic>No</italic> as response alternatives, while others use a four-point Likert type scale options: <italic>Never, Seldom, Sometimes</italic> and <italic>Often</italic>. One question presents response alternatives <italic>not at all, to a low degree, not so high degree</italic> and <italic>to a high degree</italic>. The CoLB-q was originally developed in Swedish, but has been translated into Finnish, Danish, Icelandic, and Norwegian prior to data collections in those countries.</p></sec><sec id="s0025"><label>2.3</label><title>Setting and participants</title><p id="p0060">Data were collected at all the paediatric oncology centres in Sweden (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;6), Finland (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;5), Denmark (n = 4), Iceland (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;1) and Norway (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;4). Childhood cancer treatment in the Nordic countries is centralized to these centres at public university hospitals, directing and providing the treatment in collaboration with shared care hospitals. All registered nurses (RN), nursing assistants (NA) and medical doctors (MD) who worked in direct patient care, either in inpatient or outpatient units, were invited to participate. However, as there were barely any NAs at the centres apart from Sweden, this group was excluded from analysis. The Swedish NAs experiences have been reported in another study [<xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="s0030"><label>2.4</label><title>Data collection</title><p id="p0065">Data collection was carried out between 2016 and 2022. The study was launched in Sweden in 2016, and the data collection in Finland and Denmark started in 2019, in Iceland in 2021, and in Norway in 2022. Data collection was performed by local study coordinators, such as research nurse, consultant RNs or members of the working group on ethics of the Nordic Society of Paediatric Haematology (NOPHO) and the Nordic Society of Paediatric Oncology Nurses (NOBOS). In Sweden, Iceland, and Finland data were collected by using paper questionnaires distributed by local study coordinators, who also collected the completed ones and returned them to the research group by post. In Denmark and Norway web-based questionnaires were used and the link was sent by the local study coordinators to the HCP's professional email addresses. The research team could not see who had answered the questionnaire, except from the demographic information provided.</p></sec><sec id="s0035"><label>2.5</label><title>Data analysis</title><p id="p0070">All statistical analyses were conducted by using IBM SPSS Statistics, version 29. Descriptive statistical analysis was used and presented as frequencies and percentages. Relations between variables were evaluated using cross tabulations and Pearsons Chi-square test. Fisher-Freeman-Halton tests were run when the expected count was less than five in more than 20&#x000a0;% of the cells. Group comparisons were made by evaluating differences between professions (RNs versus MDs), and between countries. Differences between countries were also evaluated by comparing RNs answers. Due to small number of participating MDs, differences between countries were not evaluated by comparing MDs alone. Regarding the analysis of situations when an interpreter is used, respondents who had answered that they <italic>never</italic> communicated with the help of an interpreter were excluded. <italic>P</italic>-values below 0.05 were considered statistically significant.</p></sec><sec id="s0040"><label>2.6</label><title>Ethical considerations</title><p id="p0075">The process of the study was in accordance with the ethical standards of the Declaration of Helsinki and its amendments [<xref rid="bb0165" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In Iceland, the study was approved by the ethical committee of administrative research [11/2021] at the national university hospital of Iceland. In Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden, no ethical review or approval was required. The regional ethical review board in Stockholm had no ethical objections in its advisory statement (2015/1782&#x02013;31/5). In Finland, research permissions were granted from all five university hospitals. Furthermore, all participants were given written information about the aim of the study, the voluntary nature of participation and that the data would be handled confidentially. In the paper survey, respondents agreed to participate by completing and returning the survey, thereby implying consent. In the online survey, the respondents had to consent before proceeding with the rest of the survey. The questionnaires were anonymous in the sense that they were not provided an identification number connected to the participant. However, since information about sex was collected, for example, the responses from a male nurse could have been tracked. Thus, anonymity was not promised but rather confidentiality. To further ensure confidentiality, participants' answers were combined and presented only on a group level.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s0045"><label>3</label><title>Results</title><p id="p0080">Out of 881 RNs and MDs who were invited to participate, 489 completed the survey (397 RNs and 92 MDs), which corresponds to a 55&#x000a0;% response rate.

The results show that both professions to some extent used family members and children as language brokers, and that in general, interpreters were rarely used for patient education or when preparing children and families for procedures or examinations. However, there were differences between professions and between countries.</p><p id="p0150">In the Nordic countries, nearly all HCP reported <italic>often</italic> or <italic>sometimes</italic> caring for families with LPMLs. This aligns with previous research from Denmark, where 56&#x000a0;% of HCP reported encountering language barriers with families in the paediatric emergency department on a weekly basis [<xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Furthermore, our study shows that RNs in Sweden meet families with LPML more often than RNs in the rest of the Nordic countries. This result is somewhat expected since Sweden has had the largest immigration among the Nordic countries [<xref rid="bb0170" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. These findings confirm that paediatric patients with families with LPML are a common patient group within the Nordic healthcare setting and emphasizes the importance of improved communication when caring for these patients and their families. One could argue that a high concentration of patients with language barriers should lead to comparable legislation and institutional policies across the Nordic region to address these barriers.</p><p id="p0155">Furthermore, education or training in the use of interpreters was overall rare among HCP. A similar finding was reported by Dungu et al. [<xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], who found that only 12&#x000a0;% of HCP had received training in the use of interpreters. The importance of training has been highlighted in previous studies: it allows the evaluation of the interpreter's ability to correctly interpret as well as the optimal use of interpreter services [<xref rid="bb0175" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0180" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0185" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>]. Our results show that education/training in using interpreters was most common among MDs. Prior studies suggest that training and education in using interpreters should be implemented in hospitals for all HCP [<xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="bb0190" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0195" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0200" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>]. Furthermore, a study from Sweden [<xref rid="bb0205" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] showed that none of the participating RNs had received any education in utilizing translation services. The RNs in the Swedish study wished for training in the utilization of interpreters and suggested that such training should be implemented in the work organization or the nursing education [<xref rid="bb0205" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Results from other studies also show that HCP want a better understanding about regulations regarding the utilization of interpreters, as to who decides when an interpreter is needed [<xref rid="bb0190" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="bb0195" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], as well as a higher awareness of the existing interpreter-related guidelines in the healthcare system [<xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="bb0200" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].</p><p id="p0160">Moreover, in our study, MDs and RNs primarily used interpreters on-site, followed by telephone interpreters, and rarely through video. The differences in the methods of communication through an interpreter may not, however, be completely accurate as data was collected at different points in time in the participating countries. For instance, the use of technology for interpretation by HCP may have been affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. Keller et al. [<xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] describe a switch in the health care setting during the Covid-19 pandemic, where, for example, virtual interpretation services increased. Nevertheless, research indicates that the means for interpretation services may not be as important as the fact that a professional interpreter is used [<xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Another finding was that MDs were using interpretation services more frequently than RNs, which also has been reported in previous studies [<xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="bb0200" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. This may be due to that MDs communicate information of a more medical and complex nature, judged to be more important or difficult, and therefore in a greater need of professional interpretation. Although interpretation services were used more frequently by MDs, our study also showed that other communication tools were used by all HCP. Essentially, this finding may indicate that MDs communicate in a more formal setting whereas RNs rely on bedside communication with the families. This suggests a need for solid and reliable communication tools available to RNs when having communication with families with LPML.</p><p id="p0165">Regarding communication without an interpreter, our study found that family members and children were used as language brokers by both professions to some extent. It is confirmed by other studies that children are used as language brokers within the healthcare system [<xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. This becomes problematic as children are not developmentally mature enough to act as language brokers in the healthcare setting and thus potentially risks the dynamics within the family [<xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The use of children as language brokers raises ethical concerns as they may be exposed to distressing information regarding their own or a family member's health and prognosis [<xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. There is also a risk that children might withhold or alter information for the sake of family members or to handle sensitive matters [<xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Furthermore, we would argue that there is a risk of obtaining informed consent that does not meet accepted standards and that parental involvement in decision-making is undermined. This could potentially cause misunderstandings of the risks, benefits and options of participation in research, medical procedures and treatments, which could lead to ethical and legal issues.</p><p id="p0170">The consequences of mistakes or wrong translations can be serious. A professional interpreter is therefore essential to achieve an accurate communication and to reduce the risk of clinically important medical errors [<xref rid="bb0210" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. When further investigating the use of children as language brokers in our study, we found differences between countries. A higher proportion of RNs in Sweden and Finland used children as language brokers more often compared to the RNs in the other Nordic countries. These differences may be explained by different legislations where for example Norway has introduced legislation that obliges government and HCP to use professional interpreters in case of language barriers. Furthermore, it is illegal in Norway to use children as language brokers in contact with authorities [<xref rid="bb0215" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. When comparing RNs with MDs, we also found that it was more common that RNs used children as language brokers. Similar results have been shown in previous research where it was found more common to use professional interpreters to describe a medical treatment, while information regarding nursing care was often communicated via non-professional interpreters instead [<xref rid="bb0200" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].</p><p id="p0175">Another objective of our study was to determine to what extent interpreters were used in different communication situations in healthcare. One finding was that only 27&#x000a0;% of all respondents often used interpreters when informing patients and families about procedures and examinations. In accordance with this, a US study demonstrated a particularly low level of interpreter use in high-risk activities in the paediatric emergency department, such as the administration of medication and procedures [<xref rid="bb0220" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Furthermore, Dungu et al. [<xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] found that HCP experienced difficulties to provide relevant information and instructions to families when a language barrier was present. The low level of interpreter use in our study when informing about procedures or examinations could therefore be considered surprising, as the study was conducted in paediatric oncology care, a highly specialized healthcare setting [<xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>]. If interpreters are rarely used when preparing patients and families for procedures and examinations in this specialized context, one may wonder how often they are used in less specialized or acute care settings. This under use of interpreters is an important aspect as children have a right to information and preparation appropriate to their age and level of development while being in hospital care [<xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="bb0225" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Lack of preparation before an examination or a procedure may result in feelings of stress and distrust and affect the child's sentiments of being seen and involved [<xref rid="bb0230" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. The international collaborative standards to support paediatric patients [<xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] emphasize that when undergoing healthcare procedures, children should be encouraged to communicate freely and to receive sufficient information, which should not be affected by their own or their parents' language proficiency [<xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Therefore, it could be argued that using an interpreter when preparing families and children for procedures is essential to ensure that children's well-being and rights, as well as patient safety, are not overlooked due to a lack of language skills.</p></sec><sec id="s0080"><label>4.2</label><title>Strengths and limitations of the study</title><p id="p0180">The instrument CoLB-q could be considered a strength of the study as it was developed and evaluated in the paediatric healthcare context [<xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The study's international perspective with a relatively large number of participants may also be considered a strength, increasing the applicability of the findings on a more global level. Nonetheless, one limitation could be the uneven distribution of participants across countries: there were fewer participants from the other Nordic countries than Sweden. However, Sweden has more inhabitants compared to the other Nordic countries. The long data collection period is noteworthy, as the Covid-19 pandemic and technological advances have significantly influenced our communication methods, potentially affecting results such as the frequency of technical device usage. One could also argue that a reasonable question to add to the instrument would be in which specific situations children are used as language brokers, and how HCP obtain valid informed consent despite language barriers. To further deepen the understanding and strengthen the interpretation of the results, on-site observations of communication situations and qualitative interviews are needed, focusing on the child's and the parents' perspectives and their participation in the communication situation. Also, more knowledge is needed about obtaining informed consent and assent to research from families with LPML.</p></sec><sec id="s0085"><label>4.3</label><title>Innovation</title><p id="p0185">This study is innovative in its comprehensive approach to understanding the communication challenges faced by healthcare personnel in Nordic paediatric oncology care. By utilizing a cross-sectional multicentre survey, the research captures a wide range of experiences from both RNs and MDs across 20 centres. This broad scope allows for a more nuanced understanding of how language barriers impact care and the varied use of interpreters. The use of the CoLB-q in multiple Nordic languages further enhances the study's relevance and applicability across different linguistic contexts within the Nordic region.</p><p id="p0190">Moreover, the study highlights a critical gap in the training of healthcare personnel regarding the use of interpreters, with only 20&#x000a0;% of participants having received such education. This finding underscores the need for targeted educational interventions to improve communication in paediatric oncology settings. The innovative aspect lies in not only identifying the problem but also in providing a clear direction for future improvements in healthcare communication practices such as education in interpreter mediated communication among healthcare personnel. By comparing the practices of RNs and MDs, the study offers valuable insights into professional differences and commonalities, paving the way for more effective and inclusive communication strategies in paediatric healthcare.</p></sec><sec id="s0090"><label>4.4</label><title>Conclusion</title><p id="p0195">The results of this study indicate that families with LPML are a commonly occurring patient group within Nordic paediatric healthcare. The study also shows that the interpreter is perceived as important for the family's participation in care as well as the relationship between HCP and the family. However, there are regularly occurring situations where an interpreter is not used, which can jeopardize the provision of patient safe care. Still, what may be considered the most important result of this study is that children (i.e. minors under 18) are used as language brokers within healthcare services. Many countries do not have an explicit prohibition against using children as language brokers, however, according to prior studies it is not compatible with the best interest of the child. The healthcare system should therefore be organized so that the occurrence of children being used as language brokers is as minimized as possible. HCP may need more knowledge and understanding about why an interpreter should be used, and a need for clarification of the children's situation when they are used as language brokers.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s0100"><title>CRediT authorship contribution statement</title><p id="p0205"><bold>Melissa Jakobsson:</bold> Writing &#x02013; review &#x00026; editing, Writing &#x02013; original draft, Visualization, Formal analysis. <bold>Helena Ventovaara:</bold> Writing &#x02013; review &#x00026; editing, Writing &#x02013; original draft, Visualization, Supervision, Formal analysis. <bold>Johanna Granhagen Jungner:</bold> Writing &#x02013; review &#x00026; editing, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Data curation, Conceptualization. <bold>Eva Brostr&#x000f6;m:</bold> Writing &#x02013; review &#x00026; editing, Funding acquisition. <bold>Elisabet Tiselius:</bold> Writing &#x02013; review &#x00026; editing, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Data curation, Conceptualization. <bold>Pernilla Pergert:</bold> Writing &#x02013; review &#x00026; editing, Supervision, Resources, Funding acquisition, Data curation, Conceptualization.</p></sec><sec id="s0095"><title>Funding</title><p id="p0200">This work was supported by <funding-source id="gts0005">the M&#x000e4;lardalen Area Research School in Healthcare Science</funding-source> [grant numbers <award-id award-type="grant" rid="gts0005">FUS-2023:0004]</award-id>; and <funding-source id="gts0010"><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="doi">10.13039/501100004047</institution-id><institution>Karolinska Institutet</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source>.
