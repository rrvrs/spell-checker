Anxiety can range from mild to severe and can significantly impact daily functioning. Coping strategies refer to the cognitive and behavioral strategies that individuals use to manage stress and anxiety. These methods can help people adapt to challenging situations, reduce emotional distress, and promote mental well-being [<xref rid="pone.0323904.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. There may be different sub categories of coping methods such as, problem- focused coping; involving directly finding solutions for the problem causing stress, emotional-focused coping; involves tackling emotional distress through methods such as mindfulness and social support, avoidance coping; using methods of avoidance and distraction, adaptive coping; using alternative strategies such as partaking in hobbies to alleviate stress, maladaptive coping; resorting to harmful activities/behaviors such as denial or drug abuse etc [<xref rid="pone.0323904.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>The hospital environment is one of naturally high stress, which contributes to anxiety among patients in hospital settings, due to various factors such as fear of diagnosis, treatment concerns, lack of support etc [<xref rid="pone.0323904.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Studies in the past have highlighted the prevalence of anxiety in the hospital setting. In a study of 102 newly admitted patients in an acute care setting with low back pain, 44.1% and 31.4% were probable and possible anxiety cases, respectively, with a mean anxiety score of 19.46 measured using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) [<xref rid="pone.0323904.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. On a larger scale, a prospective cohort study of 2,064 cardiology patients showed mean anxiety scores of 40.6 at intake, dropping to 19.5 at discharge, indicating how hospital experiences and treatment anticipation affect anxiety levels [<xref rid="pone.0323904.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. These studies collectively demonstrate that anxiety is a common issue in hospital settings, influenced by various health challenges and individual circumstances.</p><p>Anxiety is prevalent among myocardial infarction patients globally affecting their quality of life; in studies, lower socio-economic status has been shown to be associated with higher anxiety levels, and older patients of myocardial infarction suffering from anxiety show greater declines in quality of life, especially in the context of pain, discomfort and anxiety [<xref rid="pone.0323904.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Long term psychological effects include increased distress in patients returning to work after suffering from a myocardial infarction [<xref rid="pone.0323904.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Gender differences have also been demonstrated in the past with female patients showing statistically significant higher level levels of anxiety (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.014) [<xref rid="pone.0323904.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. A meta-analysis of 12 studies confirmed that anxiety worsens prognosis among myocardial infarction patients (R&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.27, p =&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.001) [<xref rid="pone.0323904.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Furthermore, some patients of myocardial infarction had reported death anxiety levels surpassing even that of cancer patients [<xref rid="pone.0323904.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. A cohort study showed that high anxiety scores were associated with a 1.31 times higher mortality rate of ten years [<xref rid="pone.0323904.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Compared to non-myocardial infarction patients, those with the condition face significantly higher risks for anxiety (HR&#x02009;=&#x02009;5.06) and depression (HR&#x02009;=&#x02009;7.23) (where HR&#x02009;=&#x02009;Hazard ratio) [<xref rid="pone.0323904.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. This interplay between anxiety and physical health as demonstrated from the above studies emphasizes the need for integrated mental health support to help improve overall outcome and reduce recurrence of events among myocardial infarction patients.</p><p>Lifestyle factors are influenced by anxiety, as a U.S.-based survey revealed that 34.3% of myocardial infarction patients were physically inactive, with anxiety sensitivity linked to this inactivity [<xref rid="pone.0323904.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. A study on first-time myocardial infarction patients indicated that in-hospital medications and social relationship difficulties significantly correlate with anxiety levels, while self-perception of anxiety is a reliable indicator of actual anxiety [<xref rid="pone.0323904.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The finding of anxiety among hospital patients carries over to Pakistan as well; a study in Pakistan found that 48.7% of 300 cancer patients had elevated anxiety or depression levels according to the Aga Khan University Anxiety and Depression Scale (AKUADS score&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;20) [<xref rid="pone.0323904.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Likewise pertaining to myocardial infarction patients in particular; In a Pakistani study, 27.24% of myocardial infarction patients exhibited depression, which signifies levels of psycho-social derangements that develop among patients of myocardial infarction [<xref rid="pone.0323904.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].These studies collectively demonstrate that anxiety is a common issue in hospital settings, influenced by various health challenges and individual circumstances.</p><p>Given the evidence from above studies regarding anxiety among myocardial infarction patients and its various influencing factors it is reasonable to presume that understanding coping methods to alleviate anxiety is crucial. Studying the relationship/association between coping methods and anxiety and how they influence each other while considering several socio-demographic factors including age, family/social support, socio-economic class, number of myocardial infarctions, and treatment satisfaction can prove to have a potentially vital role in influencing patient&#x02019;s future wellness. Especially considering the unique context of a developing country and challenges that may be associated with a tertiary care setting. Pakistan being a developing country may not be as advanced when it comes to the understanding of mental health and thus it&#x02019;s influence on patient prognosis and betterment [<xref rid="pone.0323904.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Additionally it is worth noting that there is a lack of literature on this topic for this patient population in particular. We aim to understand how different coping strategies affect anxiety in myocardial infarction patients. This can help us understand which strategies improve anxiety and which ones worsen it, ultimately improving both psychological and physiological outcomes. Furthermore, exploring coping and anxiety in myocardial infarction patients can enhance our understanding of the influence psychological well being has on cardiovascular health. In order to understand this influence it is important that we pinpoint effective interventions that address mental health among patients, which is often overlooked in clinical settings, particularly in resource-constrained environments [<xref rid="pone.0323904.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. This suggested influence of mental health on cardiovascular well-being is emphasized by previously mentioned literature that suggests psycho-social aspects not only influence mental well-being but also have a potential contribution to the prognosis of the cardiovascular disease at hand including events ranging from recurrent myocardial infarction all the way to mortality. This study would help conceptualize potential psychotherapeutic programs and interventions which may serve to be useful for the particular patient population according to common themes of anxiety and coping strategies adopted by the individuals concerned. Thus, this investigation is particularly important and worthwhile given the literature and the pressing need for holistic care in the region [<xref rid="pone.0323904.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>A cross sectional study was conducted from July 21<sup>st</sup> 2024 to August 10<sup>th</sup> 2024 in the National Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases (NICVD), Karachi, Pakistan. The study was conducted on 203 patients of myocardial infarction admitted at the tertiary care hospital. The sample size was calculated using Open Epi 3.01 [<xref rid="pone.0323904.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], by considering a total population based on estimated number of myocardial infarction patients that are admitted to the hospital within the time frame of data collection and using a confidence interval of 95%.</p><p>The data was collected by distributing a structured questionnaire. The sampling technique employed was non-probability convenience sampling. The questionnaire, which was originally developed in English, was translated into simple Urdu and then retranslated back into English with subsequent cross checking done in order to ensure its accuracy and validity, the final questionnaire was administered in Urdu, as doing such would ensure maximum comprehension among the selected sample. The questionnaire was divided into three main parts, the first part of the questionnaire mainly consisted of socio-demographic information including age, gender, number of previous myocardial infarctions, perceived family/social support, and hospital satisfaction. The second part consisted of the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM &#x02013; A) [<xref rid="pone.0323904.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] to assess anxiety levels and symptoms among the patients, whereas the third and final part of the questionnaire comprised of the Brief COPE scale [<xref rid="pone.0323904.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0323904.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] which was used to assess the coping strategies employed by the patients. These scales have been used extensively in past studies involving a variety of different patient populations including college students, stroke patients, hypertensive patients, chronic disease patients, cancer patients etc. [<xref rid="pone.0323904.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0323904.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Both HAM-A and brief COPE scales have been validated in Pakistan [<xref rid="pone.0323904.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0323904.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]</p><p>The questionnaire was given to the data collectors (authors of the study who did not currently work at NICVD) who distributed them among the myocardial infarction patients admitted at the hospital. In the light of convenience sampling participants were given the questionnaire upon recruitment without any delays. Written consent was taken from the participants and all ethical considerations and research protocols were observed. Data was collected in the form of pre-tested self-administered questionnaires. In order to standardize the questionnaires and for the purpose of examining content validity a pilot study was conducted among patients in NICVD that were in line with the criteria made for the sample population. These participants were not included in the final sample.</p><p>Data collected was analyzed using SPSS software version 20.0. Independent sample t- test, ANOVA and MANOVA were used to assess the relationship between socio-demographic factors and anxiety scores as well as socio demographic factors and coping strategies employed. Pearson correlation and multiple linear regressions were used to assess the association between anxiety scores and coping strategies employed. Continuous normally distributed data was described using means with standard deviation, whereas categorical data was described using frequencies. A significance level of p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05 was considered. Normality of dependant variables was assessed using visual inspection of histograms, most of which displayed a relatively bell-shaped, symmetrical distribution, with minimal skewness of a few variables which were still largely symmetrical and near to normal distribution. Based on these visual assessments we assumed normality for the dependant variables in the subsequent analysis.</p><p>The study included patients 18 and older who were admitted to the hospital with myocardial infarction, who provided proper informed consent and understood the questionnaire provided to them. Patients under the age of 18 or patients with other cardiac conditions, lack of informed consent or those not able to comprehend the questionnaire due the cognitive impairment or any other reason were excluded from the study. Ethical approval of the study was obtained from the Institutional review board (IRB) at Jinnah Sindh Medical University (JSMU), as well as the departmental review committee (DRC) at National Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases (NICVD).</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec003"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec004"><title>General characteristics of sample population and socio-demographic distribution of brief COPE and HAM-A scores</title><p>Out of 203 sample patients included in the study 134 (66.0%) were male participants while 69 (34.0%) were female participants. Mean age of the sample population was 54 (SD&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;12.50). 32 (15.8%) of the patients were between ages 18&#x02013;40, 114 (56.2%) of the patients were between ages 41&#x02013;60, while 57 (28.1%) of the patients were between the ages of 61&#x02013;85, we divided patients into age categories (18&#x02013;40, 41&#x02013;60, 61&#x02013;85), in an attempt to reflect the typical classifications for young adults, middle-aged adults, and older adults. This enabled us to explore variability in coping style and anxiety across these different life stages, which can be relevant when studying the psychological consequences of myocardial infarction during early and late life stages. We selected the intervals to capture the unique challenges of these age groups. The minimum age of the sample was 18 while the maximum age was 85. 129 (63.5%) of the patients were experiencing their first incident of myocardial infarction whereas 74 (36.5%) of the patients had a prior history of myocardial infarction. Out of the patients with prior history of myocardial infarction 67 (33.0%) of them had 1&#x02013;2 previous events of myocardial infarction whereas 7 (3.4%) of the patients had 3&#x02013;4 previous events of myocardial infarction. No patient in the sample had more than 4 previous myocardial infarction events. In terms of socio-economic distribution of the sample 149 (73.4%) of the population fell into the lower socio-economic class while 49 (24.1%) were in the middle-socio-economic class and 5 (2.5%) were higher socio-economic class, it is important to note that this categorization of socio-economic status was based on household income of the patients with income of less than Rs 50,000 (Rupees PKR) being considered as lower socio-economic status, Rs 50,000&#x02013;100,000 being considered as middle socio-economic status and greater than Rs 100,000 being considered as higher socio-economic status. A majority of the patients (87.4%) claimed that they had a support system (family and friends) and 119 (58.6%) of the patients reported frequent visits from family or friends. A large majority (88.2%) of the sample reported satisfaction with the healthcare that was being provided to them at the hospital. 36% of the sample population reported recreational drug use, this may be due to the diverse population served at NICVD, including low to middle income patients from Karachi and surrounding rural areas, where urban stress and easy access to drugs are common. Furthermore, NICVD has highly subsidized or often times free treatment which also influences the demographic patient population alongside playing a role in decreasing financial stress which may enable patients to prioritize other coping methods such as drug use.</p><p>There was a difference in HAM &#x02013; A scores as well as brief COPE scores among the sample. For instance, males were found to have an average HAM &#x02013; A score of 20.69 (&#x000b1; 8.62) whereas females had an average HAM &#x02013; A score of 23.54 (&#x000b1; 9.11). Female population was found to have higher brief COPE scores in problem and emotional focused coping whereas males had higher scores in avoidance focused coping strategies. The mean HAM &#x02013; A score also seemed to increase with increasing age group with the lowest average of 20.09 (&#x000b1; 7.21) among the 18&#x02013;40 year old age group and the highest average of 22.63 (&#x000b1; 9.80) found among the oldest age group of 61&#x02013;85. Problem focused brief COPE scores decreased with increasing age groups whereas avoidance focused brief COPE scores increased with the increasing age groups, emotional focused brief COPE scores were relatively similar between the age groups of 18&#x02013;40 and 41&#x02013;60 year olds but were slightly higher among the oldest age group of 61&#x02013;85 year olds. Patients who had experienced previous myocardial infarctions had a higher average HAM &#x02013; A score of 23.49 (&#x000b1; 9.91) as compared to those patients who were experiencing their first myocardial infarction who had an average HAM &#x02013; A score of 20.60 (&#x000b1; 8.07). Patients with prior history of myocardial infarction demonstrated lower problem focused brief COPE scores and higher emotional and avoidance focused brief COPE scores compared to patients having their first myocardial infarction. Avoidance focused brief COPE scores also increased with increasing number of prior myocardial infarctions with the highest scores found in patients with 3&#x02013;4 prior myocardial infarction events. The higher socio economic class demonstrated lower HAM &#x02013; A score average than lower and middle income classes and also higher problem and emotional focused brief COPE scores as well as lower avoidance focused brief COPE scores than the other two classes. Patients who were frequently visited by family and friends were found to have a lower HAM &#x02013; A average of 19.98 (&#x000b1; 8.44) compared to those who did not receive visits that had an average of 24.02 (&#x000b1; 8.98). Both groups had similar problem and emotion focused brief COPE scores but the group that did not have visits from family and friends had higher scores for avoidance focused coping. Patients with recreational drug use had a higher average of avoidance focused coping, i.e., 2.05 (&#x000b1; 0.53) compared to patients without recreational drug use whose average score for avoidance focused coping was 1.68 (&#x000b1; 0.36). Patients who reported satisfaction to health care also demonstrated a lower average in HAM &#x02013; A scores, with an average of 21.20 (&#x000b1; 8.87) compared to 25.08 (&#x000b1;8.26) among patients who were reportedly dissatisfied with the healthcare. Patients with health care satisfaction also demonstrated lower scores for problem, emotion as well as avoidance focused coping strategies.

It shows that anxiety is common among myocardial infarction patients. Significant differences in HAM-A scores were found across various socio-demographic groups, including gender, history of myocardial infarction, frequency of visits from family and friends, and satisfaction with healthcare services. This suggests that anxiety levels are influenced by multiple patient factors beyond the heart attack itself.</p><p>The variation in HAM-A scores in our study is aligned with past research using different anxiety assessment tools. Problem-focused brief COPE scores showed a significant difference between men and women, with women scoring slightly higher. This suggests that female patients tend to take action-based coping steps like problem-solving and planning. Similarly results were found for the patients from higher-income backgrounds had higher problem-focused coping scores, meaning they were more likely to use problem-solving strategies. However, the smaller sample size for this group may have affected the results. This distribution is expected, since this study was conducted in a tertiary care hospital in Pakistan, a low resource and low income country.</p><p>Avoidant-focused coping was affected by socioeconomic status, with higher-income patients showing the lowest scores. This suggests that patients with good socioeconomic status avoid escape, while middle-income patients, who had the highest avoidant-focused coping scores, may be more prone to such behaviors. Also, patients whose family and friends pays visits to the patient were less likely to use avoidance as a coping mechanism this makes sense, as family and friends provide emotional support and will power, making patients feel stronger and reducing avoidance behaviors. Patients who use drugs are more likely to use avoidant coping, which is expected since substance use is often a way to escape reality.</p><p>Healthcare satisfaction also affected coping strategies. Patients satisfied with their care were less likely to use avoidant-focused coping than those dissatisfied. From this we may assume that a good healthcare experience encourages patients to engage in treatment and use problem-focused coping. On the other hand according to the results, dissatisfaction with healthcare can possibly lead to frustration, helplessness, or distrust, increasing avoidant coping. Patients can have a proactive mindset if he has a feeling of support and value, while dissatisfaction can push people toward avoidance. Patients satisfied with their healthcare were also less likely to use emotion-focused coping, possibly because trust in healthcare helps reduce emotional distress.</p><p>There were weak positive links between all three coping strategies and total HAM-A scores, showing a minor but present connection between coping methods and anxiety levels. Higher HAM-A scores were linked to coping strategies like positive reframing, venting, religion, denial, and behavioral disengagement. In contrast, patients who accepted their condition had lower HAM-A scores.</p><p>Studies have shown differences in how anxiety and coping methods affect myocardial infarction patients. Cognitive and Dialectical Behavioral Therapy has helped shift patients from emotional to problem-focused coping, improving stress management and health outcomes [<xref rid="pone.0323904.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Older patients rely more on spiritual coping, while men generally have lower social and spiritual support. Also, those patients who have more chronic myocardial infarction receive less social support. Anxiety and depression negatively affect coping, highlighting the need for mental health support in rehabilitation [<xref rid="pone.0323904.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Regarding disease outcomes, studies have shown that emotion-focused coping strategies improve left ventricular ejection fraction, suggesting that strengthening these coping strategies can help patients recover after a heart attack [<xref rid="pone.0323904.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Positive coping methods like planning and seeking emotional support build resilience, while negative ones like denial and venting slow recovery [<xref rid="pone.0323904.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The link between coping strategies, anxiety, and depression highlights the need to include coping assessments in clinical practice to support better mental and physical recovery [<xref rid="pone.0323904.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Research also suggests that optimistic coping strategies work best for myocardial infarction patients, while emotional and palliative strategies are used less and are less effective. This highlights the need for personalized, culturally sensitive patient care, promoting positive coping while addressing barriers to better strategies [<xref rid="pone.0323904.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Certain patterns of behavior from our findings were also common with past studies such as higher problem focused coping among individuals with higher incomes [<xref rid="pone.0323904.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], decreased use of avoidant coping among patients having frequent family visits [<xref rid="pone.0323904.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], as well as increased avoidant coping behaviors among individuals with history of drug use [<xref rid="pone.0323904.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. In the past good healthcare has also shown to increase problem-focused coping tendencies [<xref rid="pone.0323904.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], while a poor healthcare satisfaction has been shown to have an association with avoidance related behaviors [<xref rid="pone.0323904.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323904.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The expression of acceptance has also been shown to be associated with decreased anxiety [<xref rid="pone.0323904.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].</p><p>This study provides a comprehensive analysis in regards to the relationship between anxiety and coping methods among myocardial infarction patients, while providing novelty in regards to investigating this relationship in a resource-limited setting especially Pakistan. With the use of a wide array of statistical methods we have been able to help understand how socio-demographic factors like gender, socio-economic status, social support, drug abuse, hospital satisfaction, and past history of myocardial infarction may influence both anxiety and coping methods among the patients. Additionally the large sample size of 203 helps increase the reliability of the study making it more applicable to a broader population with similar socio-economic standing. The collective literature mentioned in this study along with the study&#x02019;s own findings also help to emphasize the significance of anxiety in myocardial infarction patients, as well as the impact of coping strategies on their psychological health, which highlights the need for personalized interventions in caring for such patients.</p><p>It is also important to acknowledge the limitations of this study. Firstly, the R<sup>2</sup> values observed in the regression models are relatively low at 9%, 16% and 13.6% for models one, two and three respectively. Although this doesn&#x02019;t reflect a poor or ineffective model, it is important to consider that such results suggest that the model only accounts for a small proportion of the variance in anxiety levels (i.e., HAM-A scores). This could mean that certain factors such as pre-existing mental health problems, medication use, personal affairs, and other socio-demographic variables which were not included in the models, could possibly account for the remaining unexplored variance in HAM-A scores. Additionally the cross-sectional design of the study limits the ability to establish causality between coping strategies and anxiety, as it does not capture the changes over time. It is also worthwhile to consider that since the data is self-reported by patients, the possibility of response bias exists which may affect the accuracy of some of the responses. Since the study is conducted on a relatively distinct population, i.e., patients of a tertiary care hospital in a developing country, with majority patients being of lower-socioeconomic background seeking inexpensive care we should acknowledge the fact that such results may not be as applicable in more affluent settings, or in healthcare systems with different economic and cultural contexts.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec012"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, this study details the significant prevalence of anxiety among myocardial infarction patients and highlights the associated factors relating to anxiety and coping strategies implemented. The findings of this study can be used as a guideline in future research to help patients in improving their psychological well-being. The findings indicate that tailored interventions addressing individual differences, such as gender, history of myocardial infarction, and social support, are essential for effectively managing anxiety. By fostering adaptive coping mechanisms, particularly acceptance and problem-focused strategies, healthcare providers can enhance patients&#x02019; resilience and improve overall recovery outcomes. This research emphasizes the need for integrated psychological support in cardiac care, ultimately aiming to optimize mental health for myocardial infarction patients.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to acknowledge the patients of the hospital who&#x02019;s cooperation made this study possible as well as the National Institute of Cardiovascular Disease for hosting this study.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0323904.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><collab>Association AP</collab>. <source>Anxiety disorders: DSM-5&#x000ae; selections</source>. <publisher-name>American Psychiatric Pub</publisher-name>. <year>2015</year>.</mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0323904.ref002"><label>2</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><name><surname>Stephenson</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name>, <name><surname>DeLongis</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name>. <source>Coping Strategies.

I wonder whether the assumptions are met with the statistical tests performed. Authors need to indicate how statistical test assumptions are met.</p><p>Need to mention whether the anxiety assessment tools are validated for the study setting (or the country).</p><p>Need to mention about the study limitations.</p><p>Reviewer #2:&#x000a0;Thank you for submitting a research manuscript on a highly relevant topic: patients with myocardial infarctions, their anxiety, and coping skills. However, there are significant revisions needed to enhance the quality of the manuscript. These revisions are outlined below.</p><p>It is important to note that commenting on this manuscript is challenging due to the absence of line numbers and the line spacing not adhering to PLOS One manuscript guidelines.</p><p>Major revisions</p><p>1.Introduction :</p><p>The authors should pay closer attention to properly citing the literature used throughout the manuscript as not citing sources properly is considered plagiarism. E.g.</p><p>&#x02022; In the first paragraph - The first sentence (the source for the definition of anxiety) needs a citation</p><p>&#x02022; The second and fourth sentences also need to be cited</p><p>&#x02022; In the second para &#x02013; The first sentence needs a citation</p><p>&#x02022; In the third para &#x02013; the second and third statements are these from the same article as [5]?</p><p>&#x02022; In the 6th para (before methods) etc.</p><p>In the presentation of the literature, it would be most effective to structure it in a manner that describes international evidence, followed by regional evidence, and then concluding with local evidence. This organization will enhance clarity and understanding.</p><p>2.Materials and Methods:</p><p>Second para &#x02013; second sentence &#x02013; So, was the final questionnaire administered in English or Urdu?</p><p>Has the HAM tool or the COPE scale previously been validated in Pakistan? If not, the authors should at least describe the cultural adaptation process of the tools.</p><p>Third para- the last sentence is not clear- Is it the same participants or the same sample population? Using the same participants to pre-test the questionnaire will invariably introduce bias.</p><p>Who were the data collectors? Health staff? Using healthcare workers to conduct data collection, especially when it involves questions about the satisfaction of services, does not seem ideal as it will induce bias.</p><p>The authors have used non-probability convenient sampling to capture the sample size of 203 individuals. However, the whole analysis depended on the assumption that the data is normally distributed. It is important to note that data from non-probability samples may not fit the assumptions of parametric tests such as the t-test. Looking at the data, gives an impression that the data is skewed. As the author guidelines state that the &#x0201c;authors must describe any analysis carried out to confirm the data meets the assumptions of the analysis performed (e.g. linearity, co-linearity, normality of the distribution)&#x0201d; suggests to include how the authors assumed that the data was normally distributed.</p><p>3. Results:</p><p>It would be better if the authors could explain the basis of categorizing the age into three categories 18-40, 41-60 and 61-85. The usual practice is to divide into age groups with equal intervals.</p><p>The participants were divided into lower, middle and higher socio-economic status. It would be beneficial for non-local readers of the manuscript to understand what these categories represent. Is it based on income? Assets or Education levels?</p><p>Tables: In column headings, first column, better to keep only the frequency and percentage and the Mean and SD have already been described in the text. No need for repetition.</p><p>Discussion</p><p>It's always better to summarise the findings of your research first and then compare it with available research evidence.</p><p>On all three regression models, the R2 values are very low 9%-16%. Even though it doesn't mean that your model is bad or worthless it&#x02019;s worth discussing what it means (E.g. Maybe your model does not include all variables that are associated with the outcome)</p><p>The authors have focused on analysed data in the discussion section. However, the limitations and advantages of the study also needs to be included.</p><p>4. Conclusion</p><p>The last sentence &#x02013; mentions optimizing physical health, while nowhere in the article physical health has been discussed. Please revisit.</p><p>Minor</p><p>In the 5th para &#x02013; The second sentence is quite long, making it difficult to follow. Could you clarify what you mean? It would be helpful if you could break it down into several shorter sentences.</p><p>Under the results, in the title please correct brief COPE and HAM-A scores</p><p>The terms anxiety and coping scores and HAM-A and Brief COPE scores are used interchangeably throughout the manuscript. Suggest to use a uniform format.</p><p>Recreation drug users in the sample are quite high (36%). Is it a normal finding in the hospital set-up or a unique finding? Worthwhile to explain this to the international audience of this manuscript.</p><p>Tables need to be self-explanatory. Therefore, the symbols, short forms need to be described as a footnote</p><p>**********</p><p>6.

Introduction:</p><p>- We have added references to all mentioned instances as well as where we found were necessary and missing in the original document</p><p>- We have made an effort to acknowledge the sequencing in the paragraph and have structured in a way that shifts from broader to more local research, i.e. international, to any one specific country to Pakistan (country of study)</p><p>2. Materials and Methods:</p><p>- The final questionnaire was administered in Urdu, and we have now made this clear in the text as well as the reason why.</p><p>- The tools have been validated in Pakistan, appropriate references have been added.</p><p>- It is not the same population, the pre-test population was not included in the final sample, and this has been made clear now in the manuscript.</p><p>- The data collectors were authors not working at NICVD, not part of the health staff there. This point has been made clear now in the manuscript.</p><p>- Reason for assumption of normal distribution has now been elaborated in the manuscript.</p><p>3. Results:</p><p>- Ages were categorized to better reflect different stages of adult life, this has been further elaborated and explained now in the manuscript.</p><p>- The participants were divided based on income, explanation along with cut off values for different classes has been mentioned in the manuscript now.</p><p>- The tables have been heavily revised now, both to reduce redundancy and also to generally look neater and easier to interpret/read.</p><p>Discussion</p><p>- We have re-arranged the discussion in a way which elaborates our own findings before discussion on other literature&#x0003c;</p><p>- We have added discussion on the regression models.</p><p>- Limitations and advantages of the study have now been elaborated on.</p><p>4.

Along with this it mentions how such info is potentially important for the prognosis of these patients. We realize mentioning the institution led to unnecessary confusion in the sentence and has subsequently been removed.</p><p>MATERIAL AND METHODS</p><p>Thank you for your comments, your commitment to the betterment of the article is much appreciated!</p><p>- The word in question has been removed to avoid confusion.</p><p>- The sentence in question has been updated accordingly.</p><p>- Inclusion criteria is mentioned in line 208.</p><p>- Clarity has been provided. The pilot was conducted among patients in the same institute however these patients were NOT included in the final sample.</p><p>RESULTS</p><p>Thank you for your comments, your commitment to the betterment of the article is much appreciated!</p><p>- Currency has now been mentioned before the number.</p><p>- We understand your recommendations. Although we have now adapted the 2nd table to have two decimal points. We feel the 3 decimal points (in 4th, 5th tables etc.) should remain the same, as changing this would have an effect on the accuracy of the results. There are several 3 decimal numbers in which the 2nd decimal point is &#x0201c;0&#x0201d; altering this into 2 decimals could make the results look widely different especially for variables such as p value. We also feel if we selectively alter the ones that don&#x02019;t have 0 in their second decimal point it would appear untidy.</p><p>- Cell has now been aligned accordingly.</p><p>REFERENCES</p><p>Thank you for your comments, your commitment to the betterment of the article is much appreciated!</p><p>- DOI has been added where available.
