Recently, FLNC has also been identified as a causative gene in the autosomal dominant form of various cardiomyopathies such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), restrictive cardiomyopathy, arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy, and non-compaction left ventricle cardiomyopathy [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The prevalence of pathogenic variants of FLNC ranges from 1% to 8% in the cardiomyopathy subtype.</p><p>Filamin C is widely expressed in cardiomyocytes and is involved in signal transduction, connecting the sarcomere and the plasma membrane [<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Its structure consists of an actin-binding domain at the N-terminus and a dimerization domain that forms a dimer at the C-terminus.</p><p>According to ClinVar, 378 pathogenic and 147 likely pathogenic variants have been identified. Among them, the variants contributing to phenotypes including cardiac disease are 328 pathogenic and 124 likely pathogenic ones. FLNC truncating variants (FLNCtv) were reported to be mainly identified in DCM, although missense or in-frame indel variants were found in other phenotypes [<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. So far, although two variants were reported to be causative for DCM and conduction defect, these cases were ones in which the main phenotype was DCM.</p><p>Here, we report our experience with an FLNC-related cardiomyopathy case who had predominantly advanced conduction defects as the main symptom.</p></sec><sec sec-type="cases"><title>Case presentation</title><p>A 70-year-old female was referred to our hospital with an advanced heart block. For several years, she had often noticed palpitations and irregular heartbeats when she trained at the gym. When she visited a hospital, she occasionally felt lightheaded, and her physician noted bradycardia and diagnosed her with a 2:1 advanced atrioventricular block on an electrocardiogram. She was transferred to our hospital (Figure <xref rid="FIG1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).</p><fig position="anchor" fig-type="figure" id="FIG1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Electrocardiogram of the case</title><p>The upper figure is a 2:1 atrioventricular block pointed out on our hospital admission.

The patient's father had a pacemaker implanted, and her sister had a heart disease, but the details are unknown (Figure <xref rid="FIG2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).</p><fig position="anchor" fig-type="figure" id="FIG2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Family tree of the case</title><p>The proband (arrow) and her father underwent pacemaker implantation.</p><p>GT: genetic testing, PMI: pacemaker implantation, PV: pathogenic variant</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="cureus-0016-00000074631-i02" position="float"/></fig><p>The electrocardiogram showed a 2:1 atrioventricular block and left bundle branch block. On 24-hour ECG monitoring, a 2:1 atrioventricular block was observed at bedtime. The basic rhythm was sinus rhythm, and the number of total heartbeats was 80,662 per day. Blocked atrial premature contraction followed by narrow QRS atrioventricular conduction was also observed. No lethal ventricular arrhythmia was detected. Laboratory data revealed mildly elevated B-type natriuretic peptide levels (24.2 pg/ml). The complete blood count, liver function, and kidney function were normal. The echocardiogram detected mild hypertrophy without dyssynchrony. Cardiac MRI showed mild concentricity and dilatation of the left ventricle, including a region of reduced T1 value in the ventricular septum. There were no findings suggestive of inflammation or edema. Late gadolinium enhancement was negative (Figure <xref rid="FIG3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). She underwent a pacemaker (DDD mode) implantation.</p><fig position="anchor" fig-type="figure" id="FIG3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Cardiac MRI</title><p>Cardiac MRI showed mild left ventricular hypertrophy.

Genomic DNA is enriched for targeted regions using a hybridization-based protocol and sequenced using Illumina technology. All targeted regions are sequenced with &#x0003e; 50x depth.

The deletion causes a stop codon to occur after the extension of 40 amino acids. This variant is located at the calponin homology domain 2 in FLNC, which results in the truncating structure that does not contain Rod1, Rod2, or the dimerization domain. The remaining ones were variants of uncertain significance or benign ones. This case was diagnosed as FLNC-related cardiomyopathy. The genetic testing of her healthy son was negative.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>FLNC, the filamin C coding gene, is one of the causative genes involved in HCM but is most prominent in DCM. This gene is highly intolerant to loss-of-function (LOEUF: 0.25). FLNCtv&#x000a0;was reported to be identified in DCM, although missense or in-frame indel variants were found in other phenotypes [<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The phenotype of FLNC-related cardiomyopathy is a late-onset type, typically occurring in the 40s [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>However, the case had a truncating variant, but the phenotype was mild HCM and advanced conduction impairment. The cases with FLNCtv who had cardiomyopathy with atrioventricular block were identified in an Icelandic population-based analysis [<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The identified variant is located in an actin-binding domain. A case with a different variant in the same domain had DCM and a left bundle branch block [<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. It was also reported that left ventricular hypertrophy or dysfunction is not necessarily obvious in FLNCtv cases [<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>Filamin C, whose expression is enriched in cardiomyocytes and even more so in skeletal muscle, is responsible for mechanical transduction between cells by adhesion of the Z-disc of the sarcomere to the sarcolemma and the interventricular plate [<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. On the intervening disc, filamin C is located at the fascia adherens, where the ends of the myofibers reach the sarcolemma, close to the position of the desmosomal junction. Fragile filamin C may cause dysfunction of intercellular junctions. Therefore, FLNCtv could cause conduction disturbances. It is also postulated to regulate cytoskeletal protein organizations in response to stress. Aggregation of filamin C in the cytoplasm has been shown to play a pathogenic role [<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. This feature could cause a late onset of FLNCtv.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We experienced an FLNC-related cardiomyopathy case that had predominantly advanced conduction defects. In general, cases with FLNCtv show a severe DCM or HCM phenotype, and this case was considered rare. More data regarding FLNCtv is required.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group content-type="conflict"><title>Disclosures</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Human subjects:</bold> Consent for treatment and open access publication was obtained or waived by all participants in this study.
