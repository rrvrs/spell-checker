Its impact depends on several factors, one of the most modifiable being the duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) (Howes et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="eip70021-bib-0015" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>). Long DUP is associated with poorer outcomes including increased symptom severity, reduced likelihood of remission and impaired social and global functioning (Drake et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="eip70021-bib-0007" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Yu et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="eip70021-bib-0039" ref-type="bibr">2023</xref>). In addition, it casts a long shadow, with adverse effects persisting decades after psychosis onset (O'Keeffe et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="eip70021-bib-0027" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>). This has focused attention on designing mental health services which are accessible to young people in the early stage of a psychotic illness, resulting in the early intervention for psychosis (EIP) model (Malla and McGorry&#x000a0;<xref rid="eip70021-bib-0021" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Yet factors prior to initial assessment by specialised services continue to represent a barrier to engagement, with the interval between symptom onset and first mental health service contact thought to account for approximately one third of the DUP (Marino et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="eip70021-bib-0023" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). This has prompted a shift in focus towards understanding the component delays that contribute to prolonged DUP, such as delays in help seeking (Malla et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="eip70021-bib-0020" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>).</p><p>The length of the pre&#x02010;service engagement DUP highlights the need to engage the broadest spectrum of professionals, including non&#x02010;healthcare community workers, to facilitate early help&#x02010;seeking behaviour (HSE National Clinical Programme&#x000a0;<xref rid="eip70021-bib-0016" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Their input may be particularly important in youth mental health, as young people, despite recognising that they need professional help, often do not seek it (Dooley et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="eip70021-bib-0006" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). This may partially account for the finding that a younger age of onset is associated with a longer DUP (Baeza et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="eip70021-bib-0001" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>). Against this backdrop, youth workers have emerged as key professionals in efforts to enhance early detection networks (Lynch et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="eip70021-bib-0019" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Situated at the intersection of child welfare, education and mental health, youth workers are uniquely positioned to recognise early warning signs of distress and to foster help&#x02010;seeking behaviours, leveraging their relational proximity and holistic understanding of young people's developmental needs (Ranahan and Thomas&#x000a0;<xref rid="eip70021-bib-0031" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Despite this potential, pathways to care involving non&#x02010;clinical contacts have typically been associated with a longer DUP (Bhui et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="eip70021-bib-0002" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), and interventions targeting community&#x02010;based agencies have so far proven largely ineffective (Oliver et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="eip70021-bib-0028" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). For example, a community awareness programme offering direct referral pathways to EIP services failed to reduce the DUP or increase referral rates (Lloyd&#x02010;Evans et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="eip70021-bib-0018" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). The authors cited a number of barriers such as stigma, fear, and negative past experiences with mental health services, which may deter community workers from making timely referrals.</p><p>There is a clear need to better understand how youth workers perceive their involvement in youth mental health generally, and in addressing psychosis specifically, so that the potential of their unique role can be harnessed to minimise treatment delays for young people. In addition, ambiguity remains regarding the scope of what mental health training for youth workers should entail, despite calls for its implementation (Department of Health&#x000a0;<xref rid="eip70021-bib-0005" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). This study aims to bridge this gap by exploring youth workers' views of their potential role in the early identification of and response to psychosis, including their perspective on the training necessary to effectively fulfil this role.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials-and-methods" id="eip70021-sec-0007"><label>2</label><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="eip70021-sec-0008"><label>2.1</label><title>Participants</title><p>Participants were youth workers from various organisations across Ireland who attended a 1&#x02010;day EIP training course as part of a wider educational campaign to reduce DUP. Recruitment was facilitated by the National Youth Council of Ireland (NYCI), which advertised the course through online platforms and emails to affiliated organisations. The curriculum, detailed elsewhere (Hassab Errasoul et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="eip70021-bib-0014" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), was designed specifically for youth workers and aimed to equip them with the skills to recognise psychosis and access appropriate treatment, with a strong emphasis on early intervention.</p></sec><sec id="eip70021-sec-0009"><label>2.2</label><title>Study Design</title><p>To achieve both completeness and triangulation (Bryman&#x000a0;<xref rid="eip70021-bib-0004" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>), the study employed a sequential&#x02010;independent mixed methods design (Schoonenboom and Johnson&#x000a0;<xref rid="eip70021-bib-0034" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). There were two sequential phases: a quantitative strand followed by a qualitative strand, allowing participants time to reflect on the training before interviews. Data collection in each strand was conducted independently, with neither contingent on the other's results. Equal weight was given to both strands, and integration occurred after data collection, allowing for examination of agreement, partial agreement, silence and dissonance according to the triangulation protocol (O'Cathain et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="eip70021-bib-0026" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="eip70021-sec-0010"><label>2.3</label><title>Quantitative Strand</title><p>A brief questionnaire, developed specifically for this study (Supporting Information&#x000a0;<xref rid="eip70021-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>), was administered immediately after the completion of the training course. Participants were asked to rate their agreement with statements evaluating the course and their perceived role in EIP using a 5&#x02010;point Likert scale (1&#x02009;=&#x02009;strongly agree to 5&#x02009;=&#x02009;strongly disagree).</p></sec><sec id="eip70021-sec-0011"><label>2.4</label><title>Qualitative Strand</title><p>In&#x02010;depth, semi&#x02010;structured face&#x02010;to&#x02010;face interviews were conducted with a subset of workshop attendees. The interview questions were thematically aligned with the questionnaire, aiming to expand on participants' views. All participants were invited to take part. Recruitment continued until data quality signalled sufficient information power (Malterud et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="eip70021-bib-0022" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>), with the final number of participants determined by the relevance of the information gathered in answering the study's objectives.</p></sec><sec id="eip70021-sec-0012"><label>2.5</label><title>Data Analysis</title><p>Survey data were analysed descriptively using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) software, with one negatively worded item recoded to ensure that lower scores consistently reflected disagreement across all items.

A hybrid approach was employed, combining both deductive and inductive methods. While targeted interview questions and research aims guided the identification of anticipated thematic areas, codes were not predefined but instead emerged organically from the data.

However, despite their willingness to support young people as they navigate mental health services, stigma among the participants emerged as a pervasive challenge. It was subtle and largely unacknowledged by the youth workers, who, despite framing mental illness as a health issue, hesitated to use appropriate terminology and fully recognise it as an illness. In addition, the interviews expanded on participants' views regarding the format of EIP training, underscoring the value of co&#x02010;facilitation by both mental health professionals and experienced youth workers, as well as a strong preference for in&#x02010;person training, which was perceived as crucial for fostering networking opportunities.</p></sec><sec id="eip70021-sec-0021"><label>4.4</label><title>Dissonance</title><p>Quantitively, participants expressed a high degree of confidence in their ability to recognise and address psychosis in youth.

Youth workers articulated their role in opposition to that of clinicians, particularly in terms of emotional involvement and commitment to youth. Their perspectives on managing mental illness also diverged from those of mental health teams, especially concerning the use of pharmacotherapy and the conditions warranting inpatient admission.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="eip70021-sec-0022"><label>5</label><title>Discussion</title><p>Youth workers in this study viewed their involvement in youth mental health not as a diversion, but rather a natural and necessary evolution of their role. While some have described youth workers best suited to act as gatekeepers to mental health services (Rickwood and Mazzer&#x000a0;<xref rid="eip70021-bib-0032" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), others contend that this leaves them &#x02018;positioned merely at the doorway, facilitators to other service providers, waving young people through but not accompanying them to the other side&#x02019; (Ranahan and Pellisier&#x000a0;<xref rid="eip70021-bib-0030" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>, 231). Instead, proponents of the latter view have advocated for youth workers to be fully integrated within collaborative mental health teams, a model already implemented elsewhere (Rickwood et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="eip70021-bib-0033" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Participants in this study envisioned their role as falling somewhere in the middle of these perspectives, seeing themselves as &#x02018;in&#x02010;betweens&#x02019;, supportive bridges between young people, their families and specialised services. They emphasised that their greatest strength lies in their position as trusted adults for vulnerable young people often disconnected from formal support systems. However, this advantage may be compromised should their role become more formally integrated into mental health services, as the trust youth workers build could be strained&#x02014;particularly when they must prioritise a young person's safety by involving others without the young person's consent (Ranahan&#x000a0;<xref rid="eip70021-bib-0029" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). This risk is heightened in cases of psychosis, where young people may lose insight and disengage from support entirely (Kim et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="eip70021-bib-0017" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Nevertheless, youth workers are already an obligate part of the intervention pathway given that they cannot control or anticipate the mental health challenges that young people under their care will present. Therefore, the discourse must now shift from questioning their role to exploring how best to support and equip them for success. This study highlights several potential pitfalls that need to be addressed to ensure their involvement is beneficial and does not undermine the very relationships that make them effective.</p><p>A key consideration in preparing youth workers to address the mental health challenges of young people lies in determining the most effective approach to increasing their mental health literacy. Participants in this study recognised the relevance of EIP training; however, they noted that a focus on psychosis is premature without a solid grounding in general mental health principles. As their role is not to diagnose but rather to identify when a young person is unwell and in need of specialised support, perhaps training should focus less on diagnostic distinctions and more on recognising early signs of distress and functional decline, indicators that warrant closer monitoring or referral to secondary services (Fusar&#x02010;Poli et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="eip70021-bib-0012" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). This aligns with evidence suggesting that the period preceding a psychotic illness is often characterised by non&#x02010;specific indicators of risk such as increased help seeking, suicidal behaviour, and social isolation (Sullivan et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="eip70021-bib-0036" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>), offering a critical window for early intervention before the die is cast. Although identifying those at risk can be challenging even for health professionals (Strelchuk et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="eip70021-bib-0035" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>), youth workers are uniquely positioned to notice subtle yet persistent changes in social engagement and daily functioning due to their consistent presence and deep knowledge of young people's lives. In addition, condition&#x02010;specific workshops may inadvertently reinforce participants' belief that illnesses such as depression and anxiety are distinctly separate from psychosis; whereas, in practice, the boundaries between these conditions often blur. This is particularly true during the prodromal phase, where, for example, differentiating between depression and delusional mood can be challenging (Fusar&#x02010;Poli et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="eip70021-bib-0010" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Thus, while psychosis&#x02010;specific training yielded positive outcomes, a more effective strategy may involve a comprehensive trans&#x02010;diagnostic curriculum that encourages a focus on identifying risk rather than on a diagnosis, akin to Mental Health First Aid, which has shown promise in this regard (Ng et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="eip70021-bib-0024" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>).</p><p>This study revealed that didactic training alone may be insufficient in sustaining youth workers' role in EIP without simultaneously addressing existing barriers. For example, stigma is not only pervasive, but can undermine the effectiveness of community mental health literacy initiatives (Lloyd&#x02010;Evans et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="eip70021-bib-0018" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). In this study, youth workers expressed a reluctance to use appropriate psychiatric labels. While this aligns with their socio&#x02010;ecological perspective on mental illness, it also introduces several challenges. Developing comfort with accurate terminology not only facilitates effective communication within multidisciplinary teams but also plays a crucial role in reframing mental illness as a medical condition rather than a personal failing (Wright et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="eip70021-bib-0038" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). This is particularly important given that youth workers expressed a preference for psychotherapy and viewed medication as indicative of a failure to intervene early. This perspective is echoed in the youth work literature, which reflects a degree of scepticism towards what is perceived as an overly medicalised approach to youth mental health, with youth work positioned as a counter&#x02010;narrative rather than a cooperative ally (Elsen and Ord&#x000a0;<xref rid="eip70021-bib-0008" ref-type="bibr">2023</xref>). This view is likely shaped by the significant experience youth workers have with young people facing age&#x02010;appropriate difficulties, where counselling may be more appropriate. However, addressing serious mental illnesses such as psychosis demands a broader, more comprehensive treatment approach (Fusar&#x02010;Poli et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="eip70021-bib-0009" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Therefore, educational initiatives for youth workers should adopt a twofold strategy. First, they must tackle the implicit stigma that some workers may hold. Curricula that incorporate service user testimonies (Thornicroft et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="eip70021-bib-0037" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>) and experiential arts interventions (Gaiha et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="eip70021-bib-0013" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>) have shown promise in this regard and align with the relational, participatory ethos central to youth work practice (Ranahan and Pellisier&#x000a0;<xref rid="eip70021-bib-0030" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Second, training should offer a thorough overview of biopsychosocial treatment planning, emphasising the multimodal nature of EIP interventions and demonstrating that while psychotherapy is a vital element, it is only one part of a more holistic, integrated approach to managing psychosis.</p><p>Another significant barrier that repeatedly surfaced in the interviews is the difficulty youth workers face in interfacing with mental health services. Although EIP training can enhance their understanding of psychosis, it may ultimately fail in the goal of promoting help&#x02010;seeking behaviours. Without a belief in the effectiveness of mental health services, this knowledge may fall short in practice (Lloyd&#x02010;Evans et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="eip70021-bib-0018" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). The interviews highlighted an adversarial &#x02018;us versus them&#x02019; mentality which may reinforce a hierarchical dynamic, implicitly positioning clinicians as gatekeepers of legitimacy, thereby stifling youth workers' professional autonomy and hindering the development of genuine, collaborative relationships (Ranahan and Thomas&#x000a0;<xref rid="eip70021-bib-0031" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Such tensions were evident in accounts of youth workers feeling dismissed, such as when inpatient care was denied despite their concerns. Frustrations understandably arise when the rationale for such decisions, such as admission not being appropriate or beneficial, is poorly communicated, and may feed into a broader belief that mental health professionals are insufficiently invested in helping young people. Addressing these tensions requires targeted training that positions the roles of youth workers and mental health professionals as complementary and mutually reinforcing, rather than oppositional. Efforts must be made on both sides: youth workers need to gain a deeper understanding of the structure and decision&#x02010;making processes within mental health services, while clinicians must acknowledge the role of youth workers extends beyond mere custodial duties.</p><p>Despite their negative experiences, youth workers expressed a desire for more effective communication and collaboration with mental health teams. While there may be a rationale for a more direct link with EIP services, allowing at&#x02010;risk youths to be referred immediately to EIP services, this approach would have to be considered carefully given the likelihood of a high proportion of &#x02018;non&#x02010;case&#x02019; referrals in the context of low&#x02010;risk enrichment in community samples and the non&#x02010;clinical background of many youth workers (Fusar&#x02010;Poli et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="eip70021-bib-0011" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Where this has been trialled, the strategy has been ineffective, with prior negative experiences with mental health professionals being a barrier to the referral processes (Lloyd&#x02010;Evans et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="eip70021-bib-0018" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). This notwithstanding, it is important that youth workers feel supported when concerns about a young person arise so that they are not left feeling isolated and solely responsible for &#x02018;holding&#x02019; a person in distress (N&#x000ed; Charraighe and Reynolds&#x000a0;<xref rid="eip70021-bib-0025" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>). One approach could involve assigning a dedicated liaison from the local mental health team to each youth service, offering guidance on concerning cases and advising on appropriate next steps. An alternative strategy may involve organisational policies that encourage direct communication between youth workers and clinicians (Ranahan and Thomas&#x000a0;<xref rid="eip70021-bib-0031" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>), such as a recurring forum allowing for regular feedback between the two disciplines.</p><sec id="eip70021-sec-0023"><label>5.1</label><title>Strengths and Limitations</title><p>This study was conducted within a specific national context. The interface between youth workers and mental health services has varied configurations across different jurisdictions, from models where youth workers operate independently of mental health services to those where they are integrated within multidisciplinary teams, such as Australia's Headspace initiative (Rickwood et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;<xref rid="eip70021-bib-0033" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>).This should be considered in terms of its generalizability. However, these findings may also have broader international relevance given that communication between social care and healthcare professionals is a consistent feature of any interface. Thus, this study contributes to the broader, timely, and necessary discourse on expanding mental health education and responsibilities to non&#x02010;clinically trained community workers, highlighting both the challenges and opportunities this approach presents.</p><p>The strength of this study lies in its mixed methods design, which not only enabled the corroboration of findings across both strands but also uncovered nuances in youth workers' perspectives. While the views expressed may have been influenced by participants' interest in mental health and thus not fully represent the voices of other youth workers who have diverse backgrounds and priorities, their reflections represent an important contribution to service design and the research agenda. The independent structure of the study meant that interview sampling was not guided by survey responses. While this can ensure a broad range of viewpoints, it is unlikely to have influenced the findings, as participants generally showed strong agreement on the survey items. Lastly, participants in the qualitative phase reported limited exposure to psychosis, which reduced opportunities to apply the training before the interviews. Nevertheless, their insights remain valuable, as many youth workers likely have minimal experience with psychotic illness.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="eip70021-sec-0024"><label>6</label><title>Conclusion</title><p>Participant feedback in this study highlighted both the need for psychosis training and the importance of refining its focus. Future iterations could emphasise practical, scenario&#x02010;based learning to equip youth workers with the skills to identify trans&#x02010;diagnostic, early indicators of mental illness, determine thresholds for secondary care referral, and address barriers that may prevent community members from encouraging help&#x02010;seeking in youth. It would be instructive to re&#x02010;evaluate the training following these refinements.</p><p>Finally, while this study highlights the enthusiasm of youth workers in supporting the mental health needs of young people, enthusiasm alone is not enough. None of the participants in this study had access to EIP services in their communities. Without expanding these services, the goals of EIP&#x02014;and by extension, this study&#x02014;risk remaining aspirational rather than attainable.</p></sec><sec sec-type="COI-statement" id="eip70021-sec-0025"><title>Conflicts of Interest</title><p>The authors declare no conflicts of interest.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material id="eip70021-supitem-0001" position="float" content-type="local-data"><caption><p>
