They are generally introduced voluntarily in erotic or psychiatric contexts but can also result from accidents or medical interventions. The calcification of these objects, caused by prolonged reactions of the bladder mucosa, further complicates their early identification. These cases often require interdisciplinary collaboration between urologists and psychiatrists for effective management [<xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>]. The presence of these foreign bodies can lead to various complications, including chronic infections, hematuria, and, in severe cases, vesicocutaneous fistulas [<xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Understanding the associations between psychiatric disorders and foreign body insertion is crucial, as many cases are linked to mental health conditions such as schizophrenia and depression [2, 5]. These observations underline the importance of integrated psychiatric management to prevent recurrent behaviors [<xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="s0010"><label>2</label><title>Case presentation</title><p id="p0035">We present the case of a 37-year-old male who consulted our outpatient clinic with persistent chronic dysuria and a burning sensation during micturition. Notably, the patient had a long-standing history of schizophrenia managed with treatment for seven years, and he denied any previous urethral manipulations.</p><p id="p0040">Clinical examination was unremarkable, but imaging results painted a puzzling picture. A pelvic ultrasound revealed multiple bladder calculi without renal abnormalities, which was further confirmed by a plain abdominal X-ray (AUSP) showing radiopaque stones. An abdominopelvic CT scan corroborated these findings, identifying what appeared to be multiple large bladder stones, with no evidence of renal lithiasis (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>).<fig id="f0005"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>A - Image showing calcific shadows projected over the bladder area. B - Image showing multiple calculi in the bladder.</p></caption><alt-text id="al0005">Fig. 1</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="gr1" id="lk0005"/></fig></p><p id="p0045">Given the imaging results and clinical symptoms, the patient was scheduled for a suprapubic cystotomy. However, the intraoperative findings revealed a surprising twist: the suspected &#x0201c;stones&#x0201d; were, in fact, a foreign body. A plastic bead bracelet, introduced into the bladder by the patient himself years earlier, had undergone significant calcification over time, mimicking bladder stones (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>).<fig id="f0010"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Images of the calcified bracelet after extraction.</p></caption><alt-text id="al0010">Fig. 2</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="gr2" id="lk0010"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="s0015"><label>3</label><title>Discussion</title><p id="p0050">The presence of calcified foreign bodies in the bladder has been documented in several similar cases. Walsh and Moustafa reported that these objects are often introduced voluntarily for masturbatory purposes or in psychiatric contexts [<xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The case presented highlights the diagnostic complexity associated with delayed medical care due to embarrassment or underlying psychological disorders.</p><p id="p0055">The diagnosis relies on a combination of imaging modalities, including ultrasound, radiography, and CT, which help differentiate simple calcifications from foreign bodies. Cystoscopy remains the gold standard for confirming the presence of and strategizing the removal of the object. In this case, extensive calcification made the identification of the initial object challenging until surgical exploration.</p><p id="p0060">Therapeutic management is primarily surgical, although endoscopic approaches are preferred in simpler cases. However, open surgery becomes necessary when foreign bodies are large or heavily encrusted.</p><p id="p0065">Complications associated with bladder foreign bodies include chronic urinary infections, hematuria, and, in advanced cases, vesicocutaneous fistulas. Early intervention is critical to prevent these severe outcomes. Moreover, studies have highlighted the role of minimally invasive techniques in extracting foreign bodies, providing an effective alternative to open surgery in less complex cases [<xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p id="p0070">A review of the literature reveals that these cases are frequently associated with underlying psychiatric disorders. For example, Bosquet Sanz et al. emphasized that most patients suffer from schizophrenia, depression, or personality disorders [<xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. These observations underline the importance of integrated psychiatric management to prevent recurrent behaviors. A multidisciplinary approach, including routine psychiatric consultation after intervention, is therefore recommended to optimize long-term outcomes [<xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p id="p0075">Finally, it is noteworthy that calcified foreign bodies can sometimes remain undetected for years, as symptoms are often nonspecific. This highlights the importance of thorough history-taking and imaging in the presence of atypical urinary symptoms, even when patients deny any known manipulation.</p></sec><sec id="s0020"><label>4</label><title>Conclusion</title><p id="p0080">Calcified bladder foreign bodies are a rare but clinically relevant phenomenon, often associated with psychiatric disorders.
