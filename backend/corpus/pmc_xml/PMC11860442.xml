Based on participant feedback, the following themes emerged: 1) Improvement of pre-treatment preparation sessions; 2) PaT Benefits: Gaining perspective, peace, non-attachment, authenticity, honesty, relational capacity; 3) The community of practice (CoP) as the primary conduit for connection and regulation 4) Population specific curriculum with a greater focus on how to navigate death, pain and loss; 5) PaT session Challenges; 6) The interpersonal and support capacity of the team as critical for the overall experience.</p></sec><sec id="sec3923"><title>Conclusions</title><p>While more research is needed, results suggest that psilocybin can be delivered safely in a group setting, and that a virtual CoP is effective across the spectrum of set, setting&#x000a0;and integration Our findings also suggest that there is much to learn - and improve upon - in this novel area of service delivery.</p></sec><sec id="sec3924"><title>Disclosure of Interest</title><p>None Declared</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="2"/></counts></article-meta></front></article>
