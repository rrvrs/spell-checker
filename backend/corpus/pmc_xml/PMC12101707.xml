The primary purpose of this study was to examine the factors influencing the clinical outcomes of patients with tibial plateau fractures and to assess the efficacy of conservative treatment versus surgical intervention. This research aims to provide insights into managing tibial plateau fractures in resource-limited settings, with the hope of contributing to improved clinical practices.</p></sec><sec id="sec036"><title>Methods</title><p>A total of 191 patients with tibial plateau fractures were recruited from Tibebe Ghion Referral Hospital and Felegehiwot Specialized Hospital between February 1, 2018, and February 2022. Demographic, clinical, and radiological data were analyzed, and treatment outcomes were assessed via Rasmussen&#x02019;s knee functional outcome score. A correlation analysis was performed to identify factors impacting functional outcomes. Logistic regression was used to identify factors influencing clinical outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="sec037"><title>Results</title><p>The study population was predominantly male (73.8%), with a mean age of 45 years. Road traffic accidents (41.9%) were the most common cause of injury. Schatzker type I fractures (27.2%) were the most common, and compound fractures accounted for 21% of the fractures. The average time to definitive management was 1.59 weeks, with 35% of patients undergoing open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF). The duration of immobilization and weight-bearing significantly influenced functional outcomes. Patients who were immobilized for less than 4 weeks had better outcomes, with functional scores 54 times better than those of patients who were immobilized for more than 8 weeks (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01). Early initiation of partial weight-bearing also improved outcomes. A strong negative relationship was found between the duration of immobilization and functional outcomes (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;-0.705, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01).</p></sec><sec id="sec038"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study highlights the importance of early mobilization and optimal management of tibial plateau fractures for improving functional outcomes.

These fractures account for approximately 1% of adult fractures and require proper treatment and rehabilitation to achieve a stable, pain-free, and functional joint [<xref rid="pone.0323956.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. However, they are associated with significant challenges, including pain, stiffness, and the risk of posttraumatic arthrosis, which can lead to poor functional outcomes [<xref rid="pone.0323956.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Understanding the direct and indirect causes of poor outcomes is essential to improve patient care.</p><p>The factors most consistently linked to favorable outcomes are still debated and include patient characteristics, injury-related factors, and treatment approaches [<xref rid="pone.0323956.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323956.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Since treatment is under the surgeon&#x02019;s control, it is often the most debated aspect. Key areas of controversy include the relative importance of limb alignment, articular surface reduction, and the management of associated ligament and meniscal injuries [<xref rid="pone.0323956.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]<sup>.</sup> The functional outcome tends to decrease as fracture severity increases [<xref rid="pone.0323956.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323956.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In contrast, no correlation was found between fracture classification (ranging from simple to complex fractures) and the chosen treatment method (operative or nonoperative) [<xref rid="pone.0323956.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Tibial plateau fractures can be managed through various approaches, including conservative or operative methods, but short-term follow-up results have shown inconsistent functional outcomes [<xref rid="pone.0323956.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323956.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323956.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The optimal treatment for these fractures remains controversial, with a wide range of treatment modalities suggested [<xref rid="pone.0323956.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].&#x0201c; Some studies have shown that patients with displaced tibial plateau fractures treated by open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) achieve excellent results and satisfactory knee scores [<xref rid="pone.0323956.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323956.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323956.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323956.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0323956.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, the diversity in fracture patterns and the associated variability in outcomes pose significant challenges to standardizing treatment. The factors influencing outcomes also differ across various fracture patterns, further complicating treatment decisions [<xref rid="pone.0323956.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323956.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323956.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Approximately one-third of patients do not return to work following a tibial plateau fracture. This underscores the notion that tibial plateau fractures can lead to long-term complications [<xref rid="pone.0323956.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The duration of immobilization and the timing for initiating weight-bearing after surgery remain topics of debate and are often tailored to the rigidity of the fixation used [<xref rid="pone.0323956.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. There is a lack of evidence and conflicting guidelines regarding the most appropriate postoperative rehabilitation regimen, including recommendations for weight-bearing status [<xref rid="pone.0323956.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323956.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]<strike>.</strike></p><p>Despite these challenges, there is a notable research gap concerning tibial plateau fracture outcomes in sub-Saharan Africa. This gap raises critical questions about the factors influencing these outcomes and the best management strategies, especially in resource-limited settings. In such contexts, deviations from standard guidelines such as operative treatment with ORIF are common owing to shortages of materials and skilled personnel, leading to the frequent use of nonoperative approaches. Specifically, studies examining tibial plateau fracture outcomes in Ethiopia are lacking. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate the factors affecting the clinical outcomes of patients with these fractures. By addressing this research gap, we aim to contribute valuable insights to improve clinical practices for managing tibial plateau fractures in resource-limited settings.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Methods and materials</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Study area</title><p>This study was conducted at Felege Hiwot Referral Hospital and Tibebe Ghion Specialized Hospital in Bahir Dar, the capital of the Amhara National Regional State, which is located 578 kilometers northwest of Addis Ababa.

In this study, a wide sex disparity was observed. The number of male patients was 140 (73.8%), and 51 were women (26.2%). The male:female ratio was 3:1. The mean age of the participants was 45 &#x000b1; 13 years, with an age range of 18&#x02013;78 years. The mean ages of the male and female patients were 43 &#x000b1; 14 years and 49 &#x000b1; 11 years, respectively. Most 115 (67%) patients sustained injuries following RTAs or motor bike accidents. Only seven (3.7%) patients presented to our facility within six hours after the injury. Most cases (seventy-one percent) are caused by low-energy trauma. Pearson&#x02019;s correlation analysis revealed that the proportion of high-energy trauma patients decreased with increasing age. Schatzker type one fractures, 52 (27.2%) of which were the most common tibial plateau fractures observed, and type six fractures, 13 (6.8%) of which were the least common. No correlation was found between fracture type and the mechanism of injury. The prevalence of compound tibial plateau fractures was 41 (21%). The Gastilo-Anderson type three classification was the most common. Prophylactic antibiotics were administered to all patients with compound tibial plateau fractures, but only eight patients received antibiotics within three hours after the injury.

Regression analysis indicated that complications did not significantly differ between simple and complex fractures. Neither the type of fracture nor the classification (high energy vs. low energy) emerged as risk factors for complications. Compared with nonoperative treatments, operative treatment methods are associated with a greater incidence of wound complications, such as wound dehiscence and infection. Wound dehiscence occurred in five patients who underwent open reduction and internal fixation, although this finding was not statistically significant in the regression analysis.

The prevalence of compound tibial plateau fractures was 41 cases (21%), which is higher than that reported in India [<xref rid="pone.0323956.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], possibly due to recent internal conflicts and increased gun use by civilians.</p><p>According to Gustilo-Anderson&#x02019;s classification, type III fracture was the most prevalent compound fracture type, which contrasts with findings from Nigeria [<xref rid="pone.0323956.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].

This approach contrasts with the principle that tibial plateau fractures, as articular injuries, typically require open reduction and internal fixation for accurate fragment reduction and stable fixation, which often leads to excellent knee function scores [<xref rid="pone.0323956.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323956.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. This deviation may be due to limited implant availability and financial constraints.</p><p>In these two hospitals, the use of joint-spanning external fixation as definitive therapy was relatively high in 59 patients (30%), despite recent studies not supporting this approach for long-term management. For high-energy tibial plateau fractures (Schatzker types IV and V), internal fixation combined with Ilizarov external fixation is strongly recommended, as it provides stability but can lead to local complications [<xref rid="pone.0323956.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323956.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The frequent use of joint-spanning external fixation may have contributed to the high rate of knee stiffness, which was observed in 112 patients (58%) in this study. Additionally, 114 patients (59.7%) had a range of motion of less than 90&#x02009;degrees, which is lower than that reported in other studies [<xref rid="pone.0323956.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323956.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323956.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. This may be due to the excessive reliance on external fixation, nonoperative management, and lack of access to quality physiotherapy services.</p><p>Knee stiffness and the duration of knee immobilization were significantly associated with the functional outcome of tibial plateau fractures. The frequent use of joint-spanning external fixation and casting in these hospitals may negatively impact these outcomes. Early initiation of knee mobilization within a few weeks postmanagement was associated with improved functional outcomes.</p><p>The optimal timing for weight-bearing after surgery remains debated. Some studies suggest immediate weight-bearing in a brace to encourage fracture healing [<xref rid="pone.0323956.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In our study, the mean duration for starting partial weight-bearing in the operative group was 4.7 weeks, with a longer duration in the nonoperative group. Notably, the timing of partial weight-bearing was a statistically significant factor influencing functional outcomes in patients with tibial plateau fractures.</p><p>In this study, the majority of patients, 109 (57.1%), had unsatisfactory functional outcomes, a rate lower than that reported in other studies [<xref rid="pone.0323956.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323956.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323956.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The key factors affecting the functional outcome of tibial plateau fractures include the timing of partial weight-bearing, initiation of range of motion or immobilization, and the presence of knee stiffness.</p><p>Despite most participants in this study having simple fracture types, which are generally considered less complex, the unsatisfactory functional outcomes observed can be attributed to several factors. Although these patients may have been candidates for operative management (ORIF), the lack of available surgical materials and trained personnel in resource-limited settings led to 65% being treated non-operatively. Additionally, limited access to physiotherapy and rehabilitation services further hindered recovery. These findings highlight significant gaps in patient management and underscore how even simple fractures can result in poor outcomes in settings with inadequate resources and care.</p><p>The complications commonly observed included soft tissue injuries such as blisters, peroneal nerve injury, compartment syndrome, and DVT. Compared with nonoperative treatment, operative treatment was associated with a greater incidence of wound complications, including wound dehiscence and infection, although this difference was not statistically significant according to regression analysis.</p><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec023"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study analyzed the factors associated with the outcomes of tibial plateau fractures among patients treated at Tibebe Ghion Federal Hospital and Felegehiwot Specialized Hospital. Our findings demonstrate that the duration of weight bearing and immobilization significantly influences the functional outcomes of patients, with extended periods of weight bearing and immobilization associated with poorer outcomes. Additionally, stiffness was identified as a critical factor contributing to unsatisfactory functional results. These findings emphasize the importance of optimizing post-treatment rehabilitation protocols, particularly concerning weight-bearing duration and immobilization periods, to enhance patient outcomes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec024"><title>Ethical declarations</title><sec id="sec025"><title>Ethical approval</title><p>Ethical approval for this study was obtained from the Institutional Review Board of Bahir Dar University, College of Medicine and Health Sciences Research Ethics Committee, with protocol number 433/2018.

<bold>Comments to the Author</bold>
</p><p>1. Is the manuscript technically sound, and do the data support the conclusions?</p><p>The manuscript must describe a technically sound piece of scientific research with data that supports the conclusions.

Review Comments to the Author</p><p>Please use the space provided to explain your answers to the questions above. You may also include additional comments for the author, including concerns about dual publication, research ethics, or publication ethics. (Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)</p><p>Reviewer #1:&#x000a0;Although an interesting Manuscript, there are limitations and questions which need to be answered by the authors:</p><p>Q1. Predominantly Schatzker I fractures were included (27.2%?), Schatzker VI were only 6.8%.</p><p>Since Schatzker I is not a difficult fracture to treat, what is the reason that the funcional outcome is so poor?</p><p>Unsatisfactory outcome was reported with 57%, limited flexion of the knee joint below 90 Degrees with 57.9%</p><p>Q2. Section complications: compartment syndrome is reported with 4.2% and peroneal nerve injury with 7.9%.</p><p>These figures are quite high, even in contract with predominantly Schatzker I fractures. Are the listed complications</p><p>primary caused by the accident or related to surgery (postoperative complications)?</p><p>Recomendations:</p><p>1. Please put in a table the numbers and percentages of the Schatzer I, II, III, IV, V and VI Fractures, related to age, sex</p><p>and combidities (like Nicotine/ drug abuse, arterial and venous vascular disease, diabetes, renal disease).</p><p>Advisable is also to list the immobilisation time related tot the Schatzker classification</p><p>2. Please list in a table the Gusilo-Anderson classification related to the Schatzker Classification. This will provide more</p><p>information about the severity of the injury of the whole patient cohort</p><p>3. Please list in a table the functional outcome related to the Schatzker classification.</p><p>Reviewer #2:&#x000a0;The authors describe clinical outcomes one year after tibial plateau fractues in a single center hostpital in Ethiopia. There are only few studies about this topic in Africa and therefore the topic is very important and novel to report.</p><p>In the reviewed manuscript line numbering and the tables are missing. This makes sound reviewing difficult. Nevertheless there are a few comments already implementable by the authors to improve the quality of the study at hand.</p><p>The newest reference is from 2019. There is much more literature about these fractures available, for example:</p><p>
<ext-link xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=Tibial+Plateau+Fractures+in+africa" ext-link-type="uri">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=Tibial+Plateau+Fractures+in+africa</ext-link>
</p><p>The statistical testing is not done properly. Data need to be tested for normal distribution and thereafter are tested with the tests accordingly. Furthermore, why was mulivariate logistic regression performed? The power of the data sample is probably not allowing this test. Univariate analysis is of course possible. Simple t-test, chi square, fishers exact test and Mann-Whitney U test respectively should be accurate for the data sample.</p><p>Please adhere to the Strobe Checklist for reporting of your study</p><p>
<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.strobe-statement.org/checklists/" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.strobe-statement.org/checklists/</ext-link>
</p><p>I further recommend defining a primary outcome: For example functional follow up at one year and define all other values as secondary outcomes. Therewith the very nicely conducted study could further gain value.</p><p>Further feedback is possible after line numbering and access to the tables. Thank you for your work.</p><p>**********</p><p>6.

</p><p>Reviewer 1</p><p>Although an interesting Manuscript, there are limitations and questions which need to be answered by the authors:</p><p>Q1. Predominantly Schatzker I fractures were included (27.2%?), Schatzker VI were only 6.8%.</p><p>Since Schatzker I is not a difficult fracture to treat, what is the reason that the funcional outcome is so poor? Unsatisfactory outcome was reported with 57%, limited flexion of the knee joint below 90 Degrees with 57.9%</p><p>Answer:</p><p>The poor functional outcomes, despite the majority of participants having Schatzker I fractures (27%), which are typically considered less complex to treat, can be attributed to several factors. Although patients with Schatzker I fractures may have indications for operative management, such as ORIF (Open Reduction and Internal Fixation), the lack of available surgical materials and trained personnel in resource-limited settings likely prevented many from receiving the appropriate treatment. As a result, 65% of patients were treated with non-operative management methods. Additionally, the limited access to adequate physiotherapy and rehabilitation centers further impacted the overall treatment outcomes.</p><p>The main goal of this paper is to highlight these gaps in care, which point to the inefficiency of patient management in resource-limited environments. These findings suggest that even simple fractures, such as Schatzker I, can result in poor functional outcomes when critical resources and skilled care are lacking.</p><p>We added on the discussion part</p><p>Q2. Section complications: compartment syndrome is reported with 4.2% and peroneal nerve injury with 7.9%.</p><p>These figures are quite high, even in contract with predominantly Schatzker I fractures. Are the listed complications primary caused by the accident or related to surgery (postoperative complications)? We didn&#x02019;t identify whether these complication (compartment syndrome and peroneal nerve) were observed dueto surgery or due to, fracture.</p><p>Answer.</p><p>The reported complications of compartment syndrome (4.2%) and peroneal nerve injury (7.9%) appear relatively high, particularly given the predominantly Schatzker I fractures in our study. We fully acknowledge that it would have been beneficial to explicitly determine whether these complications were primarily due to the fracture itself or associated with the surgical intervention. Unfortunately, this distinction was not made in our study. As a result, it remains unclear whether the complications arose from the trauma of the fracture or as postoperative issues related to surgery.</p><p>Recomendations:</p><p>1. Please put in a table the numbers and percentages of the Schatzer I, II, III, IV, V and VI Fractures, related to age, sex and combidities (like Nicotine/ drug abuse, arterial and venous vascular disease, diabetes, renal disease).</p><p>Advisable is also to list the immobilisation time related tot the Schatzker classification</p><p>Answer; accepted and added</p><p>2. Please list in a table the Gusilo-Anderson classification related to the Schatzker Classification. This will provide more information about the severity of the injury of the whole patient cohort</p><p>Answer; accepted and added</p><p>3. Please list in a table the functional outcome related to the Schatzker classification.</p><p>Answer; accepted and added</p><p>Reviewer 2:</p><p>The authors describe clinical outcomes one year after tibial plateau fractues in a single center hostpital in Ethiopia. There are only few studies about this topic in Africa and therefore the topic is very important and novel to report.</p><p>Thank you!</p><p>1-In the reviewed manuscript line numbering and the tables are missing. This makes sound reviewing difficult. Nevertheless there are a few comments already implementable by the authors to improve the quality of the study at hand.</p><p>Answer, Accept and corrected.</p><p>2- The newest reference is from 2019. There is much more literature about these fractures available, for example:</p><p>

</p><p>3- The statistical testing is not done properly. Data need to be tested for normal distribution and thereafter are tested with the tests accordingly. Furthermore, why was mulivariate logistic regression performed? The power of the data sample is probably not allowing this test. Univariate analysis is of course possible. Simple t-test, chi square, fisher&#x02019;s exact test and Mann-Whitney U test respectively should be accurate for the data sample.</p><p>Answer: Our study included a total population of 191 participants, which we considered to be sufficiently large for the analyses performed. We initially conducted bivariate analysis for each independent variable and the outcome variable (functional outcome). Based on the statistical significance observed in the bivariate analysis, we proceeded with multivariate analysis to assess the associations between these variables. Additionally, Spearman's correlation was used to evaluate relationships between variables, such as immobilization duration and functional outcomes. We chose to perform multivariate logistic regression due to the significance observed in the bivariate analysis, and aimed to explore these associations more comprehensively. While univariate analyses, including t-tests, chi-square, Fisher's exact test, and Mann-Whitney U test, would also be appropriate for this dataset, we believed that the sample size was adequate to support the analyses conducted.</p><p>3- Please adhere to the Strobe Checklist for reporting of your study</p><p>

</p><p>Answer; accepted and adhered</p><p>4- I further recommend defining a primary outcome: For example functional follow up at one year and define all other values as secondary outcomes. Therewith the very nicely conducted study could further gain value.</p><p>Answer: Accept and Corrected.
