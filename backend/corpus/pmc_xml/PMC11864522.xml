While there are some studies showing that the recording of ethnicity in EHR is imperfect, there is no robust evidence on the accuracy between the ethnicity information recorded in various real-world sources and census data.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Methods and findings</title><p>We linked primary and secondary care NHS England data sources with Census 2021 data and compared individual-level agreement of ethnicity recording in General Practice Extraction Service (GPES) Data for Pandemic Planning and Research (GDPPR), Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), Ethnic Category Information Asset (ECIA), and Talking Therapies for anxiety and depression (TT) with ethnicity reported in the census. Census ethnicity is self-reported and, therefore, regarded as the most reliable population-level source of ethnicity recording. We further assessed the impact of multiple approaches to assigning a person an ethnic category. The number of people that could be linked to census from ECIA, GDPPR, HES, and TT were 47.4m, 43.5m, 47.8m, and 6.3m, respectively. Across all 4 data sources, the White British category had the highest level of agreement with census (&#x02265;96%), followed by the Bangladeshi category (&#x02265;93%). Levels of agreement for Pakistani, Indian, and Chinese categories were &#x02265;87%, &#x02265;83%, and &#x02265;80% across all sources. Agreement was lower for Mixed (&#x02264;75%) and Other (&#x02264;71%) categories across all data sources.

There is limited research investigating the quality of the recording of ethnicity across different health administrative data sources and in the limited available, it indicates that missingness is relatively high and consistency across sources varies. If ethnicity data across different health administrative data sources is inconsistent or misclassified, analyses based on different data sources may therefore lead to inconsistent and biased estimates, which could create confused messaging and flawed policy formation.</p></list-item></list></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>What did the researchers do and find?</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>This study applied and compared multiple approaches to assigning an ethnic category from episode-level records in several health administrative data sources and compared the individual-level assigned ethnic category with that collected in Census 2021, a source considered to contain high-quality ethnicity data for the whole population of England. The health administrative data sources compared to Census 2021 were: General Practice Extraction Service (GPES) Data for Pandemic Planning and Research (GDPPR); Hospital Episode Statistics (HES); NHS England&#x02019;s (NHSE) Ethnic Category Information Asset (ECIA); and NHSEs Talking Therapies, for anxiety and depression (TT). The number of people that could be linked to census from ECIA, GDPPR, HES, and TT were 47.4m, 43.5m, 47.8m, and 6.3m, respectively.

Study limitations include: the exclusion of individuals who did not take part in the census; linkage rates vary between ethnic groups; and the lack of information available on the context where and how the ethnicity information was collected within the health administrative data sources.</p></list-item></list></sec></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source>

Electronic health records (EHRs) can be defined as the systematic collection of patients health information stored in a digital format. EHRs contain information including but not limited to demographic, diagnosis, and medication information for patients and are designed to be accessed and shared across healthcare settings, with the data being collected from primary, secondary, and other healthcare settings when a patient has interacted with the healthcare service. The recording of ethnicity in healthcare environments vary. Primary care recording varies, with most collecting self-report at registration, but an individual can ignore the question without penalty [<xref rid="pmed.1004507.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Further, in both primary and secondary care environments, ethnicity can be recorded by clinicians or administrative staff with some assumptions, with data often carried forward from previous records that were also assumed [<xref rid="pmed.1004507.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. EHRs have increasingly been used to publish statistics and analysis on ethnic health inequalities. This was apparent during the COVID-19 pandemic, when people from minority ethnic groups were found to be at higher COVID-19 mortality risk [<xref rid="pmed.1004507.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pmed.1004507.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The limited research on the quality of the recording of ethnicity across different EHRs indicates that missingness is relatively high and consistency across sources varies [<xref rid="pmed.1004507.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pmed.1004507.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Analyses based on different data sources may, therefore, lead to inconsistent and biased estimates, which could create confused messaging and flawed policy formation.</p><p>This study builds upon previous work examining ethnicity coding between health administrative data sources [<xref rid="pmed.1004507.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1004507.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1004507.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pmed.1004507.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. These previous studies highlight issues with the quality of ethnicity information collected within the National Health Service (NHS). These quality issues are set in the context that health administrative data are increasingly being used to produce statistics and research. However, statistical analysis was not the initial purpose of health administrative data sets and is not their primary function. Health administrative data can be used for statistical analysis successfully, but to do so there is a need to understand their limitations. Furthermore, there is a lack of evidence assessing the quality of ethnicity data within primary care records in England to a &#x0201c;gold standard&#x0201d; comparator, using patient-level records. However, previous evidence has compared the aggregated ethnic breakdown between 2011 Census and Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) data [<xref rid="pmed.1004507.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1004507.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], with the studies reporting that the ethnic breakdown between 2011 Census and CPRD were broadly similar. Further analysis examining the agreement between CPRD and HES using 5-category ethnic groups [<xref rid="pmed.1004507.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and analysis examing the quality of ethnicity coding in Scottish health records compared with the 2011 Scottish Census has also been undertaken [<xref rid="pmed.1004507.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>The aims of this study are to apply and compare multiple approaches to assigning an ethnic category from episode-level records in several health administrative data sources and compare the individual-level assigned ethnic category with that collected in Census 2021, a source considered to contain high-quality ethnicity data for the whole population of England [<xref rid="pmed.1004507.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The data is noted to be high quality because we can generally be confident the ethnicity data in census are self-reported and engagement is mandatory [<xref rid="pmed.1004507.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. It is noted however that self-reported ethnicity and mandatory engagement may not always guarantee high-quality ethnicity data. Whereas, there is less certainty that ethnicity recordings within primary and hospital healthcare environments are self-reported [<xref rid="pmed.1004507.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec008"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec009"><title>Data sources and study population</title><p>This analysis compared the anonymised individual-level recorded ethnicity of patients in England in 4 health administrative data sources with their recorded self-assigned ethnicity in Census 2021.

Census 2021 includes 19 ethnic categories, including a newly implemented Roma category; GDPPR and ECIA both have 18 ethnic categories (GDPPR and ECIA categories are based on the 2011 Census) [<xref rid="pmed.1004507.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. By contrast, TT and HES data only contain 16 ethnic categories [<xref rid="pmed.1004507.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]; they do not include &#x0201c;White: Gypsy or Irish Traveller&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;Other ethnic group: Arab&#x0201d; categories. The HES categories were updated in April 2001 to represent the ethnic categories as defined in the 2001 Census. In the 2011 Census, the Chinese ethnic category moved from the &#x0201c;Other&#x0201d; ethnic category to the &#x0201c;Asian&#x0201d; ethnic category, and new groups for &#x0201c;Gypsy or Irish Traveller&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;Arab&#x0201d; were added [<xref rid="pmed.1004507.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In all health administrative data sources, the Chinese ethnic category is still within the &#x0201c;Other&#x0201d; ethnic group.

Within these data sources, some individuals have multiple recorded ethnicities within the same data source at different episodes: A set of rules was therefore implemented to select a single ethnicity per person for comparison with Census 2021. In contrast, the ECIA contains a single ethnicity per person, based on the most recent ethnicity recorded in either GDPPR or HES. Full details of the methodology used to determine this have been published by NHSE [<xref rid="pmed.1004507.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>We applied 2 methods to derive an individual&#x02019;s ethnicity within GDPPR, HES, and TT sources: the most common (modal) and most recent (recency) ethnicity recorded for each person.</p><p>For GDPPR data, we derived the most recent ethnicity recording by taking it from either the GP-Journal (SNOMED codes) or GP-Patient (ETHNIC column) tables; priority was given to the GP-Journal table recording in instances of conflict in recoding on the same most recent date between sources. Priority was given to the GP-Journal table because the data is more granular and because of previous NHSE methodology [<xref rid="pmed.1004507.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Where conflicts on the same most recent date within the same table persisted (i.e., GP-Journal or GP-Patient tables), the ethnicity recording was classified as &#x0201c;Unresolved.&#x0201d;</p><p>To derive the most common ethnicity recording within GDPPR, we firstly determined the most frequently recorded ethnicity within the GP-Journal table. All ethnicity SNOMED codes for a person were identified and then the most frequently recorded ethnic category was identified. SNOMED codes are the clinical coding standards used with GP records [<xref rid="pmed.1004507.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Where a person did not have an ethnicity recording in the GP-Journal table (i.e., had no available SNOMED codes providing ethnicity information), we calculated the most frequently recorded ethnicity within the GP-Patient table (i.e., NHSE 18-category ethnicity codes). If a person had 2 or more most frequently recorded ethnicities, their ethnicity recording was marked as &#x0201c;Unresolved.&#x0201d;</p><p>For HES data, if there were multiple ethnicities recorded on the same most recent date for the recency definition, the records were prioritised according to the sub-data set for HES: in order HES-APC, HES-A&#x00026;E/ECDS, HES-OP [<xref rid="pmed.1004507.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. If conflicts still existed on the same date within the same sub-data set, the ethnicity was classified as &#x0201c;Unresolved.&#x0201d; For the modal definition in HES, no priority was applied and the most frequently selected ethnic category was selected across all sub-data sets. If a person had 2 or more most frequently recorded ethnicities, their ethnicity recording was marked as &#x0201c;Unresolved.&#x0201d;</p><p>Because of the way the extract of TT data available to us was structured and processed, no modal definition was possible. Our extract of TT data was pre-processed and assigns the most recent ethnicity recording per year and per supplier. To derive the most recent ethnicity recording within TT, we selected the most recent ethnicity recording from the most recent supplier in the most recent year available. If there were 2 or more different ethnicity recordings on the same most recent date, they were classified as &#x0201c;Unresolved.&#x0201d; The categories Data Not Recorded and Value Outside of National Code were treated like the Not Known category.</p></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>Reallocating ethnicity records</title><p>Once a single ethnicity recording was derived for each person in GDPPR, HES, and TT using recency and modal methododologies, a further set of reallocation rules were implemented, whereby certain ethnic categories were reallocated if alternative ethnic categories were available within their records, even if these records were older or less frequent. Reallocation was applied if a person&#x02019;s most recent or frequent ethnic category was Not Known, Not Stated, or Any Other Ethnic Group. This was undertaken to test whether reallocating certain ethnic categories improved agreement with Census 2021 data. The Not Known and Not Stated categories were chosen for reallocation because they effectively represent missing entries. Any Other Ethnic Group was reallocated because of evidence suggesting there is likely over-coding of this ethnic group [<xref rid="pmed.1004507.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Where an individual had only one or more recording of the same ethnicity, their ethnicity recording was not reallocated. We applied the reallocation methodologies within the entire time series of data up to 29 January 2022 for GDPPR, HES, and TT data sources. The order of the ethnic categories that were sequentially reallocated was:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Not Known</p></list-item><list-item><p>Not Known; Any Other Ethnic Group*</p></list-item><list-item><p>Not Known; Any Other Ethnic Group; Not Stated**</p></list-item></list><p>* Where a person only had Not Known and Any Other Ethnic Group categories recorded, Any Other Ethnic Group was given priority and chosen as the reallocation destination.</p><p>** Where a person only had Not Known and/or Not Stated and Any Other Ethnic Group categories recorded, Any Other Ethnic Group was given priority and chosen as the reallocation destination.</p></sec><sec id="sec014"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>To explore the consistency of ethnicity information across data sources, we produced 18- and 5-category ethnic category crosstabulations of Census 2021 with each health administrative data source. This enabled the examination of the distribution between each ethnic category assigned in ECIA, GDPPR, HES, and TT sources, and the ethnic category an individual was assigned in Census 2021, as counts and proportions. Statistical disclosure control rules were applied to protect personal information: all values in crosstabulations were suppressed for counts less than 10. Counts of 10 or above were rounded to the nearest 5. Percentage agreement was calculated using rounded and suppressed values.</p><p>To summarise the information contained in the crosstabulations, we presented the agreement for each health data source compared with Census 2021. Overall agreement between each respective data source with census and individual agreement per ethnic group within source were calculated. For each person, the ethnic category recorded in census and each respective data source were compared and classified as: 1, if the recorded ethnicities were the same; 0, if they were different. Where the ethnic categories used in the health administrative sources data did not exactly match with the Census 2021 categories, ethnic categories were matched with the most aligned Census 2021 ethnicity category (<bold><xref rid="pmed.1004507.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Table</xref></bold>). Only those with a stated ethnicity category in both data sources were included in the agreement calculations; the Not Stated, Not Known, and Unresolved categories were not included in agreement calculations because these categories or equivalent categories were not available within Census 2021. Arab and Traveller ethnic categories are not available within HES and TT, and therefore no agreement was calculated for these categories in HES and TT. The statistical codes used to derive ethnicity are publicly available on GitHub (ONS-Health-modelling-hub). We provide worked examples of the agreement calculation in our corresponding ONS release [<xref rid="pmed.1004507.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>We also calculated sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV) for all comparisons in line with previous validation studies; sensitivity gave the percentage of individuals with a particular ethnicity recording in Census 2021 who had a corresponding recording in each health administrative data source, while PPV gave the percentage of individuals with a particular ethnicity recording in each health administrative data source who had a corresponding ethnicity recording in the Census 2021 [<xref rid="pmed.1004507.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1004507.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>We conducted 2 sensitivity analyses where we restricted the back series of ethnicity data to 1 April 2015 (aligning to the first date within our extract of ECIA) and restricted the population to only those who had a stated ethnic category in each of the GDPPR, HES, and Census 2021 datasets. We did this to assess the extent to which agreement was affected by differences in coverage and populations between GDPPR and HES.</p><p>This study is reported as per the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guideline (<bold><xref rid="pmed.1004507.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 STROBE Checklist</xref></bold>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec015"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec016"><title>Ethnicity breakdown per data source</title><p>The number of people included who were linked to Census 2021 from ECIA, GDPPR, HES, and TT were 47.4, 43.5, 47.8, and 6.3 million, respectively (<bold><xref rid="pmed.1004507.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref></bold>).

The percentage of people with a Not Stated or Not Known category differed across data sources: GDPPR had the lowest percentage of people assigned the Not Stated category (modal: 2.2%; recency: 2.6%), with a neglible number of people assigned a Not Known category.

The percentage of people assigned a Not Stated or Not Known category in TT was 5.7% and 7.6%, respectively. TT also had Data Not Recorded and Value Outside of National Code categories, which totalled 1.4% of people within TT being assigned these categories.

Across all comparisons with self-reported, Census 2021 ethnicity, we found that the level of concordance in the 18-category ethnicity recording is highly variable between ethnic groups, with particularly high levels of discordance found for White: Gypsy or Irish Traveller (not available in HES or TT), White Irish, all Mixed (Other Mixed; White and Black African; White and Asian; White and Black Caribbean) and all Other (Any Other Ethnic Group; Other Black; Other Mixed; Other Asian; Other White) ethnic categories. The highest levels of agreement across all data sources were found in the White British ethnic category, followed by South Asian (Bangladeshi, Pakistani, and Indian) and Chinese ethnic categories. We also found that, while patterns of agreement were generally found to be similar across all data sources, for most ethnic groups, agreement was lower in HES and higher in GDPPR and TT.</p><sec id="sec022"><title>In context of the literature</title><p>Our results are similar to another population-level analysis that investigated agreement between the 5-category ethnic groups in 2011 Census and HES 2009&#x02013;2011 [<xref rid="pmed.1004507.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]: the results from this analysis evidenced that the White ethnic group had the highest level of agreement between the sources (98.7%), with levels of agreement in Asian and Black ethnic groups at 87.9% and 84.7%, respectively. The lowest levels of agreement were found in the Mixed (36.9%) and Other (27.5%) ethnic groups [<xref rid="pmed.1004507.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. While our study reports the same pattern of agreement for Census 2021 and HES (recency and modal) in the 5-category ethnic categories, we report different levels of agreement which were lower for the Other ethnic category and higher for the Black and Mixed categories. This may be due to the different time period used in our analysis for HES data and our updated census data. For example, it was found that Mixed and Other ethnic groups were more likely to change their ethnic category over time than White, Black, and Asian ethnic groups between 2001 and 2011 [<xref rid="pmed.1004507.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Therefore, similar patterns may have followed between 2011 and 2021, which may partially explain some differences seen in our results. Further, there have been drives to improve ethnicity coding in HES since 2011 [<xref rid="pmed.1004507.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], which may further explain this difference. Our results further align with previous research that investigated the accuracy of ethnicity coding between HES and the English Cancer Patient Experience survey [<xref rid="pmed.1004507.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Results from this study highlighted that the probability of concordant classication with the census data was highest in White ethnic groups, followed by high levels of agreement in Bangladeshi, Indian, Pakistani, Chinese, Black African, and Black Caribbean individuals [<xref rid="pmed.1004507.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Mixed and Other ethnic groups reported similarly low agreement in the aforementioned study compared with our own. In addition, our findings align with a similar population-level analysis which examined the quality of ethnicity coding within Scottish health records, with misclassification of ethnic categories being higher in all ethnic minority groups compared with the White Scottish category, particularly Other and Gypsy or Irish Traveller categories [<xref rid="pmed.1004507.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Our results also broadly align with previous studies from US data which [<xref rid="pmed.1004507.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1004507.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], while not directly comparable due to the differing healthcare systems and how ethnicity may be interpreted between countries, found that levels of agreement were higher in White individuals compared with individuals from a minority ethnic group [<xref rid="pmed.1004507.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1004507.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The higher misclassification of ethnic category in ethnic minority groups is likely down to a multitude of reasons and is not well understood. A suggested reason for higher misclassification within certain ethnic groups is the lack of standardisation of data collection processes across multiple healthcare settings and systems [<xref rid="pmed.1004507.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1004507.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><p>Our study also found that levels of agreement with Census 2021 were generally similar across all data sources for each ethnic category. However, HES did report lower levels of agreement than ECIA and particularly GDPPR and TT across most ethnic categories. This may be explained by a previous study which highlighted that HES outpatients and A&#x00026;E data sets have poor consistency of ethnicity coding [<xref rid="pmed.1004507.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1004507.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Furthermore, our data showed that HES has high levels of coding for Not Known and Not Stated categories compared with other health administrative data sources. However, even in analysis where we reallocated Not Known and Not Stated categories, HES still had lower agreement with census than other data sources. Interestingly, while the ECIA is an amalgamation of HES and GDPPR ethnicity data to improve coverage for the entire English population [<xref rid="pmed.1004507.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], our findings report that the agreement with census is similar or worse compared with using GDPPR individually. This may be expected because GDPPR data has higher agreement than HES and therefore, using HES data to fill in gaps in GDPPR data would result in lower agreement (though having higher coverage). This is an important finding given that the ECIA is the most complete source of ethnicity information covering the whole population available to NHSE for ethnicity analyses.</p></sec><sec id="sec023"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>This study took advantage of a unique opportunity to explore linked Census 2021 data with multiple routinely collected NHSE data sources. This was the first time ethnicity data from GP and ECIA sources have been linked to census at person-level to assess the accuracy of ethnicity recording in these data sources. Further, a high proportion of census records were able to be linked to an NHS number (95.75%), which allowed for a large number of individuals to be included in the analysis and provide a representative sample of the population of England. The novelty of this analysis was being able to use Census 2021 as a gold standard for ethnicity data because of its self-reported nature. Although self-reported ethnicity may be prone to certain biases [<xref rid="pmed.1004507.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1004507.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], it is generally considered one of the most robust methods to collect ethnicity information [<xref rid="pmed.1004507.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Self-reported ethnicity may change with time and age [<xref rid="pmed.1004507.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1004507.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. However, the impact of this on our analysis is limited because of Census 2021 data being the most up to date ethnicity data available for the entire population of England at the time of analysis. Further, we were able to identify individuals with imputed census ethnicity and remove them from the analysis.</p><p>This study does have some limitations, however. An important limitation of this work is, because all individuals within our analysis had to have a stated ethnicity recorded in the Census 2021, it excluded people who did not take part in the census (estimated to be 3% of the population), recent migrants, and people who could not be linked to the NHS PDS, which may affect representativeness of the population used. However, our data set included 90.8% of the population living in England on Census Day. In addition, a limitation of the linkage approach used is that linkage rates vary between ethnic groups [<xref rid="pmed.1004507.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1004507.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. However, this methodology does result in a linked population with a high coverage of England that is implemented in many other ONS publications. Linkage between sources may also sometimes be imperfect and result in false positive linkage. Further, the demographic characteristics of the populations across the linked data sources may vary, which could explain some of the observed differences in agreement. Further, it is noted that some ethnicity responses in the census data may be provided by a proxy, for example, a parent on behalf of a child who cannot respond for themselves. Proxy reporting does not only affect census data as the health data sources are likely to also contain some proxy responses affecting the comparisons. In addition, it has been reported that ethnic category is sometimes recorded by NHS staff without asking the patient or there is a reluctance from staff to ask about ethnicity within healthcare environments [<xref rid="pmed.1004507.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The context in which ethnicity information was collected is not available within EHRs and therefore, identifying whether a record is truly self-reported or completed by healthcare staff is not possible to assess. Therefore, understanding potential differences in how people self-identify versus how they present to others is not possible in the available data.</p></sec><sec id="sec024"><title>Implications for policymakers and researchers</title><p>There is discrepancy in how major national (quasi)regulatory agencies handle ethnicity data, for example, NHSE currently use the most recent ethnicity an individual has recorded to determine their ethnicity [<xref rid="pmed.1004507.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], while the Office for Health Improvement and Disparities (OHID) use modal [<xref rid="pmed.1004507.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Our study illustrates that the impact of applying different reallocation methodologies to assign an ethnic category had little impact on agreement with census per ethnic group.</p><p>However, applying reallocation methodologies versus not applying them increased the coverage of people assigned a stated ethnic category (i.e., not a recording of Not Known or Not Stated). This increase in coverage was particularly high in HES, with the most reallocated iteration increasing the number of people with a stated ethnic category by 6.5m (recency) and 6.7m (modal), respectively. Previous work has investigated the impact of reallocating ethnic categories to account for Not Known recordings and an over-coding of Any Other Ethnic Group [<xref rid="pmed.1004507.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] and found that applying reallocation methodologies will increase coverage but marginally reduce accuracy for some ethnic categories.</p><p>As such, the results presented here, in combination with previous research, confirm that using the most recent or most frequent approach to assigning ethnic categories both provide suitable options for deriving ethnic group data.</p><p>In a broader context, if some individuals&#x02019; ethnicity data is not being recorded accurately within health administrative data sources, it may have implications for healthcare planning and resource allocation. If individuals&#x02019; ethnicity data is being misclassified on a population scale, it may lead to under- or overestimation of health outcomes or conditions in certain ethnic groups, and potentially misrepresent the true pattern and quantity across ethnic groups. Previous research has found that the misclassification of ethnicity within Scottish records concealed the high-risk of severe COVID-19 among the Gypsy and Irish Traveller ethnic group, and the under- and overestimation of risk in other ethnic groups [<xref rid="pmed.1004507.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. This misclassification may have knock on effects in healthcare planning, public health and healthcare resource allocation, and health policy formation, as well as the monitoring of ethnic health inequalities. It may lead to the continuation or exacerbation of ethnic health inequalities in certain ethnic groups.</p><p>Furthermore, our findings provide ground for other analysts to replicate our methods for wider use and further develop improvements. While this analysis is based on English data, the understanding and methodologies can be applied to other data sources and data from across the UK. Greater understanding of ethnicity coding and its limitations may lead to developing methods and consensus for analysts on how to best use ethnicity data for health and administrative analysis and statistics, ultimately leading to improvements in analyses and statistics which inform policies that aim to reduce ethnic health inequalities in England. This is particularly timely given healthcare providers and the UK Government commitment to reducing ethnic health disparities [<xref rid="pmed.1004507.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1004507.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. It is acknowledged that improving the quality of ethnicity data in administrative health data sources is a multifaceted problem. It likely requires a coordinated approach from many different organisations, and includes targeting a standardised definition on the term ethnicity, and standardising the methods that ethnicity data is collected, recorded, and processed. The standardisation of these factors would likely improve people&#x02019;s understanding and the quality of ethnicity data.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec025"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This population-level study of residents in England demonstrates that certain ethnic categories across multiple health administrative data sources have high discordance with Census 2021 ethnic categories. Agreement in groups of individuals with Mixed and Other ethnic categories were consistently found to be lower across all health data sources, with individuals who were classified as Gypsy or Irish Traveller also reporting particularly low levels of agreement with census. However, it must be acknowledged these health administrative data sources have been used to good effect to date, ethnicity coding quality issues notwithstanding. Not least evidenced than during the pandemic. They should be continued to be utilised to investigate ethnic inequalities in health and access, while simultaneously improving the data quality. This study demonstrates the value of data linkage by reporting the completeness and accuracy of ethnicity recordings across data sources. Future studies should determine the difference in health outcomes in those with discordant ethnicity recording between different data sets, the sociodemographic characteristics of those who have discordant (with census) or missing ethnicity data, and how ethnicity data may change longitudinally.</p><sec id="sec026"><title>Ethics approval and consent to participate</title><p>Ethical approval was obtained from the National Statistician&#x02019;s Data Ethics Advisory Committee (NSDEC(20)12).
