This systematic review aimed to evaluate the content and delivery of clinical knowledge in orthodontic postgraduate programs and their reported impact on trainee competence. The review followed PRISMA 2020 guidelines and a pre-specified protocol. A comprehensive search was conducted across PubMed, Cochrane Library, ERIC, and CINAHL for studies published between January 2000 and December 2024. Gray literature and reference lists were also screened. Eligible studies included randomized controlled trials, cohort studies, and cross-sectional studies involving postgraduate orthodontic students or educators, with interventions related to instructional strategies or clinical knowledge delivery. Qualitative studies and those focused solely on undergraduate or continuing education were excluded. Following duplicate removal, 104 records were screened, and 30 studies met the inclusion criteria after full-text assessment. Study selection and data extraction were performed independently by two reviewers, with discrepancies resolved by a third. Risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle&#x02013;Ottawa Scale, and quality of evidence was evaluated using the GRADE framework. Due to heterogeneity in study design and outcome measures, a narrative synthesis was conducted. Instructional strategies included didactic lectures, problem-based learning, scenario-based simulations, digital learning platforms, and structured assessments such as Mini-CEX and OSCE. Feedback-oriented and interactive methods were consistently associated with improvements in clinical reasoning, procedural skills, and learner confidence. However, substantial variability existed in assessment formats and feedback implementation across institutions. Newcastle&#x02013;Ottawa scores indicated generally strong selection and outcome measurement, though comparability was often limited. GRADE assessments showed most studies were of moderate quality due to inconsistency or imprecision. These findings highlight the need for harmonized, evidence-based frameworks to guide the delivery and assessment of clinical knowledge in orthodontic postgraduate education, while allowing for flexibility based on institutional context. Efforts to standardize assessment strategies and integrate technology-enhanced learning may support improved competence development across diverse programs.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Orthodontic postgraduate education</kwd><kwd>Clinical knowledge</kwd><kwd>Teaching methods</kwd><kwd>Educational content</kwd><kwd>Clinical competence</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>University of Szeged</institution></funding-source></award-group><open-access><p>Open access funding provided by University of Szeged.</p></open-access></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Postgraduate orthodontic education is a complex and varied field, shaped by regional standards, institutional philosophies, and the evolving landscape of dental technologies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. These programs typically consist of a combination of theoretical instruction, clinical practice, research, and continuous assessment aimed at developing both foundational knowledge and advanced clinical skills [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. However, the standards and methods employed in orthodontic training are not universally consistent; they often reflect the regulatory frameworks and professional expectations of different countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. For example, some regions require a higher number of clinical hours and diverse patient cases, while others might prioritize research and academic achievement. This variability may lead to differences in clinical competence and readiness among graduates, highlighting the need for harmonized educational standards that ensure all orthodontists are adequately prepared, regardless of where they train. Therefore, this systematic literature review aimed to answer the question: How is clinical knowledge in orthodontic postgraduate programs delivered, and how does this impact the clinical competence and patient outcomes of orthodontic practitioners? Understanding how clinical knowledge is delivered as well as its results are essential for evaluating the impact of educational practices on clinical competence and patient outcomes, as it underscores the broader implications of how clinical knowledge is structured and delivered in orthodontic postgraduate programs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par3">This systematic review followed a pre-specified methodology to ensure rigor in study selection, data extraction, and analysis. A protocol was submitted to PROSPERO but was not accepted due to the absence of a defined health intervention. No deviations from the original study design occurred. The eligibility criteria for this review were guided by the PICOT framework to ensure a structured and systematic approach to study selection. The population of interest comprised postgraduate orthodontic students and educators, with interventions encompassing didactic lectures, simulation-based training, digital learning platforms, mentorship programs, competency-based assessments, and hybrid learning models. Comparisons were made between traditional instructional methods and alternative or emerging educational approaches. The primary outcomes assessed included measures of clinical competence, knowledge retention, and skill development. To ensure the findings reflected current pedagogical practices, the review was restricted to studies published between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2024.</p><p id="Par4">Research focusing exclusively on undergraduate orthodontic programs, other dental specialties, or continuing education courses for practicing clinicians was excluded. Articles not available in English were also excluded to maintain consistency in data extraction and interpretation. The inclusion of randomized controlled trials (RCTs), cohort studies, and cross-sectional studies allowed for the evaluation of educational interventions using measurable clinical outcomes. Studies incorporating qualitative methodologies were excluded because they did not provide standardized, comparable measures of clinical competence. Although this review primarily examined educational interventions rather than direct patient outcomes, the selected studies evaluated their impact on clinical competence, skill acquisition, and decision-making. These competencies are critical components of patient care, as postgraduate orthodontic education is structured to ensure that residents develop the necessary skills to perform evidence-based treatments safely and effectively.</p><p id="Par5">A comprehensive literature search was conducted across PubMed, Cochrane Library, ERIC, and CINAHL. The search strategy was developed using Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms and Boolean operators to refine results and ensure comprehensive retrieval of relevant studies. Search terms included"orthodontic postgraduate education"AND"clinical competence","teaching strategies"AND"skill development", and"educational interventions"AND"orthodontic training", applied systematically across all databases. Reference lists of included studies were manually reviewed to identify additional relevant literature. To broaden the scope of the review, gray literature sources such as conference proceedings, institutional reports, and government publications were screened for relevant studies not indexed in peer-reviewed databases. The final search was executed on September 24, 2024.</p><p id="Par6">Study selection was performed independently by two reviewers (MB and KK), who screened titles and abstracts against predefined eligibility criteria. Full-text assessments were conducted independently by two reviewers, and discrepancies were resolved through discussion or, when necessary, consultation with a third reviewer (ZB). Data were extracted using a standardized form to ensure consistency, capturing study characteristics such as research design, descriptions of educational interventions, assessment methods, and primary clinical and educational outcomes. Extracted data were cross-checked between reviewers before final synthesis to ensure accuracy and reliability.</p><p id="Par7">The risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle&#x02013;Ottawa Scale (NOS) for observational studies, evaluating factors such as participant selection, comparability of study groups, and outcome assessment methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. To evaluate the overall quality of evidence, the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework was applied, assessing methodological limitations, consistency of findings, precision of outcome measures, and confidence in effect estimates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. These assessments were incorporated into the interpretation of findings to ensure that results account for study limitations.</p><p id="Par8">A narrative synthesis was conducted to identify key themes and methodological trends across the included studies. Given the heterogeneity in study designs, sample sizes, and outcome measures, a meta-analysis was not feasible. Results were analyzed based on teaching methodologies, geographic variation, and assessment strategies, with an emphasis on recognizing the influence of institutional and regional differences on postgraduate training approaches.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Results</title><p id="Par9">A total of 374 records were identified through database searches. After removing 270 duplicate records, 104 unique records remained for screening. Of these, 39 records were excluded after title and abstract screening due to irrelevance. Sixty-five reports were sought for retrieval. Upon full-text assessment, 35 reports were excluded: 32 due to irrelevance to the study's focus, one due to the lack of full text, and two due to unsuitable methods. A full list of excluded full-text records was not retained; however, reasons for exclusion are summarized by category in accordance with PRISM 2020 guidelines. Ultimately, 30 studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).

Unlike Mini-CEX, which evaluates students in live clinical environments, OSCEs ensure consistency across all trainees, mitigating variability caused by differences in patient cases or instructor expectations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Additionally, structured assessments such as the OSCE have been linked to higher student confidence and motivation, as residents receive immediate, actionable feedback that informs their clinical practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. However, the OSCE's effectiveness is contingent on examiner calibration and case standardization, as variability in scoring can still occur based on case complexity and faculty interpretations.</p><p id="Par16">Despite their benefits, structured assessments like OSCEs present several challenges. Their design and implementation are resource-intensive, requiring faculty training, standardized patient recruitment, and significant administrative support, which can strain educational programs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Furthermore, OSCEs'high-stakes nature can induce anxiety and stress among students, potentially impacting performance, particularly in timed or interactive components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Additionally, while structured assessments provide quantifiable evaluation metrics, their reliance on predefined tasks may limit the assessment of complex clinical reasoning skills, which are better captured in real-time clinical settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par17">Similarly, feedback-oriented learning approaches&#x02014;whether within Mini-CEX or OSCE&#x02014;are critical to skill development but introduce variability based on faculty expertise and feedback delivery.

Various instructional approaches, including structured feedback, standardized assessments, and interactive learning methods, have been shown to improve students'ability to apply theoretical knowledge to clinical practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. However, significant variability exists across orthodontic programs in terms of assessment formats, grading criteria, and feedback mechanisms, which creates inconsistencies in how clinical skills are evaluated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Addressing these inconsistencies through more standardized, competency-based assessment frameworks may improve the reliability of postgraduate training and ensure that students meet defined educational benchmarks before independent practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p id="Par30">Structured assessments have been widely adopted in orthodontic education due to their ability to provide timely, targeted feedback that enhances students'diagnostic reasoning and procedural skills [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Studies indicate that frequent, structured feedback through these methods helps students identify weaknesses and refine their clinical decision-making abilities, making them more confident in their ability to manage complex patient cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. However, inconsistencies in faculty expectations and grading rubrics limit the generalizability of these assessments across different training institutions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Implementing faculty development programs to standardize evaluation methods could improve inter-rater reliability and ensure that students receive consistent, actionable feedback that aligns with clinical practice expectations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par31">Beyond assessment strategies, interactive and digital learning interventions have been increasingly integrated into orthodontic education. Simulation-based learning and case-based discussions allow students to engage with complex patient scenarios in a controlled environment, enhancing their critical thinking and adaptability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Additionally, digital learning tools, including virtual reality simulations and self-assessment modules, have been reported to increase engagement and improve knowledge retention, particularly when used in combination with traditional instructional methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. While these tools have demonstrated clear benefits, their effectiveness is heavily dependent on proper instructional design and faculty guidance, ensuring that they supplement rather than replace hands-on clinical experience [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par32">A major challenge in orthodontic postgraduate education is the disparity in educational resources and assessment implementation across programs.

Continuous improvement in evaluation strategies, faculty training, and resource allocation will help ensure that postgraduate orthodontic programs equip residents with the necessary skills to provide high-quality patient care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Recommendations and future research</title><p id="Par34">To enhance the consistency and effectiveness of orthodontic postgraduate education, programs should adopt standardized, competency-based frameworks that align instructional content and assessment strategies with clearly defined clinical outcomes. Studies included in this review highlighted that structured assessments such as OSCEs and Mini-CEX are widely used to evaluate procedural skills, diagnostic reasoning, and communication competencies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. However, inconsistent grading criteria and uncalibrated feedback practices across institutions undermine the reliability of these tools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. To address this, institutions should invest in faculty development programs that focus on assessment calibration, feedback delivery, and the use of validated evaluation instruments. Evidence suggests that regular faculty training can improve inter-rater reliability and ensure a more consistent and supportive learning environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p id="Par35">In addition, curriculum design should integrate interactive learning approaches&#x02014;such as PBL, SBL, and digital simulation modules&#x02014;that promote self-directed learning, critical thinking, and diagnostic accuracy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].

Given the increasing role of technology in orthodontic training, virtual learning environments and distance education modules have been reported to enhance knowledge retention and flexibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. However, their effectiveness depends on instructional design and faculty facilitation, as unstructured or poorly supported implementations may limit student motivation and interaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. These digital tools should complement, not replace, hands-on clinical training.</p><p id="Par36">Efforts to standardize curricula must also account for disparities in institutional resources and infrastructure.

By including studies from multiple geographic regions, this review enhances external validity, providing insights into how differences in educational standards influence clinical training and patient outcomes. The use of robust assessment tools, including the NOS for study quality and the GRADE approach for evaluating evidence strength, further reinforces the reliability of findings. High NOS scores in selection and outcome domains indicate that most included studies had well-defined sample groups and reliable outcome measures, contributing to the overall strength of this review.</p><p id="Par39">However, several limitations must be acknowledged. The variability in study design and methodological quality reduces the ability to draw definitive conclusions about the impact of specific educational interventions on clinical competence. Lower comparability scores on the NOS indicate gaps in controlling for confounding factors, which affects internal validity. Furthermore, the GRADE assessments frequently classified evidence quality as moderate, reflecting concerns related to bias, inconsistency, and imprecision, underscoring the need for more rigorous study designs with standardized outcome measurements. The interpretation of findings was further influenced by the risk of bias across studies, as assessed through the NOS and GRADE frameworks. While most studies demonstrated strong selection criteria, inconsistencies in study design and assessment tools suggest that some conclusions should be interpreted with caution, particularly where outcome measures lacked precision.</p><p id="Par40">Another limitation lies in the inconsistent definition and measurement of clinical competence across the included studies. While some used structured assessments such as OSCEs and Mini-CEX to evaluate procedural skill, communication, and diagnostic accuracy, others relied on self-report measures or academic performance. A few studies included broader definitions involving clinical judgment or integration of knowledge into practice. This lack of standardization complicates the synthesis of findings and limits the ability to draw direct comparisons across programs. Establishing shared definitions and validated measurement tools is essential for improving the comparability and generalizability of future research in this area.</p><p id="Par41">The findings of this review must be interpreted in the context of substantial heterogeneity among the included studies. Differences in study design, assessment formats, institutional resources, and educational frameworks limited the ability to make direct comparisons or to conduct meta-analytic synthesis. While this diversity reflects the real-world complexity of postgraduate orthodontic education, it also constrains the generalizability of specific instructional or assessment strategies. For example, a given teaching intervention may yield positive outcomes in one setting but may not be replicable in another due to differences in faculty expertise, student demographics, or institutional infrastructure. Moreover, inconsistencies in reporting outcome measures and feedback protocols further complicate the ability to draw unified conclusions about educational effectiveness. Acknowledging this variability is essential for understanding the nuanced and context-dependent nature of clinical education, and for encouraging adaptable, rather than prescriptive, curriculum development.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par42">This systematic review examined how clinical knowledge is delivered in orthodontic postgraduate programs and how instructional strategies relate to the development of clinical competence. Across diverse contexts, structured assessment methods, interactive learning approaches, and technology-enhanced instruction were frequently associated with improved clinical performance and decision-making. However, variability in implementation, assessment formats, and faculty training contributed to inconsistent outcomes. These findings suggested that postgraduate orthodontic programs may benefit from adopting adaptable, evidence-based teaching models that support clinical skill development while accommodating institutional differences in resources and structure.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#x02019;s Note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>None.</p></ack><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>M.B. conceptualized the study and was also in charge of data curation, formal analysis, investigation, methodology, writing&#x02014;original draft preparation, and writing&#x02014;review and editing.
