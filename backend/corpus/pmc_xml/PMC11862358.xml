The revised manuscript responds well to reviewers&#x02019; observations and concerns of the previous version. We have carefully reframed the title, built a strong background and clearly stated the problem and aims of the pilot. Additionally, we have detailed and clarified the methodology of the pilot, changed the approach to presentation of results, and have strengthened the discussion based on the results. Provides useful detail and clarity. We have included new definitions, clarified the different consenting methods and how the pilot sub-study relates to the main study. We have also clarified on the methods, how data was handled, the usefulness of the pilot, strengths, and limitations of the pilot. Easy to read and follow, and interesting. The new version is an improved narrative and unpicks difficulties and complexity of the previous write-up. We have provided adequate and necessary detail. Strikes the right context of the paper. In the new version of the manuscript, we have deliberately emphasised that the pilot was conducted in the first pneumococcal vaccine trial using a human infection model in Malawi; a low- income setting. We have clarified the pilot is feasible and useful in a human infection study in Malawi; but the methods can be transferable, and the experience, observations made, and considerations proposed can be applicable to other low-income settings in Africa. Good finishing off, proposes considerations and future steps. This new version concludes with a good synthesis of the pilot, its relevance and proposes next steps for future similar studies.</p></sec></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Informed consent; an integral part of the ethical conduct of any study, is a process that involves explaining to a patient or study participant the risks, benefits or alternatives of a procedure or clinical research in a format and language that is comprehensible, in order to ensure voluntary participation
<sup>
<xref rid="ref-1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
</sup>. Obtaining an informed consent from a study participant can be verbal or written. The written consent has two main modalities: the traditional paper-based consenting process followed by a participant signature on a paper-consent form or an electronic consenting process followed by an electronic signature in the consent form (also called an e-consent)
<sup>
<xref rid="ref-2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
</sup>.</p><p>The traditional paper-based consent; despite its usefulness has some challenges including high documentation errors as high as 50%. These errors for example, include incomplete forms due to missing information, wrong spellings, and lack of legibility in some circumstances
<sup>
<xref rid="ref-3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
</sup>. Additionally, paper-based consent requires physical storage which can be challenging and make remote access limited and physical retrieval of consent documents cumbersome, and usually requires physical presence of both the participant and the consenter
<sup>
<xref rid="ref-4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;
<xref rid="ref-6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
</sup>.</p><p>E-consenting can be done physically in the presence of the study participant and the consenter (usually a nurse or clinician in the case of clinical research or medical procedure or any other trained staff), or remotely. This method of consenting uses electronic devices such as mobile phone or tablets containing study information for the potential volunteer, who demonstrates an informed consent by providing an electronic signature or thumbprint. E-consenting therefore provides a versatile alternative to the paper-based consent and can be useful in enhancing the consenting process through audio-visual and interactive components for participants requiring such
<sup>
<xref rid="ref-2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
</sup>. Additionally, e-consenting allows several flexibility advantages: can be time saving especially when done remotely hence cutting time spent on travel, can provide appropriate user-friendly interface, forms can be easily accessible remotely, and mitigates the need for physical storage space
<sup>
<xref rid="ref-6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
</sup>.</p><p>However, e-consenting is not without limitations. These include cost of developing the initial infrastructure and technology to manage and validate electronic consenting documents
<sup>
<xref rid="ref-8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
</sup> including the participant information and e-consent forms, need for a reliable Wi-Fi network for consenting data upload, retrieval and updates, security risks including corrupted or deleted forms, and its usability in limited resource settings
<sup>
<xref rid="ref-8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>
</sup>.</p><p>Although e-consenting has been successfully utilised in different studies and settings, as well as ethical issues explored
<sup>
<xref rid="ref-10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>
</sup>, there is no study that has explored the role of e-consenting in a human infection study conducted in a low-and middle income setting (LMIC). We therefore designed a sub-study to pilot the utility and explore considerations for e-consenting in participants enrolled in an ongoing Controlled Human Infection Study (CHIS) in Malawi, a low-income country.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Ethics consultation and approval</title><p>In October 2021, through the Data Management Support Unit at Malawi-Liverpool Wellcome Programme in Malawi, we engaged the National Health Sciences Research Committee and proposed to test the usability of e-consenting in a human infection study. NHSRC approved the proposal on 29 October 2021, pilot of e-consenting was conducted from 8

<xref rid="ref-11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
</sup>. The main trial, conducted at Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital in Malawi, was approved by NHSRC (protocol 16/07/2519) and was registered in the Pan African Clinical Trials Registry (REF: PACTR202008503507113). The e-consenting pilot aimed at exploring the utility of e-consenting in a Human infection study in Malawi, in a low-income setting.</p></sec><sec><title>Study participants, consenting methods and procedures</title><p>E-consenting pilot recruited all willing participants enrolled in the main trial
<sup>
<xref rid="ref-12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
</sup>. Recruited participants were healthy literate adults aged 18&#x02013;40 years, had no physical disability including audio-visual deficiencies, and had access to a mobile phone. We offered dual consenting (paper-based consenting followed by e-consenting) to all study participants recruited to the pilot.</p><p>Consenting for all participants recruited to the main trial
<sup>
<xref rid="ref-12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
</sup> was physical paper-based consenting. The process had two main steps: firstly, study staff (a nurse or a doctor) providing study information to participants using the participant information leaflet (PIL), and secondly completion of the consent form. The consent form contained two sections:
<italic toggle="yes">1)</italic> a ten-item comprehension checklist (participant wrote initials) to ensure participant understanding and agreement to adequacy of study information and voluntariness of study participation,
<italic toggle="yes">2)</italic> name and signature the participant and study staff, and finally date and participant identification number (PID). Paper based PIL and consent form were filed and stored in locked cabinets within the research room.</p><p>Upon completion of paper-based consenting, all participants were offered e-consenting. This procedure was conducted in the presence of both the participant and the consenter. We allowed a &#x0201c;cooling off&#x0201d; period (approximately 5 minutes) before initiating e-consenting. The process and rationale for e-consenting was explained to study participants
<italic toggle="yes">apriori</italic> including a brief demonstration of how to navigate through the e-consent forms. E-consenting adapted all ethics approved documents from the paper-based consenting. These included scanned PIL and consent forms in PDF format and the ten-item comprehension checklist in ODK format. Of note, because of the timing of the e-consenting, we did not require repetition of providing study information- the PIL was not repeated.</p><p>Study personnel first linked the electronic consent form to a PID by scanning the PID barcode. The form prompted the participant to write their name. We allowed participants to skip the PIL as this discussion had already been done. Next was the consent form containing the ten-item comprehension list. Instead of initialling, the e-consent form prompted participants to select &#x0201c;I agree&#x0201d; by a single tap at the end of each statement to demonstrate comprehension and agreement to the study information, procedures and voluntariness of participation. Using a stylus, both the participant and the study personnel signed the consent form. We exported the consent form to a secure study data server using an internet connection. We printed a copy of the completed e-consent for the study participant.</p><p>We explored several observations in both e-consenting and paper-consenting for comparability. We observed ease of navigating and completing the two consenting methods (e-consent versus paper-based consent), user-friendliness, ease of uploading and retrieving the e-consent including producing print-out copies, as well as reliability of internet connectivity. Additionally, we assessed presence of any documentation errors in both e-consent and paper-based consents based on completeness, accuracy and legibility. We categorised documentation errors into two: writing mistakes (such as inaccurate date, time, spellings, misplaced information, lack of legibility) and missing information (incompleteness). We defined
<italic toggle="yes">error rate</italic> in documentation as number of participant forms, of the total consent forms, with any amount of observed errors. We sought feedback on time taken to complete e-consent and paper-based consent forms (and not time taken for the consenting process as e-consent did not require repetition of going through the PIL) from study staff. Through unstructured interviews with the study staff, we explored pros/cons of e-consenting and paper-based consenting.</p></sec><sec><title>Setting up e-consenting in Open Data Kit (ODK)</title><p>ODK is an open-source suite of tools designed to help users build information services

</sup>. Electronic forms, same as the approved paper-based consenting forms were designed using XLSForm syntax which is an intuitive language. This involved defining the questions or consent statement, response options and other relevant information like signature fields. Once the form was designed, it was converted into XML format using the XLSForm converter tool. The XML files were then uploaded to the ODK server or directly to a mobile device using the mobile app for data collection called ODK collect. Following approval from NHSRC, an identical copy of the NHSRC ethical approval stamp was affixed to the electronic CRF in ODK.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>A total of 109 HIS participants (male 67%, n=73) were recruited in the e-consenting sub-study (

<sup>
<xref rid="ref-12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
</sup>. We showed in this study that e-consenting is feasible in Malawi, a low&#x02013;income setting, and can be used in participants with different literacy levels. All study participants engaged accepted e-consenting and completed both paper-based and e-consents. This observation; 100% participation and completion of e-consenting has been made elsewhere
<sup>
<xref rid="ref-5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
</sup>.</p><p>Furthermore, we observed additional usefulness of e-consenting mainly through massive reduction in documentation errors (zero-identifiable errors), as opposed to the traditional paper-based consenting (43.1% error rate). This observation, much that e-consenting immediately followed paper-based consenting (providing elucidation of the consenting process due to prior-experience/exposure), might have contributed to the observed improvement in errors, is still consistent with lower error rates as low as 1% versus 32% (e-consenting versus paper-based) observed in other studies
<sup>
<xref rid="ref-3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>
</sup>.</p><p>Additionally, e-consenting enhanced ease of form search and retrieval from the database as well as remote access by the investigators. This advantage has shown some utility benefits in studies obtaining remote consenting, eliminating the cost and time-burden of travel for consenting, as well as in situations where face-to-face physical consenting was deemed unsafe and disadvantageous
<sup>
<xref rid="ref-5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
</sup>. Of note, we did not objectively quantify duration of e-consenting versus paper-based consenting. Nevertheless, study staff reported that e-consenting took less time to complete, and form upload to the server was instant. This could increase efficiency by reducing the burden of physical filing especially in settings where keeping a copy of paper-based consent form is optional. Data safety was also enhanced with electronic consenting as consent forms were immediately exported to secure servers. There were no missing forms and no reported or identified breach of participant privacy.</p><p>The strength about this study is that to our knowledge, it is the first study of a large cohort of participants in a low-income setting to explore the usability of e-consenting in a controlled human infection model. Additionally, based on 100% participation rate and successful completion, upload, retrieval and issuance of a physical printed copy of the e-consent form to all study participants approached and recruited to the e-consenting study, not only reaffirms feasibility of e-consenting but also strongly suggests acceptability of the e-consenting process in Malawi. Additionally, at the time of writing this article, the Malawi Ministry of Health did not have guidelines for electronic informed consenting. The pilot therefore provides enthusiasm to further explore participant and staff experiences, considerations for e-consenting including infrastructure set-up, ethical and cultural concerns, as well as participant factors including considerations for the illiterate, and those requiring audio-visual enhancements.</p><p>The study had some limitations. Dual consenting was offered serially to all recruited participants hence the study lacked random allocation of the consenting method which would have otherwise enhanced comparability of outcomes of the two consenting methods. We made several observations surrounding e-consenting but did not explore participants&#x02019; experience and perceptions of e-consenting. Additionally, the pilot was conducted in an urban setting, at a site with access to internet and electricity hence the observation would not apply to studies done in remote areas. Since e-consenting is a new concept in Malawi, the ethics review boards did not have digital stamps thus it was initially difficult to digitize consent forms.</p><p>In conclusion, e-consenting has a utility benefit in research in Malawi, has a role in improving the consenting process and can supplement the traditional paper-based consenting. Success of e-consenting is multifactorial and its adoption requires a consultative and careful consideration.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Malawi Accelerated Research in Vaccines, Experimental Laboratory Systems consortium:

<bold>I have a few more minor comments for the authors:</bold>
</p><p>
<bold>1.&#x000a0;&#x000a0;</bold>&#x000a0;&#x000a0; The rationale for recruiting only literate people should be included in the methods.</p><p>
<bold>2.&#x000a0;</bold>&#x000a0;&#x000a0;&#x000a0; How was the unstructured interview data analysed? Content analysis? Thematic analysis? Were these unstructured interviews guided or were respondents just volunteered information? This has to be clear.</p><p>
<bold>3.&#x000a0;&#x000a0;</bold>&#x000a0;&#x000a0; A part&#x000a0;from College students, who else participated in the study? This information is not included in Table 1.</p><p>
<bold>
<underline>Discussion</underline>
</bold>
</p><p>
<bold>4.&#x000a0;</bold>&#x000a0;&#x000a0;&#x000a0; In paragraph 1 of the discussion, it is stated
<italic toggle="yes">&#x0201c;</italic>
<italic toggle="yes">We showed in this study that e-consenting is feasible in Malawi, a low&#x02013;income setting, and can be used in participants with different literacy levels</italic>
<italic toggle="yes">&#x0201d;</italic>. I find this statement problematic. The findings of this study cannot be generalized to Malawi because a greater majority of the participants were literate, the sample size was small, and the sampling was non-probability! That statement should be revised.</p><p>
<bold>5.&#x000a0;</bold>&#x000a0;&#x000a0;&#x000a0; There are two contradicting responses:</p><p> &#x000b7;&#x000a0;&#x000a0;&#x000a0;&#x000a0;&#x000a0;&#x000a0; &#x0201c;
<italic toggle="yes">Thank you very much. Both consents were self-administered with supervision by the study staff, we also maintained the same nurses and clinicians during the study. We however did not explore the reason for the errors</italic>
<italic toggle="yes">&#x0201d;</italic>
<italic toggle="yes">.</italic>
</p><p> and,&#x000a0;&#x000a0;
<italic toggle="yes">&#x0201c;</italic>
<italic toggle="yes">The errors are due to human mistakes (both study staff and participants) quality control was done at the end of the screening visit</italic>
<italic toggle="yes">&#x0201d;</italic>.</p><p> Since it is indicated in the rebuttal that these were human errors, this should be discussed in the paper. There seem to be issues with quality assurance in the trial, particularly with the documentation of informed consent. Even if participants were randomly selected (the sampling method is missing and should be included), that means, there is likelihood that a sizable proportion of the entire cohort has consenting issues. This should not happen in a trial that has good quality assurance protocols. Further, much as this paper is trying to advocate for e-consenting, it would add value to discuss how these errors can be addressed and their occurrence reduced.</p><p>

<italic toggle="yes">&#x0201d;</italic>
<italic toggle="yes">.</italic> How was &#x0201c;ease of form search&#x0201d; assessed? Were the nurses and doctors asked to comment on this or this is the authors&#x02019; opinion?

The study sought to investigate the utility of e-consenting in an ongoing clinical trial. Both paper-based and electronic consenting were done, and the error rates were compared.

The elements of consent are well known; the declaration/ signing of the consent document is the final step after someone has understood the consent information and voluntarily agrees to participate in research.

<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p> Thank you very much. Our study was a sub study under a clinical trial thus all our participants were enrolled in the trial. The mean age of 27 reflects the age for both college students and community members, please refer to the underlying data to see the detailed age for our participants. The main trial under which our study was conducted required that participants be literate. Healthy adults- aged 18 to 40 years including College students, were eligible to participate. We deliberately involved college students to increase likelihood of recruiting literate participants. This has also been the case in our sister CHIMs in Liverpool, UK. </p></list-item></list> This is an important study that investigated the transition from paper-based to digital consenting, however, the methods, result presentation, and discussion are weak and need major revisions if this paper is to be accepted for Indexing.

<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p> Thank you very much. Our electronic consent included all elements of informed consent according to ICHGCP standards. E-consenting included participant information sheet, a 10 statement form outlining critical areas of the study, and a signature section for signing. We read the information sheet on physical papers, then asked participants to undergo e-consenting and then sign off. This is clarified more in the paper. </p></list-item></list> It is stated on page 5, that "E-consenting proved to be feasible; it was reliable as it reduced the error rate to 0% (n 0/109) compared to 43.1% (n 47/109) ..." What do the authors mean by "error rate"?
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p> Error rate was defined as number of participant forms with any amount of observed errors such as wrong spelling, overwriting, missing participant ID, unfilled sections, wrongly filled sections etc of the total filled consent forms. This definition has been included in the paper. </p></list-item></list> Is it fair to infer that e-consenting is feasible with a small sample size and biased population? The authors should justify this. Reduction in the error rate is not synonymous with feasibility!
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p> Thank you. We tested e-consent in a relatively smaller cohort of literate participants. Nevertheless, the numbers tested are not unusual for some observations and interventional studies hence the study still provides useful information to learn from. </p></list-item></list> Was the paper-based consent self-administered, assisted or both? Might the errors be related to the level of experience of the research assistants?
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p> Thank you very much.

<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p> Thank you. This data was determined by both observation and unstructured feedback from study staff (nurses and clinicians) testing e-consent. This is described in the methods section. </p></list-item></list> Page 6 states, "The use of electronic consent was noted to have improved consent form accessibility and reduced the burden of the need to print all consent and information documents. It also helped in promoting data safety and reduced the risk of data breach". What do the authors mean by improved consent form accessibility? They have indicated that the consent forms are difficult to access when there is poor internet connectivity, however, in the discussion they mention something to the contrary. This should be elaborated
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p> Thank you. Our study was conducted in a technologically able setting with good internet availability. Instances of not having internet were rare and as such compared to paper based consent accessing the forms was easier than going through large physical folders. </p></list-item></list> The strengths and limitations should be presented at the end of the discussion.
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p> Thank you for this, we have revised this in the article. </p></list-item></list> The authors conclude that e-consenting is feasible but, they recruited a biased population of only literate participants, yet it is well documented that in much of sub-Saharan Africa, it is mainly illiterate individuals who participate in research. The authors explored the feasibility of e-consenting however, they seem to have a biased population that affects the credibility of their findings.
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p> Thank you. We agree with this observation. However, largely, CHIMs have involved literate participants, both in high-income and low-income settings. The pilot was a sub-study and involved literate participants of an ongoing trial. We agree that future studies should explore utility of e-consent in illiterate participants. </p></list-item></list> Page 6, "Though e-consenting showed to be a reliable tool when conducting research, it also proved that it will be almost impossible to use it in remote areas as it always required a working internet connection to upload the form to allow it to be in a printable pdf format and a printer for printing the participant consent forms as not all areas in Malawi have easy access to electricity and internet."

<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Thank you very much. Traditionally most CHIMs have been done in HICs and are recently expanding into low and middle income countries. One ethical concern for conducting CHIMs in LMICs is the challenge of obtaining voluntary informed consent especially in participants who are not literate, who may thus be considered as vulnerable (Informed consent for Controlled Human Infection Studies in low- and middle&#x000a0; income countries: Ethical challenges ad proposed solutions

I would propose a few changes to make this publication's outputs clearer and stronger.</p><p>
<underline>Introduction.</underline>
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>(Para 1) Educating a patient (in my view) sounds a bit condescending and other words like explaining, detailing might be considered.</p></list-item><list-item><p>(Para 2) No mention is made about limitations from the patient's side, it only seems to focus on the research centre staff and storage.</p></list-item><list-item><p>(Para 4) No mention is made about the considerable challenges of keeping digital data secure and protected once it's collected.

<underline>Methods.</underline>
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>(Ethics) I would like a bit more clarity about the 'proposal' that was approved. Was this submitted as a separate study within a trial? The study design is categorised as a cross-sectional observational study so this should get separate ethics approval from the clinical trial. This might have been obtained but is not clear from the text.</p></list-item></list>
<underline>Results.</underline>
</p><p> Your result section makes statements that I don't feel are supported by the data presented.
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The authors mention e-consenting is feasible but they should note that this is only the case for participants that have no (visual or hearing) impairments. No mention is made about illiterate participants or how e-consenting might be a help in this population.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The authors mention it was reliable and mention a 0% mistake rate for the e-consenting. In my opinion, the data presented cannot be interpreted as meaning e-consenting is more reliable as the participant had already gone through a (written) consent procedure. There is no mention of how this could have affected the second consent procedure. Repeating the same actions usually leads to a lower error rate.</p></list-item><list-item><p>(Documentation errors analysis) It might be better to clearly detail all errors so the reader can understand whether the errors were solely related to spelling, overwriting etc and not to more structural errors and understanding. This section can be broadened.</p></list-item></list>
<underline>Discussion.</underline>
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>(Para 1) Again I think the claim that e-consenting had a 0% error rate compared to paper-based consenting cannot be made based on this study design and results.</p></list-item></list>
<underline>Previous studies.</underline>
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Did your study look at staff satisfaction or participant usability and satisfaction? Claiming e-consenting is feasible without including any data on the patients' experiences is challenging.</p></list-item></list>
<underline>Study limitations.</underline>
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The authors rightly point out the lack of randomisation of the two different consent methods. For future studies, they might consider changing the order of obtaining the consent in different groups allowing for a more accurate understanding of the errors and challenges of obtaining e-consent (first and paper-based consent second).</p></list-item></list>
<underline>Advantages.</underline>
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>'Data safety was enhanced'. This is not supported by any data. Challenges with maintaining this type of data (E- consents) in a long term secure way is not easy and data breaches do occur.

<underline>Challenges.</underline>
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The authors mention that this pilot study was conducted to identify gaps that need to be addressed for streamlining e-consent in future studies. I am unsure what these gaps are and if they are reported in this paper.</p></list-item></list>

<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p> Thank you very much we have revised this paragraph to indicate this and other queries have also been clarifiy. </p></list-item></list> Methods. (Ethics) I would like a bit more clarity about the 'proposal' that was approved. Was this submitted as a separate study within a trial? The study design is categorised as a cross-sectional observational study so this should get&#x000a0;separate ethics approval from the clinical trial. This might have been obtained but is not clear from the text.
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p> Thank you. This was a Sub study and approval to do a pilot was sought in an amendment. The Study is a product of a review meeting with NHSRC. We have clarified this in the paper and have provided a protocol reference number. </p></list-item></list> Results. The authors mention e-consenting is feasible but they should note that this is only the case for participants that have no (visual or hearing) impairments. No mention is made about illiterate participants or how e-consenting might be a help in this population.
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p> Thank you for this observation, we have revised and clarified this statement. We propose that this could be translated into other research studies. The result section has been thoroughly revised. </p></list-item></list> The authors mention it was reliable and mention a 0% mistake rate for the e-consenting. In my opinion, the data presented cannot be interpreted as meaning e-consenting is more reliable as the participant had already gone through a (written) consent procedure. There is no mention of how this could have affected the second consent procedure. Repeating the same actions usually leads to a lower error rate.
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p> Agreed. We have revised that statement by adding that our study did not identify any errors. This improvement could be a result of prior paper-based consent process. We have also removed the word etc. from the article. </p></list-item></list> Documentation errors analysis) It might be better to clearly detail all errors so the reader can understand whether the errors were solely related to spelling, overwriting etc and not to more structural errors and understanding. This section can be broadened.
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p> Thank you. We have revised this section to be more precise. We have also defined&#x000a0;documentation errors to clarified this, </p></list-item></list> Discussion. (Para 1) Again I think the claim that e-consenting had a 0% error rate compared to paper-based consenting cannot be made based on this study design and results.
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p> We agree with this. Admittedly no errors were identified with electronic consent because of the choice of study design, this could have been improved with participants already being familiar with the paper-based consent. We have revised the wording in the article. </p></list-item></list> Previous studies. Did your study look at staff satisfaction or participant usability and satisfaction? Claiming e-consenting is feasible without including any data on the patients' experiences is challenging.
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p> Thank you very much. The pilot did not explore staff or participant satisfaction. However we sought staff feedback on e-consenting. </p></list-item></list> Study limitations. The authors rightly point out the lack of randomisation of the two different consent methods. For future studies, they might consider changing the order of obtaining the consent in different groups allowing for a more accurate understanding of the errors and&#x000a0;challenges of obtaining e-consent (first and paper-based consent second).
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p> Thank you, excellent observation. We agree.&#x000a0; </p></list-item></list> Advantages. 'Data safety was enhanced'. This is not supported by any data. Challenges with maintaining this type of data (E- consents) in a long-term secure way is not easy and data breaches do occur. Does the site have data about how many forms are lost or where privacy breaches have occurred with paper-based consenting?
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p> Thank you so much. The study file is kept in the institutional database. Our study did not have missing E-Consent forms. No data breaches were identified during this study. We have consulted and confirmed that there were no data breache. We have revised the wording of the article. </p></list-item></list> Challenges. The authors mention that this pilot study was conducted to identify gaps that need to be addressed for streamlining e-consent in future studies. I am unsure what these gaps are and if they are reported in this paper.
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p> The paper demonstrates feasibility of e-consent in Human Infection Studies. The study set up had required facilities to support use of an e- consent. The pilot serves as a reference to studies requiring to set up and demonstrate usability by participants. We have&#x000a0;Rephrased the sentence from &#x0201c;identify gaps&#x0201d; to &#x0201c;propose considerations. </p></list-item></list> Conclusions. I think the authors cannot draw the conclusion that e-consenting is feasible in a Malawian setting. It has shown to be feasible in a very specific context only and has not taken into account the participants' perspective.
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p> Agreed! We suggest studies considering e- consent should have a similar set up and explore participant experiences in detail. We have Revised the wording. And&#x000a0;have included statements such as &#x0201c;usefulness, unique advantages, and enthusiasm for utility is studies recruiting large cohorts of participants. </p></list-item></list>
