In this study, we showed that higher polyacrylamide hydrogels (PAAG) stiffness resulted in the progression and immune escape of PCa via integrin &#x003b2;1/FAK/YAP axis. The translocation of YAP into cell nucleus to bind to TEAD2 promoted the transcriptional activation of USP8. NBR1 could be ubiquitinated, and then degraded, via interacting with P62/SQSTM1 and through autophagy-lysosome pathway. Increased expression of USP8 promoted the abundance of NBR1 via K63-linked de-ubiquitination and PD-L1 via K48-linked de-ubiquitination in response to high PAAG stiffness. NBR1-mediated selective autophagy accelerated the degradation of MHC-1 of PCa. The USP8 inhibitor presented a potential application value in sensitizing immunotherapy of PCa. Taken together, we identified a USP8-mediated de-ubiquitination mechanism that involves in the process of high PAAG stiffness-mediated high expression of PD-L1 and low expression of MHC-1 of PCa cells, which provided a rationale of immunotherapy sensitization of PCa via USP8 inhibition.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Urological cancer</kwd><kwd>Ubiquitylation</kwd><kwd>Cancer microenvironment</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>This study was supported by Major Scientific Research Program for Young and Middle-aged Health Professionals of Fujian Province, China (Grant No. 2022ZQNZD006) and the &#x0201c;Eyas Plan&#x0201d; Youth Top-notch Talent Project of Fujian Province (Grant number: SCYJHBJRC-XN2021).</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Associazione Differenziamento e Morte Cellulare ADMC 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Prostate cancer (PCa) is regarded as the most frequent cancer in men around the world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Despite initial response to therapy, unfortunately, some PCa patients eventually develop more aggressive forms resistant to hormonotherapy, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, leading to poor prognosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Recently, immunotherapy has been proved as an effective therapeutic option for improving the survival of cancer patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. However, PCa usually has an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and is considered as a &#x0201c;cold tumor&#x0201d;, resulting in the inefficacy of immunotherapy, especially those with higher Gleason score [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The specific mechanism of immune evasion and resistance to immunotherapy remains unclear in PCa.</p><p id="Par3">In the process of immune surveillance, major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I)/T cell receptor (TCR) complex is an important molecule that plays a key role in antigen presentation and immune signal transmission, and is an important target for cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) to recognize and kill tumor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Immune checkpoint (for example, PD-L1, PD1, and CTLA-4) is a class of immune suppression molecules expressed on tumor or immune cells and can regulate the degree of immune activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In tumor tissues, abnormal signals of immune checkpoint or MHC-I/TCR complex would weaken the immune response of immune system and promote the immune evasion of cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The expression level of PD-L1 was proved to be positively correlated with Gleason score of PCa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], and MHC-1 was down-regulated in tissues of high Gleason score than those of low Gleason score [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], which is one of the causes that high Gleason score tissues have more suppressive immune environment. However, the specific molecular mechanism of differential expression of PD-L1 and MHC-1 in PCa tissues with various Gleason score was less studied.</p><p id="Par4">The extracellular matrix (ECM) is a non-cellular scaffold in tumor microenvironment of tumors, which could provide nests for tumor and stroma cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The cancer ECM is mainly established by collagens, elastin, proteoglycans, glycoproteins, laminins, fibronectins and other matrix proteins. The unbalance between ECM deposition and degradation results in the promotion of malignant phenotypes of cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. High level of ECM stiffness has been reported to enhance the proliferation, migration, and invasion of cancer cells. It has also been reported that higher Gleason score represents higher ECM mechanical stiffness, and that PCa with higher Gleason score is more susceptible to immune escape [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. However, whether ECM mechanical stiffness is the cause of higher ability of invasiveness and immune escape of PCa with high Gleason score remains uncertain.</p><p id="Par5">In this study, we aimed to investigate the impact of ECM-derived mechanical stiffness on PCa progression and immune evasion and the potential molecular mechanisms. We elucidated that ECM-derived biomechanical stiffness could inhibit Hippo signaling to induce the progression and immune evasion of PCa via integrin &#x003b2;1/FAK/YAP axis. Furthermore, we revealed that USP8 was a major downstream target protein of YAP/TEAD2-mediated transcriptional regulation and USP8-mediated de-ubiquitination is essentially responsible for the MHC-1 degradation and PD-L1 abundance of PCa, which is the leading molecular mechanism of ECM-derived PCa progression and immune evasion. Our results highlight the role of biomechanical signaling in ECM-induced tumor progression and immune evasion of PCa and the underlying therapeutic value of USP8 inhibition in immunotherapy sensitization.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Cell culture</title><p id="Par6">PC-3, DU145, RM-1, and HEK-293T cells were purchased from Procell Life Science &#x00026; Technology Co., Ltd (Wuhan, China).

Patients were positioned in the left lateral decubitus position, and an ultrasound probe was inserted rectally under aseptic conditions. We used a cognitive fusion image of ultrasound, mpMRI and PSMA PET/CT to locate the region of interest (ROI) for ultrasound elastography measure before prostate biopsy. The system was switched to shear wave elastography (SWE) mode to measure tissue stiffness. The Young&#x02019;s modulus (E, in kilopascals) was calculated based on shear wave velocity measurements.

RT-qPCR and western blot confirmed the efficiency of overexpression and interference of USP8 in DU145 and PC-3 cells (Fig. <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">S4A, B</xref>). CCK8 assay and clone formation assay demonstrated that high expression of USP8 could promote the viability and colony forming capability of DU145 and PC-3 cells while low expression of USP8 could inhibit the viability and colony forming capability of DU145 and PC-3 cells (Fig. <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">S4C, D</xref>). Transwell migration and invasion assay demonstrated that high expression of USP8 could facilitate the invasion and migration capability of DU145 and PC-3 cells while low expression of USP8 could inhibit the invasion and migration ability of DU145 and PC-3 cells (Fig. <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">S4E, F</xref>). Besides, we co-cultured stable USP8 overexpressed or knock-down DU145/PC-3 cells with CD8&#x02009;+&#x02009;T cells.

Stable USP8-overexpressed RM-1 cells and control cells, stable USP8-silenced RM-1 cells and control cells were subcutaneously transplanted into C57BL/6J mice and investigate the impact of USP8 expression level in tumor growth in vivo. Tumor growth in the sh-USP8 group was significantly slower than that in the control group, and tumor growth in the USP8 overexpression group was significantly faster than that in the control group. The tumor weights and volumes were smaller in the sh-USP8 group than that in the control group, and the tumor weights and volumes were increased in the USP8 overexpression group than that in the control group (Fig. <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">S4I&#x02013;K</xref>).

Next, the assay of subcutaneous tumors formed by RM-1 cells were also conducted. Tumor growth in the high PAAG stiffness group was significantly faster than that in the low PAAG stiffness group, and could be rescue by USP8 silencing. The tumor weights and volumes were increased in the high PAAG stiffness group than that in the low PAAG stiffness group, and could be rescue by USP8 silencing (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3G&#x02013;I</xref>).

To investigate the specifically targeted de-ubiquitinating substrate of USP8, we performed 4D label free quantitative proteomics and ubiquitinome in stable USP8-silenced DU145 cells and control cells. Quantitative proteomics identified a total of 167 upregulated proteins and 70 downregulated proteins (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4A</xref>).

For the reason that USP8 plays an important regulatory role in removing conjugated ubiquitin from proteins, therefore preventing the degradation of protein, we took the intersections of down-regulated proteins and ubiquitinated proteins with up-regulated ubiquitin sites in response to shUSP8 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4C</xref>).

We conducted endogenous in vivo ubiquitination assay and found that NBR1 could be ubiquitinated in PC-3 and DU145 cells (Fig. <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">S5A</xref>). Autophagy-lysosome pathway and ubiquitin proteasome pathway were two major ubiquitin-dependent degradation pathway of proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. We found that pretreatment with the lysosome inhibitor 3-MA increased NBR1 protein level in DU145 and PC-3 cells, whereas the proteasome inhibitor MG132 failed to affect NBR1 protein expression (Fig. <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">S5B</xref>), indicating that NBR1 might be degraded through autophagy-lysosome pathway. To explore the E3 ubiquitin ligase that mediates NBR1 ubiquitination modification and the autophagy cargo receptor that mediates NBR1 degradation, the protein products were analyzed using mass spectrometry after immunoprecipitation. Several E3 ubiquitin ligase, including RBBP6, MIB1, HERC2, TRIM21, UBR5, were identified as potential interacting partners of NBR1, but only TRIM21 was confirmed by Co-immunoprecipitation in DU145 cells (Fig. <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">S5C, D</xref>). Endogenous in vivo ubiquitination assay revealed that the polyubiquitination level of NBR1 was markedly decreased after interference of TRIM21 in PC-3 and DU145 cells (Fig. <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">S5E</xref>). Several autophagy cargo receptors, including P62/SQSTM1 and TAX1BP1, were identified as potential interacting partners of NBR1, but only P62/SQSTM1 was confirmed by Co-immunoprecipitation in DU145 cells (Fig. <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">S5F, G</xref>).

The endogenous interaction between USP8 and NBR1 was also confirmed by Co-IP and immunoblotting assays in DU145 and PC-3 cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4K</xref>). The immunofluorescence demonstrated the co-localization of USP8 protein and NBR1 protein (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4L</xref>). Furthermore, the overexpression or knockdown of USP8 in DU145 and PC-3 cells failed to affect the expression level of NBR1 mRNA (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4M</xref>); however, the silence of USP8 in DU145 and PC-3 cells could significantly reduce the level of NBR1 protein and the overexpression of USP8 in DU145 and PC-3 cells could significantly elevate the level of NBR1 protein (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4N</xref>). These results suggested that USP8 specifically interacted with NBR1 protein and affected the expression of NBR1 protein but not mRNA.</p><p id="Par43">Next, we explore whether USP8 could remove the conjugated ubiquitin from NBR1 protein and regulate the stability of the NBR1 protein. Then, we performed ubiquitination assay to investigate the de-ubiquitinated role of USP8 in NBR1 protein. Exogenous in vivo ubiquitination assay revealed that the polyubiquitination level of Myc-NBR1 was markedly decreased in Flag-USP8 transduced HEK-293T cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5A</xref>). Endogenous in vivo ubiquitination assay showed that the polyubiquitination level of NBR1 was markedly increased in stable USP8-silenced DU145/PC-3 cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5B</xref>). Furthermore, USP8 could also significantly promote the in vitro NBR1 de-ubiquitination (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5C</xref>). Tumors formed by RM-1 cells in high PAAG stiffness exhibited downregulation of NBR1 polyubiquitination compared to tumors formed by RM-1 cells in low PAAG stiffness, and could be rescued by the knockdown of USP8 (Figs. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5D</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM9" ref-type="media">S6A</xref>). In addition, the polyubiquitination of NBR1 was also inhibited in high Gleason score (&#x0003e;7) tissues compared with that in low Gleason score (&#x0003c;7) tissues (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5E</xref>). Ubiquitin is a protein composed of 76 amino acids with seven lysine residues (K6, K11, K27, K29, K33, K48, and K63), all of which can be ubiquitinated to form a unique polyubiquitin chain. To identify which lysine residues of ubiquitin are involved in USP8 de-ubiquitination process of NBR1, we mutated K6, K11, K27, K29, K33, K48, K63 lysine residues on the ubiquitin to arginine (K6R, K11R, K27R, K29R, K33R, K48R, K63R) and co-transfected Myc-NBR1, Flag-USP8, and HA-Ub (including wide type and mutated type) into HEK-293T cells. The results showed that it was K63 lysine residue on polyubiquitin chain involved in the USP8-medicated de-ubiquitination of NBR1 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5F</xref>). Endogenous ubiquitination assay using K63-linkage or K48-linkage specific polyubiquitin antibody further confirmed the role of K63 lysine residue in the USP8-medicated de-ubiquitination of NBR1 (Fig. <xref rid="MOESM9" ref-type="media">S6B</xref>). To identify whether K767 (Lys-767) and K887 (Lys-887) lysine sites on the NBR1 identified by ubiquitinome are involved in USP8-mediated de-ubiquitination process, we mutated K767 and K887 lysine to arginine on the NBR1 and co-transfected Myc-NBR1 (including wide type and K767R-mutation and K887R-mutation), Flag-USP8, and HA-Ub into HEK-293T cells. The results showed that the Lys-887 rather than Lys-767 was an important site for USP8-medicated de-ubiquitination of NBR1 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5G</xref>). Notably, we found that knockdown of USP8 led to a prominent decrease in the stability of endogenous NBR1 protein in DU145 and PC-3 cells, whereas the stability of tubulin was not affected (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5H</xref>).<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><title>USP8 deubiquitinates and stabilizes NBR1.</title><p><bold>A</bold> Exogenous ubiquitination assay of Myc-NBR1 in HEK-293T cells transduced with Flag-USP8 together with Myc-NBR1 and HA-Ub plasmid, and treated with 3-MA for 6&#x02009;h. <bold>B</bold> Endogenous ubiquitination assay of NBR1 in DU145 and PC-3 cells treated with 3-MA for 6&#x02009;h. <bold>C</bold> In vitro de-ubiquitination assay of ubiquitinated Myc-NBR1 protein with purified Flag-USP8. <bold>D</bold> Ubiquitination assay of NBR1 in subcutaneous tumors derived from RM-1 cells in high or low PAAG stiffness. <bold>E</bold> Ubiquitination assay of NBR1 in PCa tissues of Gleason score &#x0003c; 7 or &#x0003e;7. <bold>F</bold> Ubiquitination assay of Myc-NBR1 in HEK-293T cells co-transfected with Myc-NBR1, Flag-USP8 together with HA-Ub, HA-Ub-K6R, HA-Ub-K11R, HA-Ub-K27R, HA-Ub-K29R, HA-Ub-K33R, HA-Ub-K48R, HA-Ub-K63R, and treated with 3-MA for 6&#x02009;h. <bold>G</bold> Ubiquitination assay of Myc-NBR1 in HEK-293T cells co-transfected with HA-Ub, Flag-USP8 together with Myc-NBR1, Myc-NBR1-K767R, Myc-NBR1-K887R, and treated with 3-MA for 6&#x02009;h. <bold>H</bold> Stability analysis of NBR1 protein in DU145 and PC-3 cells transfected with shNC or shUSP8, and treated with 40&#x02009;&#x003bc;M cycloheximide (CHX) for indicated times. <bold>I</bold>&#x02013;<bold>K</bold> RM-1 related stable cells (shNC, shUSP8, and shUSP8+Myc-NBR1) were injected into the flanks of mice, respectively.

However, USP8 showed no endogenous interaction with MHC-1 although knockdown of USP8 could increase the level of MHC-1 and overexpression of USP8 could reduce the level of MHC-1 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6C, D</xref>). To determine whether USP8 affect the level of MHC-1 via NBR1, we either silenced NBR1 in USP8-overexpressing DU145/PC-3 cells or transduced NBR1 plasmid in USP8-knockdown DU145/PC-3 cells. The results revealed that NBR1 silencing could elevate the level of MHC-1 in USP8-overexpressing DU145/PC-3 cells and NBR1 transduction could reduce the level of MHC-1 in USP8-knockdown cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6E</xref>).

However, whether USP8 could de-ubiquitinate and stabilize PD-L1 in PCa remains uncertain. To address this problem, we co-transfected Flag-USP8 and His-PD-L1 into HEK-293T cells. The results of Co-IP and western blot revealed that there was an exogenous specifical interaction between Flag-USP8 and His-PD-L1 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7A</xref>). The endogenous interaction between USP8 and PD-L1 was also confirmed by Co-IP and immunoblotting assays in DU145 and PC-3 cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7B</xref>). The immunofluorescence demonstrated the co-localization of USP8 protein and PD-L1 protein (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7C</xref>).

Endogenous in vivo ubiquitination assay also demonstrated that the polyubiquitination level of PD-L1 was obviously increased in stable USP8-silenced DU145/PC-3 cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8B</xref>). Furthermore, USP8 significantly promoted the in vitro PD-L1 de-ubiquitination (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8C</xref>).

Endogenous ubiquitination assay using K48-linkage or K63-linkage specific polyubiquitin antibody further confirmed the role of K48 lysine residue in the USP8-mediated de-ubiquitination of PD-L1 in DU145 and PC-3 cells (Fig. <xref rid="MOESM12" ref-type="media">S9B</xref>).
