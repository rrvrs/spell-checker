This study aimed to describe a novel autosomal recessive <italic>GNE</italic> pedigree in a Chinese family and explore the possible mechanism of <italic>GNE</italic> variants in GNE myopathy, the most common distal myopathy in China. The clinical, genetic, and pathological characteristics of 216 Chinese patients with GNE myopathy were also summarized.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">The proband and her family underwent a comprehensive medical history assessment and neurological examinations. Whole-exome sequencing was performed on the proband, and Sanger sequencing was performed on family members. 293T cell lines were used for immunofluorescence (IF), Western blot, and dual-luciferase reporter assays. We collected the clinical data of 216 GNE myopathy patients from previous reports up until August 1, 2024. Patients were classified into distinct groups according to mutation location to analyze genotype-phenotype correlation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">Whole-exome sequencing of the proband and Sanger sequencing of all available family members identified a compound heterozygous mutation involving a novel promoter region mutation, c.-259T&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;C, and a reported mutation, c.88&#x000a0;C&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;T (p.Q30*). The <italic>GNE</italic> promoter fragment (-500 to -1; c.-259T&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;C) was cloned to construct the firefly luciferase reporter vector. The dual-luciferase reporter assay showed that the mutated promoter exhibited reduced transcriptional activity, resulting in decreased GNE expression. Western blot and IF analysis of overexpressing Q30* revealed that it reduced GNE expression without altering cellular localization and increased the ectopic cytoplasmic expression of TDP-43. The p.D207V mutation was the most common variant in China. Patients carrying p.D207V tended to experience later disease onset. In the epimerase/epimerase group, men experienced earlier disease onset than women (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05).

It is characterized by tibialis anterior muscle weakness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. A hallmark of this disease is the involvement of lower limb muscles, progressing from anterior to posterior within the calf, with relative sparing of the quadriceps femoris. Loss of ambulation typically occurs 10 to 20 years after symptom onset. Upper limb involvement may manifest 5 to 10 years after onset, though progression from distal to proximal is not always observed. In later stages, the neck and axial muscles are affected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Current evidence suggests that on histopathological examination, rimmed vacuoles are primarily observed within the muscle fibers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">GNE myopathy is indeed caused by bi-allelic mutations in the <italic>GNE</italic> gene, which encodes the UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinase and is the rate-limiting enzyme for sialic acid biosynthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. To the best of our knowledge, nearly all reported <italic>GNE</italic> mutations across various ethnic populations around the world are missense or nonsense mutations, while a small number of mutations affecting pre-mRNA splicing have been documented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">However, the pathogenicity of gene mutations in the promoter region has rarely been reported. Promoters are now understood to interact with transcription factors that determine the initiation and timing of gene transcription. The promoter, which does not encode a protein, contains the RNA polymerase binding site, the enzyme controlling mRNA synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Promoter mutations are associated with altered transcriptional activity mediated by changes in the binding of trans-acting protein factors to specific DNA sequences within the promoter region. Thus, promoter mutations affect gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">This study investigated a case of GNE myopathy resulting from a rare compound heterozygous mutation involving a novel promoter region mutation (c.-259 T&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;C) and a known mutation (c.88&#x000a0;C&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;T [p.Q30*]). The promoter region reduced transcriptional activity and GNE expression, while the exon region reduced GNE expression without altering cellular localization and increased ectopic cytoplasmic expression of TDP-43. Clinical, genetic, and pathological characteristics of 216 Chinese GNE myopathy patients were summarized to review the mutation spectrum and genotype-phenotype correlation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Clinical evaluation</title><p id="Par9">A pedigree associated with GNE myopathy was compiled from patients at the First Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, China.

Exome sequencing data was aligned to the human reference genome (hg19) using Illumina Sequence Control Software (SCS) and the BWA Aligner. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and small insertions/deletions (INDELs) were analyzed with the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) and annotated using ANNOVAR. Clinically significant variants were filtered by: (1) retaining variants with a minor allele frequency (MAF) less than 0.5% in dbSNP, genomAD, and ExAC databases; (2) selecting for exonic non-synonymous SNVs, splice site SNVs, and INDELs; and (3) classifying variants as either disease-related or unrelated.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Primer construction and sanger sequencing</title><p id="Par12">Clonal primers were constructed for <italic>GNE</italic> mutation sites identified in the proband through whole-exon sequencing.

MRI of the lower limbs revealed edema in the anterior tibialis, tibialis posterior, and extensor digitorum longus muscles, suggestive of muscle inflammation or injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Furthermore, atrophy and fatty infiltration were observed in various thigh muscles bilaterally, and histopathological examination of the left lateral vastus muscle showed rimmed vacuoles, further confirming the widespread nature of muscle involvement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. These findings diverged to some extent from the existing literature on GNE myopathy. While previous studies have largely focused on calf muscle involvement, this study provides additional evidence of thigh muscle involvement, thereby contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of the clinical spectrum of GNE myopathy.</p><p id="Par39">Prior research has established a link between <italic>GNE</italic> mutations and disease. However, investigations into promoter region mutations remain limited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Promoters are the key regulatory element of gene transcription initiation, and their integrity is essential for gene expression. Garland et al. reported the identification of an 11.3&#x000a0;kb Alu element-mediated deletion mutation in a pair of Indian siblings covering the promoter region of the GNE. This deletion was found to result in a significant reduction in the mRNA and protein levels of the GNE (about 40&#x02013;50%), indicating that the deletion of the promoter region directly affects the transcription efficiency of the gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Similarly, a 7.08&#x000a0;kb deletion mutation, also located in the promoter region upstream of the GNE, was identified by Chakravorty et al. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) showed that the GNE expression was decreased by approximately 50% and only expressed the V727M allele [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The present study&#x02019;s finding of a GNE c.-259 T&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;C mutation in the promoter region, which affected transcriptional activity and consequently reduced GNE protein expression, aligned with existing literature suggesting that promoter mutations could significantly influence disease development. Using the Human Transcription Factor Database (Human TFDB), we predicted that transcription factors such as BRD4, TCF3, TRIM28, and NHLH1 may bind to a promoter region containing GNE c.-259, which corresponds to transcription factor binding sites. Variations in key nucleotides within these binding sites could potentially alter their binding affinity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Future research should focus on the specific effects of gene promoter mutations on gene expression. Furthermore, investigating how these mutations interact with environmental or other genetic factors and their potential involvement in diverse disease processes constitutes a crucial avenue for future research.</p><p id="Par40">The enzymes encoded by the <italic>GNE</italic> gene are involved in glycosylation and cellular maintenance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. TDP-43 is a transcriptional regulatory protein mainly expressed in the nucleus and exhibits abnormal cytoplasmic accumulation in various neurodegenerative diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In this study, the GNE-Q30* variant not only resulted in decreased GNE expression but also increased cytoplasmic TDP-43 expression. Previous studies have shown that TDP-43 accumulation is common in myopathies with rimmed vacuoles, suggesting it may represent a common endpoint of muscle cell degeneration rather than a primary pathological mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Therefore, it is widely thought that abnormal TDP-43 accumulation is a feature of GNE myopathy. We hypothesize that this aberrant expression may be related to the cellular stress response as a result of reduced GNE expression, thereby affecting the normal nucleocytoplasmic transport and/or stability of TDP-43 and the reduction of GNE may affect the metabolic status of the cell, which in turn affects TDP-43&#x02019;s nucleocytoplasmic distribution. This abnormal TDP-43 accumulation may then further disrupt gene expression regulation, exacerbating cellular dysfunction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. While these findings are consistent with the existing literature on <italic>GNE</italic> mutations and aberrant TDP-43 expression, this study highlights the effect of GNE-Q30* on the distribution of TDP-43 observed in cell culture models, which provides new insights into understanding the molecular mechanisms of GNE myopathy. Future studies are needed to further explore how <italic>GNE</italic> mutations affect TDP-43 nucleocytoplasmic transport and the consequences of these alterations on cellular physiology and pathology. Furthermore, studying the interaction between GNE and TDP-43 and their respective roles in disease progression may facilitate the development of novel therapeutic strategies for GNE myopathy.</p><p id="Par41">The mean age of onset for the E/E, E/K, E/N, E/U, K/K, K/N, K/UF, and N/N groups was analyzed using one-way ANOVA, revealing that the overall mean age of onset varied significantly among the groups (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05). However, post-hoc analysis using the Dunnett test indicated no significant differences between individual groups. This discrepancy might be attributed to the limited sample size in our study, which could have resulted in insufficient statistical power for the analysis. In the E/E group, a statistically significant earlier age of onset was observed in male patients compared to female patients (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05). Although a trend towards earlier onset in female patients was noted in the remaining groups, no significant sex-based differences were observed. Further investigation with a larger sample size is required to confirm these observations. Patients carrying the p.D207V variant exhibited a later symptom onset. Substantial variability in both age of onset and muscle weakness was observed, even among patients sharing the same genetic variant, suggesting the potential influence of additional factors, such as environmental influences, physical activity levels, or other genetic modifiers, on disease progression.</p><p id="Par42">In this study, we confirmed p.D207V as the predominant pathogenic variant in the Chinese population. This aligned with observations reported in prior research. Chen et al. reported a 52.5% incidence of typical rimmed vacuoles in GNE myopathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Of the 216 patients included in the current study, biopsy site data were available for 103 individuals. Within this subset, typical rimmed vacuoles were observed in 79.61% (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;82/103) of patients. Notably, all patients with tibialis anterior biopsies exhibited rimmed vacuoles. These findings suggest a potential correlation between biopsy site selection and the presence of rimmed vacuoles. However, the limited sample size in the present study, coupled with the reliance on data from published articles, imposes certain limitations on the scope of our analysis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par43">This study identified a novel compound heterozygous variant of the <italic>GNE</italic> gene in a proband from a Chinese family, which co-segregated with the observed clinical phenotype within the family. This variant comprises a previously unreported mutation, c.-259 T&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;C, within a novel promoter region, and a known mutation, c.88&#x000a0;C&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;T (p.Q30*). Dual luciferase reporter assays demonstrated reduced transcriptional activity of the mutated promoter, resulting in decreased GNE expression. Western blot and immunofluorescence analyses of cells overexpressing the p.Q30* variant revealed diminished GNE expression without alterations in cellular localization and further indicated increased ectopic cytoplasmic expression of TDP-43. Clinical data from 216 Chinese patients with GNE myopathy, constituting the largest such series in this population to date, were compiled and analyzed. This analysis confirmed previous findings that the p.D207V variant is the most common <italic>GNE</italic> variant in China. Moreover, a trend toward earlier disease onset in females than males was observed, with the exception of individuals harboring biallelic mutations within the epimerase domain, where males exhibited earlier onset. The p.D207V mutation was associated with a relatively mild phenotype. This study expands the known genotypic and phenotypic spectrum of GNE myopathy, assesses the pathogenicity of the identified genetic mutations, and provides initial insights into the potential mechanisms by which <italic>GNE</italic> variants contribute to the development of this condition.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.</p><p>
