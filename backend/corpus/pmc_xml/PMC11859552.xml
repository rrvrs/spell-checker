We do not know, in what extense, population mental health will&#x000a0;deteriorate due to climate change. Unfortunately, not all European countries, including Poland collect the evidence-based information about current and possible future risks for mental health.</p><p>(1)World Health Organization.

Mental health-related descriptors (i.e. &#x0201e;mental health&#x0201d; OR &#x0201c;mental disorders&#x0201d;) and &#x0201e;climate change&#x0201d;&#x000a0;and &#x0201c;Poland/ Polish&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;Europe&#x0201d; term were used in particular searches. The results of the screening were included in the final selection list. References of screened full-text articles and raports were manually searched for further literature. Additionally, European and worldwide publications and reports prepared by mental health and/ or climate change organizations were taken into account.</p></sec><sec id="sec0390"><title>Results</title><p>Mental health risks of climate change can stem from climate-related natural disasters (e.g., extreme weather events), slower moving events (e.g., drought), or concern about the phenomenon of climate change itself. Primary mental health impact is related mostly to disasters itself and its consequences:&#x000a0;environment of disruption, trauma and grief. Direct consequences include increased rates of high-risk behaviours. Secondary effects of climate change are due to various processes of environmental changes and ecological disruptions. They consist of damages to physical and social infrastructure, physical health effects, food and water shortages, conflict, and displacement. Long-term droughts affect food and water supplies and can subsequently affect the economic and mental wellbeing not only the land-based workers.</p></sec><sec id="sec0391"><title>Conclusions</title><p>A focus on climate change impact on mental health can help enhance the understanding of factors that strengthening psychosocial resilience and adaptation.
