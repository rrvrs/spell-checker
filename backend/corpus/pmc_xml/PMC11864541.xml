</self-uri><abstract><sec id="sec034"><title>Objective</title><p>Arsenic exposure is a significant public health concern, particularly for its impact on children&#x02019;s cognitive development. Arsenic, a prevalent environmental toxin, is known to disrupt various biological pathways, leading to cognitive deficits and neurodevelopmental issues. Understanding the long-term effects and mechanisms underlying arsenic-induced cognitive impairments is crucial for devising effective interventions.</p></sec><sec id="sec035"><title>Methods</title><p>This systematic review included observational and experimental studies focusing on children under 18 years exposed to arsenic through drinking water, food, or other environmental sources. Studies were selected through comprehensive database searches, encompassing articles that measured cognitive outcomes via standardized tests. The synthesis was primarily narrative, given the heterogeneity in study designs, exposure levels, and outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="sec036"><title>Results</title><p>The review analysed findings from 24 studies, showing a consistent inverse relationship between arsenic exposure and cognitive performance in children. Higher arsenic levels were associated with lower IQ scores, slower processing speeds, and impaired memory and language skills. These cognitive deficits were evident across diverse geographical regions and persisted even after adjusting for sociodemographic factors. The studies highlighted the potential for both immediate and long-term cognitive effects, underscoring the importance of early-life exposure.</p></sec><sec id="sec037"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Arsenic exposure has the potential to impair cognitive development in children. Nonetheless, quantitative meta-analysis is necessary to deduce any conclusions related to its impact. Public health efforts must prioritize reducing arsenic exposure through improved water quality and community-awareness programs. Future research should focus on longitudinal studies to better understand the dose-response relationship and the effectiveness of intervention strategies.</p></sec><sec id="sec038"><title>Systematic review registration</title><p>Prospero, CRD42024544442.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>Hunan Province Natural Science Foundation of China</institution>

One of the primary routes of exposure is through drinking water and food, particularly in regions where the contamination of groundwater and agricultural products is prevalent [<xref rid="pone.0319104.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The toxic effects of arsenic have been widely studied, particularly concerning carcinogenic risks, cardiovascular issues, and neurotoxic impacts [<xref rid="pone.0319104.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0319104.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. However, much of this research has centred on adult populations, leaving a critical gap in our understanding of the long-term effects of arsenic exposure on children [<xref rid="pone.0319104.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0319104.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Recent years have seen growing recognition of the unique vulnerabilities of children to environmental toxins. The developmental processes that occur from conception through adolescence are incredibly sensitive to chemical disruptions, and arsenic exposure during these periods can have lasting and potentially irreversible effects. In particular, there is mounting evidence suggesting that early-life exposure to arsenic can impair neurodevelopment, leading to cognitive deficits, learning disabilities, and other neurobehavioral issues [<xref rid="pone.0319104.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0319104.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>One of the key ways in which arsenic can impact neurodevelopment is through its influence on cellular processes and brain structure [<xref rid="pone.0319104.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0319104.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Arsenic is known to interfere with various metabolic pathways, including those involved in neurotransmitter production and signalling [<xref rid="pone.0319104.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0319104.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. This interference can disrupt the delicate balance required for healthy brain function, leading to deficits in cognitive performance. For example, arsenic exposure has been shown to reduce the activity of acetylcholinesterase, an enzyme critical for breaking down the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. This disruption can impair synaptic transmission, affecting learning and memory functions [<xref rid="pone.0319104.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0319104.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Beyond its immediate neurotoxic effects, arsenic can also induce oxidative stress and inflammation in the brain, further compounding its impact on neurodevelopment. Oxidative stress, characterized by an imbalance between free radicals and antioxidants in the body, can damage neurons and other brain cells [<xref rid="pone.0319104.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Inflammatory responses can exacerbate this damage, leading to cellular apoptosis and potentially contributing to neurodegenerative conditions [<xref rid="pone.0319104.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0319104.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. These mechanisms underscore the multifaceted nature of arsenic&#x02019;s impact on cognitive development, highlighting the need for comprehensive research into its long-term effects on children&#x02019;s cognitive health.</p><p>The evidence linking arsenic exposure to cognitive impairment in children comes from a variety of sources, including epidemiological studies, clinical research, and animal models [<xref rid="pone.0319104.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0319104.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Research from various other regions has explored the relationship between arsenic exposure and cognitive outcomes in children [<xref rid="pone.0319104.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0319104.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0319104.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0319104.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. These studies have yielded mixed results, with some showing clear associations between higher arsenic levels and cognitive deficits, while others have found no significant effects [<xref rid="pone.0319104.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0319104.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0319104.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0319104.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. This inconsistency may be due to differences in study design, sample size, exposure levels, or genetic and environmental factors that modulate susceptibility to arsenic&#x02019;s neurotoxic effects. Nevertheless, the collective evidence points toward a concerning trend that warrants further investigation.</p><p>The implications of arsenic-induced cognitive impairment extend beyond individual health outcomes, with broader societal consequences. Cognitive deficits in childhood can hinder educational attainment, limit future employment opportunities, and contribute to socioeconomic disparities. Furthermore, the impacts of arsenic exposure on cognitive function may persist into adulthood, increasing the risk of neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease or Parkinson&#x02019;s disease.</p><p>In light of these concerns, there is an urgent need to examine the existing literature on arsenic exposure and cognitive impairment in children comprehensively. This study aims to address this need, synthesizing available evidence to provide a clearer understanding of the relationship between arsenic exposure and cognitive development.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><p><bold>Types of Studies:</bold> Our review encompasses any form of observational studies (case-control, cohort, cross-sectional) and experimental trials that investigate the impact of arsenic exposure on cognitive outcomes in children.

A variety of key search terms were used in different combinations to refine the search, including &#x0201c;Arsenic Exposure,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;Cognitive Development,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;Neurobehavioral Outcomes,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;Arsenic Toxicity,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;Children&#x02019;s Health,&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;Developmental Disorders.&#x0201d; This extensive search spanned from the inception of each database&#x02019;s records to April 2024, without language restrictions to capture a wide range of international research findings.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Study selection procedure</title><p>The study selection process was executed with meticulous precision by two independent reviewers. Initially, each reviewer conducted their own search, and then they jointly reviewed titles and abstracts to identify articles that might meet the inclusion criteria. The full texts of these preliminarily chosen studies were then carefully scrutinized by both reviewers, working independently, to verify their relevance against the predefined criteria. If disagreements arose, the reviewers sought to reach an agreement through discussion. In cases where consensus could not be achieved, a third reviewer was consulted.</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>Data collection</title><p>Structured data extraction was employed under the supervision of the lead researcher. The information gathered included: study title, publication details, descriptions of study design, information about study population, research setting, sample size, baseline characteristics, and cognitive outcomes measured. We also extracted inclusion and exclusion criteria for participants, descriptions of exposure groups based on different levels of arsenic exposure (e.g., low, moderate, or high), duration of follow-up, and final outcomes such as cognitive test scores (IQ, memory, processing speed).</p><p>We ensured that all relevant data were extracted systematically using a predefined extraction form. In cases where key data points were not explicitly reported, efforts were made to interpret and include relevant findings based on available information in the studies. However, no studies were excluded from the review solely due to missing data, as our objective was to provide a comprehensive narrative synthesis. As no meta-analysis was conducted, missing data did not directly impact the analysis. Instead, any uncertainties or data gaps were clearly noted and considered in the interpretation of results.</p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>Risk of bias assessment</title><p>All the included studies were observational studies and hence, Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) was utilized for bias risk assessment [<xref rid="pone.0319104.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. We used the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) to assess the risk of bias for the included studies. The NOS evaluates three broad perspectives: (1) Selection of the study groups, (2) Comparability of the groups, and (3) Outcome assessment. Selection criteria included aspects like the representativeness of the sample and ascertainment of exposure. Comparability was assessed based on control for key confounding factors, while outcome assessment focused on the robustness and adequacy of follow-up procedures. Each study is awarded a maximum of nine stars across these domains, with higher scores indicating better quality. Specifically, studies were classified as follows: scores of 7&#x02013;9 were considered low risk of bias, scores of 4&#x02013;6 were deemed moderate risk of bias, and scores of 0&#x02013;3 indicated a high risk of bias.</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Data synthesis</title><p>Given the significant heterogeneity in participant profiles, exposure levels, and outcome measurements across the included studies, a narrative synthesis was employed in place of a meta-analysis.

This highlights the differential significance of exposure matrices in interpreting the cognitive impacts of arsenic exposure.</p><p>Similarly, Wang et al.

The consistent observation of this dose-response relationship across diverse studies and regions highlights arsenic&#x02019;s detrimental impact on cognitive development. The dose-response relationship also suggests that prolonged or higher levels of arsenic exposure can exacerbate cognitive deficits, including IQ scores and neurodevelopmental test results. This underscores the importance of addressing arsenic exposure early on to prevent significant cognitive impairment.</p><p>The review identified that dose-response relationships varied depending on the exposure levels, matrices, and health outcomes assessed.

In contrast, studies such as Nahar et al.

Drinking water arsenic concentrations demonstrated more robust and consistent dose-response relationships, likely due to their reflection of long-term cumulative exposure. Urinary arsenic levels, representing more recent exposure, showed variability across studies due to differences in temporal exposure and individual metabolism. This underscores the importance of considering the exposure matrix in interpreting dose-response relationships.</p></sec><sec id="sec023"><title>Neurotoxicity mechanisms.</title><p>Arsenic&#x02019;s neurotoxic effects are linked to its disruption of multiple metabolic pathways.

This mechanistic understanding is crucial as it not only helps in diagnosing the extent of damage but also in guiding therapeutic interventions aimed at mitigating the neurotoxic effects [<xref rid="pone.0319104.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0319104.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Further exploration into arsenic&#x02019;s neurotoxic mechanisms reveals its potential to disrupt mitochondrial function, leading to decreased energy production within brain cells. This mitochondrial dysfunction can exacerbate the production of reactive oxygen species, thus amplifying oxidative stress and promoting a cycle of cellular damage and death. Additionally, arsenic interferes with the developmental regulation of gene expression in neural cells, which can alter the normal patterns of brain development and lead to structural and functional abnormalities. These insights into the cellular and molecular effects of arsenic provide a clearer picture of how extensive the damage can be, emphasizing the need for protective measures during critical periods of brain development [<xref rid="pone.0319104.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0319104.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Examining regional variations in the impact of arsenic exposure also reveals significant cultural considerations that influence both exposure levels and outcomes. Dietary habits, local water sourcing practices, and traditional medicine use can all affect arsenic exposure. For instance, regions with a high dependence on groundwater for drinking and irrigation may experience higher exposure levels, influencing the degree of cognitive impairments observed in these populations [<xref rid="pone.0319104.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Cultural factors also play a crucial role in the acceptance and success of intervention strategies. Tailoring interventions to fit local customs and practices can enhance their effectiveness, promoting better compliance and more profound health impacts. This calls for culturally sensitive approaches to designing and implementing arsenic mitigation strategies, ensuring they are not only scientifically sound but also socially acceptable.</p><p>The variability in methods used for arsenic detection across the included studies contributes significantly to differences in sensitivity, specificity, and detection limits. Among the methods reported, Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) offers the highest sensitivity with detection limits as low as 0.0003 ppb, whereas X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) and Anion Exchange High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (AE-HPLC) have higher limits of detection at approximately 0.7 ppb and 0.2 to 0.8 ppb, respectively. This methodological heterogeneity partly explains the discrepancies observed in arsenic concentration levels reported in different studies, especially in regions where concentrations are close to the detection limits of less sensitive methods. For instance, studies employing ICP-MS reported lower detectable arsenic levels compared to studies using XRF, which could influence risk assessments and mitigation strategies. Furthermore, the choice of method impacts the reliability of arsenic speciation, as methods like AE-HPLC are more suited for distinguishing between arsenite and arsenate compared to ICP-MS, which primarily quantifies total arsenic. These differences underscore the importance of considering detection methods when interpreting and comparing results, as well as when designing future studies to standardize analytical approaches and minimize variability.</p><p>The global nature of arsenic exposure and its profound impact on child health necessitates a coordinated response from public health authorities and governments. Interventions need to focus on preventing exposure, especially in high-risk areas, by improving water quality and establishing strict regulations on arsenic levels in consumer products and industrial emissions. The studies highlight the effectiveness of community-based interventions, such as the installation of arsenic-removal systems, which have led to improved cognitive outcomes in children from previously high-exposure areas [<xref rid="pone.0319104.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p><p>Moreover, the evidence suggests that early-life exposure to arsenic could have lasting effects that extend into adulthood, potentially increasing the risk of neurodegenerative diseases. This long-term risk reinforces the need for early and aggressive intervention strategies that not only address immediate exposure but also monitor populations over time for emerging cognitive issues.</p><p>The dose-response relationships identified in this review reveal important insights into the health effects of arsenic exposure. The observed associations between arsenic exposure and adverse outcomes, such as cognitive decline, were strongly influenced by the exposure matrices and assessment methods used. Studies measuring arsenic levels in drinking water, such as Wasserman et al. (2004) and Wang et al. (2007), demonstrated more consistent dose-response relationships, particularly at exposure levels exceeding 100 &#x000b5;g/L. This consistency likely stems from drinking water&#x02019;s role as a primary and cumulative source of arsenic exposure, providing a clearer link to long-term health effects.</p><p>In contrast, studies using urinary arsenic levels, such as Nahar et al. (2014), showed dose-response relationships that varied based on recent exposure and individual differences in arsenic metabolism. These variations underscore the temporal nature of urinary arsenic as a biomarker and its potential to capture short-term exposure rather than cumulative effects. Blood arsenic levels, used less frequently, were often intermediate in terms of reflecting both recent and long-term exposure, contributing to inconsistencies in dose-response findings.</p><p>The variability in dose-response relationships across studies highlights the critical role of exposure assessment methods and matrices. While drinking water arsenic concentrations provided the most consistent results, urinary and blood arsenic measurements introduced variability due to differences in individual metabolism, exposure timing, and environmental factors. These findings emphasize the need for future studies to standardize exposure assessment methods and consider the matrix&#x02019;s influence when interpreting dose-response relationships.</p><p>The socioeconomic impact of cognitive deficits induced by arsenic exposure cannot be overstated. Children suffering from these deficits are likely to face challenges in academic achievement, resulting in lower educational attainment and reduced job prospects in adulthood [<xref rid="pone.0319104.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0319104.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. This perpetuates a cycle of poverty in communities already vulnerable to environmental toxins. Furthermore, the burden of cognitive deficits extends beyond the individual to the societal level, where increased healthcare costs and lost productivity impose significant economic strains. Addressing these socioeconomic impacts requires integrated strategies that combine health interventions with educational support programs, ensuring that affected children can achieve optimal developmental outcomes despite their exposure to arsenic.</p><p>Some studies have explored the impact of other contaminants alongside arsenic, particularly fluoride, to understand how multiple environmental toxins interact and affect cognitive development. These studies consistently find that arsenic exposure correlates with cognitive decline, even when accounting for the influence of other toxins [<xref rid="pone.0319104.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0319104.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0319104.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0319104.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0319104.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0319104.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. For instance, research conducted in China and Bangladesh has shown that arsenic exposure&#x02019;s neurotoxic effects persist across various cognitive domains, including IQ scores, processing speed, and memory recall, despite the presence of other contaminants like fluoride. This highlights the need for comprehensive interventions to address arsenic exposure specifically and reduce its direct impact on children&#x02019;s cognitive health.</p><p>Despite the extensive data linking arsenic exposure to cognitive deficits, there remain significant gaps in our understanding of the dose-response relationship and the potential for recovery following exposure cessation. Future research should aim to define the threshold levels of arsenic exposure that lead to detectable cognitive impairments and to evaluate the effectiveness of various mitigation strategies in reversing these effects.</p><p>Additionally, there is a need for longitudinal studies that follow children over longer periods to assess the lasting impacts of early-life exposure and the efficacy of early interventions. Such studies would provide invaluable insights into the critical windows of vulnerability and the potential for neuroplasticity and recovery in the developing brain.</p><p>This study has several notable strengths. First, it offers a comprehensive analysis of existing data on the impact of arsenic exposure on cognitive functions, synthesizing a wide range of sources. The use of established risk assessment tools such as the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale ensures a structured evaluation of study quality. Additionally, a rigorous data extraction and analysis protocol enhances the reliability of the results.</p><p>However, some limitations should also be acknowledged. The included studies varied significantly in terms of population, dosage, and duration of exposure, leading to considerable heterogeneity in the findings. This variation may limit the generalizability of the results to broader populations. Moreover, most of the included studies were observational, which restricts our ability to establish causality between arsenic exposure and memory impairment. Lastly, despite efforts to gather all relevant studies, potential publication bias cannot be completely ruled out.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec032"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The evidence from this systematic review clearly indicates that arsenic exposure is a significant risk factor for cognitive impairment in children, with potential long-term effects that could span a lifetime. The findings call for an immediate and robust response to reduce arsenic exposure in affected regions and to protect future generations from its debilitating effects on brain development and cognitive function. Policymakers, researchers, and public health officials must prioritize this issue, ensuring that children in all regions have the opportunity to achieve their full cognitive potential in a safe and supportive environment.</p></sec><sec id="sec033" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material id="pone.0319104.s001" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>List of all the extracted studies for secondary screening (N = 74).</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0319104.s001.docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pone.0319104.s002" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>PRISMA 2020 Checklist.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0319104.s002.docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pone.0319104.s003" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S2 File</label><caption><title>Data file.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0319104.s003.xlsx"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0319104.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Bhat</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Ravi</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Tian</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Singh</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name>. <article-title>Arsenic contamination needs serious attention: an opinion and global scenario</article-title>. <source>Pollutants</source>. <year>2024</year>;<volume>4</volume>(<issue>2</issue>):<fpage>196</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>211</lpage>. <comment>doi: </comment><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.3390/pollutants4020013</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0319104.ref002"><label>2</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Khosravi-Darani</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Rehman</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Katsoyiannis</surname><given-names>IA</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Kokkinos</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Zouboulis</surname><given-names>AI</given-names></name>. <article-title>Arsenic exposure via contaminated water and food sources</article-title>. <source>Water</source>. <year>2022</year>;<volume>14</volume>(<issue>12</issue>):<fpage>1884</fpage>. <comment>doi: </comment><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.3390/w14121884</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0319104.ref003"><label>3</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Thakur</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Rachamalla</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Niyogi</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Datusalia</surname><given-names>AK</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Flora</surname><given-names>SJS</given-names></name>. <article-title>Molecular mechanism of arsenic-induced neurotoxicity including neuronal dysfunctions</article-title>. <source>Int J Mol Sci</source>. <year>2021</year>;<volume>22</volume>(<issue>18</issue>):<fpage>10077</fpage>. <comment>doi: </comment><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.3390/ijms221810077</pub-id>
