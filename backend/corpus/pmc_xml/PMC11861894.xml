Furthermore, glycans on host cells serve as ligands for lectins/adhesins on bacteria for bacterium-host interactions in the colonization or attachment/invasion of bacteria. Defining the structure-function relationship of O-glycans is hindered by a lack of enzyme(s) to release sialylated O-glycans from glycoproteins. Here we show identification of endo-&#x003b1;-N-acetylgalactosaminidases (O-glycanases, GH101) with broad substrate specificities, termed Peptide:O-Glycosidase (POGase). In 5 POGase orthologs identified, we characterize one that releases sialylated O-glycans from glycopeptides, glycoproteins and biotherapeutics. Three peptide motifs differentiate the POGase existing in phylum <italic>Actinomycetota</italic> from known O-glycanases in other bacteria. While the GH101 domain classifies POGases, other domains confer the efficient enzyme activity and binding to major glycans decorating epithelial cells. The dual functional POGases encompassing broader O-glycanase and adhesin activities will facilitate the study of O-glycomics, quality assessment of biotherapeutics, and development of microbiology and medicine.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="web-summary"><p id="Par2">This study identifies several&#x000a0;O-glycanases, termed Peptide:O-Glycosidases (POGases), with broad substrate specificities.

This contrasts with the study of N-glycans, which can be released by commercially available enzymes, such as PNGase F/A, leading to the advancement of functional N-glycomics.</p><p id="Par4">Endo-&#x003b1;-N-acetylgalactosaminidase (EC 3.2.1.97), also known as O-glycanase or O-glycosidase, belongs to the glycoside hydrolase family 101 (GH101), which catalyzes the hydrolysis of Core 1 disaccharide, Gal&#x003b2;1,3GalNAc&#x003b1;- from glycoproteins.

No naturally occurring enzyme has been identified to efficiently cleave sialylated O-glycans from glycoproteins. Therefore, the currently available O-glycanases, including mutants, are not applicable to functional O-glycomics studies or quality control strategies in manufacturing O-glycoprotein drugs that primarily possess sialylated O-glycans. The identification of a universal O-glycanase that can cleave a broad range of sialylated O-glycans, is an unmet need that will fill knowledge gaps in multiple scientific disciplines and improve the control of safe and effective drug products.</p><p id="Par5">Here we describe the screening and identification of a previously uncharacterized endo-&#x003b1;-N-acetylgalactosaminidase with broad substrate specificity, termed Peptide:O-Glycosidase (POGase) that cleaves a variety of neutral and sialylated O-glycans, Core 1, Core 2, Core 3, &#x003b1;2,3sialylCore 1, and sialylCore 2 from glycopeptides, glycoproteins, and therapeutic glycoproteins. Furthermore, GlycanArray analysis and cell-binding assay indicate that POGases also bind to major glycans found in epithelial cells, demonstrating their potential adhesin activity. The identification of POGases has the potential to impact numerous scientific disciplines including glycobiology, biotechnology, immunology, microbiology, and medicine.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Peptide:O-Glycosidase (POGase) orthologs were identified through screening putative O-glycanases with &#x003b1;2,3sialylCore 1-(4-MU)</title><p id="Par6">Using &#x003b1;2,3sialylCore 1-(4-methylumbelliferone, 4-MU), Neu5Ac&#x003b1;2,3Gal&#x003b2;1,3GalNAc&#x003b1;1-(4-MU) as the substrate (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1a&#x02013;d</xref>), we initially selected and screened 30 uncharacterized putative O-glycanases from different bacteria (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>, #1&#x02013;30).

MUC5AC glycopeptides primarily consisted of two &#x003b1;2,3sialylCore 1 O-glycans, <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> 1407.6 [M&#x02009;+&#x02009;2H]<sup>2+</sup> and <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> 938.7 [M&#x02009;+&#x02009;3H]<sup>3+</sup> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>, left panel), and a minor species with one &#x003b1;2,3sialylCore 1 O-glycan at one site, the Core 1 O-glycan or Tn antigen at the other.

Similarly, after POGase treatment, some MUC5AC glycopeptides remained as minor species or contained two &#x003b1;2,3sialylCore 1 O-glycan as the minor species (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>, right panel). More importantly, new peaks appeared corresponding to the unmodified peptide (<italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> 751.4 [M&#x02009;+&#x02009;2H]<sup>2+</sup> and <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> 1501.7 [M&#x02009;+&#x02009;H]<sup>+</sup>) and MUC5AC glycopeptide with one &#x003b1;2,3sialylCore 1 (<italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> 1079.5&#x000a0;[M&#x02009;+&#x02009;2H]<sup>2+</sup>).

Finally, the MUC5AC carrying two &#x003b1;2,3sialylCore 2 O-glycans (<italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> 1773.7 [M&#x02009;+&#x02009;2H]<sup>2+</sup> and 1182.2 [M&#x02009;+&#x02009;3H]<sup>3+</sup>) and a mixture of either &#x003b1;2,3sialylCore 2 O-glycan or &#x003b1;2,3sialylCore 1 O-glycan (<italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> 1590.2 [M&#x02009;+&#x02009;H]<sup>+</sup> and 1060.4 [M&#x02009;+&#x02009;2H]<sup>2+</sup>, respectively) were also tested (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4e</xref>, left panel). Treatment with POGase AS gave only a minor change in the glycopeptide pattern: two new peaks corresponding to the MUC5AC with one &#x003b1;2,3sialylCore 2 O-glycan (<italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> 1262.0 [M&#x02009;+&#x02009;2H] <sup>2+</sup> and 841.7 [M&#x02009;+&#x02009;3H]<sup>3+</sup>) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4e</xref>, right panel) appeared, which could be derived from the original MUC5AC glycopeptide after release of either one &#x003b1;2,3sialylCore 2 O-glycan or one &#x003b1;2,3sialylCore 1 O-glycan. Also, one minor peak with <italic>m/z</italic> of 1501.7 corresponding to the unmodified MUC5AC peptide appeared. To understand the efficiency of glycan release with POGase AS, the extracted ion chromatograms (XICs) of substrate and product peaks were extracted using a mass tolerance of 0.0500 Daltons, to facilitate high-accuracy mass filtering. The percentage of the peak area of each substrate peak, and product peak are summarized (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>). In &#x003b1;2,3sialylCore 1 CD24, the major product peak formed was &#x003b1;2,3sialylCore 1<sub>1</sub>-CD24, which accounted for 88.6% (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6a</xref>), while unmodified CD24 accounted for 5.8%. In contrast, the major product peak identified in &#x003b1;2,3sialylCore 1 MUC5AC was the unmodified MUC5AC peak which accounted for 30%, while the &#x003b1;2,3sialylCore 1<sub>1</sub>-MUC5AC peptide accounted for 22% (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6b</xref>). In both cases, POGase AS was not able to completely convert the glycopeptide substrate to a homogenous unmodified peptide substrate. In &#x003b1;2,3sialylCore 2 MUC5AC reactions, the major product identified was an &#x003b1;2,3sialylCore 2<sub>1</sub>-MUC5AC peptide which accounted for 45.7% (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6c</xref>). A small percentage of unmodified MUC5AC was detected, however, it only accounted for 1.8%. Although the substrate peaks &#x003b1;2,3sialylCore 2<sub>2</sub>-MUC5AC (23.9%) and &#x003b1;2,3sialylCore 1<sub>1,</sub> &#x003b1;2,3sialylCore 2<sub>1</sub>-MUC5AC (28.6%) remained after POGase AS treatment, a reduction of ~50% in both peaks were observed, indicating successful release of &#x003b1;2,3sialylated Core 1, and Core 2 O-glycans with preference to &#x003b1;2,3sialylCore 1. To further optimize the complete release of O-glycans by POGase, several factors including excess enzyme, and longer incubation periods were tested, however, full cleavage of sialylated O-glycans was not observed, most likely caused by enzyme stability issues during long incubation periods or product inhibition which will need to be further investigated. Nevertheless, unmodified peptides were generated from sialylated glycopeptides after POGase AS digestion, demonstrating its activity towards different sialylated O-glycans.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><title>MS analysis of CD24 and MUC5AC O-glycopeptides after POGase Treatment.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Schematic illustration of analytical&#x000a0;strategy: released O-glycans and peptides from glycopeptides by POGase AS were proceeded with permethylation for O-glycan analysis on MALDI-TOF and LC-MS/MS analysis, respectively. <bold>b</bold> Peptides from glycopeptides carrying Core 1: spectra of CD24 glycopeptides and MUC5AC glycopeptides carrying two Core 1 (CD24-T2 and MUC5AC-T2) and their corresponding peptides after POGase AS treatment were shown. <bold>c</bold> Mass spectra of digested CD24 glycopeptides carrying sialylCore 1: MS<sup>1</sup> of &#x003b1;2,3sialylCore 1 CD24 before and after POGase AS treatment were shown. <bold>d</bold> Mass spectra of digested MUC5AC carrying &#x003b1;2,3sialylCore 1: MS<sup>1</sup> of &#x003b1;2,3sialylCore 1 MUC5AC before and after POGase AS treatment were shown. <bold>e</bold> Mass spectra of digested MUC5AC carrying &#x003b1;2,3sialylCore 2: MS<sup>1</sup> of &#x003b1;2,3sialylCore 2 MUC5AC before and after POGase AS treatment were shown.

MALDI-TOF MS analysis of O-glycans released from &#x003b1;2,3sialylCore 2 MUC5AC (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4e</xref>) demonstrated two O-glycan peaks at <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> 779 and 575 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref> left panel) that correspond to a Core 2 O-glycan and a Core 6 O-glycan, respectively. The latter was unanticipated because GCNT2 is responsible for deriving a Core 2 O-glycan from Core 1, and appears to work on Tn antigen. MALDI-TOF MS analysis of O-glycans released from &#x003b1;2,3sialylCore 2 MUC5AC revealed evidence of mixed Core 1 and Core 2 oligosaccharides which included Core 1 (<italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> 534.3), &#x003b1;2,3sialylCore 1 (<italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> 895.5) and two sialylCore 2 O-glycans with or without a galactose residue on the &#x003b2;1,6GlcNAc branch (<italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> 1140.6 and <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> 1344.7, respectively) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>, right panel).

In comparison, O-glycan release from O-glycopeptides of abatacept and etanercept generated by proteinase K resulted in much cleaner O-glycan profiles, and enhanced release of the mono-sialylCore 1 (<italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> 895) in abatacept was observed (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6d, e</xref>, bottom panels). In addition to mono-sialylCore 1, POGase AS was capable of partially releasing di-sialylCore 1 O-glycans (<italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> 1256.6) in both therapeutic glycoproteins (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6d, e</xref>, bottom panels).

No evidence of di-substitution was observed to confirm that the major O-glycan species released was linear trisaccharide with an &#x003b1;2,3-linked sialic acid attached to the galactose instead of the branched glycoform which bears &#x003b1;2,6sialylation of the GalNAc core. Tandem mass spectra were not possible to obtain on the di-sialylCore 1 or di-sialylCore 2 peaks from POGase AS-treated samples due to the low peak abundance of the precursor ion. Together, these data further demonstrate that POGase AS can release intact sialylated O-glycans from glycoproteins and biotherapeutics.</p><p id="Par15">We attempted experiments on release, recovery, and MS analysis of O-glycans from more complex samples such as colon cancer cell extracts with digestion by POGase AS, however, we could not obtain clean O-glycan spectra. This is most likely due to the complexity of samples in nature, and importantly the limited accessibility of POGase AS to cluster O-glycans on mucin-domains of glycoproteins and mucins from cell extracts, which is a common obstacle for O-glycomics. Several strategies such as combining digestions of cellular glycoproteins with proteases, O-glycopeptidases, and mucinases, and importantly generating a universal POGase are currently taken to develop a feasible biotechnology for O-glycomics.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Three distinctive peptide sequences, Motif-1, Motif-2, and Motif-3, differentiate POGases from known O-glycanases&#x02014;sequence comparison of POGases to the known O-glycanases</title><p id="Par16">The above results demonstrated that POGases have broader substrate specificity than the known O-glycanases, indicating that structural differences exist between them. While these proteins all belong to the GH101 family, alignments of the sequences spanning GH101 domains of all 5 POGases against the 5 known O-glycanases revealed significant differences in three peptide motifs: Motif-1, AWGWMNQ in POGases versus GWD/NWLDN in O-glycanases; Motif-2 WANEEAY in POGases versus WSAEKDY in O-glycanases; and Motif-3, YSAWAWV/IEI in POGases versus YSLYLNTET (EngEF) or YAVYVGVDNR [EngBF, SpGH101(Q8DR60)] in O-glycanases (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>, Supplementary Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9</xref>). Motif-1 and -2 are within the predicted GH101 domain, and Motif-3 is C-terminal to the GH101 domain, but within other domains. These differences may account for the differences in substrate specificity between POGases and known O-glycanases. Additionally, compared to the known O-glycanases, the POGases are generally larger proteins with longer and less conserved sequences in their C-terminal regions. Interestingly, C-terminal regions of POGases contain one or two predicted domains, such as F5/8 type C domains, GalBD, or even sialidase-like domains with carbohydrate-binding properties. However, known O-glycanases often only possess one predicted carbohydrate-binding domain. Most POGases, except for POGase KS (#37), also contain an extra glycan-binding domain at their N-termini before the GH101 domain.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>&#x003b1;2,3SialylCore 1 and other O-glycan moieties can be docked in POGase AS&#x02014; structural modeling</title><p id="Par17">Structural modeling of POGase AS (#34) indicated complex structures composed of individually assembled domains with the GH101 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7a</xref>), and the overall 3D structure of POGase AS (Supplementary Movie <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Focusing on the predicted catalytic site within the GH101 domain revealed a channel consisting of two motifs (green) generating the active site lid to allow for proper orientation of the glycan&#x000a0;moieties in the active site, before being cleaved by the DDE catalytic triad (magenta) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7b</xref>), which is also found within the active site of known O-glycanases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. Two motifs make up the glycan coordination channel: AWGWMNQ (Motif-1) and WANEEAY (Motif-2) (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>). In the WWWY channel, two W residues in Motif-1, and the W and Y residues in Motif-2 seem to be involved in glycan positioning and binding as suggested by previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. In the known O-glycanases, these motifs are altered to GWDWLDQ (Motif-1) and either WSAEKDY, WGGDPAY, or WAADLTY (Motif-2) (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>, Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9</xref>). Previous studies have reported that the dual tryptophan active site lid residues, W864 and W866 in Motif-1 in EngBF, play a critical role in substrate recognition and properly positioning glycans for catalysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. The biggest difference between these motifs in POGases versus O-glycanases is that in 3D space there is a charge differential: zero charge in Motif-1 and two negative charges in Motif-2 for POGases, while there are 1 or 2 negatively charged residues in Motif-1 and one negatively charged residue in Motif-2 for known O-glycanases. The presence of these charged residues in the known O-glycanases likely contributes to a narrower substrate pool than the POGases. Furthermore, a highly conserved leucine (L867, numbering in EngBF) residue in known O-glycanases, was found to be substituted with a highly conserved methionine residue (M598, numbering in POGase AS) within Motif-1 in POGases (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>). It is therefore possible that the side-chain differences of M598 and L867 in combination with the charge status of Motif-1 and 2 in POGase AS, may alter the conformational dynamics of the glycan stabilization channel and play a critical role in the recognition of sialylated O-glycans. In terms of the role of the M/L substitution&#x02019;s effect on activity, the substitution seems to alter the area of hydrophobic interactions within the hydrophobic core of the enzymes. Evolutionary coupling analysis reveals that the M/L substitution will also induce a change in the residue that the M/L will interact within the hydrophobic core, namely I/F respectively (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>, Supplementary Movies <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">1</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">2</xref>). The M/I interaction interface has less area for the hydrophobic interaction to occur (less contact points) than the L/F pair, again suggesting a possible explanation for how the active site&#x02019;s flexibility is altered to allow for more complex (sialylated and branched) O-glycans. Together, the identity of these motifs in POGases likely allows for activity towards a larger pool of substrates leading to its broader substrate specificity.<fig id="Fig7"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption><title>Structural modeling of POGase AS.</title><p><bold>a</bold> POGase AS from AlphaFold2 with each domain is highlighted: GH101 domains 1&#x02013;5 are in white, GalBD domains (GH101 domain 6) are in yellow, the F5/8 type C domains are in purple, and unstructured or unannotated domains are in cyan. <bold>b</bold> Catalytic channel of POGase AS: the overall structure of the active site of POGase AS with &#x003b1;2,3sialylCore 1 in the binding pocket is focused.

For &#x003b1;2,3sialylCore 1, AutoDock Vina alone could not accurately orient the glycan in the active site, however, after incorporating an energetic penalty for suboptimal glycan torsion angles using Vina-Carb, the glycan retained a similar position to not only the disaccharide O-glycans docked in this study but a T antigen (Core 1) analog found in a spGH101 domain that has previously been experimentally derived<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. The distance of the anomeric carbon to the DDE catalytic triad in any of the docked structures presented here does significantly differ from an experimentally derived structure of a T antigen analog (Core 1) bound to an experimentally derived GH101 domain (PDB ID:5a56) (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">11</xref>), suggesting that the computationally predicted poses are conducive towards catalysis.</p><p id="Par19">We also attempted to dock the Core 2, GlcNAc&#x003b2;1,6(Gal&#x003b2;1,3)GalNAc&#x003b1; to the POGase AS catalytic site using AutoDock Vina and Vina-Carb, however, no reasonable pose was predicted. In contrast, the Core 2 glycan was able to be reasonably docked to one of the POGase orthologs, POGase KS (#37), which will be further investigated in a separate study. Despite attempts to dock &#x003b1;2,6sialylCore 1 into the active site, no reliable results could be observed, which could explain the observation of the limited activity of POGase AS on di-sialylCore 1 O-glycans. It should be noted that the computational prediction of substrate binding to predicted protein structures is reliant on the accurate prediction of amino acid side-chain orientations as well as the conformational dynamics of enzyme active sites. While it has been suggested that AlphaFold has appreciable accuracy in the prediction of amino acid side-chain orientations, experimental validation of computational predictions and resolution of discrepancies with the experimentally determined substrate binding of POGases is still needed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>.

The POGase KS (#37) is an exception with 1354 aa. Although POGases and O-glycanases share the GH101 domain at their N-terminal regions, the POGases have very large (~700&#x02013;1000 aa) and diverse C-terminal regions containing other domains such as F5/8 Type C domain and GalBD (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).

These features imply that the POGases may have additional function(s), such as carbohydrate-binding as adhesins. POGase TB was chosen for GlycanArray analysis since it was the first identified POGase ortholog, and its full-length (FL) and domain substructures, ND (N-terminal Domain) and CD (C-terminal&#x000a0;Domain) were expressed and obtained (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">12a</xref>) to test their potential glycan-binding activity. Binding activity was tested at 4&#x02009;&#x000b0;C rather than 25&#x02009;&#x000b0;C to limit the possible cleavage of the O-glycans by POGases. POGase TB-ND had little to no enzymatic activity to both substrates, Core 1 and &#x003b1;2,3sialylCore 1-(4-MU), while POGase TB-CD had no activity as expected (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">12b</xref>). Loss of enzymatic activity of POGase&#x000a0;TB-ND suggests that the overall fold or cooperativity between the two domains has been lost. GlycanArray data demonstrated significant and specific glycan-binding activities among the POGase TB-FL and POGase TB-CD, but not the POGase TB-ND (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8a</xref>, and <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">Supplementary Material</xref>). The consensus of their glycan-binding determinants is mainly the terminal &#x003b2;3Gal- and &#x003b2;3GalNAc- in three glycan motifs. They are: (I) Gal&#x003b2;3GalNAc- motif in Core 1 (including &#x003b1;2,6sialylCore 1), Core 2 (including sialylCore 2) O-glycans, and in BGA-like epitope (Gal&#x003b2;1,3GalNAc&#x003b1;1,3-), as well as in Gal&#x003b2;1,3GalNAc&#x003b2;1,3 in glycolipids; (II) Gal&#x003b2;3GlcNAc- motif in bivalent Type-I chains (Gal&#x003b2;1,3GlcNAc&#x003b2;1,2Man&#x003b1;-) of N-glycans and I antigen in O-glycans and others; and (III) GalNAc&#x003b2;3Gal- motif in terminal GalNAc&#x003b2;1,3Gal&#x003b1;/&#x003b2;- found in glycolipids of Globo-series. Interestingly, POGase TB-FL and POGase TB-CD are also bound to Tn antigen (GalNAc&#x003b1;1-<italic>O</italic>-linker) as a truncated O-glycan (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8b</xref>, and <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">Supplementary Material</xref>). Generally, sialylation of those motifs abolished the binding by POGase TB-FL and POGase TB-CD. Importantly these glycan motifs are mostly found in O-glycans, N-glycans, and glycolipids (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8b</xref>, and <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">Supplementary Material</xref>) that are commonly expressed on mammalian epithelial cells. Overall, POGase TB displayed higher binding signals than POGase TB-CD to their shared glycans, while POGase-CD appeared to have a broader specificity, such as both terminal GalNAc&#x003b1;- and GalNAc&#x003b2;-Linker (ID4 and 15) with similar affinity/signal (<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">Supplementary Material</xref>). Since POGase is expected to be expressed as a whole, the broader specificity of POGase-CD may not necessarily be biologically relevant and, thus should not be over-interpreted. Nevertheless, this data implies that the ND in the full-length POGase may have some indirect impact on glycan binding or recognition probably due to the conformational differences between the CD within the full-length protein versus the individual CD alone. Taken together, these data indicate that POGase TB is a general glycan-binding protein for O-glycans, the Type-I chain of N-glycans, and glycolipids.<fig id="Fig8"><label>Fig. 8</label><caption><title>Glycan-binding profiles.</title><p><bold>a</bold> GlycanArray Analysis: the POGase TB-FL, -ND, and -CD were analyzed on the nCFG GlycanArray, and the binding signal (relative fluorescence units, RFU) were measured and summarized on the bar graph (error bars, &#x000b1;1&#x02009;SD of four replicates, after eliminating the highest and lowest fluorescence reading from 6 glycan spots). <bold>b</bold> Shared Glycan determinants: Glycan motifs recognized by both POGase TB-FL and its -CD were grouped based on the Motifs (I, II, III) in (<bold>a</bold>).

Deeper analysis reveals alterations in Motif-1 in the active site identified via structural analysis, with changes in the charge states, architecture, and predicted flexibility likely leading to distinct differences in substrate recognition and, thus specificity. Evolutionary coupled (EC) analysis has identified residues that may have a role in this substrate recognition, many of which match the structural analysis using the POGase AS model. Many of these EC results suggest that in addition to the substitutions in the motifs themselves, the hydrophobic core of the proteins seems to have a role in the substrate differential noted in the enzymes. M/I in POGase AS and L/F were identified via EC analysis (Supplementary Movie <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">2</xref>) which helped support the structural modeling results that were observed, suggesting that there may be more area for hydrophobic interactions to occur in the core of the protein, restricting flexibility in substrate limited O-glycanases (Supplementary Movie <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">2</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par25">We identified five previously uncharacterized O-glycanases with significant activity to hydrolyze sialylated O-glycans, termed POGases.

Moreover, the POGase tested was found to function as adhesins as demonstrated by binding to O-glycans and Type-I chains of N-glycans on GlycanArray and cells after neuraminidase treatment likely through their C-terminal domains of the proteins. Interestingly, the C-terminal domain/portion of POGases is also required for efficient enzymatic activity. The POGase orthologs seem to exist in a restricted bacterial clade derived from <italic>Actinomycetota</italic>. This report demonstrates that naturally occurring POGases in a specific clade of bacteria have dual activities: hydrolyzing sialylated O-glycans and functioning as adhesin molecules.</p><p id="Par26">The POGases, a previously uncharacterized class of O-glycanases, have much broader substrate specificities with distinctive properties compared to known O-glycanases. In addition to Core 1 and Core 3 disaccharide, its substrates include (1) sialylCore 1 O-glycans, including both &#x003b1;2,3 and &#x003b1;2,6sialylCore 1, and di-sialylCore 1; (2) Core 2 trisaccharide, galactosylated and sialylated Core 2 O-glycans; and (3) Core 3 O-glycans. All these encompass the major sialylated O-glycans of animal cells in nature. Furthermore, POGase AS has much higher activity than EngEF towards Core 1 (<italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> of 3.0&#x02009;&#x000b5;M versus 15.3&#x02009;&#x000b5;M) and Core 3 (<italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> of 453.9&#x02009;&#x000b5;M versus un-measurable) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Around 10 known O-glycanases (EC 3.2.1.97) in the GH101 family identified in several bacteria have a strict substrate specificity, acting only on Core 1, and, in a limited number of cases, Core 3 disaccharides with residual activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>.

The POGases have corresponding amino acid residues with small side chains (A/V/T). Recently, Hansen et al. generated an E1294A EngBF variant, beyond the GH101 domain, and showed the release of &#x003b1;2,3sialylCore 1 from fetuin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. The POGases have an Ala residue corresponding to the E1294 in EngBF, suggesting structures in other domains beyond GH101 may also contribute to substrate specificities of this family of enzymes. In comparison to the naturally occurring POGases identified in this work, the mutants of O-glycanases displayed only residual activity in releasing &#x003b1;2,3sialylCore 1 O-glycans (<italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> was not measurable)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Furthermore, other substrates were not tested for those mutants.</p><p id="Par27">The POGase is a promising tool for enzymatic release of intact sialylated O-glycans from glycoproteins for functional O-glycomics and quality assessments of therapeutic glycoproteins&#x000a0;(Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>), especially CHO-manufactured protein drugs which are predominantly glycosylated with Core 1-based sialylated O-glycans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. While the intensity of di-sialylated Core 1 and Core 2 O-glycans&#x000a0;released by POGase AS was lower than the &#x003b2;-eliminated counterparts, further investigation of undescribed POGase enzymes or mutagenesis may yield an ideal candidate with broad substrate specificity and enhanced efficiency for release of di-sialylCore 1 and other sialylated O-glycan species. The disintegration of the protein is a key step in the O-glycan release process by POGase AS which made release of di-sialylated O-glycans possible, most likely by removing steric hindrance from the peptide backbone and facilitating cleavage site accessibility. POGase AS is also a large protein with an estimated size of ~200&#x02009;kDa. Identifying a smaller functional domain might also facilitate accessibility for the release of O-glycans directly from undenatured glycoproteins and cell substrates.</p><p id="Par28">POGases have both distinctive and shared sequence motifs compared to known O-glycanases. The crystal structure of an O-glycanase, EngBF, was resolved and its substrate-binding domain was identified<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. In addition, several studies have investigated the sequences, motifs, and amino acid residues in the known O-glycanases required for enzymatic activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. POGases share most of the conserved sequences, motifs, and conserved amino acid residues that are critical for activity within their GH101 domain. Those include the motifs: VDWQD, EGHD, V/IHV/IN, RFLxN, and the DDE catalytic triad<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup> (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref> and Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9</xref>). Not surprisingly, POGases also have distinctive sequence motifs within the GH101 domain: POGases contain AWGWMNQ (Motif 1) and WANE/DEAY (Motif 2), whereas the known O-glycanases contain A/GWDWLDN (Motif 1) and WSAEKDY (Motif 2 of EngEF) (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>, and Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9</xref>) among others beyond the GH101 domain. Interestingly, EngPA has hybrid sequences of POGases and O-glycanases within the Motifs: AWDWMEQ (Motif-1), WANDENY (Motif-2), and HSLWAWVQI (Motif-3), however, its activity on sialylated O-glycans was not detected<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par29">Based on structural modeling, the POGases seem to use these two motifs to help stabilize glycans within their active site. The residues that help actively stabilize the glycans are three W residues and one Y residue found in these two motifs, with the other residues likely allowing for glycan specificity through charge state and flexibility. A comparison of the interface created by these motifs to the conjugate motifs created in other O-glycanases indicates the charge state in this cleft seems to be altered based on the change to the motifs from EngEF. This could begin to explain how the POGases are able to recognize a broader substrate pool, especially sialylated O-glycans. Molecular docking also consistently reveals that the various O-glycan moieties are consistently docking between the two motifs (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>, and Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">10</xref>), with the DDE catalytic triad embedded within the same cleft for POGase AS, which is consistent with what had been found in other O-glycanases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Because the models are in the apo confirmation, CH-&#x003c0; stacking is minimized between the WW domain and the docked glycan&#x000a0;moiety. Most docking algorithms omit CH-&#x003c0; from their scoring functions, with Autodock Vina and Vina-Carb both showing difficulties being able to accurately predict binding modes when CH-&#x003c0; stacking is involved in a CH/Protein interaction. However, since the model is in its apo form, the CH- &#x003c0; would be minimized, as it is shown in an experimentally derived structure (PDB ID:5a56) (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">11</xref>) when it&#x02019;s in its apo form. The position of the anomeric carbon relative to the DDE catalytic triad of the docked glycan&#x000a0;moieties is consistent with experimentally determined structures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup> and does not significantly differ based on average distance of the DDE residues from the anomeric carbon (T-test) (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">11</xref> and Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>).</p><p id="Par30">Within the computationally predicted docking poses of Core 1 and Core 3 glycans, we observe some torsion angles that are suboptimal for free glycans. To confirm and optimize the poses of the docked glycans, an algorithm, Vina-Carb was used to address the energetic constraints on intramolecular bonds within the glycan structure. Considering the intramolecular forces did not change the docked position of Core 1 and Core 3 glycans, suggesting that intramolecular constraints from suboptimal torsion angles are compensated for by induced fit and intermolecular contacts with the enzyme active site. Only after applying a penalty of 4.5&#x02009;kcal/mol for the intramolecular energy of the glycan conformation using Vina-Carb could the &#x003b1;2,3sialylCore 1 glycan moiety&#x000a0;be accurately oriented within the active site<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup> (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>). Taken together, these suggest a complex interplay between the POGase active site geometry and the conformational flexibility of its glycan substrates. When compared to the kinetics of POGase AS, Core 3 appears to have a similar affinity computationally, to Core 1, however, the position of the GlcNAc varies from the position of the Gal in the experimental structure, suggesting even more strain on the Core 3 glycan while being oriented between motif 1 and 2. The computational data for Core 1 and the &#x003b1;2,3sialylCore 1 glycan seem to match well with the kinetics as even more strain is evident on the &#x003b1;2,3sialylCore 1 glycan, leading to a lower affinity experimentally and computationally.</p><p id="Par31">A third motif, YSAWAWV/IEI, exists outside of the GH101 domain that is highly conserved within the POGases, however, its function remains elusive. It is proximal to the GH101 domain on the C-terminal end, possibly having implications in glycan binding and coordination before cleavage. POGases often have more than two glycan-binding domains in addition to the GH101 domain. The determinants of activity of POGases will be further investigated and confirmed by analyzing their crystal or cryo-EM structures in complex with sialylCore 1 O-glycan and other O-glycan substrates, to determine substrate/enzyme interactions and differences more accurately between the POGases and other known O-glycanases.</p><p id="Par32">Identification of the POGases will promote functional O-glycomic research and the development of therapeutic O-glycoproteins. Given the complexity and heterogeneity of O-glycosylation, structural analysis of O-glycans is still challenging as there is no universal O-glycanase that can release all sialylated O-glycans from glycoproteins. The current O-glycan release protocol relies on a chemical method, termed &#x003b2;-elimination, which has several limitations. Five identified and partially characterized POGases have residual activity to cleave &#x003b1;2,6sialylCore 1, and di-sialylCore 1 O-glycans, which also commonly occur on glycoproteins. The characterization of POGase AS showed that it is not a perfect tool yet, especially in application to cellular O-glycomic analysis, most likely due to the limited accessibility to mucin-domains of glycoproteins from cell extracts which is the common obstacle for O-glycomics. More efficient enzymes need to be screened or generated through mutagenesis. Identification of the POGases is a step forward to generate a universal enzyme with the capability to release all sialylated O-glycans. This could be potentially achievable by random mutagenesis or directed evolution approaches assisted by predictive artificial intelligence (AI). Information on POGase structure will greatly facilitate the generation of previously uncharacterized POGases with increased activity and specificity towards sialylated substrates. Interestingly, like many exo-glycosidases and endoglycosidases that were shown to have transglycosylation activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>, several known O-glycanases also appear to have transglycosylase activity and can transfer the Core 1 disaccharide to aglycone<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. The potential transglycosylase activity of POGases needs to be explored and could potentially revolutionize the synthesis of O-glycoproteins/peptides with sialylated O-glycans in vitro. A universal POGase can also make it possible for the characterization and control of O-glycosylation of therapeutic O-glycoproteins, thus facilitating the drug development.</p><p id="Par33">In addition to their glycan hydrolyzing activity, POGases also possess glycan-binding activity that may serve as adhesins for bacteria to colonize and/or invade through attachment to host cells. One of the POGase orthologs tested, POGase TB showed strong and specific binding to O-glycans, the type-I chain in N-glycans, and glycolipids on the Legacy CFGv6 glycan MicroArray (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>), a powerful platform to identify glycan-binding proteins and their specificities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. Furthermore, POGase TB can bind to HEK293 cells, confirming its cell-binding, thus potential adhesin activity. The POGases identified thus far are all expressed in different bacterial species. It is well-known that host cell glycans serve as ligands of bacterial lectins and toxins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. Besides digesting these glycans as the energy/nutrition source for the bacteria&#x02019;s own benefit, the endoglycosidases may also serve as adhesion molecules, or adhesins, and play important roles in their colonization. More importantly, some of those endoglycosidases may assist in invading through the barriers of epithelia and contribute to pathogenesis. For example, EngCP of <italic>Clostridium perfringens</italic> is a virulence factor involved in gangrene infections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. The POGase orthologs identified here exist in hundreds of different bacterium species, primarily in <italic>Actinomyces</italic> and <italic>Trueperella</italic> genus. The roles of those POGases in both the microbiology and their potential pathogenesis, including both in humans and animals, are unknown and warrant further investigation. For example, POGases exist in <italic>Actinomyces</italic> and other species of gut microbiota, which are found in association with Crohn&#x02019;s disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>, one of the major forms of inflammatory bowel disease. The adhesin function of POGases may play a critical role in the attachment of pathogens to host cells, an initial step for invasion and/or infection. This is supported by the POGase&#x02019;s high binding to Type-I chains on N-glycans in addition to sialylated O-glycans, which are commonly expressed in human epithelial cells such as GI tract epithelia. A better understanding of its role in microbiology and human diseases may evolve potential therapeutics such as inhibitors and even POGase-based vaccines. One may argue the two proposed activities of POGases, hydrolase and adhesin, are paradoxical. We propose that these two independent activities of POGases are dynamically active at different stages of the life cycle of bacteria as the two activities have two different targets: hydrolase activity that is specific to sialylated O-glycans and adhesin activity for all major types of glycosylation: O-glycans, N-glycans, and glycolipids. The adhesin activity of POGases may possibly be initiated upon contact of glycoproteins, mucins, or even glycolipids on the host cell surface, facilitating the attachment of bacteria for either colonization or invasion, while its glycosidase activity is executed when the glycoproteins on host cells are partially degraded by the concerted action of sialidases, O-glycopeptidases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup> and peptidases, such as StcE mucinase from <italic>E. coli</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>. The POGases were observed to cleave the sialylated O-glycans less efficiently from intact and unmodified glycoproteins compared to their denatured counterparts and glycopeptides on short peptide backbones (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). In both processes, the C-terminal portion of the POGases appears to be essential, for not only adhesin function but also sufficient hydrolase activity.</p><p id="Par34">The POGases are found within a monophyletic clade suggesting a shared evolutionary path.

These POGases have broad substrate specificities with abilities to cleave sialylCore 1 O-glycans, sialylCore 2, and Core 3 O-glycans, in addition to Core 1 O-glycans, with a higher efficiency compared to known O-glycanases. POGases were also found to specifically recognize and bind to O-glycans, Type-I chains on N-glycans, and even glycolipids that commonly decorate human epithelia, independent of their enzymatic activity. POGases evolutionarily exist in a distinctive clade of bacteria within the genus of bacteria expressing O-glycanases. The identification of POGases could facilitate developing tools for analyzing O-glycans of therapeutic proteins in quality assessment and for functional O-glycomics.

To prepare ligands for docking, hydrogens were added using OpenBabel<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref></sup>, oligosaccharides were manually kekulized, and active torsion and a generalized amber force field were applied for the flexibility of the glycan. To confirm accurate carbohydrate models, all structures were compared to known 2D models to ensure the correct placement of functional groups. Similarly, to prepare the receptor (GH101 Domain of POGase AS) for docking, hydrogens were added, aromatic residues were manually kekulized, and the receptor was set to rigid. The resulting PDBQT files were then used to conduct the docking. Docking was run with AutoDock Vina<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref></sup>, and Vina-Carb<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref></sup> with each specified O-glycan (Core 1, Core 3, and &#x003b1;2,3sialylCore 1) being separately docked at 20 poses, with exhaustiveness of 40 and energy range of 3 for Vina and Vina-Carb. Glycans were docked into the active site cleft using the coordinates 2.11, &#x02212;7.94, and &#x02212;1.18 for the center <italic>x</italic>, <italic>y</italic>, and <italic>z</italic> coordinates for AutoDock Vina to localize the docked poses into the active site cleft previously identified for GH101 domains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. For Vina-Carb, the same coordinates, number of poses, and energy range were used but also had a Chi energy coefficient of 1 and Chi energy cutoff of 2 to better incorporate carbohydrate-specific intramolecular forces. For comparison to experimentally solved GH101 domains, the POGase AS/glycan complex was aligned to PDB ID:5a56 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.rcsb.org/structure/5a56">https://www.rcsb.org/structure/5a56</ext-link>) which is a crystal structure of a GH101 domain with a Core 1 agonist in the active site cleft. To ensure a more accurate model, the pose that best reflected the experimental structure was chosen after three computational replicates. A standard student <italic>T</italic>-test was used to compare the distances of the DDE catalytic triad to the anomeric carbon.
