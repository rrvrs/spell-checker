Introduction</title><p>Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating, age-related lung disease of unknown etiologies. The fibrotic response is driven by abnormally activated alveolar epithelial cells where the secretion of excessive amounts of extracellular matrix, mainly collagens, results in scaring and the destruction of the lung architecture [<xref rid="B1-pharmaceutics-17-00253" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Numerous hypotheses propose that inflammation has a significant impact on IPF and identifying the inflammatory mediators is crucial for the diagnosis and treatment [<xref rid="B2-pharmaceutics-17-00253" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-pharmaceutics-17-00253" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In recent years, the importance of macrophages in the development of IPF has increasingly been recognized. Macrophages, classically activated (M1) or alternatively activated (M2), are involved in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis. M1 macrophages typically contribute to the inflammatory process, whereas M2 macrophages are involved in anti-inflammatory responses and the production of fibrotic mediators such as TGF-&#x003b2; and PDGF [<xref rid="B4-pharmaceutics-17-00253" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The macrophage mannose receptor (CD206) is expressed on the surface of M2 macrophages and immature dendritic cells. It contributes to tissue repair, the resolution of inflammation, the induction of immune tolerance, and protection from excessive inflammation [<xref rid="B5-pharmaceutics-17-00253" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The primary amino acid sequence of the murine macrophage mannose receptor protein reveals a high similarity to that of the human version with an overall identity of 82% at the amino acid level [<xref rid="B6-pharmaceutics-17-00253" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The non-invasive imaging of CD206 macrophages may assist in elucidating the processes of inflammation and fibrosis, thereby aiding in the development of more effective strategies for IPF. The FDA-approved drug tilmanocept, which is a DTPA-mannosyl-dextran, was recently investigated for targeting CD206 and SPECT imaging of bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis and in ex vivo lung biopsies illustrating the utility of CD206 imaging in fibrosis [<xref rid="B7-pharmaceutics-17-00253" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. To image CD206 macrophages, we employed a CD206 PET imaging probe, which was previously developed by our group using the Gallium-68 labeled linear version of the RP832c peptide [<xref rid="B8-pharmaceutics-17-00253" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-pharmaceutics-17-00253" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In addition, we assessed a second generation where the motivation for synthesizing the cyclic version of the peptide lies in the aim of achieving enhanced stability. The cyclic form of the RP832c peptide was compared to the RP832c linear version in the bleomycin-induced lung injury mouse model (BLM). PET imaging of CD206 macrophages was conducted with Gallium-68 labeled linear and cyclic RP832c in BLM and healthy mice. Biodistribution, as well as the staining of lung tissues utilizing CD206 immunohistochemistry (IHC), Hematoxylin/Eosin (H&#x00026;E), and Picro Sirius Red (PSR), was used to biologically validate our findings.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-pharmaceutics-17-00253"><title>2.

Upon the completion of the PET/CT imaging, mice were euthanized under anesthesia, and their organs were collected for biodistribution analysis. One cohort was monitored for a duration of 3 weeks through PET/CT scans to observe the development of pulmonary fibrosis, while healthy mice were utilized as the control group.

Discussion</title><p>Both linear and cyclic [<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga-RP832c were prepared in high RCYs (&#x0003e;99%) in agreement with our previous report [<xref rid="B8-pharmaceutics-17-00253" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Some degradation was observed after 3 h for both linear and cyclic [<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga-RP832c similar to data reported by Parker et al. for the linear version [<xref rid="B8-pharmaceutics-17-00253" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The difference between blocking and non-blocking groups for both linear and cyclic versions in CD206 plate binding assay indicated specific binding to CD206 which also aligns with earlier reports with this peptide [<xref rid="B9-pharmaceutics-17-00253" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>CD206+ macrophages play a significant role in the progression of lung fibrosis by exhibiting increased expression levels during the initial stages of the disease [<xref rid="B11-pharmaceutics-17-00253" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The research conducted by Wang et al. [<xref rid="B12-pharmaceutics-17-00253" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and Zou et al. [<xref rid="B13-pharmaceutics-17-00253" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] provides evidence that the expression levels of CD206 in alveolar macrophages (AMs) are consistently elevated in cases of pulmonary fibrosis, as observed in both murine models and patients. Wang et al. reported a notable increase in the population of CD206+ macrophages in the bleomycin-induced mouse model [<xref rid="B12-pharmaceutics-17-00253" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], while Zou et al. found that serum concentrations of CD206 were significantly higher in patients diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [<xref rid="B13-pharmaceutics-17-00253" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Through a longitudinal study, we investigated the trends in PET signals obtained from CD206 imaging. Our longitudinal study results revealed that the PET signals in the lungs (measured as SUV means) peaked at one week post bleomycin instillation in a 3-week duration in the BLM lung injury model, while the SUV mean decreased two and three weeks after BLM instillation. Subsequent biodistribution studies conducted immediately after PET imaging demonstrated that the lung %ID/gram values were consistent with the SUV mean values, which were highest at one week post bleomycin instillation. A comparison of the lung SUV mean and %ID/gram values between BLM and healthy mice indicated that both linear and cyclic versions accumulated in the lungs in the presence of lung injury. The increased accumulation of both versions in the lungs of the BLM model is likely attributed to the presence of CD206 expression in lung fibrotic tissues. These findings align with the results reported by Pommerolle et al., who observed differences in SPECT signals in <sup>99m</sup>Tc-tilmanocept imaging between mice receiving either NaCl or BLM [<xref rid="B7-pharmaceutics-17-00253" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Previous work demonstrates that CD206 expression is significantly upregulated in this model, peaking at one week post bleomycin instillation, which indicates that CD206+ macrophages play an important role during the early phase of lung injury [<xref rid="B8-pharmaceutics-17-00253" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In the current study, we present both linear and cyclic forms of the RP832c peptide, which exhibit a binding affinity to CD206 as determined by plate-binding assays. These findings may elucidate the relationship between the observed peak PET/CT signals (SUV means) and ID/gram values in lung tissue, alongside the highest levels of CD206 expression noted one week post bleomycin instillation over a three-week period.</p><p>H&#x00026;E staining was used to reveal the anatomical disparities between the BLM model and healthy control mice. The observed differences in the BLM model, such as thickening of the bronchiolar wall and distended blood vessels, decreased alveolar spaces and fibrotic tissues like interstitial fibrosis/collagen were consistent with the findings reported by Ghebremedhin et al., who detailed the distinctions between the control group and bleomycin-induced lung samples [<xref rid="B8-pharmaceutics-17-00253" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. CD206 expression in lung slides from the BLM model was evaluated through the IHC staining of CD206. The results indicated that CD206 expression was specifically observed in regions that aligned with the fibrotic tissues in the BLM model. Additionally, the lung samples were stained with PSR to establish a visual association between the fibrotic tissues and the CD206 IHC staining. The absence of CD206 expression and PSR-stained fibrotic tissues in healthy mice serves as evidence for the existence of CD206 macrophages in BLM, aligning with the findings reported by Pommerolle et al. who demonstrated CD206 and PSR staining outcomes in post-99mTc-tilmanocept imaging among mice received NaCl and BLM [<xref rid="B7-pharmaceutics-17-00253" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The analysis of CD206 staining in lung tissues from both the BLM model and healthy mice reveals an absence of detectable CD206 staining in the healthy mice, in contrast to elevated scores observed in the lung tissues of the BLM model. Furthermore, a correlation exists between the PET/CT SUV values in the lungs and the CD206 scores from CD206 staining, with higher values recorded in the BLM model and lower values in the healthy mice correlating to imaging with both linear and cyclic [<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga-RP832c. The results obtained from PET/CT imaging, biodistribution studies, and CD206 staining for both linear and cyclic [<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga-RP832c consistently demonstrate that the peak values observed at one week post bleomycin instillation are likely attributable to the highest CD206 expression at this timepoint in the bleomycin-induced lung injury model.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec5-pharmaceutics-17-00253"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>The findings of this study indicate that both linear and cyclic [<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga-RP832c exhibit a specific binding to CD206 macrophages specifically in the lungs of a bleomycin-induced lung injury model, which serves as a representation of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis in mice. The demonstrated affinity to CD206 macrophages, along with the differentiation from healthy mice, is substantiated through PET/CT imaging, biodistribution studies, and CD206 staining analyses. This binding affinity holds potential for a PET imaging probe targeting CD206 macrophages. Furthermore, the effective non-invasive PET imaging of CD206 macrophages could advance our comprehension of the underlying mechanisms associated with IPF and facilitate the formulation of diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. In the future. peptide stability could be enhanced through the inclusion of non-natural amino acids. Overall, our study suggests the feasibility of clinical trials imaging CD206 in patients with lung fibrosis.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>Use of the PET/CT was enabled by UAB&#x02019;s Preclinical Imaging Shared Facility and O&#x02019;Neal Cancer Center Grant P30CA013148.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclaimer/Publisher&#x02019;s Note:</bold> The statements, opinions and data contained in all publications are solely those of the individual author(s) and contributor(s) and not of MDPI and/or the editor(s).
