Introduction</title><p>Feline reproduction has not received a great amount of investigation and attention [<xref rid="B1-vetsci-11-00663" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Abortion is among the primary reasons for pregnancy termination in felines. Within this area of research, hormonal and antibiotic therapies are predominantly utilized [<xref rid="B2-vetsci-11-00663" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-vetsci-11-00663" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. However, there has been a surge in reports detailing embryonic malformations, infertility, and various side effects resulting from the overuse of hormones and antibiotics. Thus, the creation of secure and potent fetal safeguarding products is crucial for their clinical utility in diminishing the rate of feline abortions and for the conservation of elite breeds.</p><p><italic toggle="yes">Atractylodes macrocephala Koidz</italic> (AMK) has been commonly used in the clinical prescription for preserving fetuses, and its fetal safety effects have been confirmed by thousands of years of medical practice in traditional Chinese medicine [<xref rid="B4-vetsci-11-00663" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. As one of the major bioactive components in AMK, <italic toggle="yes">Atractylenolide I</italic> (AT-I) is a naturally occurring sesquiterpene lactone that has been found to display a wide range of pharmacological and biological activities such as anti-atherosclerotic activity and the treatment of various inflammatory illnesses [<xref rid="B5-vetsci-11-00663" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-vetsci-11-00663" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-vetsci-11-00663" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-vetsci-11-00663" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>Progesterone (P4) has a variety of physiological functions, such as promoting endometrial decidualization, establishing maternal&#x02013;fetal immune tolerance, inhibiting inflammatory responses, and improving uterine&#x02013;placental circulation, which are prerequisites for the maintenance of pregnancy [<xref rid="B9-vetsci-11-00663" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-vetsci-11-00663" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Insufficient secretion of P<sub>4</sub> affects endometrial secretion, thereby affecting embryo implantation and development. In early embryonic development, P<sub>4</sub> mainly comes from luteal granulosa cells, so the activity of granulosa cells plays a very important role in corpus luteum (CL) development and early pregnancy maintenance [<xref rid="B11-vetsci-11-00663" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-vetsci-11-00663" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The CL is the primary provider of progesterone in felines, yet the placenta of cats may contribute to the maintenance of pregnancy through local paracrine or autocrine processes [<xref rid="B13-vetsci-11-00663" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Maintaining a certain concentration of estradiol (E<sub>2</sub>) can increase the uterine placental blood flow and increase the sensitivity of the uterus to P<sub>4</sub> [<xref rid="B14-vetsci-11-00663" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. E<sub>2</sub> plays a role in the endometrium mainly through its homologous nuclear receptors ESR1 and ESR2, and participates in the decidualization process of the endometrium through the ERK/MAPK pathway [<xref rid="B14-vetsci-11-00663" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Studies have shown that if the E<sub>2</sub> content is too low, it would lead to embryo implantation failure [<xref rid="B15-vetsci-11-00663" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Therefore, determining the effect of AT-I on the secretion of E<sub>2</sub> and P<sub>4</sub> in feline ovarian granulosa cells (FOGCs) might contribute to our understanding of the protection of AMK in early pregnancy.</p><p>In recent years, the high-throughput RNA sequencing technique (RNA-seq) has emerged as a powerful tool for transcriptome analysis [<xref rid="B16-vetsci-11-00663" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. By using this method, it might help to assess the changes in the transcriptome in FOGCs upon treatment with AT-I at the whole genome scale, contributing to explaining the mechanism of how AT-I regulates the changes in FOGCs.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-vetsci-11-00663"><title>2.

Culture of Primary Feline Ovarian Granulosa Cells</title><p>FOGCs were obtained from fresh ovarian tissues of healthy and diestrus period felines between six months and two years old, which were under sterilization operation in the animal hospital of Inner Mongolia Agricultural University. The feline ovarian tissues were maintained in a vacuum thermos flask containing sterile physiological saline and transported to the laboratory within 2 h. The ovarian tissues were washed several times with 37 &#x000b0;C DPBS solution (Gibco, San Diego, CA, USA), which contained 3% penicillin and streptomycin (Gibco, San Diego, CA, USA), until the tissues were completely clean. The tissues were then transferred to a 300 mm diameter plate with 0.5 mL of 12% fetal calf serum-supplemented Ham&#x02019;s F-12 nutrient mixture (DMEM/F12, Gibco, Grant Island, NY, USA). Thereafter, the follicular fluid and cumulus&#x02013;oocyte complexes (COCs) from primary follicles between 1 and 1.5 mm in diameter were aspirated by using a 2.5 mL aseptic syringe with a needle size of 0.45 &#x000d7; 13 mm. Collected cells were transferred to a 1 mL centrifuge tube and centrifuged at 503.1&#x000d7; <italic toggle="yes">g</italic> for 3 min at 23&#x02013;25 &#x000b0;C; then, the sediment was harvested and washed with DPBS solution. This process was repeated three times. Afterward, the isolated FOGCs were transferred to a 25 cm<sup>2</sup> cell culture bottle (Thermo, Waltham, MA, USA), and cultivated in a 5% CO<sub>2</sub> incubator at 37 &#x000b0;C. Cell growth and morphological characteristics were observed with an inverted microscope (Philips, Tokyo, Japan). After 72 h, the oocytes were washed out with DPBS at 37 &#x000b0;C, and the granulosa cells were isolated. Then, the medium was renewed routinely every other day until the cell density reached 75&#x02013;80% (normally 3&#x02013;4 days). Then, it was digested with 0.25% trypsin-EDTA (Gibco, San Diego, MA, USA) of 1 mL for 2 min, and the digestion was terminated with the DMEM/F12 culture medium containing 12% serum. After fully mixing, it was inoculated at a split ratio of 1:2 for subsequent cultivation.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3-vetsci-11-00663"><title>2.3.

Thereafter, the slides were stored in an autoclaved wet box that was placed in a 37 &#x000b0;C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub> incubator for 24 h. After reaching 70% confluence, the slides were washed three times with DPBS and the cells were fixed for 20 min with cold acetone. The processed slides were then stained with two different staining methods: hematoxylin-eosin (HE) and Wright&#x02013;Giemsa. They were then photographed and analyzed by using a light microscope (ECLIPSE TS100-F. Nikon, Tokyo, Japan).</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot4-vetsci-11-00663"><title>2.4. Immunofluorescence Identification</title><p>To analyze the identity and purity of isolated FOGCs, immunofluorescence staining for a specific marker of ovarian granulosa cells was performed by FSHR (follicle-stimulating hormone receptor). An amount of 0.5 mL of the logarithmic growth phase FOGCs were seeded at a density of 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> cells/mL into 35 mm glass-bottom dishes (Shengyou Biotechnology, Hangzhou, China). After the cells reached 80% confluence, they were washed three times with aseptic DPBS solution, fixed for 30 min with 4% paraformaldehyde (Solarbio, Beijing, China) at 23&#x02013;25 &#x000b0;C, and washed three times with DPBS. After fixation, the FOGCs were incubated with 1 mL 0.25% Triton X-100 (PH = 7.40, Sigma-Aldrich, St.Louis, MO, USA) for 20 min, and then washed three times with DPBS. After blocking for non-specific binding sites by BSA, the cells were stained with a primary antibody to the FSHR (1:200, Rabbit Anti-FSH receptor antibody; BS-0895R; Bioss; Beijing, China) overnight at 4 &#x000b0;C. The granulosa cells were washed three times in DPBS and incubated with a secondary antibody (Alx647; donkey-anti-rabbit IgG; Jackson, PA, USA) for 2 h at 23&#x02013;25 &#x000b0;C in the dark. After incubation, the cells were washed three times for 10 min with DPBS in the dark. Then, the nuclei were stained with DAPI, and washed on the decolorizing shaker four times for 10 min. Glass-bottom dishes were observed under an LSM 800 (Zeiss, Jena, Germany) laser confocal system.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot5-vetsci-11-00663"><title>2.5. Cell Viability Assay</title><p>The cell viability was assessed using Cell Counting Kit-8 assays (CCK-8; BS350B; Biosharp; Shanghai, China). The second-generation feline ovary granule cells were used, washed with DPBS, and 1 mL of 0.25% trypsin&#x02013;EDTA was added to digest them for 2 min. Thereafter, the DMEM/F12 medium containing 12% fetal bovine serum (Excell Biology, Shanghai, China) was added to stop the digestion. The pipetting was repeated to ensure that the cells are away from the wall and uniformly distributed. After digestion, the cell suspension concentration was adjusted to 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> cells/mL. Thereafter, a 96-well cell culture plate (Shengyou Biotechnology, Hangzhou, China) was taken, 100 &#x000b5;L of culture medium with cells was added to each well, and the plate was incubated for 12 h. Thereafter, 100 &#x000b5;L DPBS was added to the remaining wells to reduce evaporation. The cells in the plate were purified for 6 h (with the serum-free medium), the cell supernatant was purged after purification, and 100 &#x000b5;L medium (containing 12% serum) was added. The plate was cultivated for 6 h, 12 h, 24 h, 36 h, and 48 h, and then CCK-8 was added for 4 h. After then, the absorbance value (OD value) of each well was measured with a microplate reader at a wavelength of 450 nm.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot6-vetsci-11-00663"><title>2.6.

After incubation for 0 h, 12 h, 24 h, 36 h, and 48 h, respectively, the supernatant was aspirated and used for subsequent experiments. The control cells were treated with the DMEM/F12 medium with the same time condition. Three distinct biological replicates were set up for both the treatment and control experiments.</p><p>The amount of E<sub>2</sub> within the culture medium was evaluated by means of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Wuhan Xinqidi Biological Technology; Wuhan, China) according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. The estradiol standard curve ranged from 0 to 1000 pg/mL. The samples were analyzed in triplicates. The assay sensitivity, range, and intra-assay coefficient of variation were 5 pg/mL, 15.6&#x02013;1000 pg/mL, and &#x02264;8%, respectively.

FOGCs were seeded at a density of 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> cells/mL in 6-well cell culture plates and cultivated at 37 &#x000b0;C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> until they reached 70% confluence. The supernatant from the cell culture was then taken off, and the FOGC monolayer received a fresh 2 mL addition of DMEM/F12 medium with 10 &#x000b5;mol/L AT-I. The plate was subsequently placed in an incubator for 36 h, maintaining a temperature of 37 &#x000b0;C and a CO<sub>2</sub> concentration of 5%. After AT-I treatment, FOGCs were photographed and analyzed for potential morphological changes using an inverted microscope (Philips, Tokyo, Japan). The supernatant was aspirated and used for subsequent experiments. Subsequently, the FOGCs underwent a meticulous triple wash with DPBS to guarantee the complete removal of any residual drug and the cells were then prepared for transcription analysis. The control cells received treatment exclusively with the DMEM/F12 medium.

RNA Library Construction and Sequencing</title><p>The total RNA from untreated and AT-I-treated FOGCs was extracted according to the instructions of the Axygen-RNA extraction kit (AxyGen, Hangzhou, China), and there were three biological repeats in each group. Bioanalyzer 2100 and RNA 6000 Nano LabChip Kit (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) were thereafter used to analyze the quantity and purity of total RNA, yielding RIN scores &#x0003e; 8.0, in accordance with the testing standard. Magnetic beads connected with Oligo were used to enrich and purify eukaryotic mRNA with a poly-A tail. The extracted eukaryotic mRNA was randomly broken into short fragments by the fragmentation reagent (Fragmentation Buffer). Using the fragmented mRNA as the template, one-strand cDNA was synthesized by a six-base random primer (Random hexamers), and then the buffer, dNTPs, RNaseH, and DNA Polymerase I were added to synthesize the two-strand cDNA. The cDNA double-stranded product was purified by AMPureXP beads. The viscous end of the DNA was repaired to a flat end by T4 DNA polymerase and Klenow DNA polymerase, and the 3&#x02019; end was selected by adding base An and spliced AMPureXP beads. Finally, the final sequencing library was obtained by PCR amplification. After passing the quality inspection of the library, the library was sequenced with Illumina Hiseq 4000 to produce 150 bp double-terminal data. The cDNA library was sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 4000 sequencing platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) provided by Majorbio Bio-pharm Technology Co., Ltd.

The sequencing quality was authenticated through the utilization of FASTQC software (Version 0.11.6), which assessed the Q20, Q30, and GC content of the clean data. All analyses that followed were performed on the basis of these clean, high-quality data. The filtered reads were then aligned and mapped to the reference genome using Hisat 2.0. The aligned read files were processed using Cufflinks [<xref rid="B18-vetsci-11-00663" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], which uses the normalized RNA-seq fragment counts to measure the relative abundances of the different transcripts.

The histogram of GO enrichment analysis is mainly reflected in biological processes, cellular components, and molecular functions. In biological processes, 644 DEGs are assigned to the regulation of biological processes, such as cellular processes, single-organism process, biological regulation, regulation of biological process development, and metabolic processes. In the cell component field, 308 DEGs belong to the cell, the cell part, and membrane.

Discussion</title><p>AT-I has been found to be the major bioactive component from AMK, which is a medicinal plant that has been used as a pharmacological agent for the treatment of threatened miscarriages in humans for a long time [<xref rid="B4-vetsci-11-00663" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In most mammalian species the CL is responsible for P<sub>4</sub> production during the early stages of pregnancy, but as pregnancy proceeds the placenta may take over steroid production. The identification of the P<sub>4</sub> secretion source in cats varies among different studies. A study demonstrated that pregnant queens ovariectomized at day 30 or 45 of gestation exhibited a decline in serum P<sub>4</sub> concentration and subsequently aborted; however, pregnancy was maintained by supplementation of the queens with synthetic progesterone after ovariectomy [<xref rid="B22-vetsci-11-00663" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Braun BC et al. conclude that the feline placenta can produce P<sub>4</sub> [<xref rid="B14-vetsci-11-00663" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], suggesting that the feto-placental unit could be a source of gestational progesterone. So, it is currently widely believed that the CL is the main source of P<sub>4</sub> in cats, but the placenta might locally support pregnancy via para- or autocrine mechanisms [<xref rid="B13-vetsci-11-00663" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The CL is an essential organ for maintaining early pregnancy, and luteal dysfunction could cause infertility and abortions [<xref rid="B9-vetsci-11-00663" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The CL is mainly composed of large luteum cells (LLCs) and a little amount of small luteum cells (SLCs). LLCs, which have a stronger steroidogenic capacity than SLCs, mainly originate from ovarian granulosa cells [<xref rid="B23-vetsci-11-00663" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. As the major bioactive component of AMK, the effect of AT-I on the ovarian granulosa cells might contribute to our understanding of AMK treatment of threatened miscarriages. This study found that AT-I could promote proliferation and the secretion of E<sub>2</sub> and P<sub>4</sub> in FOGCs. The transcriptome profile of differential gene expression in FOGCs treated with the AT-I was also examined in this report.</p><p>Ovarian granulosa cells are the largest cell group within the follicles. They not only cooperate with theca interstitial cells to regulate the synthesis of female steroid hormones, but also can regulate both the growth and maturation of oocytes [<xref rid="B24-vetsci-11-00663" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. At present, there is only one method to culture primary FOGCs, which is by slicing ovaries into many pieces [<xref rid="B25-vetsci-11-00663" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], but the cell identification was not carried out and the fibroblasts and endothelial cells could not be effectively removed. In this study, a new method was used: puncturing small follicles to cultivate primary FOGCs. As confirmed with FSHR immunofluorescence identification, the FOGC purity could reach 90%, which could be used to perform relative experiments.</p><p>After ovulation, ovarian granulosa cells proliferated and transformed to LLCs, which can have the ability to secrete amounts of P<sub>4</sub> and maintain early pregnancy [<xref rid="B26-vetsci-11-00663" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27-vetsci-11-00663" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]; Amelkina et al. revealed that ovarian granulosa cells could be transformed to LLCs, which can have the ability to secrete steroids in domestic cats [<xref rid="B28-vetsci-11-00663" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In this study, the FOGC viability was noticed to increase significantly in a dose- and time-dependent manner within a certain range (<xref rid="vetsci-11-00663-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>A,B) and the secretion of E<sub>2</sub> and P<sub>4</sub> increased significantly (<xref rid="vetsci-11-00663-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>) after AT-I treatment in FOGCs. The increase in E<sub>2</sub> and P<sub>4</sub> might be due to cell proliferation or enhanced single-cell secretion or a combined effect, which needs further investigation.</p><p>Recent evidence obtained with a luteal cell line has confirmed that E<sub>2</sub> can positively regulate the transcriptional activity of the <italic toggle="yes">SR-BI</italic> gene to speed up the occurrence of the luteinization process [<xref rid="B29-vetsci-11-00663" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In our study, after AT-I-stimulation the E<sub>2</sub> concentration was observed to increase in 36 h, and after AT-I treatment for 36 h FOGCs can produce a substantial amount of P<sub>4</sub> instead of the E<sub>2</sub> that they did before and the ratio of P<sub>4</sub>/E<sub>2</sub> indicated that the P<sub>4</sub> secretion was more obviously increased than E<sub>2</sub> secretion in FOGCs after 36 h, indicating that the AT-I might initiate the luteinization process, which resulted in the enhanced P<sub>4</sub> secretion in FOGCs.</p><p>In this study, a total of 137 DEGs were obtained after transcriptome sequencing on the FOGCs group treated with AT-I and these results were confirmed by RT-qPCR. The GO classification and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis have indicated that the DEGs are predominantly enriched in several significant pathways. These pathways are responsible for the regulation of cholesterol metabolism, ovarian steroidogenesis, the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, and the function of ABC transporters.</p><p>The unsaturated fatty acids are able to reduce the harmful cholesterol and triglyceride in the blood by esterifying cholesterol and promote cholesterol metabolism by effectively controlling the concentration of blood lipids, and increase the content of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), which is beneficial to the human body [<xref rid="B30-vetsci-11-00663" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The DEG <italic toggle="yes">SCD</italic>, a central regulator controlling the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids [<xref rid="B31-vetsci-11-00663" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], was up-regulated by AT-I, which might contribute to the secretion of E<sub>2</sub> and P<sub>4</sub> through regulating the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acid.</p><p>The cholesterol metabolism is critical for the production of the various essential membrane components, which is necessary for cell proliferation [<xref rid="B32-vetsci-11-00663" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In addition, as a precursor of steroid hormones, cholesterol is pivotal for ovarian follicular maturation [<xref rid="B33-vetsci-11-00663" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Interestingly, in this study it was found that the DEGs after AT-I treatment mainly related to cholesterol metabolism. A constant supply of cholesterol is needed for the synthesis of steroid hormones in the CL and maternal cholesterol metabolism plays a role in fetal development [<xref rid="B34-vetsci-11-00663" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Circulating plasma lipoproteins are the major source of cholesterol for steroid production in these different cells and cholesterol can be mainly obtained from circulating low-density lipoproteins (LDLs) and in small part from high-density lipoprotein (HDL) [<xref rid="B32-vetsci-11-00663" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B35-vetsci-11-00663" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. There are multiple systems involved in the cellular cholesterol delivery for steroidogenesis, mainly through the uptake of lipoprotein-derived cholesterol via LDLR-mediated endocytic pathways [<xref rid="B36-vetsci-11-00663" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. According to the RNA-seq analysis and RT-qPCR result, the expression of <italic toggle="yes">LDLR</italic> was induced by AT-I treatment in FOGCs, indicating that the uptake of lipoprotein-derived cholesterol might be activated, which could further stimulate the cholesterol biosynthesis. The identified DEG <italic toggle="yes">SREBF1</italic> that is responsible for encoding the sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) was able to promote the transcription of various lipogenesis involved in the biosynthesis of fatty acids and cholesterols and was involved in the regulation of sterol synthesis rates [<xref rid="B27-vetsci-11-00663" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B34-vetsci-11-00663" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="B37-vetsci-11-00663" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. It was reported that SREBP could up-regulate the LDLR expression, promote the cholesterol uptake [<xref rid="B33-vetsci-11-00663" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B38-vetsci-11-00663" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], and regulate the luteinization process through enhancing the sensitivity of human granulosa&#x02013;lutein cells to LH [<xref rid="B35-vetsci-11-00663" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. After AT-I treatment, the <italic toggle="yes">SREBF1</italic> expression was up-regulated more than in the control group, suggesting that the SREBF1 signaling pathway might be activated. The activation of the SREBF1 signaling pathway by AT-I treatment might contribute to the FOGC synthesis of steroid hormones. To further confirm the effect of AT-I on cholesterol metabolism, the biochemical test was used to detect the content of cholesterol in the cell supernatant. After AT-I treatment for 36 h, the contents of total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol both declined, whereas the synthesis of steroid hormones increased, suggesting that AT-I indeed significantly affects cholesterol metabolism and promotes the secretion of E<sub>2</sub> and P<sub>4</sub> in FOGCs. Li et al. showed that the AT-I dose dependently inhibited Ox-LDL-induced VSMC proliferation to treat atherosclerosis [<xref rid="B7-vetsci-11-00663" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], which might be the result of increased LDLR expression.</p><p>The ovaries are responsible for producing sex steroid hormones during reproductive life, which is important for both reproductive and somatic health [<xref rid="B27-vetsci-11-00663" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. After AT-I treatment, the secretion of E<sub>2</sub> and P<sub>4</sub> increased significantly in FOGCs. The <italic toggle="yes">CYP1A1</italic> was down-regulated and thereby can reduce the degradation of E<sub>2</sub> to modulate ovarian steroidogenesis. The identified DEG <italic toggle="yes">LDLR</italic> is also a key gene in ovarian steroidogenesis by promoting the cholesterol biosynthesis. The DEG <italic toggle="yes">StAR</italic> can introduce cholesterol into mitochondria, which is essential for steroid production. Cholesterol is the major raw material for ovarian steroid hormone synthesis. According to this study, the increased expression of <italic toggle="yes">LDLR</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">StAR</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">SREBF1</italic> was induced by AT-I treatment in FOGCs, and the increased gene expression might further stimulate the cholesterol biosynthesis by which leading ovarian steroidogenesis happened.</p><p>The increased <italic toggle="yes">ABCA-1</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">ABCG-1</italic> expression after AT-I treatment might improve the reverse cholesterol transport, and further speed up the metabolic process of cholesterol in FOGCs since the ABC transport system can drive intracellular superfluous cholesterol from arterial wall macrophages to the liver, thus allowing its excretion into the bile and feces as to speed up the metabolic process of cholesterol [<xref rid="B39-vetsci-11-00663" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].</p><p>AT-I can promote the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids to enhance the HDL content in plasma, and dramatically enhance the ability to transport LDL into cells by increased <italic toggle="yes">LDLR</italic> expression; the intake cholesterol can be used as raw material for ovarian steroidogenesis incloud E<sub>2</sub> and P<sub>4</sub>. At the same time, AT-I can dynamically promote the reverse transport of cholesterol by up-regulating <italic toggle="yes">ABCA1</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">ABCG-1</italic> gene expression to speed up the metabolic process of cholesterol. Taken together, after AT-I treatment the differential genes identified were mainly concentrated on cellular cholesterol uptake and efflux. Thus, it was hypothesized that AT-I might affect the secretion of E<sub>2</sub> and P<sub>4</sub> by promoting the cholesterol metabolism in the granulosa cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec5-vetsci-11-00663"><title>5.
