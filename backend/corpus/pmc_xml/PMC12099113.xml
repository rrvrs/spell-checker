Prevention programmes, non-operative treatment of acute tears and degenerative lesions, return to sports and patient-reported outcome measures will be presented in a part II article.</p></sec><sec id="section2-23259671251343088"><title>Methods:</title><p>This consensus followed the <italic toggle="yes">European Society for Sports Traumatology and Arthroscopy</italic> (ESSKA)&#x02019;s &#x0201c;formal consensus&#x0201d; methodology. For this combined ESSKA, <italic toggle="yes">American Orthopedic Society for Sports Medicine</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">American Academy of Sports Physical Therapy</italic> initiative, 67 experts (26 in the steering group and 41 in the rating group) from 14 countries (US and 13 European countries), including orthopaedic surgeons, sports medicine doctors and physiotherapists were involved. Steering group members established guiding questions, searched the literature and proposed statements. Rating group members assessed the statements according to a Likert scale and provided grades of recommendations, reaching a final agreement about rehabilitation of the knee after meniscus surgery. Final documents were then assessed by a peer review group to address the geographical adaptability.</p></sec><sec id="section3-23259671251343088"><title>Results:</title><p>The overall level of evidence in the literature was low. Of the 19 questions (leading to 29 statements), 1 received a Grade A of recommendation, 2 a Grade B, 9 a Grade C and 17 a Grade D. Nevertheless, the mean median rating of all questions was 8.2/9 (9 being the highest rating on a scale of 1&#x02013;9). The global mean rating was 8.4 &#x000b1; 0.2, indicating a high agreement. Rehabilitation depends on the type of lesion, the treatment performed and is the same after medial or lateral meniscus surgery. Rehabilitation after meniscectomy should follow a criterion-based rehabilitation protocol, based on milestones rather than a time-based protocol. After meniscus repair and reconstruction, rehabilitation should be progressed according to both time and criterion-based milestones.</p></sec><sec id="section4-23259671251343088"><title>Conclusion:</title><p>Rehabilitation after meniscus surgery is a debated topic that may influence surgical outcomes if not optimally performed.

The indications of treatment and practice have evolved with time due to the improved knowledge of the biomechanics of the meniscus and the consequences of extensive meniscectomies.<sup>

</sup> Recent studies focus on the indications for surgery, and if needed, which surgery preserves as much meniscus tissue as possible while providing the best short- and long-term functional results.</p><p>Following these trends, the <italic toggle="yes">European Society for Sports Traumatology and Arthroscopy</italic> (ESSKA) initiated the European Meniscus Consensus Project in 2016.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr2-23259671251343088" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
</sup> The aim of the first part was to provide a reference document for the management of degenerative meniscus lesions (DMLs), based both on scientific literature and balanced clinical expertise. Following this, arthroscopic partial meniscectomy became not a first but a second-line treatment for treating DML. In 2019, the second ESSKA meniscus consensus<sup>
<xref rid="bibr13-23259671251343088" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
</sup> provided recommendations for the surgical treatment of Traumatic meniscus tears. The main message of this second consensus was that preservation of the meniscus (including repair or partial meniscectomy) should be the first treatment philosophy for traumatic tears. Post-operative rehabilitation after meniscus surgery may vary with time, location/country, expertise and habit. Detailed rehabilitation decisions were not covered by the previous consensuses.</p><p>For anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction, robust rehabilitation protocols and recommendations exist.<sup><xref rid="bibr6-23259671251343088" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="bibr9-23259671251343088" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> For the meniscus, literature is still scarce.<sup><xref rid="bibr5-23259671251343088" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="bibr12-23259671251343088" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="bibr19-23259671251343088" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> While many indications and techniques of meniscus surgery are made based on sufficient evidence, many surgeons, sports medicine doctors and physiotherapists still face multiple options where recommendations are lacking, especially for the post-operative care after meniscus surgery. That is the reason why ESSKA, the American Orthopedic Society for Sports Medicine (AOSSM) and the <italic toggle="yes">American Academy of Sports Physical Therapy</italic> (AASPT), three main scientific societies working around meniscus pathology and rehabilitation, decided to cover the topic together in order to give unified messages.</p><p>The aim of this formal consensus was to provide recommendations for the usage of rehabilitation (including physical therapy) for patients with symptomatic menisci. The first part of the consensus will focus on rehabilitation performed after any surgical treatment for DMLs, traumatic meniscus tears (meniscectomy or repair) or meniscus reconstruction.</p><p>The second part of the consensus will cover prevention, non-operative treatment and return to sports (RTS) modalities.

A steering group was built with experts in the field of meniscus and rehabilitation. The steering group was divided into two groups, one being mainly responsible for developing questions and statement drafts (question group) and the other one for screening the current literature and providing evidence to support the development of statements (literature group).</p><p>The consensus equally involved orthopaedic surgeons, physiotherapists and sports medicine practitioners, who were equally distributed among the United States and Europe and were equally selected by AOSSM and AASPT. First, the question group queried relevant topics in the field. According to the questions, literature was searched and summarized by the literature group. This comprehensive search was performed on MEDLINE (Pubmed), Web of Science and SCOPUS databases without time constraints for the search. All clinical studies were included (randomized and non-randomized clinical trials, multicenter studies, reviews, systematic reviews and meta-analyses). The process was restricted to the English language. Search String was validated by the group and is provided as <ext-link xlink:href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/suppl/10.1177/23259671251343088" ext-link-type="uri">Supplement 1</ext-link>.</p><p>Overall, 395 relevant papers were screened and included, and additional literature was manually searched. Each bibliography of the full-text articles was screened by hand for inclusion. Any disagreements were discussed and settled between the members of the literature group. After reviewing the literature, the question/statement group formulated recommendation statements to answer the agreed-upon questions and added grading according to the level of evidence (LOE) supporting the statements. Grade A was defined as a high level of scientific support, Grade B as a scientific presumption, Grade C as a low level of scientific support, and Grade D as an expert opinion. After recommendations were completed, an independent rating group rated the statements according to scientific quality and clinical experience using the Likert scale (ranging from 1 to 9 [i.e., totally inappropriate to totally appropriate]). The final agreement was classified as high (median value &#x02265;7, and the ratings were all &#x02265;7) or Relative (median value &#x02265;7, all scores &#x0003e;5).</p><p>At the end of the first round, 19 questions (29 statements overall) focusing on rehabilitation after meniscus surgery were formulated by the steering group. A revised manuscript draft was prepared and resubmitted to the rating group for a second assessment for any statements where the median agreement was below 7. The same level of agreement was applied for the second round. A combined steering-rating group meeting allowed us to finalize the last version of the document.</p><p>The last version of the manuscript was finally reviewed by representatives of the affiliated scientific societies of ESSKA, AOSSM and AASPT to produce the final consensus statement. The aim of this last step was to check the geographic adaptability and clinical clarity for worldwide use.

Six questions went on to a second revision and rating.
