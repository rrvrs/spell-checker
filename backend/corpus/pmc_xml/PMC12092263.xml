A previous reconsolidation intervention for spider fear abruptly reduced avoidance behaviour, whereas changes in self-reported fear followed later. In this pre-registered placebo-controlled study, we first aimed to conceptually replicate these effects in spider phobia. Second, we investigated whether re-encountering the phobic cue after the reconsolidation intervention is necessary for changes in self-reported fear to occur. Third, we tested whether the window to trigger such changes is time limited. Individuals with spider phobia (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;69) were randomized into three groups and underwent a memory reactivation procedure with a tarantula, followed immediately by propranolol (reconsolidation intervention) or placebo. One reconsolidation intervention group and the placebo group re-encountered spiders two days after treatment in behavioural approach tasks, whereas another reconsolidation intervention group re-encountered spiders after four weeks. Changes in spider avoidance behaviour and self-reported fear were followed for one year. In the short term, the reconsolidation intervention was not more effective than placebo: both conditions benefited from the intervention. In the long term, the reconsolidation intervention was more effective than placebo, but only when the phobic stimulus was re-encountered within days after treatment. Specifically, we found less tarantula avoidance behaviour and self-reported fear over the course of one year when spiders were re-encountered two days after the reconsolidation intervention, but not when the behavioural test was conducted four weeks after the intervention. These findings challenge the idea that a reconsolidation-inspired intervention alone is sufficient to treat clinical fears: Experiencing the behavioural change during the re-encounter within days after the reconsolidation window has closed seems crucial to observe a lasting fear reduction.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Psychology</kwd><kwd>Psychiatric disorders</kwd><kwd>Neuroscience</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>ERC Advanced Grant 743263 awarded to Dr. Merel Kindt.</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>This study was funded by an ERC Advanced Grant 743263 awarded to MK.

However, many people relapse after initially successful treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The dominant model of exposure treatment suggests that a novel, fear-inhibiting memory trace is formed during exposure that competes with the older, maladaptive fear memory, which can resurface over time, when highly stressed, or when encountering the feared situation outside of the treatment context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. This can potentially lead to relapse. Memory reconsolidation interventions are an exciting alternative to exposure therapy because they are assumed to directly modify the affective value of a fear memory and could thereby prevent relapse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Yet, results regarding the translational value of reconsolidation interventions in (sub-)clinical phobias are mixed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. We aimed to better understand the mechanism of change in reconsolidation interventions by shedding light on the dissociation between the different aspects of fear memory expression that was previously observed after reconsolidation interference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p id="Par3">The memory reconsolidation hypothesis suggests that an established memory can be reactivated under specific conditions, causing it to return to a time-limited labile state in which it requires de novo protein synthesis for restabilization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. While the memory is labile, it can be targeted with pharmacological agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] to alter reconsolidation. This process, referred to as reconsolidation interference, is thought to directly weaken the (affective value of the) fear memory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. As a result, there is an abrupt change in the defensive response (e.g., avoidance behaviour) when confronted with the feared situation after a night of sleep [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. In contrast, a gradual decline of avoidance behaviour is typically observed over the course of multiple exposure therapy sessions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], after maladaptive thoughts and threat expectations have been challenged [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Thus, the reconsolidation hypothesis suggests that interfering with reconsolidation weakens fear memories through a fundamentally different mechanism than exposure treatment: Instead of forming a new inhibitory memory that competes with the original fear memory, it targets the fear memory itself, leading to an abrupt change in avoidance behaviour when confronted with the feared situation the following days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p id="Par4">Pharmacological interference with reconsolidation has progressed from animals to humans by&#x02014;for instance&#x02014;using the noradrenergic beta-blocker propranolol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. While the exact neurobiological processes behind how propranolol alters reconsolidation in humans are not yet fully understood, the beta-blocker is thought to interfere with protein synthesis indirectly by inhibiting the action of noradrenaline-stimulated molecules that are required for memory processes, thereby interfering with the restabilization of the fear memory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Human fear-conditioning studies from our research group have repeatedly demonstrated that the affective or defensive component of a fear memory, as assessed with the fear-potentiated startle response, can be abruptly attenuated when propranolol was administered in combination with reactivation of the previously acquired fear memory (i.e., reconsolidation intervention), whereas self-reported threat expectancies initially remained unaffected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. However, the attenuation of the fear-potentiated startle response was not always replicated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. A study translating these promising findings to existing fears revealed remarkable results: Soeter and Kindt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] showed that individuals with sub-clinical spider fear, who received propranolol after a brief memory reactivation procedure involving a 2-min exposure to a tarantula<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn1">1</xref>, transformed their fearful avoidance into approach behaviour as assessed with a tarantula and a baby tarantula behavioural approach task (BAT), the latter serving as a generalization stimulus. A reduction in self-reported spider fear followed the behavioural transformation at the 3-month follow-up. In contrast, individuals who received placebo or took propranolol without memory reactivation did not improve. All effects were maintained after one year. Recent findings regarding the translational value of reconsolidation interventions however are either mixed or challenging to interpret due to methodological shortcomings: We found support for a reduction in sub-clinical spider fear after a reconsolidation intervention, but this study did not include a placebo-control condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Two reconsolidation intervention studies for spider fear and fear of public speaking found a substantial fear reduction following a reconsolidation intervention, but without reliably outperforming placebo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Sample sizes were small and behavioural avoidance was not assessed at baseline, limiting the interpretability of these two studies.</p><p id="Par6">The notable discovery that self-reported spider fear was not initially reduced after the reconsolidation intervention in Soeter and Kindt&#x02019;s study, and instead followed the behavioural transformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], aligns with the striking dissociation reported in human fear-conditioning studies, in which the fear-potentiated startle response was abruptly attenuated, but self-reported threat expectancies initially remained unaffected and decreased over the course of multiple extinction trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref><xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn2">2</xref>]. Such a dissociation challenges a core principle of CBT, in which updating maladaptive cognitions is often seen as critical for subsequent behavioural changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. The reconsolidation intervention seems to work in the reversed order by abruptly reducing fear behaviour following the initial weakening of the fear memory during the reconsolidation window, after which maladaptive cognitions may change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. As a reduction in self-reported spider fear was detected at the 3-month follow-up in Soeter and Kindt&#x02019;s study but was not measured between 11 days and 3-month post-treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], it is currently unclear when and how these changes in self-reported fear occurred. In sub-clinical reconsolidation intervention studies, participants re-encounter the feared stimulus during their follow-up assessments where they perform BATs to measure avoidance behaviour. This re-encounter may not only serve as a fear assessment but might be a critical addition to the reconsolidation intervention itself to substantiate changes in fear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. In clinical fears, dysfunctional beliefs towards the phobic cue are closely linked to one&#x02019;s identity (e.g., &#x0201c;<italic>I can&#x02019;t cope with spiders and must run away&#x0201d;</italic>). Testing one&#x02019;s fear behaviour may offer an opportunity to challenge safety behaviours after treatment and to disconfirm these maladaptive beliefs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. As such, re-encountering the phobic cue after the reconsolidation intervention may help to update one&#x02019;s autobiographical memory and how one relates to the feared situation (e.g., <italic>&#x0201c;I am able to deal with spiders when I see one&#x0201d;)</italic>, and this re-encounter may therefore constitute a critical addition to the reconsolidation intervention&#x02019;s treatment protocol.</p><p id="Par8">Shedding light on the dissociation between avoidance behaviour and changes in self-reported fear after a reconsolidation intervention would help to better understand the mechanism of change and to advance current interventions. Thus, we aimed to (1) conceptually replicate Soeter and Kindt&#x02019;s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] findings regarding the effectiveness of a reconsolidation intervention for spider fear, extending it to individuals who meet the diagnostic criteria for spider phobia, assessed with a Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 disorders (SCID-5-RV). The dissociation in fear expression, in which changes in self-reported fear follow behavioural changes seems to be unique to the reconsolidation intervention, but it is currently unclear when and how these changes occur. Hence, we aimed to (2) assess whether changes in self-reported spider fear automatically follow the reconsolidation intervention, or whether re-encountering the feared situation after this initial treatment session is necessary to observe these changes. Third, if re-encountering the feared situation was necessary to trigger changes in self-reported fear as we hypothesize, then (3) we aimed to test whether the window to re-encounter the phobic cue after the reconsolidation intervention is time limited. If the reconsolidation intervention directly weakens the fear memory as some previous fear-conditioning studies suggested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], then theoretically, a subjective fear reduction may be triggered any time after treatment. See Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> for our hypotheses.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Illustration of hypotheses.</title><p>We expected that participants who received propranolol after the memory reactivation procedure would approach a tarantula and a house spider more when they returned to the laboratory two days after treatment than those who received placebo (Hypothesis 1). If the reconsolidation intervention neutralizes the affective value of a fear memory as some previous research suggests, avoidance behaviour towards the feared situation might be reduced independent of how much time has passed since treatment. Thus, we tested whether individuals who received propranolol after memory reactivation and returned to the laboratory four weeks post-treatment would show more approach behaviour compared to those who received placebo (Hypothesis 2). In line with previous research, we expected that changes in self-reported spider fear follow the behavioural transformation (Hypothesis 3). Re-encountering a spider after the reconsolidation intervention may be necessary to trigger changes in self-reported spider fear. Thus, we expected that individuals who received propranolol and returned for their post-test two days after treatment would show a larger decrease in self-reported spider fear within the first four weeks after treatment than those who took propranolol and did not re-encounter spiders in the laboratory until four weeks later (Hypothesis 4). If the reconsolidation intervention fundamentally changes the affective value of a fear memory, then theoretically, the window to trigger a reduction in self-reported fear may not be time limited. Thus, we tested whether changes in self-reported spider fear can be triggered independent of the time that has passed between treatment and re-encountering spiders (Hypothesis 5). Lastly, we tested whether potential treatment effects are maintained at the 3-month and 1-year follow-up (Hypothesis 6).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41380_2024_2882_Fig1_HTML" id="d33e448"/></fig></p><p id="Par9">In this double-blind pre-registered study, 69 individuals with spider phobia underwent a brief memory reactivation procedure with a tarantula that aimed to reactivate and thus destabilize the fear memory, followed by propranolol (i.e., reconsolidation intervention; <italic>Reconsolidation</italic>) or placebo (<italic>Placebo)</italic><xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn3">3</xref>.

In the long term, the reconsolidation intervention was more effective than placebo, but only when the phobic stimulus was re-encountered within days after treatment (disconfirming hypothesis 2). Specifically, we found less tarantula avoidance behaviour and self-reported fear over the course of one year when spiders were re-encountered two days after the reconsolidation intervention, but not when the behavioural test was conducted four weeks after the intervention. Memory reactivation followed by placebo reduced avoidance behaviour and self-reported spider fear as well, but less so long-term.</p><p id="Par40">Two previous reconsolidation intervention studies from our research group also found a substantial fear reduction after treatment, but where propranolol did not reliably outperform placebo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Although we observed a similarly strong or even stronger fear reduction after the reconsolidation intervention in the current study compared to Soeter and Kindt, our findings contrast with Soeter and Kindt&#x02019;s study, in which control groups neither showed a reduction in their self-reported fear, nor avoidance behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In the light of the unexpectedly strong fear reduction after placebo in the current study and the two previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], alternative accounts that may have reduced spider fear need to be considered, such as placebo and exposure effects as these may have resulted in a (temporarily) similarly strong fear reduction in both groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Regarding placebo effects, Siegel and Peterson [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>] showed that placebo pills can increase self-efficacy: Spider fearful individuals who falsely believed that they took propranolol approached a tarantula more compared to individuals who knew that they took placebo. Regarding exposure effects, older and stronger memories are less susceptible to reconsolidation interference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>] and require longer memory reactivation procedures to enter a labile state than laboratory-induced memories [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. Given that the current study focused on a clinical rather than sub-clinical sample, we developed a more challenging memory reactivation procedure compared to Soeter and Kindt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. This may have unintentionally resulted in exposure effects (through the formation of an inhibitory extinction memory), at least for some individuals in our study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The spider re-encounters in the form of the tarantula and house spider BATs two days after treatment may then have strengthened extinction learning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Here, the tarantula and house spider BATs may have served as added exposure or as an extinction reminder.</p><p id="Par41">Still, the overall pattern of the results is difficult to reconcile with placebo or exposure effects alone. The anticipated stronger fear reduction after undergoing memory reactivation followed by propranolol, as compared to placebo, manifested later than hypothesized. This delay was not attributable to insufficient fear reduction in the reconsolidation intervention group, but rather to the unforeseen significant reduction in fear observed in the placebo group. Hence, we cannot rule out the possibility that the observed reduction in fear resulted from positive treatment expectations (i.e., placebo effect) bolstered by extinction learning. Yet, the observed long-term advantage after the reconsolidation intervention may align more closely with the reconsolidation hypothesis than with the expectancy/extinction hypothesis, at least for a subset of the active treatment group. Specifically, the reconsolidation intervention group benefited more from the brief exposure during the post-test, as only this group showed an advantage in self-reported fear and fear behaviour long-term. In contrast, the initial improvement in self-reported fear and approach behaviour observed in the placebo-control group persisted without further improvement from post-test to the 1-year follow-up. Reconsolidation interference is thought to directly weaken (the affective value of) the fear memory, thereby potentially preventing a return of fear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In contrast, extinction learning is believed to merely form an inhibitory memory that competes with the original fear memory, possibly hindering further improvements or causing a return of fear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Thus, while both groups benefited from the treatment, it is plausible that the underlying mechanism of change differed between the memory reactivation procedure followed by propranolol versus placebo, resulting in long-term advantages after the reconsolidation interference procedure. However, we can never be certain that propranolol actually interfered with the process of memory reconsolidation, as there is currently no molecular or real-time marker during the reactivation procedure in humans to confirm that the reconsolidation window indeed opened up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>].</p><p id="Par42">If the reconsolidation intervention directly weakens the affective value of the fear memory as some previous studies suggested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], then changes in self-reported fear, or how people relate to the phobic cue, may be triggered any time after the treatment. We tested this hypothesis and found that the feared stimulus needs to be re-encountered within days, rather than weeks, after the treatment session to observe such changes (disconfirming hypothesis 5). Hence, the reconsolidation intervention alone does not seem to be sufficient to change how people think about the phobic cue in real-life situations, challenging the notion that reconsolidation interventions merely require a single treatment session to reduce fear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Instead, confronting the phobic cue within days after the reconsolidation window has already closed seems to be critical to consolidate the initial effects of the reconsolidation intervention. In line with CBT principles, the new experience of being able to approach the phobic cue without panic seems to be necessary to subsequently change one&#x02019;s self-image as a phobic individual, reflected in a decrease in self-reported fear. This extended CBT-like approach may prove effective by targeting safety behaviours, thereby facilitating the updating of autobiographical memory within days following the initial treatment (e.g., <italic>I didn&#x02019;t feel the panic I expected, so I may now be able to deal with spiders in my daily life)</italic>. The current findings thus support the multifaceted nature of emotional memory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. Conceptually, enduring treatment effects in clinical samples appear to require the updating of multiple aspects of fear&#x02014;affective, behavioral, and cognitive. However, this process may not occur simultaneously and may require different intervention techniques for each facet.</p><p id="Par43">Lastly, it is important to note that re-encountering the phobic cue also resulted in a reduction in self-reported fear in the placebo-control group. This finding emphasizes that it may be premature to celebrate the effectiveness of the reconsolidation intervention alone to treat anxiety and related disorders. Further research is needed to shed light on the mechanisms of change underlying exposure- versus reconsolidation-based interventions for clinical fears. While fear-conditioning studies in both rodents and humans have demonstrated that extinction learning and reconsolidation interference reduce fear through different mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>], long-lasting fears and phobias are more complex and resistant to change than laboratory-induced fear (memories), and so may be the mechanisms to change them [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. A translational approach can help to understand this complexity, but several aspects of fear-conditioning studies in the laboratory cannot be seamlessly applied to the treatment of phobias and other anxiety disorders. For instance, fear-conditioning studies have shown that reconsolidation is influenced by various factors such as learning history, age, and strength of the targeted memory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. In the laboratory setting, researchers can manipulate these variables by adjusting the conditioning or reactivation procedures, which is not feasible when working with people with long-lasting fears and phobias. As we do not have an independent marker to indicate whether reconsolidation is triggered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>], we can often only infer the potential mechanisms of change indirectly based on how and when different aspects of fear memory expression (e.g., avoidance behaviour and self-reported fear) change over the course of treatment.</p><sec id="Sec29"><title>Limitations</title><p id="Par44">This placebo-controlled study systematically shed light on the dissociation between avoidance behaviour and self-reported fear after a reconsolidation intervention, but there are some limitations to consider. First, while we found a strong decrease in salivary alpha amylase levels, systolic blood pressure, and heart rate from before memory reactivation to 90-min after pill intake, we did not find the predicted stronger decrease in these measures after taking propranolol compared to placebo as was observed in Soeter and Kindt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. This finding is not unique to the current study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], but means that we cannot prove that propranolol physically took effect. The strong reduction of physiological measures in all groups may be due to high treatment-related anticipatory distress and the subsequent resting period in this phobic sample, which may have concealed detectable differences in arousal due to propranolol versus placebo.</p><p id="Par45">Second, we found anecdotal evidence for baseline group differences in house spider approach behaviour, which complicates the interpretation of behavioural treatment benefits. However, the three groups neither differed in their self-reported spider fear at baseline, nor two days after treatment before any of the groups were subjected to the BAT. The three groups also did not differ in their house spider approach behaviour at post-test (before group differences re-emerged at the follow-ups). Thus, at the minimum, long-term changes in fear were not entirely driven by a potential baseline difference in avoidance behaviour. Furthermore, when we included house spider approach behaviour at baseline as a covariate in the relevant analyses (see&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S13</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">14</xref>), the pattern of the results remained largely similar.</p><p id="Par46">Third, a full factorial design including an additional placebo-control group with spider re-encounters four weeks after treatment would have been ideal, but for reasons of feasibility we decided against it. As the Reconsolidation-lateBAT and Placebo groups differ in two aspects, i.e., the timing of the spider re-encounters after treatment <italic>and</italic> the type of pill (propranolol versus placebo), we only report comparisons between these two groups (pre-registered) in the context of some valid comparisons between the other groups.</p><p id="Par47">Fourth, differences in self-reported spider fear between our active treatment and placebo-control group were not robust between the full sample and the sample retained one year post-treatment, even though only three participants from both groups did not return. Specifically, the advantage in self-reported fear of the active treatment is only statistically meaningful in the 1-year sample, but not in the full sample, which means that these results need to be interpreted with caution (<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S16</xref>). Nonetheless, the emerging interaction in self-reported fear between the active and placebo-control group was already visible in the full sample towards their 3-month follow-up, suggesting that the direction of these effects is robust.</p><p id="Par48">Fifth, our sample was relatively small due to the clinical nature of this study. Our power analysis was based on Soeter and Kindt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], but in recent years it has become clear that initial findings often present an overestimation of the true effect size [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. Although our sample size allowed us to detect substantially smaller effects than those reported by Soeter and Kindt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], some analyses were still underpowered because group differences between our active treatment and placebo-control group were smaller than expected. See&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S17</xref> for our power analyses and sample size justification.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec30" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par49">Memory reconsolidation interventions are thought to work through a fundamentally different mechanism than exposure treatment by weakening fear memories directly. Even though we also observed a fear reduction in the placebo-control group, our findings support reconsolidation-inspired interventions as a promising and efficient way to reduce phobia symptoms long-term. However, a brief re-encountering of the feared situation after the initial treatment session is critical to observe a lasting fear reduction and the window of opportunity to trigger changes in self-reported fear seems time limited: Re-encountering the phobic cue two days, but not four weeks, after treatment led to a strong reduction in self-reported spider fear in this study. These findings challenge the idea that a reconsolidation intervention alone is sufficient to treat clinical fears and suggest that multiple facets of the fear memory need to be targeted. Clinically, experiencing the behavioural change <italic>within days</italic> after treatment seems necessary to observe long-lasting treatment effects, which means that testing your fear behaviour after the treatment should be a critical addition to the reconsolidation intervention itself.</p></sec><sec id="Sec31" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary information</title><p>
