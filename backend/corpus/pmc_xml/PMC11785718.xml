To evaluate the efficacy and safety of CEP compared with placebo in adults with asymptomatic or mild coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), we conducted a proof-of-concept, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. Patients were randomized to receive 120&#x000a0;mg/day of CEP, 60&#x000a0;mg/day CEP or placebo for 5 days. Main outcome was the time from randomization to negative nasopharyngeal swab and safety. Among 262 randomized participants, 188 completed the trial among group of 120&#x000a0;mg/day CEP (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;65), 60&#x000a0;mg/day CEP (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;68) and placebo (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;55). Neither 120&#x000a0;mg/day or 60&#x000a0;mg/day CEP shortened the time to negative significantly compared with placebo. However, 60&#x000a0;mg/day CEP showed a slight trend (difference=-0.77 days, hazard ratio (HR)&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.40, 95% CI 0.97&#x02013;2.01, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.072). In analysis of participants with good medication compliance, 60&#x000a0;mg/day CEP significantly shortened the time to negative (difference=-0.87 days, HR&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.56, 95% CI 1.03&#x02013;2.37, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.035). Adverse events were not different among the three groups, and no serious adverse events occurred. In conclusion, treatment of asymptomatic or mild Covid-19 with 120&#x000a0;mg/day or 60&#x000a0;mg/day did not shorten the time to negative significantly. However, 60&#x000a0;mg/day CEP showed a slight trend which needs future confirmatory trials to validate.

SARS-CoV-2 has shown a remarkably fast evolutionary rate, and five major variants of SARS-CoV-2 (Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Omicron) have emerged to date<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. In view of the large number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 across rich and poor regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, the rapid evolution of SARS-CoV-2 and limited and expensive antiviral drugs, it is urgent to identify effective, widely available and inexpensive drugs with broad-spectrum antiviral ability against SARS-CoV-2.</p><p id="Par3">Drug repurposing is a feasible approach in a pandemic. Cepharanthine (CEP) is a biscoclaurine alkaloid extracted from Stephania Cepharantha Hayata that has been used to treat various diseases (including leukopenia, alopecia and snake bites)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. CEP was identified as a potential SARS-CoV-2 antiviral drug via high-throughput screening in a recent interactome-informed drug repurposing study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. It has been reported that CEP is capable of blocking viral entry by binding to the SARS-CoV-2&#x000a0;S protein to interfere with the interaction of the S protein and its receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 nonstructural protein 13 (Nsp13) is important for the replication of the viral genome and responsible for viral viability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. CEP displays antiviral activity in inhibiting Nsp13 ATPase (helicase), thus inhibiting viral replication<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. CEP shows potential antiviral activities against SARS-CoV-2 both in vitro and in vivo<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. In addition, CEP, a natural alkaloid that has been used for a long time in the treatment of various diseases, shows no significant side effects in patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Given the well-established safety profile and significant unique antiviral effect of CEP, repurposing inexpensive and easily available CEP as an antiviral drug for the treatment of COVID-19 is of great potential.</p><p id="Par4">However, information about the efficacy and safety of CEP in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 replication to treat COVID-19 is still lacking, and clinical trials are urgently needed. Thus, during the epidemic of COVID-19 in Shanghai, China, we started a randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of CEP in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2. Given the high transmissibility but low pathogenicity of Omicron variant, the dominant SARS-CoV-2 variant at present, most of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients are asymptomatic or mild<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Therefore, patients enrolled in this study were non-hospitalized adults with asymptomatic and mild COVID-19, and as the key index to evaluate the efficacy, the time from randomization to negative nasopharyngeal swab was the primary endpoint in this study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Trial design and oversight</title><p id="Par5">This was a proof-of-concept, double-blind, stratified randomized, parallel, placebo-controlled trial.

Post-discharge, community staff collected nasopharyngeal swabs for nucleic acid test every day. During the 28-day follow-up (from the time of randomization), all participants underwent standardized procedures. Throughout the alternate care sites, researchers visited participants three times daily, including in-person visits in the morning and afternoon, as well as a telephone visit in the evening. Post discharge, telemedicine follow-ups were conducted weekly. Researchers queried and recoded information of nucleic acid test results, presence of symptoms, improvement or worsening of symptoms, development of pneumonia or severe COVID-19, and any adverse reactions following medication intake.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="Par19">All eligible patients who received at least one dose of the drug or placebo who also tested positive by nucleic acid test at randomization were included in the modified intention-to-treat (mITT) population, with patients who completed the treatment (had good medical compliance (80-120%)) included in the per-protocol set (PPS). All patients who received at least one dose of the drug or placebo were included in the safety analysis set (SS).</p><p id="Par20">In the original design of this study, the time from randomization to negative nasopharyngeal swab was used as the primary endpoint. The sample size of this study was determined to detect a potential clinical superiority of CEP in time to viral shedding. According to the experimental results of CEP against SARS-CoV-2 virus in vivo and in vitro, we supposed a total of 105 patients in each group would provide 80% power to detect a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.5, which was tested in the Cox proportional hazards model of the time to negative nasopharyngeal swab for CEP versus placebo. The overall probability of an event was 0.9, with a two-sided significance level of &#x003b1;&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.05, and the ratio of the sample in each group was 1:1:1. Considering the explorative property of this study and that the assumptions in sample size determination were based on limited clinical evidence, this study continued to enroll patients after 315 patients were enrolled when research resources were sufficient.</p><p id="Par21">The analysis for efficacy assessment was performed in both the mITT set and the PPS. The analysis performed in the mITT set was primary analysis, and that performed in the PPS was considered supportive analysis. Continuous variables are presented as the means with standard deviations or medians with interquartile ranges (IQRs), and categorical variables are reported as numbers and percentages. There were no missing data in the mITT set.</p><p id="Par22">Since all patients were quarantined until they tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 infection, there was no censoring for time to negative nasopharyngeal swab due to loss to follow-up in this study. Death was treated as a competitive event of viral shedding. The time to negative nasopharyngeal swab of each group was summarized and the restricted mean survival time (RMST) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI)of each group were estimated. A Cox proportional hazards model was fitted to estimate the HR and 95% CI for the 60&#x000a0;mg/day CEP group and 120&#x000a0;mg/day CEP group compared with the control group, and the reported p value was evaluated by the Cox proportional hazards model. In this model, underlying disease (presence or absence), age (&#x0003e;&#x02009;60 years or &#x02264;&#x02009;60 years), sex (male or female), symptoms on admission (symptomatic or asymptomatic) and days from the first nucleic acid test to randomization were included as prespecified adjusted variables. In addition, Prespecified subgroup analyses of primary and secondary endpoints were conducted, and 95% CIs were provided to evaluate whether the treatment effect varied according to age, sex, symptoms (asymptomatic or mild), days from first nucleic acid test to randomization, vaccination, and high-risk factors for progression to severe COVID-19 (including age&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;60 years, smoking, obesity, and underlying clinical conditions)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>.

The most frequently reported events (affecting at least 1% of patients) were diarrhea (13 (12.50%) in the 120&#x000a0;mg/day CEP group vs. 9 (7.89%) in the 60&#x000a0;mg/day CEP group vs. 9 (9.09%) in the placebo group), drowsiness (6 (5.77%) in the 120&#x000a0;mg/day CEP group vs. 10 (8.77%) in the 60&#x000a0;mg/day CEP group vs. 7 (7.07%) in the placebo group), night sweats (6 (5.77%) in the 120&#x000a0;mg/day CEP group vs. 9 (7.89%) in the 60&#x000a0;mg/day CEP group vs. 1 (1.01%) in the placebo group), and dizziness (3 (2.88%) in the 120&#x000a0;mg/day CEP group vs. 0 (0%) in the 60&#x000a0;mg/day CEP group vs. 1 (1.01%) in the placebo group). During the treatment period, there were no grade 3 or 4 adverse events, and all events were mild to moderate (grade 1 or 2) and were resolved at the time of this analysis [Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par35">

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec16" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par36">This study is the first randomized placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of oral administration of CEP for asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 patients at alternate care sites in China. We explored the safety and efficacy of viral clearance of two different doses of CEP in treating patients with asymptomatic or mild COVID-19. The results showed that the side effects of both 5-day oral administration of 60&#x000a0;mg/day of CEP and 120&#x000a0;mg/day of CEP were generally mild and without safety concerns. In the mITT analysis, neither the 120&#x000a0;mg/day nor the 60&#x000a0;mg/day CEP demonstrated significant effects in shortening the time to negative swab, with only the 60&#x000a0;mg/day CEP showing slight trends. However, it is noteworthy that in the PPS analysis, the time to negative swab was significantly shorter in the 60&#x000a0;mg/day CEP group compared to the placebo group.</p><p id="Par37">Although 60&#x000a0;mg/day of CEP significantly shortened the time to negative swabs in the PPS (HR&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.56, 95% CI 1.03 to 2.37, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.035), it did not achieve a significant difference in the mITT set (HR&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.40, 95% CI 0.97 to 2.01, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.072). Therefore, the efficacy of 60&#x000a0;mg/day of CEP in the PPS should be carefully explained. The possible reason may be the limited sample size. The number of de novo infected patients who underwent randomization was 262, which did not reach the designated sample size of 315 patients, and this study may not have had enough power to detect a significant difference. Based on the hazard ratio of this study, a sufficient sample size may be required for further validation trials.</p><p id="Par38">As a natural alkaloid with multiple targets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, CEP has anti-SARS-CoV-2, antioxidant (scavenging free radicals), cell membrane stabilization, drug efflux transporter inhibition, vasodilatation and other properties. However, the specific dose of CEP required to activate each target and the interactions between the targets are not completely clear. In this study, when the dose of CEP was increased to 120&#x000a0;mg/day, it did not show an efficacy in shortening the time to negative nasopharyngeal swab (neither in the mITT set nor in the PPS). Clearance of viruses in patients is determined by the speed of virus replication and the speed of the immune system in eliminating the virus. The possible reason is that in addition to the direct antiviral effect against SARS-CoV-2 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, 120&#x000a0;mg/day of CEP may inhibit the ability of the immune system to clear SARS-CoV-2. It has been reported that 10&#x000a0;mg/kg of CEP in mice can not only inhibit the replication of SARS-CoV-2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> but also inhibit the NF-&#x003ba;B pathway and reduce the release of cytokines such as TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-1&#x003b2; and IL-6<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. In addition, CEP inhibits neutrophils<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, inhibits dendritic cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, stimulates T cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, etc. According to this study, 60&#x000a0;mg/day of CEP significantly shortened the time to negative results among patients with good compliance. We speculate that at a dose of 60&#x000a0;mg/day, CEP dose not activate the target of inhibiting the immune system, while a dose of 120&#x000a0;mg/day of CEP could activate the target. As a result, 120&#x000a0;mg/day of CEP dose not shorten the time to negative swabs.</p><p id="Par39">As a natural alkaloid, CEP has been used to treat various diseases for a long time and has been proven to have good safety<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, which is also shown in the treatment of asymptomatic and mild COVID-19. In this study, no serious adverse events occurred in the 120&#x000a0;mg/day CEP, 60&#x000a0;mg/day CEP or placebo group. The incidence of adverse events in the three groups was similar, and the most common adverse events were diarrhea and drowsiness.</p><p id="Par40">This trial has several strengths. This study is the first randomized clinical trial in the world, to our knowledge, to evaluate the safety and efficacy of oral administration of CEP for non-hospitalized adults with asymptomatic or mild COVID-19, which provided an important data in advancing alternative treatments for COVID-19. Second, this study was designed as a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial and had high quality, ensuring that the results were scientific. Third, patients selected for this study were non-hospitalized adult patients with asymptomatic or mild COVID-19, which means that the results can be extrapolated. At present, because the Omicron variant has low pathogenicity but high infectivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>, asymptomatic and mild infections are the most common and will likely remain in the future. Therefore, the results of this study can be better applied to the overwhelming majority of SARS-CoV-2-infected people.</p><p id="Par41">There are also some limitations of this study. First, the baseline characteristics of the mITT population were not entirely comparable among three assigned groups. Sixty-nine patients did not receive the intervention medicine, and 36 patients had negative nasopharyngeal swabs upon retesting at randomization, therefore, we chose the mITT population as the primary analysis population in our study which caused the imbalance in baseline data among the three groups. We have considered this problem in advance and performed a prespecified adjusted Cox regression analysis in our study, which is a solution to this point. Second, since no patients developed pneumonia or severe COVID-19 during this study, the effect of CEP on preventing severe COVID-19 could not be evaluated. This is reasonable for the characteristics of Omicron variant infection. The Omicron variant is the major epidemic variant of SARS-CoV-2, and its pathogenicity is lower than that of other known variants, which leads to most of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients being asymptomatic or mild<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, and the rate of developing severe COVID-19 is extremely low<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Third, although we considered various factors that could potentially impact outcomes and conducted prespecified subgroup analyses, including vaccination status, we did not collect the data on vaccination dates, thus failing to incorporate the most recent vaccination into our analysis. Lastly, patients enrolled in this study were limited to asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 patients, and the efficacy of CEP for severe COVID-19 remains unknown and needs further study. However, according to the epidemic characteristics of the majority of asymptomatic or mild SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, the number of patients enrolled in this study was appropriate.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par42">Among asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 patients, oral administration of 120&#x000a0;mg/day of CEP and 60&#x000a0;mg/day of CEP for 5 days is safe. Neither 120&#x000a0;mg/day nor 60&#x000a0;mg/day of CEP shortened the time to negative nasopharyngeal swab. However, 60&#x000a0;mg/day CEP showed a slight trend. Further studies may validate the efficacy of CEP in treating COVID-19 among de novo SARS-CoV-2-infected patients at a dose of 60&#x000a0;mg/day.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>
