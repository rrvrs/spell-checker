BV-associated bacteria, such as <italic toggle="yes">Gardnerella vaginalis</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Prevotella timonensis,</italic> damage the vaginal mucosa through the activity of sialidase enzymes that remodel the epithelial glycocalyx and degrade mucin glycoproteins. This damage creates an inflammatory environment which likely contributes to adverse health outcomes. However, whether BV-associated glycolytic enzymes also damage sperm during their transit through the reproductive tract has not yet been determined. Here, we show that sialidase-mediated glycocalyx remodeling of human sperm increases sperm susceptibility to damage within the female reproductive tract. In particular, we report that desialylated human sperm demonstrate increased susceptibility to complement lysis and agglutination, as well as decreased sperm transit through cervical mucus. Our results demonstrate a mechanism by which BV-associated sialidases may affect sperm survival and function and potentially contribute to adverse reproductive outcomes such as preterm birth and infertility.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>bacterial vaginosis</kwd><kwd>sialidase</kwd><kwd>reproductive immunology</kwd><kwd>sperm</kwd><kwd>complement</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group><title>Classification:</title><kwd>Biological Sciences</kwd><kwd>Immunology and Inflammation</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>Funding sources include grants P50 HD096957 (Anderson) and T32-A1007309 (Dohadwala) from the National Institutes of Health, and a BU Sexual Medicine Pilot Grant (Marathe).</funding-statement></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a condition characterized by vaginal dysbiosis that affects approximately one third of women globally (<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">Peebles et al. 2019</xref>). In some regions in the global South, up to 50% of women have BV (<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">Kenyon et al. 2013</xref>). This condition is highly associated with spontaneous preterm birth, increased risk of preclinical pregnancy loss, and STI acquisition (<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">Howe et al. 1999</xref>; <xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">Ralph et al. 1999</xref>; <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">Cauci and Culhane 2011</xref>; <xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">van Oostrum et al. 2013</xref>; <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">Armstrong and Kaul 2021</xref>; <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">Abou Chacra et al. 2023</xref>; <xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">Mohanty et al. 2023</xref>). In addition, emerging evidence suggests a link to infertility and pre-eclampsia, as well as adverse neonatal outcomes even for full term infants (<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">Denney and Culhane 2009</xref>; <xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">van Oostrum et al. 2013</xref>; <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">Dingens et al. 2016</xref>; <xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">Kindschuh et al. 2024</xref>). BV is an extremely variable condition, characterized by high diversity in the vaginal microbiome, and clinical symptoms such as irritation, discharge, itching, and fishy odor (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">Abou Chacra et al. 2022</xref>). To more precisely define the composition of vaginal microbiota found in humans, the field has adopted community state types numbered I to V to describe various proportions of different bacterial taxa (<xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">Ravel et al. 2011</xref>). A healthy vaginal microbiome, or CST I, consists primarily of <italic toggle="yes">lactobacillus crispatus,</italic> which maintains low vaginal pH and inflammation. A microbiome dominated by <italic toggle="yes">lactobacillus iners</italic>, termed CST II, is thought to be an intermediary microbiome between a healthy and disease state (<xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">Ravel et al. 2011</xref>). Dysbiotic vaginal microbiomes include other bacterial species such as <italic toggle="yes">Gardnerella vaginalis</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Prevotella Timonensis</italic>, defined by CST III and IV.</p><p id="P4">To date, the mechanisms by which BV increases risk of adverse reproductive outcomes are poorly understood (<xref rid="R66" ref-type="bibr">Ugwumadu 2002</xref>; <xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">Mania-Pramanik et al. 2009l</xref>
<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">Elovitz et al. 2019</xref>; <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">Gudnadottir et al. 2022</xref>); several have been proposed, including high vaginal pH, an inflammatory vaginal milieu, and BV-associated epithelial damage (<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">Cauci et al. 2008</xref>). Recent findings have implicated glycolytic enzymes in remodeling the host vaginal glycocalyx (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">Agarwal et al. 2023</xref>; <xref rid="R61" ref-type="bibr">Segui-Perez et al. 2024</xref>). In particular, sialidases are often present in high concentration in clinical BV isolates and remove terminal sialic acids from glycoconjugates that decorate cell membranes. Endogenous sialidases are also present in the female reproductive tract (<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">Flori et al. 2007</xref>; <xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">Ma et al. 2012</xref>). A key difference between endogenous and bacterial sialidases is that targeted host sialidases trim specific glycans during normal processes such as sperm capacitation, while in BV, promiscuous bacterial sialidases indiscriminately cleave host glycans important for reproductive and immune functions. BV-associated sialidases may forage nutrients from the vaginal tract mucosa that are required for BV associated bacteria and STI pathogens to thrive (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">Agarwal and Lewis 2021</xref>). A recent study demonstrated that sialylation of the vaginal epithelium was markedly lower in women with BV than those with a healthy microbiome, and that this phenomenon could be replicated ex vivo with a recombinantly expressed BV sialidase, NanH2 (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">Agarwal et al. 2023</xref>). Several other groups have corroborated this finding. One study showed that similar enzymes from another BV-associated bacterium, Prevotella, also removed sialic acid from the surface of vaginal epithelial cells; another demonstrated similar hydrolytic damage to mucins and other components of the vaginal mucosa (<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">Pelayo et al. 2024</xref>; <xref rid="R61" ref-type="bibr">Segui-Perez et al. 2024</xref>).</p><p id="P5">Much evidence suggests that BV-associated damage to the vaginal mucosa could contribute to clinical symptoms of BV (<xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">Roselletti et al. 2020</xref>; <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">Cheu et al. 2022</xref>). However, the mechanistic connection between BV associated changes to the vaginal environment and adverse reproductive outcomes, which primarily relate to the upper FRT, remains unclear. Thus, we have studied the effects of BV sialidases on spermatozoa, cells that transit through the vaginal environment and exercise important functions in the endocervix, endometrium and fallopian tubes (<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">Mahdavinezhad et al. 2022</xref>). Their glycocalyx protects them from the female immune system, facilitates their passage through cervical mucus, and prevents premature capacitation, a process necessary for fertilization (<xref rid="R63" ref-type="bibr">Tecle and Gagneux 2015</xref>). The sialic acid-capped glycocalyx, termed the sialome, is particularly important (<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">Fliniaux et al. 2022</xref>). Sialic acids are negatively charged moieties that cap glycan chains on the cell surface and bind several activating and immunosuppressive receptors in the Siglec family (<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">Fliniaux et al. 2022</xref>). As a result, they are often part of a cell surface self-signal to prevent aberrant innate immune damage. Thus, sialic acid-mediated immune signaling within the female reproductive tract is thought to be important for the timely and appropriate induction of processes in fertilization and early pregnancy (<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">Ma et al. 2012</xref>). In particular, the negatively charged sialic acid moiety allows sperm to navigate quickly through negatively charged cervical mucins and potentially bind to Siglecs on the endometrium and fallopian tubes to form sperm reservoirs prior to ovulation. Sialic acids may also mask highly immunogenic glycan epitopes on the sperm surface that are exposed during ovulation-induced capacitation and participate in fertilization(<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">Ma et al. 2012</xref>). Thus, BV-associated sialidases may adversely affect sperm migration, immune signaling, and fertilization capacity.</p><p id="P6">The purpose of this study was to determine whether sialidases derived from <italic toggle="yes">Gardnerella vaginalis</italic> remodel the human sperm glycocalyx, prematurely exposing cryptic glycan epitopes and decreasing the negative surface charge of sperm. We used two approaches, lectin flow cytometry and zeta potential, to characterize the changes to the remodeled sperm glycocalyx after treatment with recombinant NanH2, a sialidase derived from clinically relevant strains of Gardnerella vaginalis that cleaves both <italic toggle="yes">N-</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">O</italic>-linked glycans (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">Agarwal et al. 2023</xref>). We next investigated the effect of desialylation on sperm motility through cervical mucus and sperm agglutination, and on innate immunity by investigating susceptibility of desialylated sperm to complement-mediated cytotoxicity. These data provide strong evidence that BV-associated sialidases can adversely affect sperm functions in the female reproductive tract, potentially contributing to the adverse reproductive outcomes such as preterm birth or subfertility that are associated with bacterial vaginosis.</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Sialic acids are depleted from the sperm glycocalyx after exposure to recombinant BV sialidase and bacterial supernatants, exposing cryptic epitopes and reducing negative surface charge.</title><p id="P7">Sperm are rich in sialylated cell surface proteins that may be susceptible to hydrolysis by BV-associated sialidases. Accordingly, to investigate BV-associated damage to sperm, we produced recombinant, endotoxin-free GvNanH2 as described previously (<xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">Robinson et al. 2019</xref>). GvNanH2 is a truncated variant of a sialidase derived from Gardnerella vaginalis. To ensure that our experiments employed physiologically relevant sialidase activity, we used a reported value of enzyme activity derived from cervicovaginal swabs obtained from women with BV (0.5 micromoles/min 4U-MU hydrolysis, after accounting for dilution factors). In addition, we back-calculated amounts of active enzyme from specific activity values of the recombinant enzyme, and used BV-diagnostic values of 250 ng/mL and 2000 ng/mL of enzyme (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">Agarwal et al. 2023</xref>). Next, to confirm that BV-associated sialidases desialylated sperm-surface glycans, sperm were collected from healthy, reproductive aged men, isolated by density gradient, and treated with either recombinant GvNanH2, AUS (a commercially available sialidase derived from <italic toggle="yes">A. urufaciens</italic>, positive control), or no treatment (negative control). Then, we assessed removal of terminal sialic acids with lectin flow cytometry using SNA-Cy5 and MAL II-biotin to measure a decrease in 2, 6 and 2,3-linked terminal sialic acids, respectively (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). The untreated controls demonstrated the presence of 2, 3 and 2, 6 linked sialic acids on the sperm surface (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>, <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>). This corresponds to results from previous studies using lectin microarrays to profile the sperm surface glycome (<xref rid="R67" ref-type="bibr">Xin et al. 2014</xref>). For SNA-Cy5 staining, the direct conjugate enabled a direct comparison of the activity of AUS and GvNanH2. AUS reduced the signal by roughly 50% relative to the control, while GvNanH2 reduced it by approximately 15% (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref>). Similarly, a significant reduction was observed in the staining for MAL-II, though due to a secondary amplification step, a linear relationship to compare AUS and GvNanH2 was not possible. Although not statistically significant, a three-fold decrease in signal was observed with NanH2 compared to AUS (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>).</p><p id="P8">Sperm, being foreign to the female reproductive tract, have immunogenic epitopes capped with terminal sialic acids that function in processes such as the acrosome reaction and sperm-egg interaction. To determine if the glycan moieties underlying terminal sialic acids were exposed or degraded after sialidase treatment, we used lectin flow cytometry with pea savitum agglutinin (PSA), a lectin which binds <italic toggle="yes">N</italic>-acetyllactosamine residues and is a marker for the acrosome reaction (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). In untreated (control) sperm, robust PSA staining was observed (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>). In both sialidase treatment conditions (AUS and NanH2), sperm PSA staining was unchanged from that of the control (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>). This indicates that sialidase treatment does not degrade other glycan moieties nonspecifically and does not result in a premature acrosome reaction.</p><p id="P9">The sperm sialome contributes to a negative surface charge. To determine if the surface charge of sperm is modified in response to sialidase treatment, the zeta potential of sperm cultures was measured in response to different doses of enzyme. First, we optimized the diluent for the assay and confirmed the effect of different culture conditions on the measurement (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig S4A</xref>). A decrease in sperm surface charge was observed when whole semen was treated, though the magnitude of the change observed was lower than when washed sperm were treated. It is possible that sialylated glycoproteins in seminal plasma protect the sperm surface from the full force of the sialidase enzymes through a competition mechanism. Next, we measured the change in zeta potential to compare the same doses of recombinant NanH2 and AUS and found that effects were similar (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig S4C</xref>). Finally, we used a physiological relevant series of doses of both NanH2 and AUS sialidase and measured the zeta potential of the cultures. We observed a dose dependent decrease in the magnitude of the negative surface charge after a 30 min incubation for both AUS and NanH2 (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1F</xref>). We also measured the donor-to-donor variance in the biological replicates, and found that there was some variance in how the sperm from different donors were affected by the sialidases, though overall trends in the data were retained (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig S4D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Desialylated sperm are more susceptible to spontaneous, antibody- and lectin-mediated agglutination</title><p id="P10">Agglutination is a phenomenon driven by cell motility and surface charge wherein motile sperm collide and stick to one another, forming large, aggregated networks. We investigated the propensity of highly motile sperm to agglutinate after sialidase treatment. We hypothesized that by reducing the negative charge, sperm desialylation would make the sperm stickier and prone to agglutination.</p><p id="P11">To measure this, washed sperm were treated with different doses of AUS sialidase and observed over time. We observed variable degrees of sperm agglutination under these conditions. The variable characteristics in these spontaneous agglutinates included time to agglutination and size and shape of agglutinates. Next, we tested whether sperm desialylation affects antibody or lectin-induced sperm agglutination. To quantify this effect, we performed a kinetic agglutination assay on sperm treated with sialidase or heat inactivated enzyme (negative control), followed by Galectin-1, the Human Contraception Antibody (HCA), or Pea savitum agglutinum (PSA). These entities were selected due to their importance in reproductive biology. Galectin-1 is involved in binding STI pathogens and is expressed in FRT tissues. HCA, derived from the serum of an infertility patient, is part of a contraceptive product that is poised to enter Phase II clinical trials (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">Anderson et al. 2020</xref>). Finally, PSA is a marker for the acrosome reaction, a process crucial to sperm-egg interaction. These three entities bind distinct glycans-- HCA binds a male reproductive tract specific, but largely uncharacterized sperm <italic toggle="yes">N</italic>-glycoform; Galectin-1 binds repeat <italic toggle="yes">N</italic>-acetyllactosamine units, and PSA binds terminal mannose residues. None of these three entities bind sialic acid moieties specifically, though they may all be tolerant of sialylated glycans.</p><p id="P12">We optimized the concentrations of the agglutinating antibodies and lectins, selecting low concentrations that were weakly agglutinating to distinguish the effect of sialidases treatment. We found that sperm agglutinate significantly faster when exposed to each of the three agglutinating entities after treatment with either AUS or NanH2 sialidase (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>, <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>). In addition, for PSA, flow cytometry data indicated that surface staining is unchanged in response to sialidase treatment, suggesting charge-mediated repulsion in preventing agglutination, rather than enhanced binding of underlying glycan epitopes in treated sperm. In sum, removal of surface sialic acids from sperm increased their propensity to agglutinate spontaneously and in the presence of several distinct lectins and glycan-binding antibodies.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Desialylated sperm are more susceptible to complement-mediated immobilization and cytolysis</title><p id="P13">Sialic acids prevent aberrant complement activation by binding several complement inhibitors including Factor H (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">Blaum et al. 2015</xref>). Both complement and complement inhibitors can be found in human cervical mucus and seminal plasma (<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">Price and Boettcher 1979</xref>; <xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">Petersen et al. 1980</xref>) suggesting that complement biology may be important to fertility and reproduction, though specific mechanisms are not yet fully understood. For instance, complement proteins may serve as a bridge between sperm and egg (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">Anderson et al. 1993</xref>), and some antisperm antibodies demonstrate potent complement-dependent immobilization and cytolysis of sperm (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">Baldeon-Vaca et al. 2021</xref>).</p><p id="P14">We used the complement-mediated sperm immobilization assay to determine the potential role of sialidase enzymes in spontaneous- and lectin- mediated complement activation. We first investigated whether sialidase treatment alone affected sperm motility. We did not observe a significant effect of either NanH2 or AUS on sperm motility through 60 minutes, after which time we observed a slight decrease in sperm motility in some donors (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>). Next, we examined the effect of sialidases on sperm motility in the presence of complement. Addition of 2000 ng/mL GvNanH2 with complement significantly reduced sperm motility compared to all three negative controls (no enzyme treatment, heat inactivated complement, addition of compstatin, a C3 complement inhibitor) (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>). We also used AUS sialidase to examine how additional sialic acid linkages may play a role. In comparison to AUS, GvNanH2 is reported to cleave &#x003b1; 2&#x02013;3, 6 linkages; its activity against &#x003b1; 2&#x02013;8,9 linked sialic acids is unconfirmed. We observed that treatment with much lower doses of AUS sialidase resulted in substantial reductions in sperm motility in the presence of complement, indicating a strong role for &#x003b1; 2&#x02013;8,9 linked sialic acids, primarily found in poly-sialic chains, in protection from complement lysis (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>). We also tested a lower dose of the complement inhibitor compstatin (25 &#x003bc;M) to determine if alternative complement activity accounted for sperm immobilization, since compstatin has a lower IC<sub>50</sub> (12 &#x003bc;M) to inhibit the alternative pathway. Complement activity was hindered, but not completely abrogated (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig S6</xref>). This indicates that this complement activity likely occurs through the lectin pathway rather than the alternative pathway. Finally we confirmed that complement-mediated sperm immobilization is a surrogate for cell lysis (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>). After complement treatment of sialidase-treated sperm the majority of immotile sperm stained positive for trypan blue, indicating that they were lysed. The majority of lysed sperm were present in agglutinates, which could indicate that sperm become sticky after lysis, or that agglutination facilitates complement activation on the surface of sperm due to increased size (<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">Dalia et al 2011</xref>). In addition, we explored antibody-mediated complement lysis, and sperm were more prone to complement lysis through the classical complement pathway in the presence of sialidase (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig S5</xref>). In sum, these data provide evidence that surface sialic acid moieties protect sperm from complement-mediated lysis, likely through lectin mediated pathways.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Desialylated sperm are less able to transit through human cervical mucus</title><p id="P15">Human cervical mucus varies in physical properties and composition throughout the menstrual cycle and is rich in negatively charged mucins. Sperm must transit across this mucosal barrier to access the upper reproductive tract and fertilize an egg. To determine how sperm transit through mucus may be affected by sialidase treatment, we measured numbers of sperm observed at progressive distances through a capillary tube filled with ovulatory human cervical mucus. We started with a model that simulates sperm transit through the vagina and cervix after intercourse (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>). Motile sperm were isolated, resuspended at a concentration of 80 million/mL in 50% seminal plasma, and placed into a capillary tube to measure migration through a small region (0.5 cm) of GvNanH2 sialidase or media (control), followed by midcycle cervical mucus (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>). We found a significant reduction in the numbers of total sperm that were able to transit through the mucus after exposure to sialidase (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref>).</p><p id="P16">Next, we measured different methods of sialidase exposure since the localization of the bacterial enzyme in the cervix is unknown. We mixed human midcycle cervical mucus with recombinant sialidase (amount equivalent to 0.5 &#x003bc;M/min 4-MU hydrolysis activity) or media (control) and counted the number of sperm that penetrated to various depths of the capillary tube after 90 minutes. Pre-treatment of mucus with sialidase initially facilitated sperm transit, but the sperm became immotile as they traversed the sialidase-containing mucus (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig S8</xref>). While the numbers of sperm found in mucus increased in the sialidase-containing mucus, the percent motile sperm decreased, which was the opposite of the trend observed in untreated mucus (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig S8</xref>). This may be due to more efficient complement lysis of the sperm exposed to sialidase during transit through the cervical mucus. Next, we tested treatment of sperm with sialidase prior to mucus exposure and found that this also reduced their transit through cervical mucus (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig S8</xref>). We also tested these phenomena with and without seminal plasma, which contains several proteins known to coat the sperm surface (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig S7</xref>). We found that seminal plasma protects sperm from the immobilization observed in sialidase-containing mucin, perhaps due to abundant seminal sialoglycoproteins in seminal plasma (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig S7</xref>). Finally, we also compared sperm transit through human cervical mucus to a commonly used commercially available mucin model, bovine submaxillary mucin. In the absence of seminal plasma, a similar pattern was observed; however, in the presence of seminal plasma, human cervical mucus was much more permissive to sperm transit (data not shown). This indicates some specific interaction between components of human cervical mucin and seminal plasma that is not be recapitulated with bovine mucin. In sum, our data indicate that BV-associated sialidases affect sperm transit through human midcycle cervical mucus, both by altering the sperm&#x02019;s forward progression in mucus, and by altering the properties of the mucus itself.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P17">Our study demonstrates that that BV-derived sialidases alter the sperm glycocalyx by removing terminal sialic acid residues, and provides evidence that the unperturbed sperm glycocalyx likely protects sperm from immune effectors present in the female reproductive tract and facilitates their transit through cervical mucus. Desialylated sperm were highly susceptible to complement-mediated damage and agglutination, and penetrated midcycle cervical mucus poorly. Prior to our work, most studies on the effects of BV-associated sialidases were limited to the vaginal mucosa (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">Agarwal et al. 2023</xref>; <xref rid="R61" ref-type="bibr">Segui-Perez et al. 2024</xref>), and the work of groups looking at the importance of the sperm sialome in bacterial infection and capacitation (<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">Khosravi et al. 2016</xref>). Studies related to the effects of sialidases on sperm were limited in humans, though some animal models supported the idea that exposure to sialidases affects sperm function in the reproductive tract (<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">Ma et al. 2016</xref>; <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">Fernandez-Fuertes et al. 2018</xref>).</p><p id="P18">Several orthogonal lines of evidence support the idea that BV-associated sialidases may damage sperm and affect fertility: 1) <italic toggle="yes">G.vaginalis</italic> is found at a higher frequency in semen from infertile men (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">Andrade-Rocha 2009</xref>) and oligozoospermic seminal plasma contains higher levels of free sialic acid relative to normozoospermic samples (<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">Menevse et al. 2022</xref>), 2) other bacterial conditions that involve glycolytic enzymes are mechanistically linked to male infertility (<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">Khosravi et al. 2016</xref>), 3) multiple studies with sperm from various other mammalian species have pointed to the importance of the glycocalyx in protecting from innate immunity in the FRT (<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">Fliniaux et al. 2022</xref>), 4) the semen microbiome is associated with sperm health (<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">He et al. 2024</xref>; <xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">Osadchiy et al. 2024</xref>) and 5) natural reproductive processes, such as capacitation, the acrosome reaction and sperm-egg fusion, are sialidase-dependent and rely on the timely exposure of relevant surface glycans (<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">Feng et al. 2016</xref>). Finally, several animal models demonstrate that sialic acid moieties on sperm can impact immune cells and endometrial reproductive processes (<xref rid="R64" ref-type="bibr">Toshimori et al. 1991</xref>; <xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">Froman and Thursam 1994</xref>; <xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">Machado et al. 2014</xref>; <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">&#x000c1;lvarez-Rodr&#x000ed;guez et al. 2020</xref>; <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">Batra et al. 2020</xref>; <xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">Schjenken et al. 2021</xref>; <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">Donnellan et al. 2023</xref>; <xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">Li et al. 2024</xref>). In sum, human sperm are an underappreciated target for bacterial sialidase enzymes associated with BV, and premature desialylation likely impacts sperm function and the immunology of the female reproductive tract.</p><p id="P19">We found that desialylated sperm provoke complement activation via the lectin-mediated pathway. Prior work has demonstrated that semen and sperm mediate inflammation in the lower reproductive tract in the absence of BV-associated bacteria, and thus it is possible that BV-associated damage to sperm exacerbates this existing inflammatory effect through pathways such as excessive complement activation (<xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">Schjenken et al. 2021</xref>). Higher levels of complement components C3 and C5, and mediators such as mannose binding lectin have been found in women with BV who deliver preterm, and so it is possible that sperm are doubly susceptible to damage from the FRT immune system in the BV condition-- first via desialylation, and second via the increased levels of innate immune mediators in the cervicovaginal environment (<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">Chan et al. 2022</xref>). Given that women with BV are already at a heightened state of immune activation at baseline, desialylated sperm may kickstart an ascending immune response. Despite the lack of a definitive mechanism for the association between preterm birth and BV, the field has coalesced on an ascending infection/inflammation model to explain aberrant inflammatory processes in the upper reproductive tract (<xref rid="R62" ref-type="bibr">Tantengco and Menon 2022</xref>). These aberrant processes in early pregnancy may result in poor decidualization that drives adverse outcomes such as preterm birth (<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">Norwitz et al. 2001</xref>; <xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">Norwitz 2006</xref>). Given that sperm transit through the lower reproductive tract to the upper tract, sustaining immune damage and activating complement throughout their route, we hypothesize that sperm may initiate and carry some of these aberrant immune activation cascades into the upper tract prior to fertilization. Initial bursts of inflammation are required for processes in early pregnancy such as implantation and placentation, but overactivation of these pathways results in pathology; perhaps desialylated sperm are partially responsible for the imbalance.</p><p id="P20">Next, we found that desialylated sperm are more prone to agglutination, probably due to a reduction in the surface charge that removes the inherent cell-cell repulsion that sperm use to avoid attachment to other sperm. Enhanced agglutination may mean that contraceptive antibodies and lectins will be more efficacious in women with sialidase-positive BV, but also that sperm may be more prone to agglutination in the absence of antibody as well(<xref rid="R65" ref-type="bibr">Tsuji et al. 1988</xref>; <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">Baldeon-Vaca et al. 2021</xref>). Given that several leading clinical contraceptive candidate antibodies, as well as a few anti-HIV antibodies, rely on glycan binding, it will be important to investigate how women with sialidase-positive BV respond to these topical glycan-binding drug products(<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">Anderson et al. 2017</xref>). Furthermore, several groups have proposed that sperm may carry STI pathogens into the upper tract via cell-cell sticking, and vaginal sialidases may exacerbate this phenomenon (<xref rid="R68" ref-type="bibr">Young et al. 2019</xref>).</p><p id="P21">We found that desialylated sperm traverse less successfully through ovulatory cervical mucus. This supports rich glycosylation data from cervical mucus in the sheep model, where interesting differences in sialic acid content on the cervicovaginal tissue and mucus were found in sheep with impaired fertility (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">Abril-Parre&#x000f1;o, Krogen&#x000e6;s, et al. 2022</xref>). Studies on the nature of ovulatory human cervical mucus are hindered by the difficulty of sample collection, particularly from women with untreated bacterial vaginosis and in the absence of hormonal birth control, which can modify mucus characteristics (<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">Moncla et al. 2016</xref>). It is known that women with BV produce more mucus, perhaps to counteract the bacterial metabolism of mucin glycoproteins observed in BV (<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">Moncla et al. 2016</xref>). However, it remains understudied whether sialidases remain in the vagina or ascend into the cervical environment and upper reproductive tract in women with sialidase-positive BV.</p><p id="P22">This work has some limitations. We did not collect samples from infertile or subfertile men, so we cannot make assertions about male infertility outside the FRT, or how bacterial sialidases may exacerbate pre-existing male infertility. In addition, we did not screen sperm donors for BV-associated bacteria, though sperm samples with poor motility were excluded. In addition to sialidases, several other glycolytic enzymes including amylases and fucosidases are produced by BV-associated bacteria that we have not yet explored. Finally, the diversity in bacterial vaginosis cases should also be further considered, given that molecular profiling has revealed varying presentations of vaginal flora (<xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">Savicheva et al. 2023</xref>). <italic toggle="yes">Gardnerella vaginalis</italic>, which produces the sialidase of focal interest in this study, is a primary cause of BV (<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">Morrill et al. 2020</xref>). However, it should be noted that not all genotypes of G. <italic toggle="yes">vaginalis</italic> produce sialidase, and this may cause variation in clinical presentation of BV cases, and that other species such as Prevotella and mycoplasma, express sialidases (<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">Hardy et al. 2017</xref>; <xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">Pelayo et al. 2024</xref>). Clearly, in adverse reproductive outcomes associated with BV, there is also a role of the damage to the FRT. This work does not study the interactions between damaged FRT and sperm. The <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> environment may not recapitulate certain aspects of physiology, such as fluid flow, muscle contractions, as well as the menstrual cycle and hormone signaling on sperm.</p><p id="P23">In summary, we demonstrate that BV-associated sialidases increase sperm susceptibility to damage in the FRT, and that this may play an underappreciated role in adverse reproductive outcomes. Understanding aberrant immune damage to sperm in bacterial vaginosis raises new questions about how sperm may modify the immune milieu of the female reproductive tract in both a eubiotic and dysbiotic condition. These findings highlight the need for further investigation of the role of sperm in decidualization and ascending inflammation in the upper reproductive tract, as well as a better foundational understanding of important processes of early pregnancy in humans.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Materials:</title><sec id="S9"><title>Enzymes and substrates:</title><p id="P24">AUS Sialidase refers to Neuraminidase A (New England Biolabs P0722L). 4-MU Sialic acid refers to 2&#x02032;-(4-methylumbelliferyl)-&#x003b1;-D-<italic toggle="yes">N</italic>-acetylneuraminic acid sodium salt hydrate (Sigma Aldrich 69587).
