This study examines the immunomodulatory effects of sEVs derived from lung adenocarcinoma (ADC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) on T cells. Methods: SEVs were isolated from lung cancer cell lines and Jurkat-E6.1. SEV size and morphology were analyzed by NTA and TEM, respectively, while Western blotting confirmed sEV markers. SEV uptake was assessed, followed by resazurin assay, RNA isolation, quantification, cDNA preparation, RT-PCR, nano LC-MS, and bioinformatic analysis, before and after treating Jurkat-E6.1 cells with sEVs from A549 and SKMES1. Results: Cancer-derived sEVs were efficiently internalized by immune cells, reducing T-cell viability. The real-time PCR analysis showed downregulation of KI67, BCL2, BAX, TNFA, IL6, TGF&#x003b2;, and IL10, suggesting reduced proliferation, dysregulated apoptosis, and impaired inflammatory and immunosuppressive signaling, and the upregulation of GZMB and IL2 suggests retained cytotoxic potential but possibly dysfunctional T-cell activation. Proteomic analysis revealed 39 differentially abundant proteins (DAPs) in ADC-treated T cells and 276 in SCC-treated T cells, with 19 shared DAPs. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis of these DAPs highlighted processes such as sEV biogenesis, metabolic pathways, and regulatory functions, with ADC sEVs influencing NAD metabolism, ECM binding, and oxidoreductase activity, while SCC sEVs affected mRNA stability, amino acid metabolism, and cadherin binding. The cytoplasmic colocalization suggests the presence of these proteins in the cellular and extracellular lumen, indicating the potential of further release of these proteins in the vesicles by T cells. Conclusion: Lung cancer-derived sEVs regulate T-cell activities through immunoregulatory signaling. The molecular interactions between sEVs and immune cells can reveal novel tumor immune regulatory mechanisms and therapeutic targets.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>lung adenocarcinoma</kwd><kwd>squamous cell carcinoma</kwd><kwd>T cells</kwd><kwd>sEVs</kwd><kwd>cross-treatment</kwd><kwd>RNA</kwd><kwd>protein</kwd><kwd>immune modulation</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>Council of Scientific and Industrial Research</funding-source><award-id>08/528(0011)/2021-EMR-I</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>Canterbury Christ Church University</funding-source><award-id>P23-0227</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>This research was funded by Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (08/528(0011)/2021-EMR-I), and Canterbury Christ Church University (P23-0227) funded the APC.</funding-statement></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-proteomes-13-00015"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Among the most prevalent malignancies, lung cancer is the primary cause of cancer-related mortality globally. Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) includes adenocarcinoma (ADC), squamous-cell carcinoma (SCC), and large-cell carcinoma (80% of NSCLC cases). Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) makes up the remaining 15% of cases [<xref rid="B1-proteomes-13-00015" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The complex and dynamic immunological alterations taking place inside the tumor microenvironment are primarily responsible for the unsatisfactory clinical effectiveness in treating advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) despite advances in immunotherapy. The release of extracellular vesicles (EV), especially small extracellular vesicles (sEVs), which are known to alter immune cell function and accelerate tumor growth, is one such mechanism linked to immune evasion [<xref rid="B2-proteomes-13-00015" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-proteomes-13-00015" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Exosomes range in size from 30 to 200 nm. They are found in all bodily fluids and are generated by all cell types through the endosome route. We refer to them as small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) rather than &#x0201c;exosomes&#x0201d; in accordance with minimal information for studies of EV (MISEV) recommendations [<xref rid="B4-proteomes-13-00015" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-proteomes-13-00015" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-proteomes-13-00015" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-proteomes-13-00015" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-proteomes-13-00015" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. SEVs are considered potential elements of liquid biopsy, as their molecular and genetic constituents are similar to that of their parent cells [<xref rid="B9-proteomes-13-00015" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. SEVs play a crucial mediating role in many facets of cell-to-cell communication, including those pertaining to causes of illness. Cancer cells produce and release cancer-derived sEVs in vast quantities [<xref rid="B10-proteomes-13-00015" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-proteomes-13-00015" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-proteomes-13-00015" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. It has been reported that T-cell dysfunction for tumor immunity can be caused by a range of immune suppressive signals carried by tumor-derived EVs [<xref rid="B13-proteomes-13-00015" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>On the other hand, human plasma has a diverse mixture of circulating sEVs from various organs, including immune cells [<xref rid="B14-proteomes-13-00015" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-proteomes-13-00015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In recent research, sEVs produced from cancer have been shown to have the ability to modify immunological responses, which might lead to immune suppression in the tumor setting. However, little is known about the precise function of sEVs from various NSCLC subtypes in modifying T-cell activity [<xref rid="B16-proteomes-13-00015" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-proteomes-13-00015" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>Successful cancer immunotherapy has long been thought to be hampered by tumors&#x02019; capacity to evade the host immune system [<xref rid="B18-proteomes-13-00015" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Human tumors can suppress immune cell activity, particularly that of anti-tumor effector cells such as CD8+ and CD4+ T lymphocytes, NK cells, and dendritic cells [<xref rid="B19-proteomes-13-00015" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. It has been reported that after a short incubation time, the sera of cancer patients may inhibit the activities of normal activated T cells but not the sera of normal control samples [<xref rid="B20-proteomes-13-00015" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Later, it was shown that sEVs, which resembled the parental tumor cells&#x02019; cell-surface membranes in molecular makeup, were responsible for this suppressive impact [<xref rid="B20-proteomes-13-00015" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-proteomes-13-00015" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>In this work, we examine the immunomodulatory effects on T-cell lineages of sEVs secreted from two different subtypes of lung cancer cell lines: SCC and ADC. We hope to clarify the molecular processes behind the connection between tumor-derived sEVs and T-cell line by isolating sEVs from lung cancer cell lines (A549 and SKMES1) and evaluating their effects on T-cell survival, gene expression, and proteomic profile. This study specifically aims to determine how sEV-mediated signaling modifies T-cell activity and adds to the immunomodulatory milieu that characterizes advanced lung cancer in vitro.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-proteomes-13-00015"><title>2. Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2dot1-proteomes-13-00015"><title>2.1. Adherent and Suspension Cell Culture</title><p>Human lung cancer cells A549 (CCL-185, lot no: 70047545) and SKMES1 (HTB-58, lot no: 70037644) were purchased from ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA, while Jurkat E6.1 was acquired from the National Centre for Cell Science (NCCS), Pune, India. Following verification of cell line purity using short tandem repeat (STR), ATCC cell lines were procured following approval of the material transfer agreement (MTA) and biosafety level (BSL). Cell line procured from NCCS was identified for its identity using STR at NCCS. AmpFISTR Identifier Plus PCR amplification kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) was used to amplify STR loci. The Applied Biosystems 3500 Genetic Analyzer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Foster City, CA, USA) was used to process the cell line. Applied Biosystems&#x02019; Gene Mapper ID-X v1.5 software was used to analyze the data and guaranteed that the cell line purity fully matched with the ATCC STR profile database.</p><p>A549 cell line and SKMES1 were adherent cells that were cultured in Ham&#x02019;s F-12K and EMEM medium, respectively. The media was supplemented with 10% (<italic toggle="yes">v</italic>/<italic toggle="yes">v</italic>) sEV-free serum and 1% pen strep, and the cultures were maintained at 37 &#x000b0;C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.

Isolation of sEVs Using Precipitation Method</title><p>The cells were cultured in a medium containing serum devoid of sEVs for a minimum of 2.5&#x02013;3 doublings until they reached 90% confluency. After collecting the conditioned media, it was centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 5 min to remove any cell debris. It was then centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 20 min and filtered using a 0.22 &#x003bc;m filter. sEVs were precipitated using the ExoEnrich high performance sEV isolation kit (Catalog No. PEC50, Exocan Healthcare, Pune, India). Two rounds of sEV washing were conducted using phosphate buffer solution (PBS).</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3-proteomes-13-00015"><title>2.3. Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis</title><p>SEV samples were filtered through 0.22 &#x003bc;m filter membranes and diluted 10- to 100-fold in PBS to achieve a particle count of around 100 per frame for the measurement. The size distribution and concentration of isolated sEVs were determined using a Nanoparticle Tracking Analyser (Particle Metrix Zetaview-PMX 130-Mono laser, Bavaria, Germany). As advised by the manufacturer, the camera level (9&#x02013;12) and detection threshold (2&#x02013;6) were manually changed. Each identified particle&#x02019;s mean square displacement was calculated from the video that was captured. The program then calculated the sphere-equivalent hydrodynamic radius and diffusion coefficient using the Stokes&#x02013;Einstein equation.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot4-proteomes-13-00015"><title>2.4. Transmission Electron Microscopy</title><p>The sEV suspension was fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde (final concentration of 2%). A sample of around 35 &#x003bc;L fixed sEVs was put onto copper-mesh support film coated with carbon, and the film was sealed for two to five minutes. Then, the surplus solution was removed from the edge and left to sit on the pointed filter paper for approximately ten minutes. Uranyl acetate dye solution was dropped and left for ninety seconds after the support film had dried. After the surplus dye solution was absorbed, the support film was clamped onto the filter paper and allowed to dry for three hours in order to observe.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot5-proteomes-13-00015"><title>2.5. SEV Quantification and Treatment</title><p>The Pierce bicinchoninic acid assay (BCA) kit (Catalog No. 23225, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) was used to measure the protein content of sEVs. Protein standards (BSA) were used to make a standard curve by serial dilution. Reagents A and B were combined in a 50:1 ratio to create the working reagent. To allow for color development, sEV samples and standards were combined with 200 &#x000b5;L of the working reagent and incubated for 30 min at 37 &#x000b0;C. A microplate reader was used to measure the absorbance at 562 nm once it had cooled to room temperature. The protein concentrations were determined by comparing the absorbance values of the sEV samples to the standard curve. Background absorbance was subtracted using a blank. For the treatments using A549 and SKMES1 derived sEVs on T-cell lines, 50 &#x003bc;g/mL sEV was used to treat cancer cell-derived (A549, SKMES1) sEVs on T cells (Jurkat E6.1) at 70% confluency.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot6-proteomes-13-00015"><title>2.6.

Treg cells can also develop from naive CD4+ T cells in the exposure of cancer-derived exosomes [<xref rid="B26-proteomes-13-00015" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Immunosuppressive Treg cell differentiation may be induced by EVs produced from melanoma patients, but immune-active Th1 and Th17 lymphocyte differentiation may be hindered [<xref rid="B27-proteomes-13-00015" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28-proteomes-13-00015" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Conventional T cells are converted to CD4 + CD25highFoxP3+ Treg cells in a way that is reliant on TGF&#x003b2;1 and IL10 since neutralizing antibodies specific to TGF&#x003b2;1 and/or IL10 prevents tumor-derived EVs from proliferating Treg cells [<xref rid="B27-proteomes-13-00015" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The real-time PCR results, where the changes in the expression of cytokines were used as the indicators of sEV effect on the T-cell line, indicate that cancer cell-derived exosomes significantly modulate T-cell function by altering key gene expression patterns, potentially contributing to immune suppression and tumor immune evasion. The observed downregulation of KI67 suggests reduced T-cell proliferation, while decreased expression of BCL2 and BAX indicates a dysregulated apoptotic balance, potentially predisposing the cells to AICD [<xref rid="B29-proteomes-13-00015" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Furthermore, the suppression of TNF&#x003b1; and IL6 suggests a diminished inflammatory response, which may impair T-cell effector function and cytokine-mediated anti-tumor immunity [<xref rid="B30-proteomes-13-00015" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The reduced expression of TGF&#x003b2; and IL10 further implies a disruption in immunoregulatory signaling, which could compromise regulatory T-cell activity and immune homeostasis [<xref rid="B31-proteomes-13-00015" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><p>Interestingly, we found that GZMB and IL2 were upregulated in spite of these immunosuppressive effects, indicating a paradoxical rise in activation signals and cytotoxic potential. However, this activation can be transient and eventually result in T-cell dysfunction, exhaustion, or death in the absence of key survival signals like BCL2. These results are in line with previous studies showing that tumor-derived exosomes might influence immunological responses by promoting immunomodulatory pathways and reprogramming T-cell function [<xref rid="B32-proteomes-13-00015" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B33-proteomes-13-00015" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. SEV-mediated immune suppression may reduce the effectiveness of T-cell-based treatment approaches; hence, such alteration of T-cell function may have important effects on tumor growth and immunotherapy resistance [<xref rid="B25-proteomes-13-00015" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. To clarify the exact molecular processes by which cancer-derived exosomes orchestrate these immunological changes and investigate viable methods to reverse their immunosuppressive effects, more research is required.</p><p>The proteins that were distinguished between T cells and T cells treated with cancer-derived sEVs hint the role of cancer-derived sEVs on T cells. Our differential analysis on ADC and SCC-derived sEVs on T cells indicated 39 DAPs in ADC-derived sEV-treated T cells and 276 in SCC sEVs-treated cells, in which 19 proteins were common in both the groups, 20 proteins were unique to ADC treated group, and 257 proteins were unique to SCC-treated groups. Interestingly, upon GO analysis, these DAP showed high potential to release as sEVs by the recipient cells (T cells in our scenario) due to their localization in the cellular and extracellular compartments which are involved in the sEV biogenesis pathway (cytoplasmic luminal compartments, cis-Golgi network, etc.).</p><p>Crucially, the GO performed for DAP between T cells and T cells treated with ADC sEVs predicted their presence in the NAD metabolic process, nucleotide phosphorylation, oxidoreductase activity, extracellular matrix binding, ssDNA binding, scavenger receptor activity, etc. Furthermore, the GO performed for DAP between T cells and T cells treated with SCC sEVs predicted their presence in mRNA catabolic and stability regulation, translational regulation, the amino acid metabolic process, cellular polarity regulation, cadherin binding, unfolded protein binding, etc. Moreover, the GO performed using DAP unique to T cells treated with ADC-derived sEVs and DAP unique to T cells treated with SCC derived sEVs also showed CC in the extracellular and vesicle lumen. In addition, the DAP unique to squamous cell-derived sEV-treated T cells showed their presence in the ficolin-1-rich granule, cytoplasmic vesicle lumen, proteasome and chaperone complex, and in the eukaryotic translation initiation complex. Other than the cytoplasmic and luminal presence, the DAP unique to ADC cell-derived sEV-treated T cells were localized at the cell&#x02013;matrix adhesion, rough ER lumen, and cis-Golgi network. Altogether, the results indicate the potential of these proteins to be trafficked along the endosomal pathways in T cells so as to release them in sEV form for the downstream cell&#x02013;cell communication.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec5-proteomes-13-00015"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>The current study found that lung cancer cells derived sEVs can induce immunomodulation on T cells. These sEVs modulate cytokine level in the T cells and their activity. The lung cancer-derived sEV induces DAP in the T cells, which are common and specific to the ADC and SCC histotypes. These DAP further possess the potential to be released by the T cells in sEV form. Further knowledge of the molecular processes underlying the interaction of immune cells with sEVs is also anticipated to yield important new information on the mechanism of tumor immune regulation.</p></sec><sec id="sec6-proteomes-13-00015"><title>6. Limitations and Future Prospective</title><p>Although we considered the protein abundance in the samples and not the post-translational modifications (PTMs) for the present study, bottom-up proteomics has a number of drawbacks that may limit a thorough description of protein diversity. One major problem is that when proteins are broken down into peptides during digestion, important information about full-length proteins and the PTM that go along with them is lost. This restricts the capacity to completely capture proteoforms, which might include isoforms, PTMs, and alternative splicing. Furthermore, it is frequently challenging to differentiate between protein isoforms with similar peptide sequences since they may produce identical peptides when digested. Certain PTMs may be identified using bottom-up proteomics; however, it can be difficult to determine the exact location and intricacy of PTM patterns, especially when they appear on several residues in the same peptide [<xref rid="B34-proteomes-13-00015" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="B35-proteomes-13-00015" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p><p>Here, we examined Jurkat E6.1 cell lines to examine the impact of sEVs produced from cancer on T cells. Specific T-cell subtypes (CD4+ or CD8+ T cells) derived from peripheral blood can be immune-sorted and experimentally examined for a more thorough examination of the immunological impact. Moreover, this study&#x02019;s reliance on an in vitro model, which might not accurately mimic the complexity of entire biological systems, like those in vivo, is one of its shortcomings. Since cultured cells do not fully represent the physiological environment, it is still up for debate whether results from culture models can be applied to human biology. Additionally, the use of a precipitation-based method for sEV isolation, while convenient and widely adopted, may co-isolate non-vesicular extracellular particles (NVEPs), potentially impacting the purity of the sample, although the absence of exosome negative marker calnexin in the blot mitigates it. The qPCR results showed both upregulation and downregulation of inflammatory markers, reflecting the complex, context-dependent roles of exosomes. While this biological variability is relevant, it also limits the ability to draw definitive conclusions about directionality in immune modulation.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The proteomics core facility support provided by Arun Surendran at the DBT-SAHAJ National Facility for Mass Spectrometry at the Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology in Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, is much appreciated and gratefully acknowledged by the authors (LC-MS), National Institute of Animal Biotechnology (TEM), Vellore Institute of Technology (NTA), and Jubilee Centre for Medical Research for providing equipment feasibility for the completion of this work.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclaimer/Publisher&#x02019;s Note:</bold> The statements, opinions and data contained in all publications are solely those of the individual author(s) and contributor(s) and not of MDPI and/or the editor(s).
