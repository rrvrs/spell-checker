Preoperative and postoperative pain scores, sexual function scores, and vulvar aesthetic scores were recorded. Additionally, the degree of sexual function improvement and the incidence of complications were assessed. Depending on the distribution of the data, paired <italic>t</italic>-tests or non-parametric tests were employed to compare preoperative and postoperative scores. Descriptive statistics summarized the distribution of sexual function improvements and complications.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The study demonstrated a significant reduction in postoperative pain scores [preoperative: 1.5 [0, 2] vs. postoperative: 0 [0, 1], <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.001]. Sexual function scores improved from 19.939&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;3.903 to 28.742&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;2.766 (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.019), while aesthetic scores increased from 10.50 (9, 12.75) to 21.72 (20.25, 23) (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001). Based on the definition of sexual function improvement (significant improvement, moderate improvement, no improvement), 72.2% of patients experienced significant improvement, 25.0% moderate improvement, and only 2.8% showed no improvement. Furthermore, no cases of flap necrosis or recurrence were observed. The complication rate was low, with only one case (2.8%) of mild infection and two cases (5.6%) of scar tension, all of which resolved well with local treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The five-flap technique is a safe and effective innovative reconstructive method that demonstrates significant pain relief, sexual function improvement, and aesthetic enhancement in the treatment of posterior fourchette flap deformities.

However, factors such as congenital developmental abnormalities, trauma, or surgical interventions may damage the posterior fourchette, resulting in flap deformities that affect both the aesthetics and functionality of the vulva, potentially leading to sexual dysfunction (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Flap deformities not only negatively impact patients' psychological well-being but may also cause painful sexual intercourse, increased risk of infections, and other physiological complications (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Traditional repair methods, such as simple excision and suturing, can temporarily address these issues in some cases. However, these approaches often lack a targeted design, leading to increased local tension, scar contracture, and suboptimal postoperative functional recovery (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). In recent years, advancements in plastic surgery techniques have led to the emergence of procedures aimed at both functional and aesthetic vulvar reconstruction. For instance, Dong Yulin et al. proposed the labial margin arc-shaped excision combined with crescent-shaped excision technique to treat labial hypertrophy with excessive clitoral hood, yielding excellent clinical outcomes (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Similarly, Zheng Meilian et al. employed arc-shaped excision of the elongated clitoral hood alongside linear labial margin excision, achieving satisfactory postoperative aesthetics, fewer complications, and reduced surgical difficulty (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). These approaches have significantly improved patient satisfaction and quality of life.</p><p>However, there is still a lack of standardized and effective techniques specifically designed for the repair of posterior fourchette flap deformities. Existing literature primarily focuses on the reconstruction of the labia minora or other parts of the vulva, with limited research addressing the unique anatomical and functional characteristics of the posterior fourchette (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Therefore, developing a repair technique that not only restores the normal anatomical structure but also enhances functionality is critical for addressing posterior fourchette flap deformities and their associated dysfunctions.</p><p>This study aims to propose and validate an innovative repair method based on the five-flap technique to tackle the challenges of posterior fourchette flap deformity repair. Addressing the limitations of existing methods, this study systematically evaluates the clinical value of the five-flap technique in terms of anatomical reconstruction, aesthetic improvement, and functional recovery through clinical observation and follow-up.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2a"><label>2.1</label><title>Patient selection</title><p>This retrospective study analyzed patients who underwent repair of posterior fourchette flap deformities using the five-flap technique at Plastic Surgery Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College between January 2022 and March 2024.

At each end of the primar<italic>y</italic> axis, two arms were extended laterally to a length equal to half the primar<italic>y</italic> axis, forming angles of 60&#x000b0;&#x02013;65&#x000b0; with the axis. Perpendicular to the midpoint of the axis on one side, a line slightly shorter than the arm length was drawn.

Subsequently, according to the plan, angles 1&#x02013;5 are sequentially transferred to target positions A&#x02013;E (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1B</xref>), creating the structure shown in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1C</xref>. During the transfer process, Flaps 6 and 7 might stretch into near-180&#x000b0; obtuse angles; to ensure a smooth incision edge, these areas were trimmed along the red lines as necessary (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1D</xref>). Three suturing techniques were employed: (i) At the sharp corners, sutures were placed by inserting the needle into the skin at the incision edge, passing through the subcutaneous tissue at the corner, and exiting to tie a knot. (ii) Parallel mattress sutures were used for the middle portion of each edge. (iii) Interrupted sutures were added to the ends of the edges as needed (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1E</xref>). The final outcome formed a zigzag suture line (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1F</xref>), effectively alleviating contracture and restoring the anatomical structure and function by extending tissue length and optimizing tension distribution. The surgical wound was covered with sterile dressings, and flap color and hematoma formation were closely monitored postoperatively.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><label>2.6</label><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 25.0 (SPSS Inc.).

Due to the complex anatomical structure of this region, which serves as an important barrier and support while directly participating in sexual and reproductive functions, deformities often result in dyspareunia, tissue tearing, and significant vulvar aesthetic abnormalities, severely affecting the patient's quality of life (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). However, current research on reconstruction techniques for deformities in the posterior fourchette region is limited, with most studies focusing on functional and aesthetic repair of other areas, such as the labia minora or clitoris (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Although existing methods have achieved some progress in localized improvements, their effectiveness in addressing the complex deformities of the Posterior fourchette is often limited due to the unique anatomical characteristics and functional demands of this region. These limitations highlight the need for further exploration in this field. Based on the five-flap technique, this study proposes an innovative repair method to address this technical gap.</p><p>As a flexible multi-flap incision repair method, the five-flap technique has provided crucial theoretical support and practical insights for this study through its successful application in various fields of plastic surgery in recent years. For instance, the five-flap technique has been widely used in the correction of axillary webbed scar contractures, thumb web space contractures, and syndactyly deformities (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Studies have shown that by redistributing tension and optimizing flap cross-positioning, this technique not only restores local function but also enhances postoperative aesthetic outcomes, significantly improving patient satisfaction (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Additionally, the application of the five-flap method in minor cup ear correction and epicanthoplasty has further validated its advantages in addressing complex, small-scale tissue deformities (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). These studies demonstrate the broad applicability and favorable clinical outcomes of the five-flap technique in repairing complex deformities.</p><p>Similarly, this study is the first to apply the five-flap technique to the reconstruction of posterior fourchette flap deformities. Through multi-flap incision design, the technique achieves tension redistribution, reduces the risk of postoperative scar contracture and functional recurrence, and significantly improves postoperative aesthetic outcomes. Postoperative follow-up data revealed that pain scores significantly decreased [1.5 [0, 2] vs. 0 [0, 1], <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.001], while sexual function scores (19.939&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;3.903 vs. 28.742&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;2.766, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.019) and vulvar aesthetic scores [10.50 [9, 12.75] vs. 21.72 [20.25, 23], <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001] showed remarkable improvement. These findings align with the successful application of the five-flap technique in other fields, further validating its feasibility in the reconstruction of complex vulvar deformities.</p><p>Compared to traditional excision and suturing methods, the five-flap technique demonstrated higher safety in this study. None of the patients experienced flap necrosis or recurrence, and the complication rate was low, with only 1 patient (2.8%) reporting mild infection and 2 patients (5.6%) reporting postoperative scar tension issues. These issues were effectively resolved through local treatment and did not significantly impact the overall recovery of the patients. Notably, this study highlighted an important advantage over the approach by Yuanbo et al. (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>), which involved pulling the mucosal flaps outward. In contrast, our method repositions the skin tissue inward, ensuring that the postoperative surface exposed to friction is primarily the skin. This adjustment enhances durability and flexibility, significantly reducing the risk of recurrent tears or injuries. Overall, the five-flap technique showed comprehensive advantages in alleviating postoperative pain, optimizing anatomical function, and improving aesthetic outcomes, providing a reliable technical option for the repair of complex vulvar deformities.</p><p>Although this study confirmed the effectiveness of the five-flap technique in posterior fourchette deformity repair, some limitations exist. First, the sample size was relatively small (36 cases), which may limit the generalizability of the results. Second, the follow-up duration was short (3 months), which did not allow for a full evaluation of the long-term outcomes, such as sustained functional recovery and patient satisfaction. Additionally, this study was based on cases from a single center, which may introduce selection bias. Future research should aim to include larger sample sizes, multicenter cases, and extended follow-up durations to further validate the long-term safety and efficacy of the five-flap technique.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><label>5</label><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, this study validated the safety and efficacy of the five-flap technique in the repair of posterior fourchette flap deformities. This technique significantly alleviates postoperative pain and improves patients' sexual function and vulvar aesthetic scores without increasing the risk of complications. By utilizing a multi-flap incision design, the technique effectively redistributes tension, achieving the dual goals of anatomical function restoration and aesthetic improvement. Compared to traditional excision and suturing methods, the five-flap technique demonstrates significant advantages in the reconstruction of complex vulvar deformities, offering patients a safe and personalized treatment option. The application of this innovative technique fills a technical gap in vulvar plastic surgery and provides new directions for future research.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s6"><title>Data availability statement</title><p>The original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/Supplementary Material, further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding author.</p></sec><sec sec-type="ethics-statement" id="s7"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>The studies involving humans were approved by The study was conducted in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional review board of the Plastic Surgery Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College (NO. 20PUMCSKYU).
