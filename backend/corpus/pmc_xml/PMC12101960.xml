Bladder diverticula can be categorized as primary (congenital) or secondary, with most being secondary in origin. In infants and children, most secondary bladder diverticula are due to urethral obstruction (such as posterior urethral valves (PUV)), neurogenic bladder, or connective tissue disorders. Congenital bladder diverticula are rare, with an estimated incidence of 1.7%, and are more commonly diagnosed in males [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. They are thought to develop due to weakness in the detrusor muscle, usually at or near the ureterovesical junction [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].&#x000a0;</p><p>Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) may occur when the ureterovesical junction becomes incorporated into the bladder diverticulum as it enlarges [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Most small diverticula are asymptomatic and are identified incidentally. These small, clinically insignificant diverticula do not require monitoring or treatment. As diverticula enlarge, they can lead to a variety of clinical presentations and ultimately require surgical treatment. The most common presenting symptoms include hematuria, VUR, or sequelae of urinary stasis such as urinary tract infections due to bacterial overgrowth in the stagnant urine, and bladder stones as minerals in the urine precipitate and accumulate within the diverticulum [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>-<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Obstructive urinary symptoms and urinary retention are rarely reported symptoms in pediatric patients with congenital bladder diverticula. These symptoms are even rarer in neonates, with limited cases reported in the literature [<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>-<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. While the mechanism remains poorly understood, bladder diverticula are believed to cause bladder outlet obstruction through mechanical means, either compression and/or kinking of the bladder outlet or urethra [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Recognizing the inherent technical challenges associated with performing surgical excision in neonates, the current medical consensus, as reflected in the literature, favors a staged management approach. This strategy involves initial urinary diversion with a vesicostomy for immediate treatment of the urinary retention, followed by delayed definitive repair with excision of the diverticulum [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>We report a case of a two-week-old male neonate with urinary retention secondary to a large congenital bladder diverticulum, initially managed successfully with clean intermittent catheterization (CIC), with delayed definitive surgical treatment at seven months of age.</p></sec><sec sec-type="cases"><title>Case presentation</title><p>A two-week-old male neonate presented to the emergency room with a distended abdomen.

Acquired diverticula develop secondary to obstructive diseases such as PUV, connective tissue disorders, or neurogenic bladder [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Congenital bladder diverticulum is a rare congenital anomaly with an estimated incidence of 1.7% and primarily affects males [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The etiology is due to weakness in the detrusor muscle in the trigone near the ureteral orifice, most commonly lateral and superior to the ureteral orifice. As the diverticulum enlarges, the ureter may be incorporated into it [<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. They are mostly asymptomatic, although patients with large diverticula may present with hematuria or urinary tract infections due to urinary stasis in the diverticulum [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Small asymptomatic diverticula do not require treatment; however, symptomatic diverticula require surgical repair. Surgical indications include persistent or recurrent UTI, bladder stones, obstructive symptoms (including urinary retention), and/or VUR [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Urinary retention is a rare presenting symptom of congenital bladder diverticula, especially in neonates [<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>-<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Urinary retention is thought to be the result of mechanical compression and/or angulation of the bladder neck and/or urethra as the diverticulum enlarges [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. There are limited reports of pediatric patients with obstructive urinary symptoms or acute urinary retention due to congenital bladder diverticula. Aslam et al. reported an 11-month-old male who initially presented with an abdominal mass and obstructive voiding symptoms due to a large diverticulum [<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. At that time, the family chose not to pursue surgical intervention. Three months later, the patient developed sepsis and acute urinary retention and was successfully treated with diverticulectomy and ureteral reimplantation. Oge et al. report a case of a 2.5-year-old male presenting with urinary retention and a palpable abdominal mass secondary to a large bladder diverticulum [<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. This patient was successfully treated with diverticulectomy and ureteral reimplantation. Shukla et al. reported a case series of four patients (three male and one female) with bladder outlet obstruction secondary to large bladder diverticula presenting at four months to 11 years of age [<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. All patients presented with obstructive symptoms (slow urine stream, incomplete emptying), but none developed urinary retention. All were treated with diverticulectomy, with three of the four requiring ureteral reimplantation. Bhat et al. reported a series of 12 pediatric patients presenting with urinary retention secondary to primary bladder diverticula who underwent surgical repair [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Six of the 12 patients in their cohort were under one year of age, with the youngest patient being one month old.</p><p>Surgical excision is technically challenging in neonates, and the current recommendation in the literature is to utilize a staged approach with urgent vesicostomy followed by delayed surgical repair, typically after one year of age [<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Bogdanos et al. reported a series of 22 children with large diverticula requiring surgical intervention [<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Two of the 22 patients were neonates presenting with urinary retention managed initially with vesicostomy, followed by excision after one year of age. Singal et al. reported a series of infants presenting with poor urinary stream or urinary retention secondary to a congenital bladder diverticulum [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Two of the seven patients were neonates managed with vesicostomy with a plan for definitive surgery at 1 year of age.&#x000a0;</p><p>Although there are reports of young infants with urinary retention due to congenital bladder diverticula managed with immediate surgical repair, current recommendations in the literature are to manage urinary retention in neonates using urinary diversion with vesicostomy, followed by delayed surgical repair after one year of age. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of a neonate presenting with urinary retention secondary to a congenital bladder diverticulum successfully managed initially with CIC followed by definitive surgical repair.&#x000a0;The use of CIC allowed for successful non-operative management in the neonatal period.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>A congenital bladder diverticulum, defined as a primary outpouching of the bladder mucosa through the bladder muscle, is a very rare cause of urinary retention in pediatric patients. The mechanism by which a congenital bladder diverticulum leads to urinary retention is believed to involve mechanical compression and/or angulation as the diverticulum progressively enlarges. CIC offers a safe and viable alternative to vesicostomy for the management of urinary retention in neonates with congenital bladder diverticula until definitive surgical repair can be safely undertaken.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group content-type="conflict"><title>Disclosures</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Human subjects:</bold> Consent for treatment and open access publication was obtained or waived by all participants in this study.</p><p><bold>Conflicts of interest:</bold> In compliance with the ICMJE uniform disclosure form, all authors declare the following:</p><p><bold>Payment/services info:</bold> All authors have declared that no financial support was received from any organization for the submitted work.</p><p><bold>Financial relationships:</bold> All authors have declared that they have no financial relationships at present or within the previous three years with any organizations that might have an interest in the submitted work.</p><p><bold>Other relationships:</bold> All authors have declared that there are no other relationships or activities that could appear to have influenced the submitted work.</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="other"><title>Author Contributions</title><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Concept and design:</bold>&#x000a0; Claudia Berrondo</p><p><bold>Drafting of the manuscript:</bold>&#x000a0; Claudia Berrondo</p><p><bold>Critical review of the manuscript for important intellectual content:</bold>&#x000a0; Claudia Berrondo</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="REF1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><article-title>Radiological diagnosis and management of congenital bladder diverticulum in pediatric patients</article-title><source>Quant Imaging Med Surg</source><person-group>
