This review aimed to identify effective strategies for involving GPs in PD vaccination practices. Methods: A systematic review following PRISMA guidelines was conducted on MEDLINE, TripDatabase, ClinicalTrials, CINAHL, and Cochrane up to January 2024 to identify full-text studies in English evaluating the effectiveness of GP involvement. A meta-analysis was also performed. Results: Of 1018 records, 15 studies were included, with an intermediate quality assessment. Studies originated from the United States (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 9), Europe (5), Singapore (1), and China (1). Eight studies investigated educational programs for GPs, while seven focused on organizational or technological interventions to enhance immunization practices. Twelve studies reported increased vaccine uptake after intervention. Vaccines addressed included influenza, SARS-CoV-2, pneumococcal, zoster, and trivalent (diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis). Interventions involving GPs in PD vaccination campaigns, focusing on organizational or technological strategies, demonstrated a significant increase in vaccine uptake (OR = 1.15; 95% CI: 1.03&#x02013;1.27; <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001; I<sup>2</sup> = 96%). Conclusions: GPs emerged as valuable allies for PDs due to their extensive territorial reach and trusted relationships with patients. Additionally, up-to-date organizational and technological tools could play a decisive role in increasing vaccine uptakes. This study, offering valuable insights into the effectiveness of GPs involvement, may be useful to implement similar intervention in different contexts.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>general practitioner</kwd><kwd>primary care</kwd><kwd>vaccine uptake</kwd><kwd>prevention departments</kwd><kwd>systematic review</kwd><kwd>effectiveness evaluation</kwd><kwd>vaccination campaigns</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>This research received no external funding.</funding-statement></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-vaccines-12-01438"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Immunization stands as a cornerstone of global health, annually preventing millions of deaths by enhancing the body&#x02019;s immune response and providing protection against more than 20 life-threatening diseases across all age groups [<xref rid="B1-vaccines-12-01438" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), developing recommendations on how to use vaccines, emphasizes that vaccination is one of the most crucial public health measures for preventing infectious diseases and that maintaining high vaccination coverage rates within the population is essential for controlling vaccine-preventable diseases that affect persons throughout their life span and decreasing associated morbidity and mortality [<xref rid="B2-vaccines-12-01438" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. A 2024 Lancet article by Andrew Shattock et al. pointed out that vaccinations have saved 154 million people from dying since 1974; vaccinations are also responsible for 40% of the decline in infant mortality globally [<xref rid="B3-vaccines-12-01438" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Despite this, global vaccination coverage is still patchy and incomplete, with the WHO highlighting that 14.5 million children will still remain unvaccinated in 2023. The COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated this issue, contributing to a dramatic decline in vaccination coverage, which has not yet returned to the pre-pandemic levels seen in 2019 [<xref rid="B4-vaccines-12-01438" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Even post-pandemic, concerns about vaccine safety, misinformation, and distrust in the healthcare system continue to drive vaccine hesitancy, further limiting vaccination coverage [<xref rid="B5-vaccines-12-01438" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Due to these considerations, the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE), in their development of the Immunization Agenda 2030, emphasized that it will be essential for each country to establish catch-up vaccination policies and schedules, with healthcare workers adequately trained to screen and vaccinate. They also highlighted the importance of leveraging all available tools to promote vaccination and minimize missed opportunities, including integrating catch-up vaccination efforts within primary healthcare services [<xref rid="B6-vaccines-12-01438" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>As the WHO underlined, Primary Health Care (PHC) enabled health systems to meet an individual&#x02019;s comprehensive health needs, including health promotion and disease prevention. PHC is widely regarded as the most inclusive, equitable, and cost-effective approach to achieving universal health coverage [<xref rid="B7-vaccines-12-01438" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. GP (GPs) is the key medical professional within the context of PHC. Through sustained relationships with individual patients and their families, GPs can establish a long-term therapeutic alliance grounded in trust and solidarity. The interpersonal GPs&#x02019; skills, as well as their ability to engage therapeutically with patients, are crucial to achieving positive clinical outcomes, as emphasized by the World Organization of Family Doctors (WONCA) [<xref rid="B8-vaccines-12-01438" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. A 2019 cross-over study by Christine Cohidon and colleagues emphasized the pivotal role of GPs within PHC in enhancing prevention practices. The study demonstrated how GPs, in collaboration with PDs, can adopt systematic, context-specific approaches to health promotion [<xref rid="B9-vaccines-12-01438" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. GPs could play a significant role in increasing immunization rates among adults, particularly the elderly, as these populations frequently consult their GP for the management of chronic conditions, as noted by A. Sessa et al. from the Italian College of GPs in an editorial paper in 2015 [<xref rid="B10-vaccines-12-01438" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Furthermore, advice from one&#x02019;s own GP has been shown to be a key determinant influencing vaccination acceptance, as suggested by a study conducted by Renske Eilers et al. in Dutch patients over 50 years of age [<xref rid="B11-vaccines-12-01438" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>PDs worldwide have involved GPs and PHC departments in numerous ways to develop vaccination campaigns, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has produced a comprehensive report detailing all the strategies employed during the 2021 COVID-19 vaccination campaign [<xref rid="B12-vaccines-12-01438" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. These PDs engagement strategies have included interventions such as reminder/recall systems for vaccination appointments using messaging platforms, recommendations from GPs, or a combination of these approaches. The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has also compiled these methods in its field guide, which was designed to support the efforts of health departments and community organizations [<xref rid="B13-vaccines-12-01438" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, the effectiveness of these engagement strategies is not always easy to determine.</p><p>This paper aimed to analyze effective strategies for GP involvement in PD vaccination campaigns. Rather than focusing on a specific vaccination campaign or patient population, it aimed at finding the most effective approaches for enhancing vaccine uptake.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-vaccines-12-01438"><title>2. Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2dot1-vaccines-12-01438"><title>2.1. Search Strategy</title><p>This systematic review was performed in alignment with the PRISMA guidelines and the standards for reporting systematic reviews and meta-analyses [<xref rid="B14-vaccines-12-01438" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The protocol for the systematic review was registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (ID: CRD42024503102). To address the primary research objective, a PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome) framework was formulated, through the following key targeted search terms: (P) GPs; (I) involvement of GPs in vaccination campaign; (C) none or usual care; (O) am increase or decrease in vaccine uptake and acceptance in GP&#x02019;s patient population. A systematic literature search was conducted across MEDLINE (PubMed), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), CINAHL (EBSCO), and PsycINFO (EBSCO) databases up to February 2024. The search aimed to identify all published articles evaluating effective strategies to involve GPs in vaccination campaigns, with a focus on research published within the past 10 years to capture recent advancements. The inclusion criteria were restricted to studies involving human participants, including randomized controlled trials (RCTs), Clinical Trials, Clinical Studies, and Observational Studies, with full-text availability. Search strategies were tailored to the requirements of each database using the following Boolean operators and relevant keywords: (GP OR &#x0201c;GPs&#x0201d; OR &#x0201c;family doctor * &#x0201d; OR &#x0201c;General practitioner * &#x0201d; OR &#x0201c;primary care practice * &#x0201d; OR &#x0201c;primary care physician * &#x0201d; OR &#x0201c;primary care doctor * &#x0201d;) AND (&#x0201c;vaccin * &#x0201d;)) (&#x0201c;7 February 2014&#x0201d; [Date-Entry]: &#x0201c;7 February 2024&#x0201d; [Date-Entry].

Data Extraction and Quality Evaluation</title><p>Titles and abstracts were screened by reviewers to identify studies that satisfied the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Full texts of potentially eligible studies were retrieved after duplicate removal and independently assessed by six reviewers (AC, GM, FS, CC, DG, and MM) using a standardized, pre-tested data extraction form. Any disagreements regarding study eligibility were resolved through discussion within the research team. Data extracted from the study included: name of the first author, publication year, country, study design, care context, population study, type of intervention, type and numbers of outcome and results reported as vaccine uptake in target population. Data extraction followed the methods provided by the Cochrane Reviewers&#x02019; Handbook [<xref rid="B15-vaccines-12-01438" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Study authors or investigators were contacted as needed to obtain additional information [<xref rid="B16-vaccines-12-01438" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In accordance with PRISMA guidelines [<xref rid="B14-vaccines-12-01438" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], the risk of bias for each included study was systematically evaluated. Three researchers (AC, GM, MM) independently and blindly assessed the studies using validated tools recommended for each study design. The &#x0201c;Version 2 of the Cochrane Risk-of-Bias Tool for Randomized Trials&#x0201d; (RoB-2) was employed to assess randomized controlled trials [<xref rid="B17-vaccines-12-01438" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. For observational studies, including cross-sectional and cohort designs, the &#x0201c;STROBE statement checklists&#x0201d; were utilized [<xref rid="B18-vaccines-12-01438" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Quasi-experimental studies were evaluated using the &#x0201c;Risk of Bias in Non-Randomized Studies of Interventions&#x0201d; (ROBINS-I) tool [<xref rid="B19-vaccines-12-01438" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. These assessments ensured a consistent and rigorous approach to evaluating the methodological quality of the included studies. Disagreements among reviewers regarding quality scores were resolved through discussion. If consensus could not be reached, a fourth blinded reviewer (DG) acted as a tiebreaker. The risk-of-bias assessment focused on the primary outcome of interest: vaccine uptake and acceptance within the patient population of GPs. This methodological approach was conducted in alignment with PRISMA guidelines [<xref rid="B14-vaccines-12-01438" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>The RoB-2 tool assesses five domains of bias: (1) bias arising from the randomization process, (2) bias due to deviations from intended interventions, (3) bias resulting from missing outcome data, (4) bias in the measurement of outcomes, and (5) bias in the selection of reported results. Each domain is evaluated using signaling questions with predefined responses: yes, probably yes, probably no, no, or no information. These responses inform an overall risk-of-bias judgment, categorized as low risk, some concerns, or high risk. The STROBE (Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology) statement, a 22-item checklist, is designed to improve reporting quality in observational studies, including cohort, cross-sectional, and case&#x02013;control designs. Studies were graded based on prior research as follows: poor quality (0&#x02013;14), intermediate quality (15&#x02013;25), and good quality (26&#x02013;33) [<xref rid="B18-vaccines-12-01438" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The ROBINS-I (Risk of Bias in Non-Randomized Studies of Interventions) tool evaluates bias in nonrandomized studies that compare health outcomes across two or more interventions. It provides a structured evaluation of potential biases across various domains before and after intervention implementation. The ROBINS-I tool evaluates seven domains, offering a structured framework for assessing biases in nonrandomized studies examining intervention effects. The first two domains focus on issues present before the initiation of the interventions being compared, while the third domain addresses the classification of interventions. The remaining four domains examine post-intervention biases, including those arising from missing data, outcome measurement, and the selection of reported results. Response options for each domain mirrored those in RoB-2, with overall risk-of-bias ratings categorized as low, moderate, serious, critical, or no information [<xref rid="B19-vaccines-12-01438" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>After the descriptive analysis of the included studies, separate meta-analyses for the different interventions were performed. We assessed statistical heterogeneity to determine the appropriateness of combining studies for meta-analysis. Heterogeneity was evaluated using graphical forest plots and by calculating the I<sup>2</sup> statistic, which quantifies the proportion of variance in effect estimates attributable to heterogeneity rather than sampling error (chance). An I<sup>2</sup> value greater than 40% was considered indicative of substantial heterogeneity. Following the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions [<xref rid="B15-vaccines-12-01438" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], if fewer than five studies were included or substantial heterogeneity was observed, a random-effects model was applied using the DerSimonian and Laird method to compute random-effects estimates [<xref rid="B20-vaccines-12-01438" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Forest plots were generated to present effect estimates with 95% confidence intervals. All data analyses were conducted using RevMan software (Version 5.3; The Nordic Cochrane Centre, The Cochrane Collaboration, Copenhagen, Denmark, 2014) [<xref rid="B21-vaccines-12-01438" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec3-vaccines-12-01438"><title>3.

The intervention included: Stage A&#x02014;baseline assessment, Stage B&#x02014;learning interventions with action planning, and Stage C&#x02014;reassessment.

[<xref rid="B36-vaccines-12-01438" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] examined the effectiveness of the 4 Pillars&#x02122; Practice Transformation Program, also referred to as the 4 Pillars&#x02122; Immunization Toolkit, in 25 primary care practices across Houston and Pittsburgh. This program aims to address vaccine-preventable diseases by identifying vaccination barriers and implementing tailored strategies to overcome them. At the conclusion of Year 1, practices could choose to extend the intervention into Year 2; four practices elected to do so. In Year 2, the Year 1 control sites initiated the intervention, while the four Pittsburgh practices that continued the program were merged with the former control sites to form the active intervention group. The study assessed the intervention&#x02019;s effectiveness on vaccine uptake for pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV), pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV), FLU (FLU) vaccine, and tetanus&#x02013;diphtheria toxoids and acellular pertussis vaccine (Tdap) in a total of 70,549 patients. At the end of the study, PPSV rates at individual sites ranged from 43.4% to 94.7%. Both active intervention and maintenance groups showed significant improvements in PPSV rates from Year 1 to Year 2 (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). By Year 2, 79% of practices (19/24) had PPSV rates of 70% or higher, and 58% (14/24) had rates of 80% or higher.

For FLU vaccination, both intervention and maintenance groups significantly increased vaccination rates and reduced missed opportunities. In Pittsburgh, the percentage point change in FLU vaccination did not differ between intervention (1.44 PP) and maintenance (1.4 PP) groups, but in Houston, the intervention group showed a significantly higher increase (3.6 PP) compared to the maintenance group (1.7 PP; <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001).

Lieu et al. [<xref rid="B27-vaccines-12-01438" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] was conducted within the Permanente Medical Group (TPMG) of Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) and included 8287 Latino and Black individuals aged 65 years and older. Participants who had not received a COVID-19 vaccination despite previous outreach were randomly assigned to one of three groups: (1) outreach via electronic secure messages and/or mail from their general practitioners (GPs; standard GP group), (2) outreach incorporating culturally tailored content (culturally tailored group), or (3) usual care, which involved no outreach messages (usual care group). Vaccination rates were significantly higher in the culturally tailored group compared to the usual care group (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.22; 95% CI, 1.09&#x02013;1.37; <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) and in the standard GP group compared to usual care (aHR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.04&#x02013;1.31; <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.007). However, the difference between culturally tailored outreach and standard GP outreach was not statistically significant (aHR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.94&#x02013;1.17; <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.42).</p><p>Two RCTs by Peter G.

The first trial involved 164,205 patients randomized into four groups: no reminders, one, two, or three reminders sent through the Epic&#x02122; EHR patient portal. Vaccination rates were significantly higher in the reminder groups (32.8%) compared to the control (32.0%; <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.001).

The study enrolled 810 adults listed with participating GPs who were eligible for the 2019&#x02013;2020 FLU vaccination campaign and unvaccinated as of 2 January 2020 (mid-campaign). GPs in the intervention group sent a standardized letter inviting eligible, unvaccinated patients to receive the FLU vaccine, while GPs in the control group continued with standard clinical practice. At the end of the campaign, vaccination coverage in the intervention group was 14.7% (95% CI [11.6%, 17.9%]) compared to 1.7% (95% CI [1.0%, 4.3%]) in the control group, resulting in a 13.1 percentage point difference between the two groups (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001).</p><p>Two additional studies focused on informational materials to promote vaccination. A 2019 crossover RCT by Hanley J. Ho et al. [<xref rid="B31-vaccines-12-01438" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] in Singapore involved 22 GP clinics using flyers and posters for a 3-month intervention period. This resulted in higher vaccination rates for FLU (5.9% vs. 4.8%; <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.047) and pneumococcal disease (PCV) (5.7% vs. 3.7%; <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.001) compared to a control period. In contrast, a 2019 RCT by Christophe Berkhout et al. [<xref rid="B32-vaccines-12-01438" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] in 75 French GP waiting rooms found no significant impact of additional FLU vaccination posters and pamphlets on vaccination uptake (Relative Risk = 1.01; 95% CI, 0.97&#x02013;1.05; <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.561).</p><p>Finally, an observational study by Emily Herrett et al.

Discussion</title><p>This systematic review with meta-analyses assessed the effectiveness of GPs&#x02019; involvement in vaccination campaigns conducted by PDs internationally, emphasizing both educational aspects and the implementation of organizational and technological innovations. The review not only described the impact of these interventions on vaccine uptake but also examined the nature of the implementations compared to standard GP vaccination practices.</p><p>Among the 15 studies selected, 9 were from the United States, 4 from Europe, and 2 from Asia. The global prevalence of GP involvement in PD vaccination campaigns suggested their potentially crucial role in addressing vaccine hesitancy. This hypothesis may be supported by a 2023 cross-sectional study by Kemmyo Sugiyama et al. in Japan, which found that being under the care of a GP was associated with an increased likelihood of COVID-19 vaccination [<xref rid="B37-vaccines-12-01438" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Similarly, in a 2017 observational study in Singapore involving 3700 individuals, over 50 identified having a GP as a positive predictor of flu vaccine uptake [<xref rid="B38-vaccines-12-01438" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].</p><p>Fourteen of the fifteen studies included were conducted in multidisciplinary clinical settings with multiple GPs, suggesting a well-established international trend towards implementing community-oriented primary care (COPC) models. COPC focuses on healthcare as a relational process, often reducing health inequalities related to socioeconomic, structural, and environmental factors [<xref rid="B39-vaccines-12-01438" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Reviews, such as the 2022 study by Chris G. Buse et al., have highlighted how the COPC approach can enhance integration and collaboration between primary care, public health, and preventive medicine, especially in rural and complex community settings [<xref rid="B40-vaccines-12-01438" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. This aspect was also supported by a recent Italian paper from 2024 conducted on 15,272 Italian citizens, which showed that territorial context variables such as altitude, urban planning, and the presence of a vaccination center could impact vaccine uptake [<xref rid="B41-vaccines-12-01438" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Furthermore, logistical accessibility to healthcare facilities is identified as a significant factor influencing vaccination willingness among older adults, as noted in a systematic review by R. Eilers et al. of 1001 studies [<xref rid="B42-vaccines-12-01438" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].</p><p>While the involvement of GPs in vaccination educational programs did not significantly increase vaccine uptake, their involvement in organizational or technological implementations was effective, with an odds ratio of 1.15 (95% CI: 1.03&#x02013;1.27; <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.00001; I<sup>2</sup> = 96%). These findings are supported by a systematic review conducted by Odone et al., which highlights the potential to enhance vaccine uptake and coverage through programs and interventions incorporating technological tools [<xref rid="B43-vaccines-12-01438" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].</p><p>Technological implementations could play a crucial role in integrating primary prevention practices, such as vaccination, into primary care settings, as evidenced by a 2024 cohort retrospective study conducted on 1039 patients, where the vaccination reminder message served as the primary source of information by which patients became aware of the catch-up campaign [<xref rid="B44-vaccines-12-01438" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Although digital systems are currently used in prevention practices, they are predominantly applied in tertiary prevention, as highlighted by a 2022 U.S. review [<xref rid="B45-vaccines-12-01438" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Nevertheless, their broader application in the context of primary prevention could also prove to be cost-saving or cost-effective, as indicated in a 2023 systematic review by Wang et al., which screened 6860 studies [<xref rid="B46-vaccines-12-01438" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].</p><p>This systematic review has several limitations. First, it included only studies published in English, potentially excluding valuable research published in other languages and introducing a risk of language bias. Second, gray literature was not considered, which may have resulted in the omission of relevant but unpublished or non-peer-reviewed studies. Third, we acknowledge that three studies (20% of the total) were conducted at the same sites, though the interventions were tailored to different vaccines. While we considered the potential for site-specific biases, our assessment of the methodological quality of each study revealed no significant factors that would unduly influence the results. However, we recognize that the inclusion of multiple studies from the same sites may limit the generalizability of these findings. Fourth, the substantial variation in GP roles across different countries and healthcare systems may limit the generalizability of these conclusions. Lastly, only seven of the included studies were rated as having a low risk of bias, which could impact the robustness of the findings. These factors should be taken into account when interpreting the results.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec5-vaccines-12-01438"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>This systematic review examined the effectiveness of general practitioners&#x02019; involvement in vaccination campaigns within the prevention department. The included studies, consisting of RCTs, observational, and quasi-experimental designs, generally demonstrated medium to high quality and described various methods of GP engagement and outcomes across diverse global settings. While the adoption of purely educational interventions involving GPs did not show statistically significant increases in vaccine uptake, the meta-analysis results indicated that interventions targeting GPs to engage the adult population, with a focus on organizational and technological implementation, were effective. These findings highlight the potential of GPs as valuable partners in public health efforts to achieve vaccination targets. However, the need for more robust scientific evidence in this area remains, particularly in light of the increasing diversity of vaccination delivery settings. Potential avenues for future research include examining the impact of vaccination delivery sites on vaccine uptake, such as comparing practices that administer vaccines on-site to those that do not. Additionally, exploring the contributions of other healthcare professionals, such as pharmacists and nurses, in vaccine delivery could provide valuable insights for future research.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclaimer/Publisher&#x02019;s Note:</bold> The statements, opinions and data contained in all publications are solely those of the individual author(s) and contributor(s) and not of MDPI and/or the editor(s).
