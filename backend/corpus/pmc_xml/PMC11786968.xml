Both protocols employed 80mL of iodinated contrast media volume. Quantitative measurements of the thoracic vascular opacification, contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), effective radiation dose, and arterial venous contrast ratio (AVCR) for each vessel were computed and compared. The measured values of vascular opacification, CNR, and dose length product (DLP) were assessed utilizing paired t-test and Pearson&#x02019;s correlation.

There have been several attempts to improve the quantitative and qualitative image quality of chest CT examinations when employing various radiation dose reduction and contrast media administration strategies&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].&#x000a0;More elaborate work has been conducted on the radiation dose among different types of CT studies due to the increased risk of developing cancer. The estimated number of CT scans that will lead to such a side effect depends on the type of CT examination and the patient's age and sex, being higher in the younger age group and more complicated studies such as multiphase CT scans [<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Furthermore, more specific research work studied the effect of iodinated contrast agents during imaging procedures, such as chest CT, demonstrated a significant increase in the level of radiation-induced DNA damage by increasing the average number of phosphorylated histone (&#x003b3;H2AX) foci per peripheral blood lymphocyte [<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].&#x000a0;The establishment of clinically acceptable image quality is a complex task engaging objective quantitative measures such as contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and until recently, arteriovenous contrast ratio (AVCR)&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Qualitative image analysis was performed by employing visual grading characteristics (VGC) and Cohen&#x02019;s kappa values&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. As a distinguishing factor in CT imaging, contrast media administration plays a paramount role in both qualitative and quantitative assessment of image quality and pathology detection&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Finally, to our knowledge, there is no existing literature focusing on image quality measured quantitatively and the viable clinical indicators between two main types of contrast media injections (direct-drive and peristaltic).</p><p>To date, there have been no known studies employing peristaltic pump injection systems on humans. As such, there are no studies comparing peristaltic to direct-drive injectors during chest CT. These two types of contrast media delivery systems differ significantly in their mechanical properties [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The first system consists of a direct-drive contrast injector-which is made of a piston plunger with a ram moved by a drive motor, an elastic plunger, and a stretcher that fills a syringe as a reservoir to inject contrast media into the patient&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The second system consists of a peristaltic drive contrast injector, which employs compression and relaxation of the tube to draw the contents (contrast media and saline) into the delivery tube; this creates a seal between the suction and discharge side of the pump, eliminating product slip and reducing delivery pressure of the contrast media into the injected vein [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Technically, there are differences between these two injection systems with respect to achieving higher flow rates and varying saline or contrast media concentrations upon delivery&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In this study, we discuss and compare the two main injection techniques considering vascular opacifications in the thorax and the outcomes of qualitative and quantitative image quality while highlighting the total radiation dose to the patient.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>This retrospective study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the American University of Beirut. As part of the approval, patient consent was waived. Before 2016, a direct-drive pump contrast media injector was employed at our university hospital. After 2016, the injector was substituted with a peristaltic contrast media with iodinated contrast media.</p><p>Study population&#x000a0;</p><p>A total of 88 patients who underwent CT scans of the chest with iodinated contrast media utilizing a direct drive pump injector (before 2016) and later on utilizing the peristaltic pump injector (after 2016) were included in the study. This same group of patients was named Group A or Group B&#x000a0;depending upon which injection technique they received. Group A (88 patients) received the direct-drive injection method (Optivantage, Guerbet, France), and Group B (88 patients) received the peristaltic injection method (CT Motion, Ullrich, Germany).</p><p>CT scanning protocol</p><p>Computed tomography was performed using a 256-channel scanner (Philips Brilliance iCT, Philips Healthcare, Netherlands). Both contrast media groups employed a tube voltage of 100 kVp and 180 mAs with x, y, and z-axis modulation (DoseRight, Philips, Netherlands). The temporal resolution was 0.3 sec/rot with a pitch value of 1.375 mm/rot. The detector width was 256 x 0.625 mm.</p><p>Contrast media administration</p><p>The contrast media volume for Group A (direct-drive) was 80 mL of Ioversol (Optiray 350 mgI/mL; Guerbet, France). For Group B (peristaltic drive), the contrast media volume was 80 mL of Iohexol (Omnipaque 350 mgI/mL; GE Healthcare, USA). Both groups received the injection intravenously at a flow rate of 3 mL/s with a 100 mL saline flush. Each acquisition had a 60-second post-injection delay (venous phase) for all routine imaging.</p><p>Quantitative image assessment</p><p>Chest images were assessed in the venous phase of the chest CT for the mean arterial, venous lymph node and soft tissue structures. A slice thickness of 3 mm was used for all chest exams to measure the opacification profile of the thoracic vasculature and the CNR for each arterial (n = 18) and venous (n = 9) segments.</p><p>Image reconstruction</p><p>Trans-axial images were reconstructed with a model-based iterative reconstruction algorithm (iMR, Philips Healthcare, Netherlands). All images employed iMR, Level 2. Images were reconstructed using 3 x 3 mm slice thickness using a smoothing convolution kernel (field of view 380 x 380 mm; image matrix 512 x 512).</p><p>CNR measurement</p><p>The CNR was calculated by measuring the mean thoracic vasculature Hounsfield Unit (HU) and standard deviation. The CNR = &#x003bc;A - &#x003bc;B / &#x003c3;A, where &#x003bc;A is the mean region of interest (ROI) value for each of the vessels, &#x003bc;B is the mean ROI value of the HU of air, and &#x003c3;A is the standard deviation of the ROI values for the total vasculature.</p><p>Radiation dose measurement</p><p>For each of the CT scans, individual effective dose [Eff (mSv)] was calculated from the dose-length products [DLP (mGy&#x000d7;cm)], which were recorded from the patient groups. A normalized conversion factor [k (mSv/mGy&#x000d7;cm)} for the chest (mSv/mGy&#x000d7;cm) was used to calculate the Eff (1): Eff = DLP x k.</p><p>Qualitative image assessment</p><p>The image observer bank consisted of 88 patients who had a chest CT with a direct-drive contract injector before 2016 (Group A) and their corresponding chest CT with peristaltic contrast injector type after 2016 (Group B), totaling 176 images. The images were randomly arranged and blinded, with the contrast injection group not revealed to the observers. All images were assessed in a single sitting by nine radiologists who are experts in chest CT with more than 10 years of reading experience in various institutions around the world (multicenter reader observer).</p><p>Receiver operating characteristic analysis&#x000a0;</p><p>Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) methodology was employed to illustrate radiologist confidence intervals to detect pathology. A score of 1 or 2 was assigned to each image of chest lesions, where 1 indicated positive for pathology detection, and 2 indicated negative for pathology detection.</p><p>VGC analysis</p><p>The VGC method was employed to illustrate radiologist preference for one injection group over another based on qualitatively assessing image quality. A score between 1 and 5 was assigned- where 1 indicated poor image quality, and 5 indicated optimal image quality for each anatomical structure including arterial, venous, lymph node, and soft-tissue structures, as well as overall image quality for diagnosis.</p><p>Inter- and intra-reader variability</p><p>In each group, the inter- and intra-observer agreements were calculated using Cohen kappa analysis. A kappa value of 0.60 to 1, 0.41 to 0.60, 0.21 to 0.40, or less than 0.20 were considered excellent, moderate, fair, or poor agreement, respectively.</p><p>Statistical analysis</p><p>Vascular opacification and radiation dose measurements were compared employing paired t-test and Pearson's correlation. Results were considered statistically significant if p &#x02264; 0.05. Categorical variables were presented as frequencies with percentages, and continuous variables were presented as means &#x000b1; standard deviations. ROC and VGC were employed to measure the confidence intervals in pathology detection and image quality, respectively. Inter- and intra-observer variations were investigated employing Cohen&#x02019;s kappa methodology.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Quantitative analysis</p><p>Patient Demographics</p><p>All patients were White, with a mean age of 48.6 &#x000b1; 20.89 for Group A and 49.02 &#x000b1;20.87 for Group B.

Different quantitative approaches were utilized in our research. We evaluated the opacification levels, CNR, and AVCR of the thoracic vasculature. Consequently, a qualitative assessment was employed using VGC, ROC, and kappa analysis. The results revealed neither injection system had any difference in terms of mean vascular opacification, except for the right internal jugular vein which was statistically significant (p &#x0003c; 0.05). Further into our quantitative analysis, there was a significant drop in CNR values when employing the peristaltic contrast media injector. The CNR values for group B were significantly lower than those for group A (p &#x0003c; 0.05), which could account for the non-uniform contrast delivery in the peristaltic approach when compared with the direct-drive approach [<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. This could potentially highlight the need for future studies aiming to reduce contrast volume when employing direct-drive injectors. While we measured the levels of the mean vascular opacification between the direct-drive and peristaltic injection systems, CNR and AVCR, we observed a decreased CNR in Group B, indicating the decline of quantitative image quality.</p><p>Contrary to the results obtained by the quantitative tests, the utilization of qualitative assessments (VGC, ROC, and kappa analysis) allowed us to conclude that neither injection system had any significant difference in the diagnostic value or pathology detection as assessed by international reviewers (multi-center), and thus, no difference was found in the qualitative measurement of image quality. For VGC, no significant difference was reported between the two groups (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="FIG2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).

Otherwise, the patients who were chosen would not have had any pathology pertaining to oncology where changes can be seen in short periods of time.</p><p>Patients who undergo constant CT examinations are subjected to high amounts of radiation&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. On this account, it is crucial to decrease the radiation dose whenever possible. There also would be reduced accessory costs when employing multi-use system savings as well as the potential reduction of radiation doses compared to direct-drive injection systems [<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In this way, the utilization of a peristaltic injection system would greatly contribute to the well-being of the patient in multiple injections over a long period of time for pathology evaluation. Even though we did not achieve significant results quantitatively, there was no difference in the qualitative results between the groups, which signifies that the image quality between groups was the same for radiologists. Moreover, although the radiation dose in peristaltic drive was lower than in direct-drive injection, we did not observe a statistical difference (p &#x0003e; 0.05).</p><p>Another study in the literature assessed the diagnostic and physical image quality of the chest throughout different CT image reconstructions&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The results demonstrated the importance of being meticulous while measuring the efficiency of CT equipment by only considering quantitative measurements such as CNR [<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. This might give an insufficient depiction of the actual image quality achievement. It highlights the importance of qualitative measures in assessing acquired CT images. Finally, while we did employ model-based iterative reconstruction, this could have shown the reduced image noise due to technology advances and not contrast media delivery [<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Our study has a few limitations. It is a retrospective analysis of a small sample size. Random errors could have occurred due to human inaccuracy in properly measuring the required values with the same precision.&#x000a0;In addition, were not able to calculate SNR because we did not have the standard deviation factors for each vessel.&#x000a0;Computing the SNR would have added further support to the data and results of the study and better sustained our study&#x02019;s hypothesis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our study emphasizes the existence of a broad spectrum of systems to be discovered and validated for chest CT scans. When the two contrast media injection systems in chest CT were compared, there was no difference in image quality or pathology detection utilizing qualitative assessments (VGC, ROC, and kappa analysis). However, upon quantitative assessment of each vessel (thoracic vascular opacification, CNR, and AVCR), direct-drive injectors provided higher CNR and superior quantitative image quality of chest vasculature compared to peristaltic injectors. We were able to extract valuable information from the measured values, even when the image CNR was compromised according to quantitative measurements. The peristaltic injection system of contrast media failed to give us a statistically significant reduction in radiation dose. Our study will shed light upon future examinations needed in contrast-enhanced chest CT scans with a larger sample size for better comparison between the two injection techniques.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group content-type="conflict"><title>Disclosures</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Human subjects:</bold> Consent for treatment and open access publication was obtained or waived by all participants in this study.
