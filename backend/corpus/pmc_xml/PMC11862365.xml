To address structural inequalities and inequities in health, public policies require intersectoral development and implementation. Health Impact Assessment (HIA) is an established approach for analysing potentially detrimental health impacts of policies, programmes, and projects, as well as potentially positive impacts and opportunities. National public health policy,
<italic toggle="yes">Healthy Ireland</italic> (2013&#x02013;2025), endorses an intersectoral whole-of-system approach to ensure that health is a central part of all relevant policy areas. HIA is endorsed in this policy as one way to drive this agenda. Synergising with this policy commitment for HIA, the all-island Institute of Public Health Ireland produced revised HIA guidance in 2021. Two HIAs will be carried out as part of this project, including one at a local policy level, addressing the Cork City Development Plan (2022&#x02013;2028), and the second HIA at a national policy level, addressing the Irish Government&#x02019;s Climate Action Plan (2024). The updated HIA guidance will be used in the conduct of these HIAs. This research project involves a co-creation of a Health Impact Assessment Implementation Model by employing an action research approach with implementation science frameworks to the conduct of the two HIAs. Therefore, the process of doing the HIAs will form the basis for the research study. In order to enhance meaningful community involvement in HIA in Ireland, the project will co-create a Community Engagement Toolkit for HIA. This Model will strengthen researcher, policy actor, practitioner, community, and voluntary sector capacity to collaboratively develop and implement intersectoral and equitable policy responses to major population health issues.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>Health Impact Assessment</kwd><kwd>action research</kwd><kwd>implementation science</kwd><kwd>city planning</kwd><kwd>climate action</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund-1" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010414"><funding-source>Health Research Board</funding-source><award-id>EIA-2022-001</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the Health Research Board [EIA-2022-001].</funding-statement></funding-group></article-meta><notes notes-type="version-changes"><sec sec-type="version-changes"><label>Revised</label><title>Amendments from Version 2</title><p>Only change to the previous V 2 is that I'm adding an author to the protocol.

These wider social, economic, political and environmental circumstances are a greater determinant of health status than individual factors and behaviours (
<xref rid="ref-8" ref-type="bibr">CSDH, 2008</xref>). Health inequalities, which are a result of systemic inequities across these wider determinants of health on population groups, require intersectoral action from beyond health sector contexts (

<xref rid="ref-45" ref-type="bibr">Solar
<italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2023</xref>). In an Irish context, published by the government Department (Ministry) of Health, the
<italic toggle="yes">Healthy Ireland</italic> national survey (2019) reaffirmed that people living in deprived areas are more likely to suffer from health conditions compared to those in wealthier areas (
<xref rid="ref-14" ref-type="bibr">DOH, 2019</xref>). Those who are employed and higher educated are more likely to report 'good or very good' health (
<xref rid="ref-16" ref-type="bibr">DOH, 2023</xref>;
<xref rid="ref-20" ref-type="bibr">Duffy
<italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2022</xref>).</p><p>The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in Ireland was experienced more negatively by marginalised communities in society (
<xref rid="ref-21" ref-type="bibr">EAPN, 2020</xref>). Clearly, what is needed is a tangible way for all policy sectors to work collaboratively in improving population health and tackling health inequalities.</p><p>HIA is a process that encompasses a set of tools to identify best possible outcomes related to categories of objectives needed to strengthen the promotion of health and health equity. HIA is &#x0201c;a process which systematically judges the potential, and sometimes unintended, effects of a project, programme, plan, policy, or strategy on the health of a population and the distribution of those effects within the population&#x0201d; (
<xref rid="ref-48" ref-type="bibr">Winkler
<italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2021</xref>: 3). The WHO Gothenberg Consensus paper (1999) identified four core values of HIA, which continue to underpin the process to this day, namely, democracy, equity, ethical use of evidence and sustainable development. HIA is conceptually underpinned by the wider determinants of health (
<xref rid="ref-44" ref-type="bibr">Solar &#x00026; Irwin, 2010</xref>). It is through the examination of this aforementioned &#x02018;distribution of effects&#x02019; across identified population groups, and collection of data within HIA, that health equity can be improved, and health inequalities tackled. HIA is an established approach for implementing Health in All Policies (

<xref rid="ref-19" ref-type="bibr">Douglas &#x00026; Scott-Samuel, 2001</xref>). It can strengthen the Health in All Policies approach to strengthening the co-benefits across health, economic and environmental improvements (
<xref rid="ref-53" ref-type="bibr">Greer
<italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2024</xref>). HIA, as well as providing formal evidence of potential health-related outcomes across sectors, has been shown to broaden the set of issues under scrutiny, the types of decisions assessed, and the range of actors involved (
<xref rid="ref-25" ref-type="bibr">Green
<italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2021a</xref>).
<xref rid="ref-35" ref-type="bibr">Lynch
<italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> (2023)</xref> advocate for governmental support of HIA as a way to implement Health in All Policies and improve health equity across policy domains.</p><p>Despite continued HIA practice and policy for more than two decades, (
<xref rid="ref-41" ref-type="bibr">O'Mullane, 2013</xref>;
<xref rid="ref-43" ref-type="bibr">Rogerson
<italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2020</xref>), HIA implementation-the doing or practice of HIA-remains ad hoc in many jurisdictions. HIA practice and policy in Ireland has been stopping and starting since its initial and strongest policy endorsement to date, in the public health policy
<italic toggle="yes">Quality and Fairness: A Health System for you</italic>, published by the then Department (government Ministry) of Health and Children (DOH&#x00026;C) (
<xref rid="ref-17" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>). HIA has been criticised over the years, predominantly for adding to the work burden of statutory stakeholders (
<xref rid="ref-34" ref-type="bibr">Linzalone
<italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>), becoming a tick-the-box exercise, and not aligning the informational pathway from the HIA with the relevant respective policies, projects or programmes. In Ireland, research found it often did not have impact beyond the health sector because of poor intersectoral collaborations (
<xref rid="ref-40" ref-type="bibr">O'Mullane, 2015</xref>). This finding concurs with a review of HIA progress in Ireland, which concluded that an implementation gap exists in relation to surmounting cultural and professional boundaries and acceptance of a joint intersectoral approach (
<xref rid="ref-24" ref-type="bibr">Gillespie &#x00026; McIldoon, 2009</xref>). Other challenges for implementing HIA identified in the review include time, capacity, and resource limitations; issues regarding roles and responsibilities; and the impression of policy stakeholders is that HIA is a complicated process. These challenges are deemed surmountable (
<xref rid="ref-24" ref-type="bibr">Gillespie &#x00026; McIldoon, 2009</xref>) by way of adopting a triadic approach to enhancing HIA implementation in Ireland by a) improving the HIA implementation process; b) providing HIA capacity-building; c) garnering political will and leadership. HIA-IM will develop a HIA implementation model addressing points a and c; it will also indirectly inform the Institute of Public Health HIA programme of capacity-building (b) (
<xref rid="ref-31" ref-type="bibr">IPH, 2020</xref>).</p><p>The premise of the project is to explore the doing or implementation of two HIAs with a view to developing a HIA implementation model that includes strategies to overcome barriers in the doing of HIA as identified in the two HIAs. We chose to use two implementation science (IS) frameworks (NPT and CFIR) in developing this HIA implementation model because of the value those IS frameworks bring to this field of research. NPT focuses more on the process of implementing whereas CFIR focuses more on the determinant hindering and enabling factors affecting the implementation or doing of HIA. Both frameworks complement one another in creating data to build the HIA implementation model, given their differing emphasis on process (NPT) and factors affecting or determining the implementation or doing of HIA (CFIR).</p><p>The rationale for choosing the action research design approach, is to ensure the creation of the implementation model is underpinned by an iterative development of the implementation model, involves learning, reflection and action in the HIA approach of those involved in the HIA Steering Groups.</p><p>This multifocal approach to enhancing Health in All Policies through HIA implementation has been demonstrated in other countries, including Wales (

<italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2020</xref>). What can be observed also over the past two decades is the enactment of innovative and creative ways of implementing HIA, in local and/ or national policy development, adopted across in many countries across the globe (
<xref rid="ref-41" ref-type="bibr">O'Mullane, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Current public health policies on the island of Ireland produced by the respective Departments (Ministries) of Health, namely

<italic toggle="yes">Making Life Better</italic> (2013&#x02013;2023) (
<xref rid="ref-12" ref-type="bibr">DHSSPS, 2013</xref>) endorse HIA as a way to facilitate this intersectoral, Health in All Policies, whole-of-government way of working for population health. In line with this endorsement, the all-island Institute of Public Health Ireland, published new HIA guidance in 2021 (
<xref rid="ref-42" ref-type="bibr">Pyper
<italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2021</xref>), as part of a reinvigorated policy support for HIA across the island. Also, efforts in recent years in Ireland have sought to counter siloed ways of working for health and wellbeing. The
<italic toggle="yes">Healthy Ireland Strategic Action Plan 2021&#x02013;2025</italic> (
<xref rid="ref-15" ref-type="bibr">DOH, 2021</xref>) was launched in 2021, including the Sl&#x000e1;intecare Healthy Communities Programme which puts in place a legal structure for local authorities to work in an intersectoral way with community agencies and health services for health and wellbeing improvement. This action plan aims to address health inequality in Ireland through an intersectoral Health in All Policies approach.
<italic toggle="yes">Healthy Ireland</italic> recognises the relevance and importance of HIA in operationalising this intersectoral response. However, the
<italic toggle="yes">Healthy Ireland</italic> action plan does not address the challenges of HIA implementation (

<xref rid="ref-33" ref-type="bibr">Kearns &#x00026; Pursell, 2011</xref>) including the issue of how the approach could tangibly facilitate intersectoral action in tackling health inequalities. HIA-IM seeks to address these challenges through the co-creation of the HIA implementation model.</p><p>&#x02018;Development of a Health Impact Assessment Implementation Model: Enhancing Intersectoral Approaches in Tackling Health Inequalities&#x02019; (acronym: HIA-IM) is funded by the Health Research Board (HRB) under the Emerging Investigator Award (EIA), 2023 to 2026. Dr Monica O&#x02019;Mullane holds this award as Principal Investigator, with team members involved in the project from across University College Cork (UCC), the Institute of Public Health Ireland, Cork Environmental Forum (CEF), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Cork City Council, the Health Services Executive (HSE), Public Health Wales, Ben Cave Associates Insight, University of Galway, University of Bradford, University of New South Wales, Trinity College Dublin and University of Strathclyde. The HIA-IM Public Involvement Consultation Group includes members from Cork Environmental Forum, Cork Healthy Cities, Global Action Plan, Coalition 2030, Coast Watch Ireland, Global Health Ireland, Independent Living Group and Social Justice Ireland. The project is co-hosted in University College Cork between the School of Public Health and the Institute for Social Science in the 21
<sup>st</sup> Century (ISS21).</p></sec><sec><title>Study aims and objectives</title><p>The aim of the project is to critically explore the process of developing a Health Impact Assessment implementation model that will enhance researcher, policy actor, practitioner, community, and voluntary sector capacity to collaboratively develop and implement intersectoral and equitable policy responses to major population health issues.</p><p>The project involves doing two HIAs as part of the research study, one at a local policy level, addressing the Cork City Development Plan (2022&#x02013;2028) (HIA 1), and the second HIA at a national policy level, addressing the Irish Government&#x02019;s Climate Action Plan (2024) (HIA 2). Simultaneously, the process of doing the HIAs will form the basis for the research study using an action research approach integrating implementation science theoretical frameworks. Research participants included in the study are the members of each of the two HIA Steering Groups (Group A), as well as individuals within key organisations involved in the HIAs with capacity to use and embed the practice HIA within existing structures (Group B). For the HIA Steering Groups, members are recruited from community organisations, health services, statutory environmental organisations, local authorities and the research/ academic community. The goal is that by drawing learning from participants&#x02019; lived experience and reflections across Groups A and B, we can connect evidence, policy, and practice in a co-created manner to directly inform the iterative building of the contextualised HIA implementation model. This model will be developed in a way to practically inform the conduct of HIA in practice through the roll out of the HIA implementation programme, led by the Institute of Public Ireland, as well as enhancing capacities and confidence of individuals in doing HIAs going forward. A key component of the HIA implementation model will be the creation of a Community Engagement Toolkit to facilitate meaningful community engagement, specific to the conduct of HIAs. Although the focus of the project is on HIA as one approach for implementing intersectoral action for improved population health, the exploratory nature of the work will reveal insight and nuances in the perceptions of the approach, in using the IPH guidance, and problematising HIA as a suitable approach for creating Health in All Policies within an Irish context.</p><p>Using revised Irish HIA guidance (
<xref rid="ref-42" ref-type="bibr">Pyper
<italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2021</xref>), this mixed methods research study will employ action research approach integrated with implementation science theory to iteratively develop a contextualised HIA Implementation model, that will lead to implementing intersectoral and equitable policy responses in the future. HIA-IM will address five research objectives across four work packages which align with national public health policy priorities for population health in Ireland (
<xref rid="ref-12" ref-type="bibr">DHSSPS, 2013</xref>;
<xref rid="ref-13" ref-type="bibr">DoH, 2013</xref>), with Northern Ireland (
<xref rid="ref-12" ref-type="bibr">DHSSPS, 2013</xref>), and internationally (
<xref rid="ref-47" ref-type="bibr">WHO, 2013</xref>). Through these objectives, HIA-IM will address the HIA implementation gap, as outlined in research on HIA implementation (
<xref rid="ref-24" ref-type="bibr">Gillespie &#x00026; McIldoon, 2009</xref>) and national policy (
<xref rid="ref-13" ref-type="bibr">DoH, 2013</xref>;
<xref rid="ref-15" ref-type="bibr">DOH, 2021</xref>).</p><p>The five research objectives, outlined below, align with four work streams. The four work streams are described in the methods section:</p><p>Research objective 1: Conduct two HIAs on (i) the Cork City Development Plan 2022&#x02013;2028; (ii) the Government Climate Action Plan 2024</p><p>Research objective 2: Apply an action research cycle during the conduct of the two HIAs;</p><p>Research objective 3: Identify factors that influence the process of HIA implementation with a hybrid implementation science framework drawing from the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) and Normalisation Process Theory (NPT);</p><p>Research objective 4: Produce a Community Engagement Toolkit in order to optimise community participation in HIA in Ireland</p><p>Research objective 5: Develop a contextualised contemporary Irish HIA implementation model iteratively by integrating and triangulating data from across the project.</p><sec><title>Study design</title><p>This research study will use multiple implementation science frameworks (

<xref rid="ref-5" ref-type="bibr">Bradbury, 2022</xref>) to co-produce in an iterative way a contextualised Health Impact Assessment implementation model with key partners. HIA implementation is optimised when relevant stakeholders contribute evidence and insight (
<xref rid="ref-11" ref-type="bibr">den Broeder
<italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>). HIA implementation with meaningful community engagement is integral to its sustainability as a public health response for tackling health inequalities, as has been evidenced in previous research (
<xref rid="ref-25" ref-type="bibr">Green
<italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2021a</xref>). Using a community-centered and co-design approach, the first Community Engagement Toolkit for HIA in Ireland will be co-created with key partners. This Toolkit will be a practical resource to be used in carrying out participatory HIAs in Ireland, complementing the use of any HIA guidance. In using the HIA approach, the research study is founded on improving health equity for population groups who will be affected by the implementation of the policy under study, which in the case of HIA-IM, includes local urban policy and national climate action policy. The equity lens allows us to consider the health impacts of policies under study. The rationale, approach and timing of this research study is designed to inform the roll-out of the HIA implementation programme led by the Institute of Public Health, synergising with key national population health priorities and policy implementation going forward. Quantitative and qualitative methods will be employed underpinned by co-design and co-production approaches. A scoping review of factors influencing HIA implementation will be carried out in order to create research evidence that informs contextualised responses to create intersectoral policy for population health.</p><p>Action research has been shown to improve the contextualised nature of implementation procedures within organisational structures, compared to other research methods (
<xref rid="ref-7" ref-type="bibr">Bush
<italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>). However, little research has been conducted on the use of action research methods with implementation research, specifically in assessing implementation processes and outcomes of policies and policy-informing processes, such as HIA. Action research is applied in order to improve specific practices through critical reflection (
<italic toggle="yes">ibid</italic>). It is founded on participation and collaboration of individuals who work through an action research cycle which includes planning, acting, outcome, and reflection, to provide feedback (collected data) in order to introduce improvements to a specific practice. It presents a learning opportunity for data collection of participants&#x02019; reflections and learnings (
<xref rid="ref-38" ref-type="bibr">McNiff, 2013</xref>). Action research is an approach that co-creates research with people, places praxis and reflection as primacy, and is underpinned by social constructivism (
<xref rid="ref-5" ref-type="bibr">Bradbury, 2022</xref>). Hence, within this project, the research team adopts a critical sociological lens to allow space for reflections of social and power relationships with any nuanced implementation dynamics arising throughout the research, specifically in the conduct of the HIAs (

<bold>Cork City Development Plan (2022&#x02013;2028)</bold>
</p><p>The Cork City Development Plan (2022&#x02013;2028) has a remit in creating a strategic spatial land-use policy for the city of Cork. The remit of the Plan is to guide development in the city across nine strategic objectives, including Compact Liveable Growth, Delivering Homes and Communities, Transport and Mobility, Climate and Environment, Green and Blue infrastructure, Open Space and Diversity, Economy and Employment, Heritage, Arts and Culture, Environmental Infrastructure, and Placemaking and Managing Development (

<xref rid="ref-52" ref-type="bibr">GoI, 2024</xref>). The remit of the annual Plans is to provide a roadmap for taking decisive action to halve Ireland&#x02019;s emissions by 2030 and reach net zero by no later than 2050. This commitment is included in the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021. The Climate Action Plan (2024) builds on the previous iteration, published in 2023. It updates measures and actions that are required to deliver the carbon budgets and sectoral emissions ceilings. The geographic scope of the Plan is within the boundary of the Republic of Ireland. The population of Ireland comprises of 5,149,139 people, based on the latest census figures (

In line with action research ethos, this workshop will ensure key stakeholders will engage in the co-design of data analysis, ensuring that the people envisaged to work with HIA and use the resources of HIA-IM after project completion, will be involved in the research process. Incorporating the outcomes from this co-production of analysis, data will be further refined using the reflexive thematic analytical framework (

<xref rid="ref-22" ref-type="bibr">Finch

<xref rid="ref-9" ref-type="bibr">Damschroder
<italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2022</xref>). Relevant theoretical constructs from both frameworks will be used in order to analyse the
<bold>process</bold> of doing or carrying out a HIA (NPT) and the
<bold>determining factors</bold> affecting HIA implementation (CFIR). NPT comprises of four constructs; Coherence- what is the work?,
<underline>Cognitive Participation</underline>- who does the work?,
<underline>Collective Action</underline>- how does the work get done?,
<underline>Reflexive Monitoring</underline>- how is the work understood? NPT in particular seeks to examine the implementation processes of complex interventions such as HIA, understood as deliberately institutionally sanctioned interventions that are formally defined; planned; and intended to lead to a changed outcome (
<xref rid="ref-22" ref-type="bibr">Finch
<italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>). NPT works to assess the implementation processes of those directly engaged in the intervention (HIA) as well as individuals not directly engaged but knowledgeable of the process (
<italic toggle="yes">ibid</italic>). CFIR comprises of five domains; intervention/innovation characteristics, inner and outer setting, the individuals involved, process of implementation. In our research examining the implementation or doing of HIA in practice, the inner and outer settings domains of CFIR will be particularly illustrative in generating data on the wider institutional and policy contexts within which participants are working, enabling us to explore the relevant institutional and policy drivers and levers. CFIR was not developed to only focus on the institutional and policy context within which an intervention or approach such as HIA operates, however, the Outer Setting domain does include policy relevant attributes such as Policies and Laws, Local Conditions, and Local Attitudes that are relevant to the practice of HIA.</p><p>HIA 1 and HIA 2 steering group members from Task 1.1 will form Group A for work stream 2. Each HIA Steering Group structure will include 12 participants. Group B will comprise of individuals within key organisations involved in the HIAs with capacity to use and embed the practice HIA within existing structures (Group B). A snowballing technique will be used to identify and recruit Group B participants, estimated between 5 and 10 individuals per HIA (10 to 20 individuals in total).</p><p>An explanatory mixed-methods approach in data collection and analysis will be employed to capture implementation processes. Quantitative data will inform qualitative data collection and analysis, integrated sequentially with qualitative data (
<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>- green stream). The standardised validated NoMAD (
<xref rid="ref-22" ref-type="bibr">Finch
<italic toggle="yes">et al.,</italic> 2018</xref>) questionnaire, with additional questions from CFIR domains, will be administered to Groups A and B. The NoMAD questionnaire assesses implementation processes from the perspective of professionals involved in the work of implementing complex interventions such as HIA.</p><p>Once the HIA stage of Scoping is completed, both groups A and B will be asked to complete the questionnaire online. They will be asked again after the HIA analysis stage, and following completion of the HIA. In total the groups will complete the questionnaire three times during the process of the HIA. Normalisation Process Theory (NPT), from which the NoMAD questionnaire is derived, addresses and highlights factors in the HIA process needed for successful implementation and integration of HIA into routine work (normalisation). Therefore, we administer the NoMAD questionnaire more than once during the HIA process, at the work-intensive points (Scoping, Analysis and Reporting), in order to capture the evolution, if any, of participant&#x02019;s perceptions of factors needed to enhance HIA implementation. Once the HIA process is completed, respondents from groups A and B will be invited to participate in semi-structured interviews. A purposive sample will be chosen, using selection criteria (organizational affiliation, decision-making authority, gender and intersectionalities balance), from those who volunteer for interviews. The interview schedules will incorporate the NPT and CFIR constructs as well as findings from the rounds of NoMAD questionnaire administration. This will allow the research team to elicit perceptions and experience on factors affecting the implementation of HIA from the perspective of individuals in Groups A and B.</p></sec><sec><title>Work stream 3- Co-produce a Community Engagement Toolkit in order to optimise community participation in HIA in Ireland (research objective 4)</title><p>The aim of this work stream is to capture learning from the HIA Analysis stage (stage 3 of HIA process (

In addition, toolkits that have been developed to enhance community engagement will be included for review. The findings from the literature review will inform the conceptual framework for data collection for the HIAs. This framework will then be applied when involving communities in both HIAs, forming the conceptual content for data collection using the World Caf&#x000e9; method during the Analysis stage of the HIAs. Based on the findings from the application of the framework, which involves community participation during the Analysis stages of both HIAs, the Community Engagement Toolkit will be created. The Toolkit will be aimed at people who are doing HIAs and want guidance on community engagement, as well as guidance for community groups on engaging in HIAs. Data for work stream 3 will be drawn from work streams 1 and 2 of community representatives on the HIA Steering Groups, as well as part of the Analysis stage of the HIA.</p></sec><sec><title>Work stream 4: Iterative development of a contextualised, contemporary, Irish HIA implementation model by integrating and triangulating qualitative and quantitative data from all work streams (research objective 5)</title><p>Identified limitations in the literature will be addressed in HIA-IM including a scoping review of factors affecting HIA implementation, with a view to informing the development of the HIA implementation model. This scoping review will inform the integration of data from all work streams as well as the main output from the research study, the HIA implementation model. Contributions from the Public Involvement in the research study is crucial to the development of the HIA implementation model. This work stream 4 involves four Public Involvement events with the HIA-IM Public Involvement Consultation Group, in the first three years of the project, in order to gather contributions to inform the development of the model. In the fourth and final year of the project, a Public Forum event will be held in order to include further contributions from the public to the model, beyond the Consultation Group. This will ensure the model is both informed by scientific evidence together with contributions from the Public Involvement process.</p><p>Upon completion of both HIA 1 and HIA 2, data will be synthesised and analysed in order to iteratively build the contextualised Irish HIA implementation model. The research study will do this through a process that documents the implementation process in the conduct of two HIAs. Work stream 4 will consolidate the findings on impact and effectiveness of HIA 1 and HIA 2 (Task 1.1), themes emerging from Task 1.2, findings from work stream 2, findings from the creation of the Community Engagement Toolkit (work stream 3) and four PPI events (work stream 4) in order to produce the contextualised HIA implementation model.</p><p>Integration of data occurs at three stages in HIA-IM. The model will be produced iteratively as findings from HIA 1 will be integrated with findings from HIA 2 creating the report on the application of the action research cycle to HIA implementation. Integration will take place at the interpretation stage of the study, to triangulate findings. Specifically, triangulation will be carried out during the iterative and continual synthesis and integration stages, where a convergence coding matrix will be developed to display findings emerging from all work streams.</p><p>A central feature of the research study will be to ensure that research findings and outcomes are interpreted by the research team, staff of the Institute of Public Health Ireland (IPH), and relevant collaborators during research team, Steering Group and Advisory Panel meetings, and meetings with project collaborators. Contributions at PPI events will facilitate contributions to identify key priorities and recommendations, as well as co-production in data analysis, informing the model. The main outcome from work stream 4 will be the continual development of the HIA implementation model, which will be built iteratively and consistently throughout the project. This model will be populated by data findings from all work streams.</p><p>The HIA implementation model will include an explanation of the implementation of HIA at local policy level and national policy level, in order to uncover, enhance understanding and offer a guiding tool and process for doing HIAs in Ireland, at the policy, strategic level.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results dissemination</title><p>As the action research approach is central to the study, results dissemination will be done in an iterative way during the conduct of both HIAs, with ongoing dissemination and learning to be carried out with both of the two HIA Steering Groups. There will be a variety of research dissemination outputs resulting from this research project including peer-reviewed journal articles, policy briefs, research papers, published dataset with the Irish Qualitative Data Archive (IQDA), and conference proceedings as a result of this research project. The translation of evidence to policy impact pathway inherent in the partnership between project team and leading health policy actors on the island of Ireland, namely the Institute of Public Health who are leading on the roll-out of the HIA programme and within the HSE, will influence the implementation of HIA on the island of Ireland. These publications including the Community Engagement Toolkit will be disseminated through the School of Public Health and ISS21 websites, the HIA Public Involvement Consultation Group members, project partners, team members and academic networks.

</p><p> The theme &#x0201c;Development of a Health Impact Assessment Implementation Model&#x0201d; is an essential contribution to public health and policy implementation. The study aligns with Health in All Policies (HiAP) and intersectoral governance models. Also, the integration of action research and implementation science frameworks by global HIA best practices and frameworks. The research has direct applications in policy implementation and public health interventions. Although, the model could be adapted for other countries looking to strengthen HIA frameworks. Using AI-driven data analysis could enhance HIA implementation and scalability and the study can inform urban planning, climate policy, and social justice initiatives. However, the manuscript requires several improvements for a clearer and stronger impact.
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The title is informative, appropriate, clear and concise, effectively summarizing the research focus. However, it will be better featured as &#x0201c;A Health Impact Assessment Implementation Model for Policy Integration.&#x0201d;</p></list-item><list-item><p>The abstract is well-structured. however, the abstract should emphasize how this model advances existing HIA practices.</p></list-item></list>
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Rationale: The abstract outlines the importance of HIA but does not adequately highlight the limitations of existing models.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Objective: Clearly stated, but it should mention how the study builds on previous HIA research.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Methods: The methodology is well-articulated, but more details on the research frameworks used (e.g., CFIR, NPT) should be included. The proposed model is not tested in multiple policy environments to verify its robustness.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Results: The abstract should provide a more structured summary of the key innovations of the model.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Conclusions: Should emphasize the applicability of the model to different policy settings.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Recommendations: The abstract should outline how policymakers can apply this model in practice.</p></list-item></list>

It employs a mixed methods research strategy incorporating action research and implementation science theories to develop a contextualized HIA Implementation Model. The study is structured around several work streams that address five objectives and includes the production of a Community Engagement Toolkit and dissemination strategies.</p><p> Overall, the study addresses a topical/pressing issue, using a robust methodological approach. The manuscript, however, is structured and written in a manner that might be confusing for readers. The transitions between sections are not always clear, and it can be challenging to discern the main objectives and rationale of the study&#x02019;s methods.</p><p> The study&#x02019;s aim for example is discussed in several places using different terminology.&#x000a0;The authors might consider some restructuring so that that the aim (mentioned just once) flows directly from an introduction that introduces the research gap, followed by methods and results/conclusions.

Identifying an implementation gap of HIA into intersectoral policies and actions addressing health inequalities, the study sets out to experiment with a local and a national level HIA, using these as action research settings for exploring theory-driven as well as experience-based implementation conditions and co-developing with study participants an implementation model and a Community Engagement Toolkit. The authors argue that this design will also allow for critical assessment of whether HIA overall is fit for purpose.</p><p> The action research approach in my view offers important conditions to do justice to observed implementation barriers such as reflexive dialogues with HIA actors, affected groups and end users moving from evidence to meaning through joint sense-making and shared value creation, developing a common language and ambition horizon, as well as developing a shared understanding and sense of acceptability, feasibility and applicability of policy recommendations within the institutional frames and boundaries of voluntary coordination in that particular policy field. Actions that move beyond these boundaries require alternative strategies such as activism, advocacy or litigation.&#x000a0;The reflection-in-action design could however take a broader approach, moving the development of a toolkit and a model towards developing conditions for a sustainable organizational infrastructure collecting policy feed forward and feedback for policy responsiveness and change, of which HIA can be an important partial component. This could institutionalize ownership in the non-health policy domain. It is of crucial importance to understand that implementation is not in the hands of HIA proponents, and ownership needs to be organized beyond the HIA.</p><p> On a more critical note, the study design reads as a rather technical approach to procedures of HIA and action research. Yet the study purposes of policy implementation and change are fundamentally political - whether at the micro, meso or macrolevel of government and its relations to society. Therefore the study design could benefit from adding an explicit framework for the analysis of power within and between governmental and societal actors and stakeholders. Understanding the political dynamics allows HIA proponents to leverage the access, voice and veto options in the political system in strategies additional to HIA to the benefit of the public's health. Why would this be important? Because HIA implementation cannot be enforced. We need to deeply understand the mechanisms of policy change apart from HIA in order to devise appropriate strategies.</p><p> Under policy and institutional conditions by which intersectoral policies and HIAs are 'endorsed' - and therefore in the absence of regulatory obligations, sanctions and enforcement, the coordination of such HIAs and their policy recommendations depends largely on voluntary mechanisms.Voluntary policy coordination and alignment across sectors, although often described as 'weak' or 'soft' mechanisms, rely on an ever growing repertoire of strategies, instruments, arrangements and networks that can produce strong and hard policy change to better promote and protect the health of affected groups or populations. However, such policy change usually does not result from a singular HIA but rather from intentional or unintentional combinations of strategies that significantly broaden the relevance to a larger and more powerful group, external events that induce contextual changes in public or political support, and/or shifts in power within the bureaucracy or in the political system. Any HIA initiative therefore could be more embedded in an approach to understand and act upon the complex adaptive system around the policy at hand. Secondly, HIA could become embedded in a sustainable learning infrastructure that connects operational, instrumental policy learning within a single HIA to organizational learning and adaptation of policymaking rules and procedures and to system level learning and change. The system level incorporates an infrastructure built around governmental monitoring and evaluation that makes policies more responsive to issues of legitimacy. Deeply understanding the politics of, for instance, permit procedures, practices, lobbying and (lack of) enforcement puts HIA in a different perspective. It might be helpful to use the action research design to develop a decision tool on what strategies would fit a variety of health impacts and purposes.&#x000a0;</p><p> It might be interesting to further strengthen this study protocol in the literature with alternative&#x000a0; considerations of the Health FOR All Policies model and a co-benefits approach towards a persuasive argumentation for policy change; and whole of society approaches for the convergence of health and economy - an anticipatory rather than reactive approach to state-society partnerships.&#x000a0;</p><p> Some suggestions concern specific points in the use of theory and methods, these are listed here.</p><p> On the use of theory:&#x000a0;the Normalisation Process Theory (NPT) and the&#x000a0;Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research&#x000a0;(CFIR): why and how did the authors select these two and how do these complement each other?&#x000a0;The CFIR was not developed with a focus on public&#x000a0;policies but, rather, to address organizational or professional&#x000a0;policies that do not have to comply with or are not&#x000a0;set according to democratic requirements.&#x000a0;</p><p> Methods</p><p> -&#x000a0;Although participation of key implementation actors and end users is mentioned under the Analysis stage of HIA, it is of crucial importance that implementation actors are already part of the study from the very first moments of designing the HIAs in the Steering and Working Groups.</p><p> - The protocol states that a conceptual framework for meaningful community engagement needs to be developed. The World Caf&#x000e9; offers an organizational procedure that might be enriched with for instance the technique of responsive evaluation (first developed by Robert Stake). Here the dialogue is owned and designed by participants. It focuses on sharing and understanding their issues, claims and concerns, articulating the controversies and avoiding premature consensus. This has been evaluated and proven highly effective in communities and stakeholders feeling heard, developing common understanding and offering increased engagement and alternative actions.&#x000a0;</p><p> - I would suggest to replace the Stop and Share interview during the reporting and implementation stage with this World Caf&#x000e9; format since this seems a crucial stage to the study's purpose. Moreover, participants learn from each other enriching the model further.</p><p> -&#x000a0;I am unfamiliar with the NoMAD questionnaire and it is unclear to me why participants would have to fill out this questionnaire three times, since this study does not have an experimental or longitudinal setup.</p><p> - the study protocol does not elaborate on the Cork City Development plan nor the national Climate Action plan. It is therefore unclear what specific conditions are relevant for the HIA as well as the action research design, and to what extent the implementation model and citizen engagement kit are generalizable to other policy proposals, geographic regions and population groups.&#x000a0;</p><p> - The protocol does not address a theoretical framework for health inequalities. The design might benefit from using scientific publications on the Health Equity Impact Assessment toolkit.</p><p> - The study organization with for instance the Public Involvement Group is convincing to ensure co-creation and co-production with relevant stakeholders and community representatives. The quality however will depend on who will participate and the range of diversity represented. This is not specified yet.</p><p> Overall the protocol addresses an important and&#x000a0; increasingly urgent issue of aligning policies to protect public health. However, the protocol is executed in a rapidly changing context with increasing uncertainties and pressures on democratic and governance stability. Moreover,&#x000a0; climate change increasingly shows how human health in the complex ecosystem depends on environmental and planetary conditions. As a last suggestion, it might not suffice to focus the HIA implementation model and the community engagement toolkit on human health and human inequalities alone. The public health sector itself might consider going beyond human health to incorporate other living organisms affected by climate change, environmental health, biodiversity, and a circular economy as crucial risks and resources to human health.&#x000a0;</p><p> Refer:</p><p>
