This paper evaluates the four existing finance models available for healthcare systems and proposes a new model&#x02014;the GIVE model (government, institutions and individuals, values, and engagements)&#x02014;as the fifth model for global sustainable healthcare systems. The paper presents an evaluation of a chain of three paediatric cardiac hospitals in India to assess the sustainability of their philanthropy-based operational model, through which surgeries are offered completely free of cost to children with CHD. The three Sri Sathya Sai Sanjeevani Centres for Child Heart Care in India have been proponents of this philanthropic model for over a decade. From February 2013 to January 2024, 19,684 patients with CHD received surgeries at no cost. The average cost of surgery was reported to be USD (United States Dollar) 1800. A case study of one of the Sanjeevani Centres showed that 23.8% of patients were in STAT Category 3 and above, as defined by the Society of Thoracic Surgeons-European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery, with an in-hospital mortality rate of 2.08%. The evaluation highlighted the institution&#x02019;s numerous strategies to enable sustainability in key aspects of operations, economics, and social impact. Despite challenges, the Sai Sanjeevani philanthropic model, which encompasses both economic and social impact, is dependable and can be replicated. The proposed GIVE model is recommended for adoption by LMICs as a global way forward to enable free CHD surgeries through sustained philanthropy, strengthened by a shared vision and collaborations.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Congenital heart disease</kwd><kwd>CHD</kwd><kwd>Free healthcare</kwd><kwd>Philanthropy</kwd><kwd>Sustainability</kwd><kwd>GIVE model</kwd><kwd>India</kwd><kwd>Sri Sathya Sai Sanjeevani</kwd><kwd>Low-middle income countries</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Indian Association of Cardiovascular-Thoracic Surgeons 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Universal health coverage (UHC) aims to ensure equity in access to healthcare, provide a comprehensive range of need-based services, and shield individuals from the economic burden associated with seeking medical care.

The centre commenced outpatient services in November 2018. With basic infrastructure including one operating room and a six-bedded ICU, the first surgical procedure was performed in May 2019. By the end of the year, 125 free CHD surgeries were conducted with no mortality. As work progressed amidst scaling of infrastructure and manpower building, clinical care was affected by the pandemic with Mumbai being one of the worst affected cities of India during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. This was in line with the trend seen across 24 paediatric cardiac centres in India which reported 66.8% reduction in inpatient admission between 2019 and 2020 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Soon services reopened with strict protocols and patient testing, amidst restricted travels for patient families and supply chains for consumables. Soon the centre expanded to a new OT&#x02014;Cath lab&#x02014;ICU complex, with two operating rooms, one cath lab, and a 26-bedded cardiac ICU.</p><p id="Par36">Analysis of retrospective data of the hospital highlights that 2541 paediatric cardiac surgeries were conducted by the hospital in the period May 2019&#x02013;January 2024, all totally free of cost. This included both primary and redo procedures on the same patient (surgery for complication or revision of procedure or residual defects) or new staged procedures, but excludes reoperations for bleeding, pacemaker insertion, and wound debridement. Key areas in which patient data was captured were weight, age, gender, Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) category, cyanotics/acyanotics, morbidity, mortality, and ICU stay (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>; Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>). The overall mortality rate was 2.08%. The average ICU stay across all STAT categories, inclusive of main and step-down ICU stay, was 2.65&#x000a0;days for 82% children, 7.29&#x000a0;days for 11% children, and 13.5&#x000a0;days for 7% children. Among the operated, 34.16% of children were neonates and infants and 23.73% were less than 5&#x000a0;kg (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The Kharghar Centre is currently revising its protocols to share data with the International Quality Improvement Collaborative (IQIC).

The assertion of this paper is that free care in Child Heart Care is no longer a choice. The case of SSSSH in India that run largely through philanthropy exemplifies collaborations between governments, institutions, and individuals bonded by societal values and provide a possible approach for international and social organisations in low-middle income countries seeking to commence and offer free CHD care through a sustained philosophy. Redefining sustainability as a composite result of both social impact and economics, the paper also marks a departure from a purely financial perspective of sustainability.</p><p id="Par79">The success of the Sri Sathya Sai Sanjeevani model underscores the relevance of adopting a holistic approach, including state-of-the-art infrastructure, service mapping, advocacy, screening, training and education, research and phased growth to ensure sustained care provision, scalable philanthropy, and continued collaborations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. The model also highlights the need for organisations to focus on operational efficiencies, transparency, and governance for donor retention, a key contributor to sustainable philanthropy. Collaborations have in them the intrinsic power of partnerships which would be the main driving and success factor towards developing a global strategy for philanthropy driven CHD care in LMICs, as is seen in the cases of Sri Lanka and Fiji.</p><p id="Par80">The paper suggests that providing free CHD surgeries through sustained philanthropy is a possibility and recognises the need for more research to evaluate the GIVE model, relevance of the discussed sustainability model in different geographies and implementation models, success factors for sustained philanthropy, relevance of philanthropy in low-income countries, and global examples on collaborations with regard to CHD care. In the pursuit of this noble goal, it is time for the world to unite, rise to the challenges, and pave the way for a future where every child, regardless of socioeconomic background, can receive the life-saving care they deserve.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher's Note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn><fn><p>Declaration of generative artificial intelligence (AI) and AI-assisted technologies in the writing process.</p><p>During the preparation of this work the authors used Openai for minor grammar checks.
