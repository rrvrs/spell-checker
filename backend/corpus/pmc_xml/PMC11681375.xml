Two-way fixed-effects specifications were estimated to assess how ENDS flavor restrictions affect young adults&#x02019; use of ENDS and cigarettes.

In a review<sup><xref rid="aoi240079r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> of quasi-experimental analyses of ENDS minimum sales ages, advertising restrictions, and/or taxes, 16 of 18 studies concluded that these policies increased conventional cigarette use (&#x0201c;smoking&#x0201d;) compared with trends in nonadopting states.</p><p>ENDS flavor restrictions offer a newer and less thoroughly evaluated regulatory tool. A scoping review<sup><xref rid="aoi240079r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> of evidence on these policies&#x02019; effects identified 30 studies in May of 2022. The authors&#x02019; GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) analysis concluded that there was moderate-quality evidence that ENDS flavor restrictions decrease both ENDS sales and the availability of flavored ENDS products at affected retailers, low-quality evidence that they increase cigarette sales, and very low-quality evidence for increases in cigarette use. Findings of ENDS flavor restrictions associated with decreases in flavored ENDS sales and availability at affected retailers are consistent with retailer survey data on availability in stores that are subject to these policies compared with those that are not.<sup><xref rid="aoi240079r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup></p><p>More recent peer-reviewed quasi-experimental studies include Dove et al&#x02019;s<sup><xref rid="aoi240079r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> 2-way fixed-effects (TWFE) analyses of self-reported vaping among high school students in northern California, which found no statistically significant changes in current ENDS use. An industry-funded analysis<sup><xref rid="aoi240079r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> of sales data assessed flavored ENDS sales prohibitions implemented by 4 states as temporary emergency responses to the late-2019 outbreak of vaping-associated lung injuries. The authors found that flavor prohibitions were associated with reduced sales of ENDS refills but increased cigarette sales. Work neither funded by nor affiliated with the industry drew similar conclusions: matching data on all US state and local flavor restrictions to retail sales data for 44 states, Friedman et al<sup><xref rid="aoi240079r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> findings indicate that restricting flavored ENDS sales reduced retail sales of ENDS, especially flavored ENDS, but increased cigarette sales.</p><p>To our knowledge, no peer-reviewed quasi-experimental study has evaluated permanent flavor restrictions&#x02019; relationship to ENDS and cigarette use across multiple states. Thus, we applied a quasi-experimental research design to nationally and state-representative data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) survey, focusing on 18- to 29-year-old respondents to compare how young adults&#x02019; ENDS and cigarette use changed in states that adopted ENDS flavor restrictions compared with those that did not, before vs after those policies went into effect. Not only are transitions into daily smoking common in this age group&#x02014;52% of US daily smokers aged 26 to 29 years reported first smoking daily at 18 years or older<sup><xref rid="aoi240079r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>&#x02014;but also benefits from cessation are particularly high: survival curves for cigarette smokers who quit before age 35 years are &#x0201c;nearly identical&#x0201d; to those of never smokers.<sup><xref rid="aoi240079r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Consequently, policies that decrease habitual smoking among 18- to 29-year-old individuals may have large benefits for population health. Thus, our objective was to estimate how ENDS flavor restrictions affect young adults&#x02019; use of cigarettes and ENDS.</p></sec><sec id="H1-2-AOI240079"><title>Methods</title><p> The Yale institutional review board deemed this study not to be human subjects research (No. 2000037301).

Exposures of interest were a binary indicator for state restrictions on flavored ENDS sales on the first day of each respondent&#x02019;s quarter of interview and a continuous variable capturing the proportion of state residents covered by only local ENDS flavor restrictions (ie, without a state law), to estimate separate effects for statewide compared with partial policy coverage. In all but the first analysis, a separate indicator was used for Maryland&#x02019;s flavor restriction, which stemmed from a regulatory enforcement prioritization document (not legislation or an executive order), and unlike other states, only applied to disposable and cartridge-based ENDS, exempting the open-system devices that many adults prefer.</p></sec><sec id="H2-4-AOI240079"><title>Covariates</title><p>We adjusted for concurrent policies as covariates to avoid confounding when attempting to estimate how ENDS flavor policies affect use. These covariates included other product-based sales restrictions&#x02014;the proportion of state residents covered by restrictions on flavored cigar sales, restrictions on menthol cigarette sales, and bans on unflavored ENDS sales at the start of the interview quarter&#x02014;and the percentage of state residents whose municipality had passed but not yet reached the effective date for flavored ENDS sales restrictions, to adjust for anticipatory responses. Other state- and time-varying tobacco policy covariates included tax rates on cigarettes, cigars,<sup><xref rid="aoi240079r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> and ENDS<sup><xref rid="aoi240079r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> at interview; percentage of state residents covered by workplace indoor smoking and vaping laws at the start of the interview month<sup><xref rid="aoi240079r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>; and an indicator for whether individuals could legally purchase tobacco products given their age and their state&#x02019;s legal sales age at the start of their interview month.<sup><xref rid="aoi240079r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Covariates omitted the federal &#x0201c;tobacco-21 law&#x0201d; (included in the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020) adopted on December 20, 2019, because quarter-year fixed-effects absorbed that variation. Analyses also adjusted for annual beer tax rates<sup><xref rid="aoi240079r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> and indicators for medical cannabis legalization and recreational cannabis legalization, policies that may have affected tobacco use indirectly via complementary or substitutionary behaviors.</p><p>Additional covariates included respondent sociodemographic characteristics&#x02014;indicators for age, sex, race/ethnicity, whether the respondent has completed 1 year or more of college, and whether the interview was conducted by cell phone (a key sampling variable). In addition, we included state and time-varying factors related to the economy (state monthly unemployment rates<sup><xref rid="aoi240079r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>), COVID-19 (deaths per 100&#x02009;000 residents in the respondent&#x02019;s state and interview month,<sup><xref rid="aoi240079r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> indicators for COVID-19&#x02212;related nonessential business closures in one&#x02019;s state at interview<sup><xref rid="aoi240079r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>), and the US outbreak of vaping-associated lung injuries, which has been shown to be associated with ENDS risks perceptions<sup><xref rid="aoi240079r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>; ie, total state vaping-associated lung injury deaths at the start of the respondent&#x02019;s interview month and binary indicators for temporary state-level restrictions on ENDS sales in response to that outbreak that were blocked or stayed (the eData in <xref rid="note-AOI240079-1-s" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplement 1</xref> provides further details).</p></sec><sec id="H2-5-AOI240079"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>We calculated sample-weighted means for all outcomes, exposures, and tobacco policy covariates, for the full sample and the balanced panel. Then, multivariable regressions estimated TWFE analyses to assess each outcome variable&#x02019;s association with ENDS flavor restrictions, with separate indicators for state laws compared with partial coverage from municipal policies. This approach adjusted for state- and quarter-year fixed-effects in addition to the aforementioned covariates to capture how an outcome variable changed in states that adopted ENDS flavor restrictions vs those that did not, before vs after the flavor policies&#x02019; effective dates, without bias from common time trends or time-invariant state characteristics. Given that logistic regressions can introduce bias in analyses with large numbers of fixed-effects, we used linear regressions<sup><xref rid="aoi240079r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> with robust standard errors clustered by state, the primary level of policy variation.<sup><xref rid="aoi240079r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup></p><p>While simplified analyses used a single indicator for all state-level flavor policies, subsequent regressions controlled for Maryland&#x02019;s policy separately, then limited the sample to the 31 states that fielded vaping questions in all BRFSS waves in which they were offered. The latter analyses were first run unweighted and then sample-weighted to clarify weighting&#x02019;s influence on estimates.</p><p>Two additional robustness checks were considered. To address concerns about potential unmeasured confounders related to COVID-19, the first omitted interviews conducted during the pandemic&#x02019;s first 6 months (March-August 2020). The second dropped the 10 states with the highest baseline adult smoking rates (&#x02265;21% in 2016) to ensure that adopting states&#x02019; lower baseline smoking rates did not drive our estimates.</p><p>Event studies and Goodman-Bacon decompositions<sup><xref rid="aoi240079r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> assess assumptions required for causal interpretation of these estimates. Specifically, staggered policy implementation can introduce bias in TWFE analyses if policy impacts differ between states or over time because comparisons between early and late adopters will not cancel out when their effect sizes differ. Goodman-Bacon decompositions disaggregated the proportion of the TWFE estimate that stemmed from each type of comparison; that is, adopters vs never-adopters, within-adopter (ie, before vs after a state adopts), or between-adopters (ie, early vs late adopters and vice versa). This disaggregation enabled empirical assessment of whether staggered policy implementation substantively biased a TWFE analysis&#x02019;s results.</p><p>If Goodman-Bacon decompositions<sup><xref rid="aoi240079r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> suggested substantive bias from staggered policy implementation, we re-estimated the main specification using the De Chaisemartin and D&#x02019;Haultfoeuille (DCDH) approach to generate unbiased average treatment effects,<sup><xref rid="aoi240079r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> following prior ENDS policy evaluations, because DCDH is both robust to that bias and valid in contexts where policies are rescinded as well as adopted, unlike many alternatives<sup><xref rid="aoi240079r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="aoi240079r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="aoi240079r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> (the eMethods in <xref rid="note-AOI240079-1-s" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplement 1</xref> provides further details). Because TWFE produces a more efficient estimator than DCDH, the former provides our preferred estimates where Goodman-Bacon decompositions do not indicate substantive bias.

These findings reinforce the need to consider young adults as a high-priority group when developing tobacco and nicotine policies.<sup><xref rid="aoi240079r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="aoi240079r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup></p><p>Although our findings will disappoint advocates of aggressive ENDS flavor restrictions, the findings regarding Maryland&#x02019;s policy suggest an alternative. Specifically, Maryland&#x02019;s restriction on nonmenthol flavors in disposable and cartridge products was associated with reductions in both vaping and smoking. Because that policy exempts the open-system ENDS used more by adults than youth, it may offer a better target for interventions to reduce youth use without impeding adult smokers&#x02019; substitution away from combustible cigarettes. Or perhaps exempting menthol ENDS dampened cross-product substitution, so that those who vaped flavors and did not want to quit were nudged toward vaping menthol instead of smoking cigarettes.</p><p>Until mid-2024, the US Food and Drug Administration had not authorized marketing for any nontobacco flavored ENDS, a track record that shifted in June of 2024 with the approval of 4 menthol ENDS submitted by NJOY (Altria Group; Scottsdale, Arizona). Although flavored ENDS remain widely accessible, it is unclear whether this pattern of marketing authorizations is paving a path toward policy outcomes more similar to those estimated by this analysis for Maryland vs other states&#x02019; flavor restrictions. Future research should further investigate the potential of ENDS flavor restrictions that exempt open-system devices and/or menthol to reduce young adult vaping without increasing cigarette smoking.</p><sec id="H2-8-AOI240079"><title>Strengths and Limitations</title><p>Our study offers several strengths over prior work. First, to our knowledge, this is the first analysis using nationally representative survey data to estimate how permanent flavor restrictions implemented across multiple states affected both smoking and vaping for young adults. Second, these analyses leveraged a uniquely detailed dataset of state and local flavored ENDS policies to adjust for municipal policies. Given that local policies were widely adopted in several states before statewide adoption, omitting these controls would have biased state policy coefficients.</p><p>Primary limitations stem from reliance on self-reported data and gaps in BRFSS data coverage for vaping. Reassuringly, while self-reported data may introduce social desirability bias, restrictions on flavored ENDS sales would need to increase reporting of cigarette use to explain our findings. It is not clear why this would be true, particularly in an anonymized survey. Unfortunately, the lack of more detailed questions regarding frequency of cigarette and ENDS use precludes distinguishing changes in experimentation from shifts in frequent but nondaily use. More detailed data are needed to clarify those relationships. Similarly, these data did not allow us to distinguish specific mechanisms driving observed relationships, such as retailer compliance, changes in manufacturer behaviors, and/or changes in ENDS risk perceptions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="H1-5-AOI240079"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study&#x02019;s quasi-experimental analyses found that state restrictions on flavored ENDS sales were associated with decreased vaping but increased cigarette smoking among young adults. However, the increase in smoking was not evident for Maryland&#x02019;s policy, which exempted menthol ENDS and the open-system devices used more by older adults. Understanding what drove the difference in Maryland&#x02019;s response&#x02014;whether a specific policy detail or contextual factors&#x02014;will be important to inform regulation going forward, so that efforts to reduce vaping do not inadvertently harm public health by increasing smoking. These findings offer important considerations for US regulatory debates as state legislators consider adopting restrictions on flavored ENDS sales.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="REF-AOI240079"><title>References</title><ref id="aoi240079r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="webpage"><person-group><string-name><surname>Blewett</surname>
