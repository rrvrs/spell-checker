Despite their prevalence, the mechanisms underlying regional itch differences remain poorly understood. Here, we investigate the neural basis of regional differences, focusing on the functional role of neuropeptides and histamine receptors expression in trigeminal ganglia versus dorsal root ganglia innervating afferents to cheek and the neck. Using an interdisciplinary approach, we identified distinct regional differences between the cheeks and necks of mice and humans. Our findings reveal that Substance P modulates itch in the cheek, while histamine receptor 1 (HRH1) is the primary receptor mediating itch but not pain in the cheek. We also discovered regional differences in sensory neuron subpopulations, with increased co-expression of HRH1 and neuropeptides in trigeminal ganglion neurons. Our study provides new insights into the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying regional itch differences, supporting region-specific treatment strategies for skin and systemic diseases.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p id="P2">Somatosensory neurons in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and trigeminal ganglia (TG) detect various stimuli, generating distinct sensations and responses. DRG neurons innervate the skin of the limbs and torso, whereas TG neurons innervate unique sensory areas in the head and neck, including the eyes, nose, mouth, meninges, and vibrissae. Reports have identified genes linked to somatosensory neurons&#x02019; detection specificity in DRG and TG. DRG RNA-sequencing reveals distinct expression profiles for proprioceptive and itch-responsive neurons predominantly in mice<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> and humans<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. However, TG neuronal populations differ from DRG, as they lack proprioceptive neurons and innervate several unique sensory environments: the eyes, nasal passages and sinuses, meninges, and, in animals, vibrissae. Recent research has found TG-specific differences at the transcription level<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>, but whether that induces a differential behavioral response or differences in itch circuitry in mice is unknown.</p><p id="P3">In humans, the severity of itch is perceived differentially across body regions, with the face and torso<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> exhibiting distinct intensity thresholds. Animal models have recapitulated these phenomena, showing fewer scratching bouts in response to intradermal pruritogen injections in the cheek than dorsal nape<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. This difference is consistent across common pruritogens<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>, including histamine<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. Notably, facial injection of pruritogens and algogens activates an overlapping population of second-order neurons found in the spinal trigeminal nucleus<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. In contrast, itch and pain are processed in the DRG sensory neurons and activate separate populations of second-order neurons<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">The distinct neural processing of itch in the TG versus the DRG suggests the involvement of specific neuropeptides and signaling pathway involved in transmitting itch signals from the face versus the body. Itch and pain sensations are mediated through specific neuropeptides. Substance P (SP) mediates pain sensations<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. Meanwhile, itch sensations are mediated by somatostatin (SST)-expressing neurons, which are &#x0003e; 99% co-localized with brain natriuretic peptide (BNP)-expressing neurons<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>. Activation of these first-order neurons triggers the release of these neuropeptides, which then activate second-order neurons in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord to further process these pain and itch sensations<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">The significant difference in itch processing between the face (cheek) and torso (neck) reveals a substantial knowledge gap. To address this, we employed a multifaceted approach combining mouse genetics and behavioral, pharmacological, cellular, and molecular techniques. Following intradermal histamine injections into the dorsal nape or cheek, we investigated itch behavior in C57Bl6/J (inbred) and CD-1 (outbred) mice. Additionally, we examined histamine-induced itch behavior in mice lacking BNP or SP as well as in mice treated with antagonists for their respective receptors (NPR1<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> and TACR1). We also assessed nape and cheek skin innervation density by genetically marking somatostatin-expressing neurons with tdTomato. To identify differences in neuronal populations, we used tracing techniques followed by immunohistochemistry and in-situ hybridization to analyze histamine receptors H1 and H3, BNP/SST, and SP in human and mouse DRG and TG. Our findings show a crucial mechanism underlying the differences in itch processing between the face and body, which may have implications for future therapeutic interventions.</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="S3"><title>Regional scratching response between the face and neck</title><p id="P6">We initially performed a literature review of papers published between January 2009 and June 2023 (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>, <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">C</xref>) which revealed significant differences in scratching bouts, when normalized for time, between these two regions in response to various pruritogens, including for histamine (*p &#x0003c; 0.0001), chloroquine (*p = 0.0008), and SLIGRL-NH2, PAR-2 specific agonists (*p = 0.0006) (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). This data was further confirmed when we combined all scratching bouts/minute values for all pruritogens (*p = 0.0073) (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>).</p><p id="P7">To investigate the regional scratching response between the face and neck, we comprehensively analyzed scratching behavior in C57Bl6/J mice following intradermal injections of pruritogens into the dorsal nape and cheek. Histamine elicited significantly fewer scratch bouts of ipsilateral cheek-directed scratching than dorsal nape-directed scratching bouts (*p = 0.0040) (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>) in C57Bl6/J mice injected with histamine. In contrast, we did not find any significant differences when comparing the total amount of time spent scratching directed at these areas (*p = 0.2947) (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>), and no significant differences were seen in the average bout duration (*p = 0.2540) (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>). The time course of histamine-induced scratching bouts differed significantly between the dorsal nape and cheek (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref>). Ipsilateral cheek-directed scratching bouts peaked within the first 5 minutes (*p &#x0003c; 0.0001) (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref>) and the number of dorsal nape-directed scratching bouts peaked at 15 minutes (*p = 0.0001) (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref>).</p><p id="P8">To confirm that our findings in C57Bl6/J mice were not strain-specific, we repeated the experiments using CD-1 mice, a commonly used itch research outbred mouse line (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1H</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">K</xref>)<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>. Our results showed a similar pattern: fewer ipsilateral cheek-directed scratching bouts (*p &#x0003c; 0.0001); however, we found significantly shorter scratching times than dorsal nape-directed scratching bouts (*p &#x0003c; 0.0001) (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1H</xref> &#x00026;<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">I</xref>). Unlike with C57BL/6J mice, bout duration significantly differed between regions in the CD-1 mice (*p = 0.0380) (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1J</xref>). The time course of histamine-induced scratching bouts differed between regions, with cheek-directed scratching peaking within 5 minutes, and significant differences were observed at 15 (*p = 0.0002), 20 (*p = 0.0477) and 30 minutes (*p = 0.0009) (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1K</xref>).</p><p id="P9">Overall, our data suggests that regional differences in itch are conserved across outbred and inbred mouse lines, with the cheek being less responsive to histamine-induced itch compared to the dorsal nape.</p><sec id="S4"><title>Regional itch differences are not explained by innervation densities</title><p id="P10">Given the difference in histamine-induced itch between the dorsal nape and cheek, we hypothesized that there may be a difference in innervation density of itch sensing neurons between the facial dermatomes innervated by the TG<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> and the dorsal nape dermatomes innervated by the DRG<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>. To assess this, we generated SST-cre::Ai9 mice in which tdTomato was conditionally expressed in SST-expressing neurons. We chose to generate SST-cre::Ai9 mice since previous work has demonstrated that SST-expressing DRG sensory neurons are responsible for mediating itch signals induced by histamine<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>. We found that the skin of the cheek has a significantly higher degree of innervation by SST-cre::Ai9 neurons as compared to the dorsal nape (*p = 0.0158) (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1N</xref> &#x02013; <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">O</xref>). Due to the increased innervation density of SST-cre::Ai9 afferents in the cheek, we hypothesized that there was an increase in the number of SST-expressing neurons in the TG. As expected, we found significantly more SST-expressing neurons in the TG as compared to the DRG (*p = 0.0029) (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2Q</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">S</xref>). This increase is likely to be responsible for increased SST-positive afferent density between the dorsal nape and the cheek. These findings also establish that the higher innervation density of itch-sensing neurons in the cheek does not correlate with the reduced scratching response observed in this region.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Distinct role of SP in modulating itch response in the cheek and dorsal nape.</title><p id="P11">Since innervation density did not explain the regional differences in itch response, we hypothesized that pain-associated neuropeptides, specifically Substance P (SP)<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>, might modulate ipsilateral cheek-directed scratching behavior. Based on previous observations where we found the dorsal nape, all SST-expressing DRG sensory neurons are positive for BNP<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. Further, these BNP-expressing DRG sensory neurons are not positive for Substance P (SP)<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>, a canonical pain-associated neuropeptide.<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> While there is literature about the relative co-expression of these neuropeptides in DRG sensory neurons, there is no information about their co-expression in TG sensory neurons.</p><p id="P12">To test if SP modulated itch responses in the cheek, we used knockout (KO) mice lacking SP or BNP and quantified scratching bouts after histamine injection into both the dorsal nape and the cheek (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). We found that SP-KO mice exhibited significantly more ipsilateral cheek-directed scratching bouts than wild-type controls (*p = 0.0007) (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>), with no differences in dorsal nape-directed scratching bouts (*p = 0.2390) (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). We used BNP-KO mice as a control, as these mice should lack an itch behavior phenotype, and demonstrated that the loss of BNP resulted in a significant decrease in the total number of dorsal nape (*p = 0.0126) and ipsilateral cheek-directed (*p = 0.0338) scratching bouts (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref> &#x00026; <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">F</xref>).</p><p id="P13">To confirm that our behavior results in SP-KO and BNP-KO mice, we pharmacologically inhibited the SP receptor (TacR1) with L-733,060<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>. We found that these mice exhibited significantly higher amounts of ipsilateral cheek-directed scratching bouts than vehicle-treated mice (*p = 0.0198) (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). Like the SP-KO mice, L-733,060 treated mice had no significant differences in dorsal nape-directed scratching bout compared to vehicle-treated mice (*p = 0.3568) (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). Mice treated with the NPR1 antagonist JS-11<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> experienced significantly fewer scratching bouts in both the ipsilateral cheek (*p = 0.0338) and the dorsal nape (*p = 0.0396) (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G</xref> &#x00026; <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">H</xref>). These findings suggest that SP plays distinct roles in modulating itch response in the cheek and dorsal nape, with SP inhibiting and BNP promoting itch in the cheek.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Histamine receptor-specific itch induction.</title><p id="P14">To investigate which histamine receptors, mediate histamine-induced itch in these regions, we built on our previous findings on regional differences in itch between the cheek and nape. We focused on the four histamine receptors, three of which are expressed in DRG sensory neurons. scRNA-sequencing data showed that HRH1 mRNA is expressed predominantly in SST- and MrgprA3-positive DRG sensory neurons, while HRH3 is expressed in SP-positive DRG sensory neurons involved in pain<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P15">To determine which histamine receptor(s) are responsible for transducing histamine-induced itch, we injected 2-pyridylethylamine (HRH1-specific agonist)<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> and immethridine (HRH3-specific agonist)<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> into the dorsal nape and cheek of mice. We found that 2-pyridylethylamine induced HRH1-mediated itch in both the dorsal nape and ipsilateral cheek, with no significant differences in scratching bouts compared to histamine-injected mice (*p = 0.5208, nape; *p = 0.7708, cheek) (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref> &#x00026; <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">C</xref>). We found that 2-Pyr induced significantly more cheek wipes as compared to histamine in addition to the cheek directed scratching (*p = 0.0230) (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). Immethridine also induced more ipsilateral cheek wipes (*p = 0.136) (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>), but fewer scratching bouts than histamine (*p &#x0003c; 0.0001, nape; *p = 0.0264, cheek) in both regions. Immethridine induced fewer scratching bouts than 2-pyridylethylamine in the nape (*p = 0.0002, nape), but not the cheek (*p = 0.2373). Our results suggest that HRH1 is the primary histamine receptor mediating itch in dorsal nape-innervating DRG sensory neurons, while HRH3 may play a role in pain-behavior.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Regional variations in sensory neuron populations underlying itch and pain</title><p id="P16">Our previous findings on regional differences in itch and SST/SP innervation led us to investigate the populations of SST-, SP-, HRH1-, and HRH3-expressing sensory neurons in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) and trigeminal ganglion (TG) of mice, which we also further validated in humans. Our SST-cre::Ai9 innervation results indicated that there should be a larger proportion of SST-positive TG sensory neurons. Additionally, our behavior results indirectly indicate that SP-positive TG sensory neurons are important in modulating ipsilateral cheek itch. Since pain signaling is capable of modulating itch sensation and vice versa<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>, we hypothesized that there is a change in the number of TG sensory neurons that are positive for both SST and SP. We found that overall, there was a significant increase in the percentage of TG sensory neurons positive for both SST and SP as compared to the DRG (*p = 0.0012) (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref> &#x02013; <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">D</xref>). We further validated this in human using <italic toggle="yes">in situ</italic> hybridization (ISH; <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">H</xref>).</p><p id="P17">Using wheat germ agglutinin (WGA-350) as a neuronal tracer, used here to identify skin-innervating sensory neurons, we also found a larger population of cheek skin-innervating TG sensory neurons positive for both SST and SP compared to dorsal nape-innervating DRG sensory neurons (*p = 0.0051) (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). Next, we investigated the expression of HRH1 and HRH3 in skin-innervating sensory neurons in mice (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). Our results showed an increase in the percentage of TG sensory neurons expressing HRH1, SST, and SP, as well as HRH3, SST, and SP, compared to the DRG. We further corroborated these findings in human TG versus DRG regional-specific differences in human sensory neurons (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S8"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p id="P18">Our study reveals significant regional differences in itch response between the cheek and dorsal nape (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). These differences are not attributed to variations in innervation density (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>), but to distinct populations of sensory neurons expressing specific neuropeptides and receptors (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Here, we demonstrate that the difference in facial histaminergic itch processing is due to differences in the proportion of TG neurons that co-express Substance P with SST, HRH1, and HRH3 (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figs. 4</xref> &#x00026;<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Behaviorally, this results in the likely activation of HRH1, inducing pain responses in the cheek. Further, we demonstrate that HRH3 might transduce histamine activation into pain (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). Our histological results were also recapitulated in human DRG and TG samples (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figs. 4</xref> &#x00026; <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>), extending their translational relevance. Finally, our results indicate that the TG processes facial itches fundamentally differently by a mechanism similar to what is seen in the gate control model of itch and pain processing (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6I</xref>).</p><p id="P19">Here, we confirmed that the number of histamine-induced ipsilateral cheek-directed scratching bouts is significantly reduced as compared to the number of histamine-induced dorsal nape scratching bouts by systematically comparing the scratching bouts by using the C57Bl/6J mice and the same amount of histamine in the same injection volume for both the cheek and nape injections. These results confirm that the reduction in the total number of ipsilateral cheek-directed scratching bouts is due to a difference in the neurophysiology of the cheek skin as opposed to differences in injection volumes or dose (at least for histamine). Interestingly, outbred CD-1 mice, which are thought to be a better model for human research<sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup>, had significantly fewer ipsilateral cheek-directed scratching bouts, corroborating the results from the inbred line. Furthermore, CD-1 mice have significantly shorter scratching bout durations (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1I</xref>), implying that they also perceive histaminergic itch in the cheek as less intense than histaminergic itch in the dorsal nape. Validation of regional differences in histamine-induced itch between inbred and outbred lines suggests that the study findings are not limited to a specific mouse strain and likely translatable to humans.</p><p id="P20">One of the limitations of our study is that we specifically investigated the role of histamine in regional itch differences, despite literature suggesting that other itch mediators, such as chloroquine, serotonin, SLIGRL-NH2, IL31, and proteases, may also exhibit similar regional differences (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). There are mostly three reasons for this focus: Firstly, histamine is a well-known endogenous mediator for itch. Further, its involvement in itch processing is a helpful model for understanding the neural mechanisms underlying regional differences itch sensitivity. Secondly, in sensory neurons, histamine&#x02019;s-induced itch primarily mediated by the histamine receptor 1 (HRH1). This receptor specificity allows for targeted investigation of histamine&#x02019;s role in regional itch differences, without the confounding effects of other itch mediators. Lastly, histamine allows for a more in-depth investigation of the neural mechanisms underlying regional itch differences, which can serve as a foundation for future studies on other itch mediators, and the clinical relevance of histamine in itch disorders makes it a prime target for therapeutic intervention at sensory neurons carrying message to the CNS.</p><sec id="S9"><title>Histamine-induced behavior hints at TG-specific processing of itch behavior</title><p id="P21">Reports have indicated differences between the DRG and TG at the transcriptome level<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. Yet, the overall assumption has been that itch and pain processing in the TG follows the same pathways as itch processing in the DRG. Electrophysiology work performed by Akiyama et al.,<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> further hinted at a difference in pain and itch signaling when they reported that pruritogens and algogens, itch inducers and pain inducers, respectively, results in postsynaptic activation of an overlapping population of neurons in the spinal trigeminal (TG) nucleus.</p><p id="P22">There are currently two main theories about how the nervous system processes itch and pain. The first is a modified label-line theory, which posits that itch and pain are processed by two parallel pathways by the peripheral nervous system and the spinal cord dependent on the input simulus<sup><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup>. Overall, the label line theory is correct for the DRG; SST-positive/BNP-positive neurons primarily process itch, and pain is mediated mainly by SP-expressing DRG neurons<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>. Further supporting this theory is the finding that activation of the MrgprA3-expressing DRG neurons by capsaicin in TRPV1-KO::MrgprA3<sup>ROSA &#x02212; TRPV<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> mice, wherein TRPV1 is <italic toggle="yes">only in MrgprA3-expressing neurons</italic>, results in itch &#x02013; <italic toggle="yes">not</italic> pain<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>. The second theory of itch and pain processing is the Gate Control theory, which states that separate pain and itch-responding DRG neurons activate the same set of secondary neurons located in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. This theory was founded by discovery of dynorphin-expressing spinal interneurons activated following TRPV1 or TRPM8 neurons activation<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. Activation of these dynorphin-expressing interneurons triggers the release of dynorphin, which then suppresses activation of gastrin-related peptide receptor (GRPR)-expressing spinal interneurons, thus preventing the transmission of itch signals<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. Current research has determined that these GRPR-expressing spinal interneurons are where itch signals converge<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> before these interneurons transmit itch signals to the parabrachial nucleus<sup><xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup>. This theory is further supported by the finding that SST-dependent activation of SSTR2-subpopulation inhibits pain responses<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. Both of these theories on itch processing have been assumed to be the <italic toggle="yes">de facto</italic> pathways by which the TG processes itch behavior despite the lack of evidence, either for or against, the presence of these pathways in the TG nucleus.</p><p id="P23">Our results suggest that <italic toggle="yes">the TG itself uses gate control to process facial itch signals</italic> despite the unclear presence of these pathways in the spinal trigeminal nucleus<sup><xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup>. Our mouse data demonstrate that TG have a significantly increased percentage of SST-expressing neurons expressing Substance P compared to the DRG (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). HRH1, which transduces histamine receptor activation into itch, has significant changes in downstream neuropeptide populations (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figs. 5</xref> &#x00026; <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). In the DRG, HRH1 is predominantly co-expressed with SST, with few neurons being positive for HRH1 and Substance P; however, in the TG, this proportion of HRH1-positive and Substance P-positive neurons roughly triples (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). This change in HRH1 and Substance P expression also results in a change in behavioral outcomes (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). HRH3 underwent similar changes in the proportion of neurons positive for Substance P in the TG compared to the DRG (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figs. 5</xref> &#x00026; <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Interestingly, immethridine, an HRH3-specific agonist<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup>, did not induce itch but significantly more ipsilateral cheek-directed wipes than histamine, indicating that histaminergic itch is both receptor-dependent and neuropeptide-dependent. These findings provide a basis for examining how the gate control theory of pain and itch processing may be relevant in this context. The gate control theory of pain and itch processing has evidence that there might be two subtypes: the leaky gate subtype suggesting itch and weak pain signals activate the same pathway<sup><xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup>, and an intensity coding subtype suggests itch signal transmission is dependent on a frequency or burst of stimulation<sup><xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup>. While we could not test this hypothesis here, but our results, and those reported in Akiyama et al<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>, alluding to an intensity coding in the TG. Another avenue to explore would be to determine if the histamine-triggered SP-release can activate a previously identified monosynaptic facial pain circuit<sup><xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup> as these neurons express the receptor for SP<sup><xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup>. Activation of this pathway by histamine would also likely account for the decrease in itch behavior and increase in pain following intradermal injection of histamine into the cheek.</p><p id="P24">In summary, we identified distinct sensory neuron subpopulations, highlighting the importance of considering regional differences in itch response when designing treatment strategies. Overall, our study has significant implications for the understanding and treatment of itch disorders by developing therapies targeting HRH1 and HRH3 receptors that may provide new treatment options for itch disorders.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S10"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="S11"><title>Chemicals</title><p id="P25">Histamine was ordered from Sigma Aldrich (Catalog # H7125).

Interstitial histamine activates HRH1 and/or HRH3 on DRG and TG sensory neurons. The majority of HRH1 and HRH3 expressions are limited to the SST population of itch mediating neurons in the DRG. In the TG, HRH1 and HRH3 are expressed on the SST-positive itch TG neurons and expressed in the SST-positive/SP-positive population of TG neurons that are polymodal for itch and pain signaling. The activation of these SST-positive/SP-positive neurons result in modulation of TG-mediated itch signals.
