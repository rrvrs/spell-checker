Lithium serves as first line in the management of bipolar disorder, demonstrating efficacy in stabilizing mood episodes and preventing relapses. Therefore, it also a recommended treatment during the pregnancy period. However, its use presents potential risks for both the mother and the developing fetus. Given the prevalence of bipolar disorder in reproductive-age women, it is crucial to investigate the risks associated with lithium use during pregnancy, along with its subsequent obstetric and neonatal complications.</p></sec><sec id="sec9095"><title>Objectives</title><p>This report outlines a case of severe polyhydramnios in a 42-year-old primigravida patient, under long-term lithium and antipsychotic treatment. Additionally, a systematic search for similar case reports was conducted to provide an overview of the existing literature.</p></sec><sec id="sec9096"><title>Methods</title><p>
The patient&#x02019;s medical history and perinatal medical care are documented in this case report. A systematic literature search on MEDLINE (PubMed) was conducted using Boolean operators.</p></sec><sec id="sec9097"><title>Results</title><p>The patient was diagnosed with bipolar disorder type I and had a history of lithium treatment for over 20 years, supplemented later with antipsychotics. During her pregnancy, she experienced a polyuria-polydipsia syndrome and a severe polyhydramnios. She also suffered renal impairment. Together, it is indicative of a nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI), likely induced by prolonged lithium treatment. As the pregnancy progressed, she experienced premature rupture of membranes at 34 weeks and 5 days. The newborn needed medical support and was admitted to the neonatal unit, without further complications.</p><p>Systematic research showed three published case reports describing nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) and polyhydramnios associated to lithium treatment.</p></sec><sec id="sec9098"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Chronic administration of lithium may contribute to the development of resistance to antidiuretic hormone (ADH), leading to polyuria-polydipsia syndrome and potentially severe obstetric complications. The co-administration of lithium and antipsychotics may exacerbate these effects. Further research is needed to elucidate their combined clinical impacts.</p></sec><sec id="sec9099"><title>Disclosure of Interest</title><p>None Declared</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="2"/></counts></article-meta></front></article>
