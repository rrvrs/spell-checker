Parents&#x02019; perception and decision about covid vaccination is an important parameter to consider.</p></sec><sec id="sec5557"><title>Objectives</title><p>The ain of this study is to evaluate the parents&#x02019; attitude about childhood vaccination against Covid 19 in Tunisia.</p></sec><sec id="sec5558"><title>Methods</title><p>The &#x0201c;vaccine hesitancy scale (VHS) adopted from WHO&#x02019;s Strategic Advisory Group of Immunization&#x0201d; with 8 items translated in tunisian dialect and an additional ten survey idem about the Characteristics of parents and their vaccination status against Covid 19.

The most common reasons for the refusal were.Parents consider that routine childhood vaccines are safe, necessary and useful more than covid vaccine. Some parents reported that their children have been infected by the virus so they have doubts about the usefulness of the vaccination.</p></sec><sec id="sec5560"><title>Conclusions</title><p>A year after the pandemic, covid 19 contamination and vaccination against the virus are still an issue. With the emergence of new variants, the decline in protective measures, vaccination against covid is in the process of integrating routine programs. But the lack of information on the effectiveness of the vaccine and the adverse effects are a source of hesitation and refusal for parents. a large-scale national study is necessary before.</p></sec><sec id="sec5561"><title>Disclosure of Interest</title><p>None Declared</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="1"/></counts></article-meta></front></article>
