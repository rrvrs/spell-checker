on-site sensing platforms for a wide range
of analytes in different matrices, microfluidic paper-based devices
(&#x003bc;PADs) are promising candidates to bring the lab to the sample,
as they allow passive, capillary-action-driven flow. Their use, however,
is somewhat limited by the fact that the integration of advanced functionality
and flow control is difficult. Although recent progress in this area
has led to the development of on/off-valving and timing control of
flow by changing the chemical and physical properties of paper, precise
control over flow in paper microfluidics remains challenging. Here,
we propose the use of a simple covalent modification of cellulose
paper to tune its surface properties, thereby introducing a broad
range of functionality and applicability. For this purpose, fatty
acyl chlorides with different chain lengths were used as hydrophobic
reagents to change the surface properties. The modified paper was
characterized by FTIR-ATR, static water contact angle measurements,
and capillary flow properties (permeability, maximum flow distance,
and flow rate). The produced papers were then applied in several proof-of-concept
devices to demonstrate their potential in sensing and actuating for
improved on-site analysis. We demonstrate how precisely modified paper
can be used for surface tension measurements and multistep valving
based on its wickability for solutions of varying surface tensions,
for the determination of ethanol concentration in water by monitoring
the maximum flow distance in a 3D-printed device, and for the optimization
of on-paper liquid&#x02013;liquid extraction via fine-tuned control
of capillary flow rates.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>paper microfluidics</kwd><kwd>microfluidic

point-of-need (PoN) analyses are experiencing
rapid growth, driven by their successful implementation as early warning
tools in medical diagnostics, and in maintaining food and environmental
safety.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref></sup> A recent success story is, of
course, the global application of rapid tests to diagnose SARS-CoV-2
infections, underscoring the increasing importance of timely diagnostics
to limit the spread of diseases. Key to the success of such tests
is that they are affordable, sensitive, specific, user-friendly, rapid
and robust, equipment-free, and deliverable to the end user (ASSURED).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref></sup> This stands in stark contrast to more conventional,
lab-based methods, which &#x02013; despite their superior analytical
performance in the identification and quantification of analytes &#x02013;
are time-consuming, requiring complex procedures, sophisticated laboratories
with expensive equipment, and professionals trained in analytical
science.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref></sup> It is now widely accepted that
fast, on-site methods can overcome many limitations of lab-based methods
and complement them by decentralized screening approaches.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref></sup></p><p>Prime examples of on-site analytical devices can be found
in the
field of microfluidics.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></sup> Microfluidic devices
are miniaturized, often chip-based systems designed to precisely manipulate
fluid flows by changing the fluid and/or material properties or device
parameters in a well-controlled fashion. Such analytical devices have
many advantages, such as requiring only small amounts of sample, integrating
different functional elements, and offering high cost efficiency.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></sup> A special subcategory of microfluidics is represented by microfluidic
paper-based analytical devices (&#x003bc;PADs), which are especially
promising for on-site analytical applications, given the fact that
paper is inexpensive, flexible, lightweight, and compatible with many
solvents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref></sup> As paper is fabricated from hydrophilic
cellulosic fibers and has a tortuous, porous structure,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref></sup> it enables passive, capillary-driven flow, thereby removing the
requirement for an external pump to generate flow.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref></sup> As a result, the material can be used as
a substrate in the development and production of many different quick
tests, which are typically referred to as paper microfluidics.</p><p>In paper microfluidics, the passive capillary flow can be described
by the Washburn equation, which characterizes the flow in porous media
by assuming that it can be treated as a bundle of parallel capillary
tubes with a uniform radius. It is simplified to the Lucas-Washburn
equation <xref rid="eq1" ref-type="disp-formula">eq <xref rid="eq1" ref-type="disp-formula">1</xref></xref> for horizontal
flow by eliminating the gravitational force from the equation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref></sup> This model can be used for vertical flow when the hydrostatic pressure
is negligible compared to the capillary pressure. Thus, the flow is
primarily governed by the balance between surface tension and viscous
forces.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref></sup> In this equation, <italic>l</italic> is the distance traveled by the solution, <italic>t</italic> is
the flow time, &#x003b3; is the surface tension of the liquid in air&#x02013;liquid
interface, &#x003d5; is the contact angle between the liquid and the
solid surface, <italic>r</italic> is the radius of the capillary tubes,
and &#x003bc; is the dynamic viscosity of the liquid.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref></sup><disp-formula id="eq1"><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="mt4c01812_m001" position="anchor"/><label>1</label></disp-formula></p><p>Capillary flow in paper can be directed
through confined hydrophilic
regions, typically referred to as &#x0201c;channels&#x0201d;, via hydrophobic
patterning of impermeable &#x0201c;walls&#x0201d;, e.g., by wax printing
or PDMS coating.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref></sup> In addition to confined flow regions, sample and
detection zones can also be created to obtain passive flow from one
region to another for detection and quantification of analytes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref></sup> The advantage of passive flow
in paper, however, also represents its major limitation, namely, that
paper-based devices lack any control over flow rates, since the flow
occurs spontaneously. This drawback is one of the major challenges
in developing fully automated, robust &#x003bc;PADs as sensitive analytical
tools.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref></sup> Precise flow control in paper
microfluidics is therefore highly needed to allow the integration
of functional operational elements in such devices, e.g., for sample
handling, sequential analyte transfer, and ultimately to improve performance
and applicability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref></sup> Hence, a significant amount of scientific work has
been devoted to finding ways to manipulate flows in paper microfluidics
and extend its scope.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref></sup></p><p>Following
different strategies, some degree of tunability in the
microfluidic properties of paper has been achieved, including geometrical
and chemical modifications. Geometrical alteration was used as a flow
manipulation strategy by Fu et al., who demonstrated that having a
wider central segment of a paper strip, while maintaining identical
sizes for the segment that was in contact with the solution, resulted
in an increased travel time for the same linear distance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref></sup> Park et al. created a pressed region on paper,
which led to a delay in the arrival time of the sample coming from
it, due to a reduced internal volume and pore size, so that they could
transfer multiple analytes in a sequential manner to develop a multistep
dipstick.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref></sup> Liu et al. applied laser carving
within patterned paper-based channels to obtain microcracks. These
microcracks are essentially miniature channels, through which fast
capillary flow can be obtained, leading to a significant increase
in the overall flow rate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref></sup></p><p>A second
and broader strategy to tune the microfluidic properties
of paper is to change its (physico-)chemical properties, thereby affecting
the interaction between cellulose and liquid, and, as a result, capillary
flow.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref></sup> Several studies have so far focused
on two main categories: (i) physical deposition of hydrophobic materials,
such as wax, to decrease or block its pores and alter porosity and
surface energy and (ii) covalent, chemical modification of paper,
which mainly influences the surface properties of cellulose fibers,
rather than the pores. In the first category, Strong et al. achieved
tunable time delay by varying the amount of wax loaded on paper,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref></sup> and Chen et al. have designed a wax-printed
valve that separated the sample and detection regions, so that it
was &#x0201c;off&#x02019; in aqueous media, while it could be turned
&#x0201c;on&#x0201d; by wetting it with a drop of organic solvent to
achieve a controlled mixing, incubation, and flow.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref></sup> While those methods based on physical deposition of, for
example, wax are easily incorporated, such coatings are affected by
solvents and will actually partially dissolve, thereby changing the
device &#x02013; and thus its detection properties &#x02013; over time
and contaminating the sample with the hydrophobic material. In contrast,
when using covalent attachment, it has been demonstrated that functional
elements can actually withstand multiple wetting and drying processes
and thus be restored to their starting state. For example, Salentijn
et al. applied covalent hydrophobic patterning of paper using alkyl
ketene dimer to achieve solvent-dependent on/off valving with hydrophobic
regions that were selectively permeable to solvents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref></sup> Analogously, Li et al. systematically varied the wettability
of paper (hydrophilic, hydrophobic, oleophilic, and oleophobic) by
applying fluoro-silanization, followed by oxygen plasma etching to
adjust the surface properties.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref></sup> It was
demonstrated that all combinations of these surface conditions could
be obtained with the suggested two-step method, so that modified papers
could be used in several applications such as oil&#x02013;water separation
and measurement of surface tension. While Li et al. worked with extreme
conditions to achieve distinct surface properties with plasma treatment,
Rosso et al. focused on finer tuning. It was demonstrated how plasma
treatment gently modifies surface properties, particularly on silicon
and silicon nitride surfaces. This work underscored the potential
of the technique for broader applications requiring precise surface
adjustments, which could potentially be adapted for paper modification
as well.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref></sup></p><p>Despite these advances,
there is currently a lack of an easily
accessible and adaptable toolbox to functionalize cellulose paper
in a broad range, allowing precise tuning of its flow properties for
application in paper microfluidics. For example, in those previous
studies, mostly binary (wicking versus nonwicking) systems were developed,
or systems with a single type of chemical modification were studied
to observe the effect on the capillary flow rate. However, gradually
altering the surface energy of paper with various covalent modifications
has not been studied, while this would, in principle, yield many levels
of controlled wettability that can respond sensitively with respect
to small changes in the surface tension of the solvent.</p><p>In this
work, we therefore set out to study the influence of small
variations in covalently attached hydrophobic reagents (fatty acyl
chlorides of different lengths) on the microfluidic properties of
paper. A broad range of covalent surface modifications were performed
to achieve precise control over the wettability and &#x0201c;wickability&#x0201d;
(or permeability) of papers, as well as over the flow properties of
solutions with varying surface tensions through those papers. We optimized
the reaction conditions so as to allow optimal sample analysis, following
correlations resulting from <xref rid="eq1" ref-type="disp-formula">eq <xref rid="eq1" ref-type="disp-formula">1</xref></xref>. The characteristics of the modified papers were then investigated
in terms of their permeability (whether the paper wicks the solution
or not), maximum flow distance (how far the solution flows before
it stops), and flow rate (how fast the solution wicks through the
modified paper). Finally, in order to demonstrate the applicability
of the proposed toolbox for tuning the properties of paper microfluidic
devices, several paper-based applications were developed, including
surface tension measurement, multistep valving, alcohol concentration
determination, and optimization of paper-based liquid&#x02013;liquid
extraction.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Experimental Section</title><sec id="sec2.1"><label>2.1</label><title>Materials</title><p>Whatman chromatography

to increase the contact between the sample and the ATR accessory.
First, a background measurement was performed with ambient air. The
spectra of the sample papers were then acquired. Measurements were
performed for different batches of a type of modified paper by selecting
a random paper from each batch, and measurements were performed on
at least three different spots for each sample. Their chemical stability
was also assessed by placing water-permeable ESC(0.8)-80T6h paper
in water and aqueous solutions at pH 2, 4, 10, and 12 for 1 h, while
C8(1)-80T6h paper was placed in a 1:1 (v/v) mixture of EtOH and aqueous
acidic and alkaline solutions of pH 2, 4, 10, and 12. The papers were
then dried in a vacuum oven for 1 h, after which they were analyzed
by ATR-FTIR.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.4.2"><label>2.4.2</label><title>Contact Angle Measurements</title><p>The

were taped onto a glass slide with a piece of double-sided tape to
align them horizontally. 3 &#x003bc;L droplets of the solutions were
dispensed on the paper surface by using a syringe; then, the contact
angle between the paper surface and the liquid drops was measured
with an integrated camera using the sessile drop method in the software,
ADVANCE. For WCA measurements, Milli-Q water was used. Aqueous EtOH
solutions in varying concentrations were applied to observe changing
contact angles with varying EtOH content and to determine the EtOH
concentration at which the solution would fully wick into the paper.

(iv) flow rates of liquids traveling through the paper. These characteristics
of the modified papers were assessed using solutions of varying surface

of seconds. The minimum required EtOH concentration for a solution
to fully wick into a modified paper was defined as the critical wicking
concentration (CWC) and was determined for each paper. A Kr&#x000fc;ss

a certain distance and then stop. Distance-based analysis was performed
to investigate how far a liquid sample would travel along the paper
before stopping. The experiment was performed by vertically dipping
strips of modified paper into the wells of a 96-well plate, each filled
with 300 &#x003bc;L of varying % EtOH in water. Strips could be reproducibly
positioned by using a 3D-printed holder (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsabm.4c01812/suppl_file/mt4c01812_si_001.pdf">Figure S3</ext-link>). After the capillary flow stopped, a photograph of the

liquid was measured from the image against the grid of reference lines.
In the initial benchmarking experiments, the analysis was performed
either (i) on an open bench, (ii) in a closed container (thin-layer

and Discussion</title><sec id="sec3.1"><label>3.1</label><title>Covalent Modification</title><p>The surface
properties and functionality of modified papers were studied for different
reagent types, amounts, starting papers, reaction times, and temperatures
(<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsabm.4c01812/suppl_file/mt4c01812_si_001.pdf">Table S4</ext-link>). All these parameters had an
influence on not only the surface chemistry of the paper but also
its physical structure. This is relevant since the combination of
physical alterations and covalent surface modifications together tunes
the paper microfluidics. A notable physical change was an increased
thickness of the paper after the covalent modification (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsabm.4c01812/suppl_file/mt4c01812_si_001.pdf">Figure S4</ext-link>), where the influence varied for different
reaction conditions and paper types used. Longer fatty acid chain
lengths or higher reaction temperatures, for example, resulted in
thicker modified papers. In particular, thick papers were obtained
when using Gr17 paper, where the thickness increased from approximately
1 to 4 mm. Although the Gr17-C8(2)-80T6h paper was impermeable to
water, the highly swollen structure of this paper made it highly opaque,
thereby making it impossible to follow the flow of liquid in the paper
by eye. Regarding the starting materials, Gr3MM paper was modified
under a single set of conditions only since it did not show a difference
compared to Gr1 paper in terms of maximum flow distance in early experiments.
Gr17 paper, on the other hand, allowed for further diversification
of the approach. Finally, a threshold for the number of equiv of the
reagents used in modification was identified for modified papers to
become impermeable to water; thus, lower numbers of equiv than this
threshold were not explored (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsabm.4c01812/suppl_file/mt4c01812_si_001.pdf">Table S4</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="sec3.2"><label>3.2</label><title>Characterization</title><sec id="sec3.2.1"><label>3.2.1</label><title>ATR-FTIR

and 3000&#x02013;2800 cm<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>, which were attributed
to hydroxyl (O&#x02013;H) stretch and alkyl (C&#x02013;H) stretch, respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref></sup> For modified papers, those same bands were observed, where convoluted
peaks at 2924 and 2854 cm<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> represented &#x02212;CH<sub>2</sub> symmetric and antisymmetric stretch vibrations, respectively.
Importantly, a peak was observed at 1740 cm<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>, which
was attributed to an ester (&#x02014;O&#x02014;C=O) stretch,
originating from the covalent attachment of the fatty acyl chloride
to hydroxyl groups on cellulose.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref></sup> This signal
was the first qualitative indicator of successful covalent modification.
Moreover, no signal was obtained for the acyl halide, which should
have been observed at 1803 cm<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> in the case of having
physically adsorbed reagent residues, rather than covalent attachment.
The only exception to this was seen with C16(2) papers for reaction
times longer than 1 h, likely due to the excessive use of this very
hydrophobic reagent (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsabm.4c01812/suppl_file/mt4c01812_si_001.pdf">Figure S7</ext-link>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref></sup> Additionally, it was observed that while the

attached to the paper surface. It was also observed that esterification
could be successfully achieved for shorter reaction times than 6 h:
reaction times of 1, 2, and 4 h for C16(2) and C8(2) at 80 &#x000b0;C

spectra were acquired from three spots for a single strip

groups were highly reproducible, not only for different locations
on a single strip but also for different batches of the same modifications.
It was also observed that esterification could be successfully achieved
with C8(1) at RT, 40 &#x000b0;C, and 80 &#x000b0;C for 6 h of reaction time,
with increased esterification at higher temperatures (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsabm.4c01812/suppl_file/mt4c01812_si_001.pdf">Figure S10</ext-link>). Finally, for different starting

this.</p><p>Finally, the stability of the modified papers was examined

ESC, via POAC, to PAC, consistent with their decreasing polarity (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>A). In addition,
the WCA was not affected by the reagent amount over the range tested

capillary flow behavior. This result aligns with previous reports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref></sup> in which damage to cellulose fibers after the

demonstrate that the surface properties of paper can be tuned by covalent
modification to control capillary flow through paper, permeability
tests were performed in addition to the reported WCA measurements.
While the WCA gives a clear indication of the hydrophobicity of the
modified papers, permeability-based analysis provides insight into
the interaction between the papers and liquids with surface tension
lower than that of water. Aqueous EtOH solutions with various % EtOH
were thus used to establish the wicking/nonwicking response of the
modified papers. Bare (unmodified) cellulose paper is permeable to
water due to the strong polar interaction between cellulose and water
and its porous structure, whereas (sufficiently) modified hydrophobic
papers are impermeable to water due to lowered surface energy. With
modified papers, the wettability increased with higher % EtOH, due
to the decreasing surface tension of the solution, until the solution
wicks into the paper. The CWC was determined for varying reagent types,
reagent amounts, and reaction times and temperatures (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>; CWC values of all modified
papers can be found in <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsabm.4c01812/suppl_file/mt4c01812_si_001.pdf">Table S5</ext-link>). Despite
the fact that the CWC has a generally increasing trend with decreased
polarity, for some modifications, the same trend could not be observed.
It was expected to see higher CWC for POAC and PAC papers than for
C4 papers due to their lower polarity, based on their partition coefficient
(<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsabm.4c01812/suppl_file/mt4c01812_si_001.pdf">Table S2</ext-link>), as observed in the WCA values;
however, they resulted in lower values (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>A). This result may imply that it is not
only the polarity of the reagent and the resulting surface chemistry
but also physical changes occurring in the paper during modification
that contribute to the wicking properties of the modified papers.
The physical change could be observed most dramatically for Gr17 paper
modified with C8(1) at 80 &#x000b0;C for 6 h (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsabm.4c01812/suppl_file/mt4c01812_si_001.pdf">Figure S4</ext-link>), where the thickness increased by a factor of 4.</p><p>In terms of the amount of the reagent used, a clear impact on the
CWC was observed (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>B). For example, a stark difference was observed between C8(0.6)
and C8(0.5) papers, with the former having a CWC of 32% EtOH, while
the latter simply imbibed water. We defined the minimum required amount
of the reagent for modification to achieve a CWC as a threshold equiv.
This value was observed at 0.4 equiv for C16 and C12, 0.5 equiv for
C8, C6 and C4, and 0.9 equiv for ESC, POAC and PAC. Above these thresholds,
for all reagents, an increase in the number of equiv would lead to
a rise in CWC within the tested range of equiv. It was observed that
using 2 equiv could result in residual reagents remaining in the paper,
as mentioned in the ATR-FTIR analysis of C16(2)-80T6h paper. Additionally,
this amount of reagent did not produce an increase in WCA and CWC
for C8 compared to 1 equiv, and only a slight increase for C12 and
C16; therefore, amounts above 2 equiv were not investigated. The total
range of CWC values obtained with the presented array of covalent
modifications covers 9.5&#x02013;57.7% EtOH in water.</p><p>The reaction
time was optimized to reproducibly produce hydrophobically
modified papers in the shortest time possible. For all modifications,
an increase in the reaction time up to 6 h resulted in an increase
of WCA and CWC (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>C). Furthermore, for reaction times of 1, 2, and 4 h, it was more
challenging to obtain repeatable results, but at 6 h, a robust and
easily reproducible modification was established (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsabm.4c01812/suppl_file/mt4c01812_si_001.pdf">Table S5</ext-link>). Extending the reaction time to 16 and 24 h did
not lead to different WCA and CWC for C4 compared to 6 h, while C12
resulted in higher CWC but similar WCA compared to 6 h, likely related
to a change in the structure as a result of the long exposure to solvents
under elevated temperature. Therefore, a 6 h modification time was
selected for further experiments.</p><p>Next, the influence of the
reaction temperature was investigated.
It was observed that modified papers have, in addition to their altered
wetting properties, altered structures as well (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsabm.4c01812/suppl_file/mt4c01812_si_001.pdf">Figure S4</ext-link>). It was therefore investigated whether modification
could be carried out under milder conditions to prevent possible drawbacks
of these structural changes. Reactions were carried out at RT, 40
&#x000b0;C, and 80 &#x000b0;C for C4, C8, and C12 reagents with Gr1 paper.
Temperature elevation during modifications led to higher WCA and CWC
for C4 and C12; for C8, even though the WCA increased with the reaction
temperature, the CWC did not show a pronounced difference (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsabm.4c01812/suppl_file/mt4c01812_si_001.pdf">Table S5</ext-link>). These differences might be explained
by the fact that especially at an elevated reaction temperature, the
structural properties of the paper also change, favoring the wicking
into those papers. On the other hand, the elevated temperatures also
lead to an increased hydrophobicity (as evidenced by the increasing
WCA), and so these two effects influence the CWC in opposite directions.</p><p>Finally, different papers as starting materials were studied; a
thicker paper with a similar flow rate to Gr1 paper (Gr3MM) and a
thicker paper with a higher water flow rate (Gr17) were selected for
this purpose (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsabm.4c01812/suppl_file/mt4c01812_si_001.pdf">Table S1</ext-link>). The WCA and CWC
results of Gr3MM paper were obviously distinct compared to Gr1 paper
for the C8(1)-80T6h modification, while Gr17 paper wicked water when
produced under the same modification conditions. The first important
observation was the significant change in shape after modification
for Gr17 paper. The reaction at 80 &#x000b0;C yielded thicker, sponge-like
modified papers (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsabm.4c01812/suppl_file/mt4c01812_si_001.pdf">Figure S4</ext-link>), whereas the
modification carried out at RT resulted in a paper that, to the naked
eye, looked much more like the starting material. The required equivalents
of reagent to obtain Gr17 paper that would repel water were also greater
than those for Gr1; this can be explained by the fact that capillary
action is determined by numerous factors including the pore size and
structure of the paper. The thicker, more open network allows water
to wick into the paper more easily. However, at the same time, it
was a challenge to observe the actual capillary flow of liquids within
these papers due to the thicker and thus more opaque structure of
the modified Gr17 papers compared to the Gr1 paper. In order to obtain
comparable properties with Gr17 paper as with Gr1 paper, modification
at RT with 2 equiv of reagent had to be applied (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsabm.4c01812/suppl_file/mt4c01812_si_001.pdf">Table S5</ext-link>).</p><p>In summary, the surface properties and capillary
properties of
paper can be manipulated in a well-controlled manner by a range of
covalent modifications via the selection of appropriate reagents with
different hydrophobic tails under various reaction conditions. While
previous research has focused on the wicking/nonwicking of solvents
into paper in terms of simple on/off valving or extreme wettabilities,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref></sup> in contrast, our approach provides precise control over surface
properties, allowing careful tuning of the paper surface properties,
which can accordingly be used to broaden the applicability for on-site
analytical chemistry.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.3.2"><label>3.3.2</label><title>Distance-Based Analysis</title><p>In addition
to surface wettability and wicking properties, paper strips were also
analyzed in terms of their maximum flow distances for solutions of
EtOH and water. When the modified papers were used to draw up mixtures
of EtOH and water, it was observed that the resulting flow would stop
after a fixed traveling distance; this occurred both when the paper
was positioned horizontally or vertically, excluding gravitational
pressure as the main cause. Moreover, the distance traveled by the
solution after which this occurred was found to be reproducible and
dependent on the % EtOH in the solution. The occurrence of a maximum
flow distance has been reported by Li et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref></sup> for the hydrophobic/oleophilic paper that they obtained by fluoro-silanization,
followed by oxygen plasma etching. The hypothesis to explain such
a maximum flow distance is based on the evaporation of EtOH from the
paper surface during the wicking process. Given that EtOH (boiling
point: 78 &#x000b0;C) is more volatile than water, flow in an open porous
system will lead to evaporation at a higher rate than the evaporation
of water from the binary solutions used, effectively diluting the
EtOH solution. When the % EtOH is diluted to a value at or below the
CWC of the modified paper, further wicking is prevented, as previously
proposed by Li et al. (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsabm.4c01812/suppl_file/mt4c01812_si_001.pdf">Figure S14</ext-link>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref></sup> To confirm the hypothesis, experiments were
performed with the same solution-paper combinations on an open bench,
in a closed chamber filled with ambient air, and in a chamber saturated
with EtOH vapor. Maximum flow distances were obtained in a closed
chamber filled with air with a good reproducibility (RSD = 0.8&#x02013;3.5),
while on an open bench the reproducibility was worse (RSD = 1.0&#x02013;9.3)
for C8(1)-80T6h Gr 1 paper, since the evaporation of EtOH was affected
by ambient air flow (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsabm.4c01812/suppl_file/mt4c01812_si_001.pdf">Figure S15</ext-link>). Moreover,
the maximum distance was lower on the open bench, indicating enhanced
evaporation compared to the closed system. In an EtOH-saturated chamber,
on the other hand, the solutions wicked along the papers for all concentrations
above the CWC until the upper end of the strips as a result of the
reduced evaporation rate or the absence of net evaporation. All further
analyses were therefore carried out by placing the papers vertically
in EtOH solutions in the 3D-printed holder inside a closed chamber
filled with ambient air (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsabm.4c01812/suppl_file/mt4c01812_si_001.pdf">Figure S3</ext-link>).</p><p>In the work by Li et al., fluorinated paper was used to differentiate
EtOH content of solutions with 20% concentration increments,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref></sup> which has limited practical value. On the other
hand, in our work, the surface properties of paper were diversified
over a broad range by a simple, single-step covalent modification
with fatty acyl chlorides, achieving a higher sensitivity toward small
increments, below 1%, of EtOH concentrations.</p><p>The maximum distance
traveled by the liquid samples on modified
paper was measured and correlated to the % EtOH in solution (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>A). For all modified
papers, the measured distance increased with the increasing % EtOH.
This result was in line with expectations, because (i) the higher
% EtOH in water means that the surface tension is lower, resulting
in improved wettability of the hydrophobic surface, and (ii) the amount
of EtOH needed to be evaporated until the solution was diluted to
the CWC to stop wicking was greater, which simply takes more time.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>(A) Maximum

other hand, the maximum distance was different
for the differently modified papers. They were characterized by differences
in the minimum, maximum, and total range of % EtOH that could be measured.
In addition, the change in flow distance for a defined increment in
EtOH concentration (&#x00394;<italic>d</italic>/&#x00394;EtOH%), which
is the sensitivity of each specific paper, was evaluated as well.
In <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>B, it was
observed that Gr1 paper, both modified at RT and 80 &#x000b0;C using
the C4 reagent, resulted in limited sensitivity. The traveling distance
varied from 8 to 36 mm and 5 to 55 mm, for 35&#x02013;75% EtOH, averaging
7 and 12.5 mm for every 10% change in EtOH concentration for papers
modified at RT and 80 &#x000b0;C, respectively. However, the RT modification
of Gr17 paper with the C4 reagent already resulted in a strong increase
in the slope of the distance-based measurement, with the variation
of traveling distance from 7 to 55 mm, for 35&#x02013;55% EtOH, which
results in 24 mm for every 10% change in EtOH content. It can be concluded
that the sensitivity of maximum distance measurements was predominantly
influenced by the specifications of the paper used rather than the
reaction temperature. Nevertheless, control over both factors allowed
an enhancement in sensitivity, thus demonstrating how fine-tuning
of the modification can improve device performance.</p><p>As expected
from WCA and CWC measurements, it was observed that
with longer alkyl chain lengths of the acyl chlorides, i.e., with
more nonpolar modifications, the measurement range shifted to higher
concentrations (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>A). This makes perfect sense, as paper needs to first wick a solution
before a maximum flow distance can be observed. Furthermore, the use
of more nonpolar acyl chlorides resulted in a narrower measurement
range for the same observed maximum flow distance; in other words,
in that range, these papers exhibit a higher sensitivity to a small
change in % EtOH.</p><p>Next, the influence of the reaction temperature
on the maximum
flow distance was investigated. For the papers modified with C12(1),
the higher reaction temperature did not affect the EtOH concentration
range over which they were sensitive to changes in EtOH composition.
However, the maximum distances were consistently higher for the paper
modified at more elevated temperatures, thereby increasing the sensitivity
to changing composition (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsabm.4c01812/suppl_file/mt4c01812_si_001.pdf">Figure S16A</ext-link>).
Given the fact that the hydrophobicity of the paper was not influenced
for this paper, another change in the paper must have occurred. It
was hypothesized that the increase in reaction temperature led to
increased accessibility for the binding of the reagents due to increased
swelling of the paper at higher temperatures during the reaction,
and as a consequence, better coverage inside the cellulose fibers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref></sup> This in turn would result in weaker interactions
between the fibers, yielding a looser paper structure, which thus
provides a larger surface area and thereby increases the sensitivity
to changes in the solvent composition.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">42</xref></sup> This hypothesis was strengthened by the experiments with a particularly
thick paper type, Gr17, for which a macroscopically appreciable change
in structure was observed by comparing different reaction temperatures
(<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsabm.4c01812/suppl_file/mt4c01812_si_001.pdf">Figure S4</ext-link>). In addition, it was observed
that heating of the papers in solvent after modification did not have
an effect on the maximum flow distance (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsabm.4c01812/suppl_file/mt4c01812_si_001.pdf">Figure S16B</ext-link>); in other words, the heating during the reaction is what
ultimately leads to the changes in the paper responsible for this
altered wicking behavior and not the heating in the solvent by itself.</p><p>It must be appreciated that the larger the slope of the curves
in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>B, i.e.,
the higher the sensitivity to small changes in % EtOH, the more precisely
and accurately such papers would be in potential distance-based sensing
applications. However, especially for the somewhat more polar modifications,
it was found that this slope could be very shallow (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>A). Therefore, it was investigated
if changing the starting paper (Gr1, Gr3MM, and Gr17), which would
effectively lead to changes in the pore size, thickness, and capillary
flow rates, could be leveraged to increase the sensitivity in those
modified papers with limited sensitivity. According to the understanding
that the maximum flow distance is determined by the evaporation of
EtOH, it is clear that a higher initial flow rate would lead to an
increase in the distance traveled before the concentration is diluted
down to the CWC and the wicking stops. Thus, Gr1 and Gr3MM with a
C8(1)-80T6h modification were tested. While no clear differences were
observed in terms of maximum flow distance and sensitivity in distance-based
measurements (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsabm.4c01812/suppl_file/mt4c01812_si_001.pdf">Figure S17</ext-link>), clear differences
were observed when Gr17 was used as the starting material and the
reaction was conducted at room temperature for 6 h (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>B). No distance-based data
was obtained for Gr17 paper with the modifications at 80 &#x000b0;C for
all reagents, as it led to thick paper in which flow could not be
visualized (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsabm.4c01812/suppl_file/mt4c01812_si_001.pdf">Figure S4</ext-link>). However, when the
reaction was carried out at room temperature, the travel distance
could be measured and compared with the other starting papers for
the same modification (no. equiv, reaction time, and reaction temperature).
In addition to that, Gr17 paper modified with 1 equiv of C4, C8, and
C12 reagents did not show a CWC, i.e., they wicked water. For these
modifications, the density of the hydrophobically modified groups
on the paper surface could not overcome the other parameters like
the porosity and larger pore size to repel water. The reagents were
required to be used in higher amounts like 2 equiv for C4 and even
3 equiv for ESC to obtain a CWC value for Gr17 paper.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.3.3"><label>3.3.3</label><title>Time-Based Analysis</title><p>Given the fact
that it was established in previous experiments that different temperatures
of the reaction affect the flow behavior, it was first assessed whether
different reaction conditions, in the absence of reagents, would lead
to alterations in the paper and thus result in altered flow rates.
Therefore, Gr1 papers were placed in DMF, the reaction solvent, for
6 h at RT, 40 &#x000b0;C, and 80 &#x000b0;C, and then vertically run with
water. The resulting flow distance was plotted against the square
root of time (see <xref rid="eq1" ref-type="disp-formula">eq <xref rid="eq1" ref-type="disp-formula">1</xref></xref>, the Lucas-Washburn equation). The underlying model could be used
in vertical settings, since the effect of gravity on the flow in paper
was observed to be limited with these papers. It was observed that
the solvent treatment had a clear impact on increasing the water flow
rate in paper, while the treatment temperature did not noticeably
influence the flow rate (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsabm.4c01812/suppl_file/mt4c01812_si_001.pdf">Figure S18</ext-link>). Here,
the Lucas-Washburn equation can be used to explain the varying parameters.
First, the contact angle between the liquid and the paper is directly
influenced by changes in the surface properties after modification.
As introducing hydrophobic reagents to the paper surface led to a
decrease in the capillary flow of water, or even rendered the paper
completely impermeable to water, the surface chemistry (and thus,
the resulting WCA) is the dominant factor influencing wicking and
flow behavior, more so than, for example, geometrical factors (pore
size and the travel distance). On the other hand, solvent treatment
experiments (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsabm.4c01812/suppl_file/mt4c01812_si_001.pdf">Figure S18</ext-link>) showed that geometrical
changes also play a role in altering or even enhancing liquid flow.
Notably, one hydrophobically modified paper, ESC(0.8)-80T6h, actually
exhibited a higher water flow rate than that of bare paper. This implies
that in this specific example, morphological changes had a more significant
impact on the liquid flow than alterations in the surface chemistry.
Ultimately, the contact angle plays a more significant role in most
cases studied in this work, but the final outcome results from the
combined effect of all these factors, and studying these effects in
an isolated manner remains challenging.</p><p>In addition, while most
paper microfluidic devices are operated with aqueous solutions, it
is often beneficial to be able to work with less polar organic solvents
as well, for example, to improve selectivity by liquid&#x02013;liquid
extraction or to work with less-polar analytes. However, regular cellulose
paper might not be the most suitable material to allow the capillary
flow for organic solvents. To gain a better insight into that, the
flow of ethanol, toluene, and octanol within five different papers
was monitored, namely, bare cellulose and modified papers with varying
CWCs of 10%, 20%, 40%, and 53% EtOH. The flow rate of all solvents
was slowest on bare cellulose paper due to the weak interaction between
the paper surface and the solvent. In contrast, the highest flow rate
for octanol and toluene solvents was achieved on C4(0.8)-80T6h paper
with a CWC of 20% EtOH, and the flow rate kept decreasing on papers
with a higher CWC. On the other hand, ethanol flowed faster in more
hydrophobic papers, and it reached the highest flow rate on C12(1)-80T6h
paper. The overall lower flow rates of octanol compared to ethanol
and toluene are due to its higher viscosity (dynamic viscosities of
0.59, 1.2, and 9.27 mPa&#x000b7;s at 20 &#x000b0;C for toluene, ethanol,
and octanol, respectively; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43">43</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref45">45</xref></sup> Critically, this result shows that hydrophobic modifications
for paper-based systems working with organic solvents are important
to optimize flow and that tuning the surface modification allows for
fine control also of nonaqueous solutions.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Varying flow rates of

to compare their
water and EtOH flow rates with those of bare grade 1 paper (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsabm.4c01812/suppl_file/mt4c01812_si_001.pdf">Figure S19</ext-link>). Water flowed faster in ESC(0.8)-80T6h
and slower in C16(0.4)-80T6h papers compared with unmodified hydrophilic
paper. While it is true that, compared to unmodified paper, ESC(0.8)-80T6h
paper was more hydrophobic, it was also subjected to the modification
process in DMF at 80 &#x000b0;C, which resulted in changes to the structure
of the paper, thereby influencing the flow rate. On the other hand,
the flow of EtOH was the slowest on unmodified paper and the fastest
with ESC(0.8)-80T6h paper. This result implies that the combination
of polar and nonpolar interactions between the surface and the solvent,
and the physical changes that occurred in the paper structure due
to the modification resulted in the fastest flow.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3.4"><label>3.4</label><title>Applications</title><p>The aim of developing

were 0.06 and 0.07, respectively. It is therefore allowed below certain

in a color change from colorless to purple (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsabm.4c01812/suppl_file/mt4c01812_si_001.pdf">Figure S23B</ext-link>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref48">48</xref></sup> The compounds SA and NED

was thus designed and assembled for this application (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsabm.4c01812/suppl_file/mt4c01812_si_001.pdf">Figures S24</ext-link>; see <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsabm.4c01812/suppl_file/mt4c01812_si_001.pdf">S25</ext-link> for the schematic flow of multistep valving). First, the color responses
of different reaction sequences were investigated to confirm that
the correct sequence of reactions gives the strongest color response
on paper; the device was then tested ( <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsabm.4c01812/suppl_file/mt4c01812_si_001.pdf">Figure S26A&#x02013;C</ext-link>). After applying 50 &#x003bc;L of aqueous nitrite
solution to the nitrite sample pad, the aqueous sample would reach
the first circular bare paper through paper 1. Here, the flow stopped,
as papers 2 and 3 (C4 (0.8)-80T6h) would not wick water; these valves
were thus &#x0201c;off&#x0201d; (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref></xref>B). When 50 &#x003bc;L of EtOH was then loaded onto the
EtOH pad, the surface tension of the aqueous solution would decrease
to allow the transfer of nitrite to the SA paper pad; the valves &#x0201c;2&#x0201d;
and &#x0201c;3&#x0201d; would be &#x0201c;on&#x0201d; (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref></xref>C). Still, the last valve,
paper 4 (C12 (1)-80T6h), remained &#x0201c;off&#x0201d; as it had a
higher CWC than papers 2 and 3. Thus, the nitrite reacted at the SA
location to produce the diazonium salt product. After 1 min, another
50 &#x003bc;L of EtOH was applied onto the EtOH pad to further reduce
the surface tension of the wicking solution and open the last valve,
thus allowing the diazonium salt to move to the NED paper for the
second step of the Griess reaction and produce the azo-compound that
gave the purple/pink color response (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref></xref>D). After obtaining a color change in the
detection zone for varying concentrations of nitrite (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsabm.4c01812/suppl_file/mt4c01812_si_001.pdf">Figure S26D</ext-link>), the green color pixel intensity
(GCPI) was measured by using the software ImageJ 1.52.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref49">49</xref></sup> Due to the inverse relationship between pixel
intensity and actual color intensity (the pixel intensity decreases
as the color intensity increases), normalization of pixel intensities
was carried out by dividing the blank solution&#x02019;s value by the
GCPI values of the nitrite solutions. These values were then plotted
against the nitrite concentration (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref></xref>E). As can be seen, a linear correlation
was obtained, showing that the use of appropriately modified paper
pads allows the determination of a relevant analyte simply by the
two-time addition of an EtOH solution.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>(A) Permeability-based

bromophenol blue (BpB) from octanol to water via paper-based LLE by
using different hydrophobically modified papers. Experiments were
performed by placing circular bare papers, prior to being soaked in
water, on paper strips taped on a backing card, on which octanol with
BpB flows (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref></xref>A&#x02013;C). Following their removal after 30 s, the papers were
dried, and the GCPI was determined using ImageJ. To demonstrate the
direct relationship between the color intensity and concentration
(darker color indicates more BpB passed to the water phase), the inverse
values of the GCPI were used to establish a correlation. This serves
as an indication of the amount of BpB on the circular papers after
the LLE. Since the exact amounts of transferred BpB were not known,
inverse values of GCPI were taken as an indication without further
normalization (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref></xref>D).</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><p>Paper-based LLE efficiency optimization scheme: (A) 0.2% w/v BpB

in the flow
rate leads to a corresponding increase in extraction efficiency; higher
flow rates facilitate a greater convective mass transfer of the analyte
from one phase to another. Consequently, these modifications demonstrate
the potential for optimizing such systems by effectively pairing the
(modified) paper with the appropriate solvent in paper microfluidic
devices, thus achieving enhanced performance. Conversely, since the
opposite is also valid as the increasing mass transfer is caused by
increasing flow rate, this feature can be simply used to obtain insight
into quasi-steady flow through paper-based systems, which applies
in the case of using absorbent pads.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref51">51</xref></sup></p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="sec4"><label>4</label><title>Conclusions</title><p>In this research, a family
of simple covalent modifications has
been studied and applied to manipulate the surface properties of paper
toward several &#x003bc;PAD applications. The potential of covalent
paper modifications to develop tunable on-site sensing platforms for
a wide range of analytes in different matrices was investigated by
systematic variation of various properties of the modified papers,
namely permeability (wicking/nonwicking), maximum flow distance, and
flow rate. It was demonstrated that the typical (and often critical)
lack of control over the flow in &#x003bc;PAD applications can be overcome
by such easy and highly tunable chemical modifications. Various proof-of-concept
devices that hinge on the resulting fine-tuned flow properties were
demonstrated, enabling easy sensing and actuating for improved on-site
analysis. The wide range of examples that were included (measurement
of the surface tension of a solution based on maximum flow distance,
determination of the EtOH content of alcoholic beverages, solvent-dependent
valving, permeability-based surface tension sensing, and optimization
of paper-based liquid&#x02013;liquid extraction using timing control)
show the significant potential of these simple covalent modifications
of cellulose paper. Ongoing work in our laboratories focuses on further
fine-tuning of the attached layers and an extension to more advanced
devices for PoC and PoN analysis.</p></sec></body><back><notes id="notes1" notes-type="si"><title>Supporting Information Available</title><p>The Supporting Information is
