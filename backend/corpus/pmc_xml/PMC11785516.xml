Initially described by Walter Burkholder in 1942 as a phytopathogenic organism affecting crops, <italic>Burkholderia</italic> species have since been recognized as both beneficial and pathogenic [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. While certain strains within this genus contribute to biotechnological and agricultural applications such as bioremediation and biocontrol, several <italic>Burkholderia</italic> species have emerged as significant opportunistic pathogens, particularly affecting immunocompromised individuals [<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Among the pathogenic species, <italic>Burkholderia pseudomallei</italic>&#x000a0;and the <italic>B. cepacia </italic>complex (BCC) stand out due to their clinical significance.<italic> B. pseudomallei</italic>, the causative agent of melioidosis, is associated with severe and often fatal infections in tropical regions, including Southeast Asia and Northern Australia, and exhibits significant resistance to various antibiotics. BCC, which comprises at least 17 species, presents a particular threat to cystic fibrosis (CF) patients due to its role as a nosocomial pathogen, leading to high morbidity and mortality rates in this vulnerable population [<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In South Asia, reports suggest that melioidosis might account for 44% of the global disease burden, with India suspected to have a substantial yet underrated prevalence [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Despite the pathogenic potential of <italic>Burkholderia</italic> species, their clinical importance is often underestimated in developing countries, where diagnostic challenges contribute to underreporting and delayed treatment. Many clinical laboratories may misidentify <italic>Burkholderia</italic> isolates as <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> species or dismiss them as contaminants. Further complicating the issue, advanced diagnostic tools such as VITEK&#x000ae;&#x000a0;2 Compact (bioMerieux, Marcy-l'&#x000c9;toile, France), MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, and 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing require specialized expertise and are not widely accessible, especially in resource-limited settings [<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. As a result, the incidence of <italic>Burkholderia</italic> infections is likely underreported, leading to unacknowledged pervasiveness and inadequate management of these infections.</p><p>This study aims to provide comprehensive insights into the epidemiology and clinical outcomes of <italic>Burkholderia</italic> species infections in an area that has received limited attention in existing literature.&#x000a0;Additionally, the study seeks to determine the antibiotic sensitivity pattern, which is crucial for developing effective antimicrobial stewardship&#x000a0;in the face of growing antimicrobial resistance.</p><p>By retrospectively analyzing cases, we aim to improve the understanding and address the knowledge gap of the clinical and microbiological characteristics of <italic>Burkholderia</italic> infections, with an emphasis on enhancing diagnostic accuracy and treatment strategies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Study design and setting</p><p>This retrospective observational cross-sectional study was conducted at the Kalinga Institute of Medical Sciences, Bhubaneshwar,&#x000a0;over a two-year period (June 15, 2022 to June 15, 2024).

The plates were incubated aerobically at 37&#x000b0;C for a minimum of five days. Identification of <italic>Burkholderia</italic> species was based on colony morphology, growth characteristics, and biochemical reactions. NFGNB were further classified as <italic>Burkholderia</italic> species by evaluating oxidative utilization of glucose, lactose, mannitol, and maltose, liquefaction of gelatin, nitrate reduction, and arginine hydrolysis. Demographic data and clinical records of patients with <italic>Burkholderia</italic> infections were retrieved to assess clinical features, underlying risk factors (such as age, gender, chronic disease history, and immunosuppressive conditions), and laboratory parameters at the time of sample collection. This analysis also included antibiotic susceptibility patterns based on standard microbiological protocols to determine effective treatment options.</p><p>All cases meeting the inclusion criteria during the study period were analyzed following a consecutive sampling approach.</p><p>Statistical analysis</p><p>Descriptive statistics were computed using &#x0201c;R&#x0201d; version 4.3.2 (R Foundation, Vienna, Austria). Categorical variables, including demographic data, clinical features, and antibiotic susceptibility patterns, were summarized using frequencies and percentages (Chi-square for categorical variables and t-test for continuous variables).

The p-value of 0.066, while not meeting the conventional significance threshold of 0.05, approaches it. This indicates a trend toward a stronger inflammatory response in <italic>B. pseudomallei </italic>infections, as evidenced by the higher mean CRP levels. Procalcitonin levels exhibited a notable difference between the two groups, with a mean of 44.89 ng/mL (SD: 40.72) in <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> and a mean of 31.78 ng/mL (SD: 57.29) in <italic>B. cepacia</italic>. The p-value of 0.035 indicates a statistically significant difference, suggesting that patients with <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> infection have a more pronounced systemic inflammatory response or potentially greater infection severity than those with <italic>B. cepacia</italic>. The mean platelet volume (MPV) was similar between the two species, with <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> showing a mean of 9.98 fL (SD: 1.15) and <italic>B. cepacia</italic> showing a mean of 10.24 fL (SD: 1.22). The p-value of 0.44&#x000a0;suggests no significant difference in MPV, indicating that platelet activity does not vary notably between infections caused by these two organisms.

However, resistance is notably high for certain antibiotics. In<italic> B. pseudomallei</italic>, amikacin and cefepime exhibited the highest resistance rates, while in <italic>B. cepacia</italic>, piperacillin/tazobactam, aztreonam, and gentamicin were among the most resistant drugs.

Through a comprehensive clinical and microbiological assessment, we aim to elucidate the demographics, clinical manifestations, and laboratory features of patients infected with <italic>B. cepacia</italic> and <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic>. The analysis of antibiotic susceptibility and resistance patterns will provide insight and ultimately guide the optimization of treatment strategies for these challenging infections.</p><p>In our study, male predominance (66.10%) was observed, with most patients between 40 and 60 years of age. This aligns with other studies that have reported higher infection rates in middle-aged male patients, potentially due to occupational or environmental exposure risks associated with these pathogens [<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Comorbid conditions such as hypertension and diabetes were common, with 35.70% and 39.30% prevalence, respectively. These comorbidities are frequently noted in studies involving <italic>Burkholderia</italic> infections, as they can compromise immune function and increase susceptibility [<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>Microbiological findings and species distribution</p><p>In our culture analysis, <italic>B. cepacia</italic> was more frequently isolated, accounting for 67.60% of cases, whereas <italic>B. pseudomallei </italic>accounted for 32.40%. Blood samples yielded the highest number of positive cultures, which aligns with the observations of Gangaram et al. [<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], who reported a similar trend of higher isolation rates from blood samples in <italic>Burkholderia</italic> infections. This distribution could reflect the bacteremia-inducing potential of these pathogens, especially in immunocompromised patients [<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Comparison of clinical parameters and laboratory findings</p><p>Our study identified elevated procalcitonin levels in patients with <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic>, suggesting a more intense systemic inflammatory response than&#x000a0;<italic>B. cepacia</italic> (p = 0.03). This finding is consistent with prior research, indicating that <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> often provokes a heightened inflammatory response due to its virulence factors [<xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Higher procalcitonin levels in <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> infections may indicate a stronger inflammatory response, although further analysis of clinical outcomes is needed to confirm its association with infection severity. The elevated CRP levels in patients with <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> (mean CRP: 197.23 mg/L) approached significance (p = 0.06), also supporting previous reports of stronger inflammatory markers in infections caused by this species [<xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Although&#x000a0;we could not find any comparative analysis between the two species, we believe this article will be the first to make such a comparison. Most other laboratory parameters, such as WBC counts and neutrophil levels, showed no significant differences between the two species, a pattern seen in several similar studies [<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. This may indicate comparable acute immune responses, particularly in patients without severe immunosuppression.</p><p>Antibiotic sensitivity and resistance patterns</p><p>Both <italic>B. cepacia</italic> and <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> exhibited good sensitivity to certain antibiotics, including cefoperazone/sulbactam, ceftazidime, and meropenem, which aligns with the guidelines suggesting these antibiotics as primary treatment options [<xref rid="REF14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. However, in the <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> group, there was a notable resistance to amikacin and cefepime, each demonstrating over 40% resistance, suggesting limited efficacy for these drugs in routine treatment. This is consistent with recent reports highlighting rising resistance to these antibiotics in <italic>Burkholderia</italic> infections [<xref rid="REF15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. For <italic>B. cepacia</italic>, piperacillin/tazobactam, gentamicin, and aztreonam also showed high resistance rates. These findings are corroborated by studies indicating similar resistance trends, likely due to intrinsic resistance mechanisms and the high adaptability of <italic>Burkholderia</italic> species to antibiotic pressures. Given the resistance to commonly used antibiotics, the use of carbapenems and beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitors appears crucial in managing these infections effectively, as suggested by other authors [<xref rid="REF16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>Clinical implications and recommendations</p><p>These results underscore the importance of species-specific susceptibility testing when treating <italic>Burkholderia </italic>infections. Given the variability in resistance patterns, particularly in multidrug-resistant organisms such as&#x000a0;<italic>B. cepacia</italic>, clinicians should exercise caution in antibiotic selection. Furthermore, the significant inflammation markers in <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> infections could predict prognosis and guide therapeutic decisions. Future research could investigate the genetic basis for these resistance patterns and explore the role of multimodal therapies in managing severe cases, as suggested by recent clinical and diagnostic guidelines [<xref rid="REF17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>Limitations</p><p>This study has several limitations. First, as a single-center study with a relatively small sample size, the findings may not be generalizable to other geographic regions or healthcare settings. Second, the reliance on culture-based identification methods may have underestimated the true prevalence of <italic>Burkholderia</italic> infections, as advanced molecular diagnostics were not employed. Third, while procalcitonin and CRP levels were analyzed, the absence of clinical outcome data limits the ability to correlate inflammatory markers with infection severity or prognosis. Finally, this study did not investigate the genetic mechanisms of antibiotic resistance, which could provide valuable insights into the rising resistance trends observed. Future multicenter studies with larger cohorts, clinical outcome analyses, and genomic approaches are warranted to address these limitations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study offers a unique comparative analysis of <italic>B. cepacia</italic> and <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic>, focusing on clinical, microbiological, and inflammatory responses. By analyzing antibiotic sensitivity and resistance patterns, the findings provide actionable insights for clinicians, particularly in resource-limited settings. Furthermore, identifying elevated procalcitonin levels in<italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> infections adds valuable clinical guidance for diagnosis and treatment. Notably, patients with <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic><italic>&#x000a0;</italic>infections demonstrated higher procalcitonin levels, suggesting a more pronounced systemic inflammatory response. There is a trend for CRP (approaching significant value) in <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> group but are only suggestive not meeting statistical significance suggesting the need of more robust clinical trials to seek the CRP as probable diagnostic marker of <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic>. The antibiotic resistance patterns observed underscore the importance of tailored antimicrobial therapy and the necessity for species-specific susceptibility testing to optimize treatment. The study supports the continued use of antibiotics such as cefoperazone/sulbactam and meropenem as effective treatments, while caution is advised when considering agents such as amikacin and cefepime due to noted resistance. Further multicentric, prospective studies involving larger patient cohorts and advanced diagnostic methods are recommended to validate these findings and improve treatment protocols for <italic>Burkholderia</italic> infections.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>I would acknowledge the use of AI-generated text in some parts of the introduction and discussion.</p></ack><fn-group content-type="conflict"><title>Disclosures</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Human subjects:</bold> Consent for treatment and open access publication was obtained or waived by all participants in this study.
