Evidence is emerging that internet searches for medical information may help facilitate diagnoses of medical conditions. Machine learning models may predict the diagnosis of a condition more accurately than traditional diagnostic methods. Integration of internet search data with a patient&#x02019;s medical records may provide an opportunity for enhanced screening to identify disease in its early stages. In response to nascent research in this area, the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation is supporting an initiative to explore the potential to harness internet search data for medical diagnoses. This report reflects a component of a comprehensive research endeavor focused on addressing diagnostic delays before hospitalization, encompassing the time lapses preceding a patient&#x02019;s arrival at a health care facility where their condition is conclusively diagnosed [<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>Through a review of the relevant peer-reviewed literature and informational interviews with subject matter experts, this report identifies key themes and insights to lay the groundwork for understanding the implications of leveraging internet search data that links with health research datasets resulting in innovative methodologies that empower health care professionals to make precise and timely diagnoses.</p><p>This work does not consider a patient&#x02019;s search engine preference for finding health information, nor review the patterns, trends, or accuracy of patient self-diagnosis through internet searches. It does identify the current body of literature from researchers who leverage internet search data to link to other health research data about the individual patient to identify a diagnosis. Our objective is to explore the broader landscape of leveraging internet search data in health care and its potential for assisting clinicians with diagnoses and to elucidate promising avenues for researchers to enhance diagnostic capabilities through thoughtful application of internet search data. In doing so, we sought a nuanced understanding of the possibilities within the realm of health care diagnostics with a focus on leveraging search history data to benefit clinical care teams rather than investigating self-diagnosis pathways.</p><p>This paper sheds light on the research surrounding the use of consumer internet search data for early health concern detection without delving into the clinical validation of such findings. It focuses on the identification of potential diagnostic signals and patterns to inform predictive models and proactive health care interventions, while acknowledging the challenges involved in discerning such signals among the vast array of search queries. By leveraging insights from internet search data, health care professionals may more effectively identify early warning signs, enabling timelier interventions and improved patient outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Background</title><sec><title>Overview</title><p>Access to accurate medical diagnosis has been hindered by socioeconomic disparities, limited availability of specialized medical professionals, and lack of patient education, among other factors. Inequities in access to high-quality health care services exacerbate these challenges, leading to disparities in health outcomes. Missed or inaccurate diagnoses can lead to delayed or unnecessary treatments, risking worsening of conditions. The historical reliance on direct patient-physician interactions for diagnosis has failed to bridge these gaps. The emergence of the internet and digital data in the late 20th century began to alter this landscape. Eysenbach [<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] highlighted the early potential of the internet in patient education, setting the stage for an ever-increasing reliance on online health information; however, questions remain regarding information accuracy, access, benefits, and privacy.</p><p>Internet searches represent one of the largest sources of health data. As of mid-2023, Google&#x02019;s daily search volume was &#x0003e;8.5 billion queries [<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Around 5% of Google searches are health related [<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], and about 77% of persons with a new diagnosis use search engines [<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. A recent study showed that 15% of internet searches by individuals with a recent diagnosis involved symptoms of a disease before diagnosis [<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], and 15% of all annual Google searches are new [<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>These and other data have prompted a series of research projects to address the feasibility and utility of using internet search data for seeking health services. Although the use of patient search data represents just one facet of technology being explored to help obtain new data about patient conditions [<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], this paper focuses only on research that uses internet search data.</p></sec><sec><title>Population Health Research</title><p>In population health research, there are studies available to assist researchers in approaching the use of internet search data. These studies focus on population health rather than diagnostic search but remain valuable because they offer methodologies for leveraging internet search data that can benefit research. These studies also delve into how understanding the dynamics of vaccine hesitancy across social media is crucial in devising strategies to promote vaccine acceptance.</p><p>Forecasting vaccine hesitancy has become increasingly vital within public health initiatives, and internet search data and social media platforms are pivotal in comprehending the underlying dynamics of this hesitancy [<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Leveraging data from search logs and social media platforms through machine learning and data analysis provides fresh perspectives on vaccine intentions and behaviors that aid policy makers and health care professionals in crafting strategies to tackle vaccine hesitancy.</p><p>The study titled &#x0201c;Accurate Measures of Vaccination and Concerns of Vaccine Holdouts from Web Search Logs&#x0201d; [<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] showcases the potential of using search logs for insightful analysis that addresses health concerns of patients. By developing a vaccine intent classifier, researchers accurately detect user searches for COVID-19 vaccines that strongly correlate with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&#x02019;s vaccination rates [<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], enabling real-time estimation of vaccine intent rates across demographics and regions and revealing granular tendencies in vaccine-seeking behavior [<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Machine learning identifies vaccine holdouts; their inclination toward using untrusted news sources; and specific concerns about vaccine requirements, development, and myths [<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Understanding these concerns among demographic groups unveils variations in hesitancy, shedding light on those crucial moments when individuals transition from being vaccine holdouts to considering vaccination [<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Similarly, the study on COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and increased internet search queries for fertility side effects following emergency use authorization demonstrates the link between public concerns and vaccine uptake [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The surge in fertility-related queries after emergency use authorization, fueled by unfounded scientific claims propagated on social media, underscores the hesitancy regarding potential side effects that influenced vaccine acceptance rates [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], emphasizing the importance of addressing specific concerns highlighted by web searches to alleviate hesitancy and promote informed public decision-making.</p><p>Research involving empathic engagement with vaccine-hesitant individuals in private Facebook groups highlights the potential of social media platforms to provide a place for health education and discussions [<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. These moderated discussions positively influenced vaccination intentions and beliefs, representing a promising strategy for combating vaccine hesitancy [<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Social media policies and interventions play an important role in mitigating vaccine misinformation. Policies implemented by platforms such as Facebook have reduced the reach of antivaccine content [<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], and the systematic appraisal of current social media strategies and their alignment with evidence-based practices represent necessary first steps [<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. However, the primary focus of these studies involves public sentiment, intentions, and behavioral patterns and not the diagnosis of specific conditions. Leveraging internet search data and social media platforms provides insights into vaccine hesitancy that can drive evidence-based strategies to address hesitancy, promote informed decision-making, and contribute to the success of vaccination campaigns, potentially curbing the spread of vaccine misinformation during public health emergencies.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Literature Review</title><p>We conducted a literature search on the PubMed database from October 2 to October 30, 2023, using predefined keywords and Medical Subject Headings related to Google, Bing, Takeout, internet search, web search, search behavior, diagnosis, disease identification, and diagnostic accuracy. <xref rid="app1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Multimedia Appendix 1</xref> lists all the search terms.</p><p>Stringent inclusion criteria were applied to identify relevant studies for analysis according to the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Multimedia Appendix 2</xref>).

While the use of data from <italic>aggregate, anonymized</italic> queries is widespread, particularly in epidemiological studies at the population level, such use lacks value in diagnosing specific conditions for individual patients. These anonymized datasets, lacking individuals&#x02019; specific informed consent, fall under exempt research use. Consequently, this paper does not include detailed examinations of these studies [<xref rid="ref55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,<xref rid="ref56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>].</p><p>The second and third categories of research applications using search queries are the focus of this examination. Both include individually consented patient data that may be linked with additional clinical datasets. In the United States, these studies fall under the Common Rule and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) privacy rule [<xref rid="ref57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>].</p><p>The second category includes using a <italic>search history to predict future search queries</italic> strongly correlating with health conditions or disease outcomes. One application involves developing specialized queries associated with a condition, searching patients&#x02019; internet logs with that condition, and evaluating associated symptoms [<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Researchers then build statistical classifiers to predict future appearances of landmark queries based on patterns in search logs [<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Such signals show possibilities of predicting forthcoming diagnoses from subtle temporal signals in searchers&#x02019; queries [<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. This approach was used to establish patient searches of symptoms associated with pancreatic cancer before their clinical diagnosis [<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>The third category involves using users&#x02019; internet <italic>search logs for which they granted consent for researchers</italic> to access and possibly permitted linkage to their health data. Most applied research in this category has used retrospective analysis to correlate with features of clinical symptoms or diagnostic tests. In several cases, particularly studies involving behavioral and mental health, prospective associations with Google and Bing search data series have been aligned with clinical outcomes [<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In the subsequent sections, we summarize findings from peer-reviewed publications representing research conducted on disease or condition diagnosis using search history to predict future health searches and patient-consented data linked to other health research data. Although these data represent a promising avenue for health research, cohort sizes in studies of internet search data linked with clinical records are typically smaller than those evaluating only individual internet search data, necessitating careful consideration when interpreting results and designing future studies. Nevertheless, studies going beyond aggregate, anonymized data offer important insights, particularly in understanding behavioral and mental health conditions.</p></sec><sec><title>Cancer</title><sec><title>Overview</title><p>The study titled &#x0201c;Patterns of Information-Seeking for Cancer on the Internet: An Analysis of Real World Data&#x0201d; [<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] was among the first internet query&#x02013;based studies to present a detailed analysis of cancer-related internet searches. It analyzed Yahoo search data over 3 months, involving 50,117 users and 225,675 queries [<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Findings include a correlation between the aggressiveness of the cancer type and the intensity and duration of search patterns [<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].

Ethically, the balance between leveraging data for societal benefit and protecting individual privacy is paramount, particularly given the sensitive nature of health-related search queries. Interviewees note challenges in fostering trust between patients and researchers; patient concerns around consent, transparency, and potential misuse of data require robust safeguards and clear communication to ensure that individuals are informed about how their data will be used and about accessible mechanisms to control or recover their shared data, along with demonstrable benefits of data use. Legally, the application of privacy laws such as HIPAA is complicated by the fact that internet search data fall outside traditional health care regulatory frameworks, necessitating new guidelines to address these gaps. Public acceptance hinges on building trust, which involves addressing fears of surveillance, potential discrimination, and misuse of personal data. These considerations underline the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration to develop ethical frameworks and policies that align technological capabilities with societal expectations and legal requirements.</p></sec><sec><title>Cross-Cutting Themes, Lines of Evidence, and Research Gaps</title><p>The results of our analysis of the peer-reviewed research for anonymized and nonanonymized research using Bing or Google search data reflect a clearly nascent domain of IT and data research in assisting with diagnosis determinations. Nevertheless, the advances in structured data, large language models (LLMs), search engines, analytic platforms, and expanding research experiences of health service investigators in population health and individual patient research are promising [<xref rid="ref58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. At present, there is no structured way of designing these types of studies to aid in diagnosis, but among the most visionary applications of search data, one of the applications is to develop disease-specific predictive models for classifying internet search terminologies that may one day be applied in real time for clinical decision-making.</p><p>The published research addresses feasibility and clinical efficacy in prospective studies. None of the reviewed studies have addressed clinical utility. However, some studies discussed implications of how analysis tools and predictive models were used, and some described the conceptualization for data representations in clinical health records [<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>-<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Should this type of research demonstrate clinical utility, one could envision the development of apps to empower individual patients. Research of rare diseases could benefit from population-level applications, where crowdsourcing of queries could be mined for commonalities and integrated with population data, disease registries, and EMRs. In addition, utilities for identifying patient candidates for clinical trials could be explored.</p><p>Researchers publishing results using internet search data are from 2 general health research domains: researchers from large technology companies with proprietary technology that supports internet searches, who have provided methodological innovations that open doors for clinical investigations [<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>-<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], and academic researchers experienced with large dataset analysis for specific health conditions. The research approaches differ in terms of anonymization, integration with EMRs or other data, the size of the groups studied, and applications of methods and tools. Moreover, it seems likely that research that combines important research questions from clinical and academic settings with the technology engineering domains would catalyze promising clinical and public health insights.</p><p>Research questions explored using internet search data usually focus on diseases that evolve over time (ie, subacute or chronic diseases) with a wide array of clinical presentations. One challenge across the domains studied using consented, retrospective internet search data involves the risks for bias in methods for consenting, patient donation, and other areas. However, the associations of causal effects through statistical analysis and mathematical examinations in population studies that use anonymous data sources can frame insights that can be evaluated through pilot studies and prospective randomized clinical trials that can address or help minimize the effects of biases.</p><p>Several studies integrate datasets from other social media platforms, such as Instagram and X (formerly known as Twitter), while others use Google Takeout or Bing. We found no publications using Google and Microsoft patient data on the same patients, nor any studies using the same analytic algorithms. Future work could examine crossover effects of patient populations using both data sources because the orientation and structure of the datasets differ.</p><p>Only 1 study to date has used a prospective data collection approach that enables patients to contribute data from the beginning of their enrollment (KA Comtois, PhD, personal email correspondence, December 26, 2023). It is unclear whether the search patterns differed in patients who donated their data retrospectively versus patients who donated prospectively. The publications we examined provide no details on the mathematical methods used in classifying terms; there appears to be no consensus or best practices for annotating such data. Thus, reproducing study results may be difficult. We found no publications that have made anonymized datasets created from their research available to other researchers for examination. The most detailed descriptive methods publications provide are supplemental data that include search patterns, common terms, and other data classification details. Future research may encourage more open data policies, including the provision of metadata and the descriptive characteristics of the study populations, which would allow others to validate and build on pilot studies that shape hypothetical associations for enabling diagnosis.</p><p>While cancer diagnosis was the initial clinical domain of disease diagnosis captured in the early literature [<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], the research has broadened to additional areas, including mental and behavioral health [<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>-<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>-<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The ability to obtain search data from patients provides researchers with valuable insights into the patterns of thought, the periodicity of searching patterns, and themes of research. Perhaps the most noteworthy search domain identified involves queries regarding the patient&#x02019;s intent to harm oneself or others. A series of studies on integrating patients&#x02019; online activities and risk-taking behavior are underway to evaluate their utility in understanding patient management applications. In these domains, the clinical utility is less focused on diagnosis than on monitoring the patient&#x02019;s status for management and on using search data as an integral tool to intervene or make therapeutic changes in clinical regimens. Government or nongovernmental research organizations are sponsoring several of these studies, marking a milestone for nonindustry sponsorship of search data applications [<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>From the articles we reviewed, there appears to be consensus that assistance with infrastructure development would benefit researchers in designing their studies. In this paper, we have summarized the research findings on tools for harnessing massive datasets and enabling their integration with other datasets, including those with EMR data. We also noted a need for broader information about the nature of the available search datasets, best practices for individuals to manage their datasets with researchers, and the conditions under which their data can be shared. Given the concerns regarding data privacy and security for large datasets in the consumer marketplace and the interplay of these data with HIPAA-regulated data in clinical settings, benefit to the researcher and patient advocacy communities could be achieved by establishing resources and best practices to guide future research design, oversight, and patient benefits from the use of their data.</p></sec><sec><title>Researcher Tools</title><p>Researchers have created tools to effectively use internet search data, the integration of which has eased the identification of early signs of issues, ensured user privacy, and streamlined the investigative process. Innovation in these tools (<xref rid="app5" ref-type="supplementary-material">Multimedia Appendix 5</xref>) allows researchers to be more successful in their searches, as has been the case in other research domains with novel data sources, such as genomic datasets.</p><p>The gTAP web application prioritizes data privacy and security by allowing participants to download their data without sharing personal account credentials, ensuring a higher level of user trust and confidentiality [<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. This feature encourages participation in studies involving symptom analysis and diagnostics, fostering collaboration between researchers and users while maintaining data integrity [<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].</p><p>Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count, a text analysis software package, exhibits remarkable potential in differentiating linguistic attributes within search logs [<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. By identifying linguistic patterns indicating emotional, sexual, or physical abuse, Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count is instrumental in early symptom identification, providing valuable insights for health care professionals and researchers [<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p><p>The Google natural language processing application programming interface is pivotal in ensuring data privacy and anonymization [<xref rid="ref48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. By automatically detecting and removing personally identifying information from search history data before they are saved as research data, this application programming interface safeguards the confidentiality of individual study participants [<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], enabling researchers to delve into symptom analysis and diagnostics using real-world data while upholding ethical standards and privacy regulations [<xref rid="ref49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>].</p><p>CrowdTangle, a powerful tool from Meta, aids in monitoring, analyzing, and reporting social media activities [<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. It effectively offers transparency across various social media platforms, positioning it as an invaluable resource for understanding public discourse and sentiment regarding health-related symptoms and conditions [<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. It is the most effective transparency tool in the history of social media [<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>Latent Dirichlet allocation and Differential Language Analysis Toolkit are cutting-edge methodologies in text analysis [<xref rid="ref59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Latent Dirichlet allocation produces clusters of words that occur in the same context across Facebook posts, yielding semantically coherent topics [<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Differential Language Analysis Toolkit determines the relative frequency with which users use words (ie, unigrams) and 2-word phrases (ie, bigrams) and can also retain variables and phrases [<xref rid="ref59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Both are pivotal in the identification of potential symptoms or health-related discussions [<xref rid="ref59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>].</p><p>In a recent diagnostic study evaluating artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities, the use of the AI chatbot GPT-4 (OpenAI) showcased remarkable proficiency in certain diagnostic scenarios [<xref rid="ref60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Comparing the LLM&#x02019;s performance with a broad survey of human clinicians, the study revealed that the LLM surpassed human clinicians in accurately determining pretest and posttest probabilities following a negative test result across 5 cases, although the performance was less robust after positive test results [<xref rid="ref60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. The study suggests that leveraging probabilistic recommendations from such LLMs could enhance human diagnostic capabilities and that combining AI&#x02019;s probabilistic, narrative, and heuristic diagnostic approaches could improve diagnostic accuracy [<xref rid="ref60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>].</p><p>These tools offer greater accuracy and prioritize user privacy and data security. Integrating them into research and health care systems enables early detection and better understanding of symptoms and contributes to well-being outcomes, especially for older individuals, when combined with a comprehensive support system. As technology evolves, these tools are poised to play an increasingly vital role in enhancing health care and advancing diagnostic capabilities.</p></sec><sec><title>Challenges</title><p>The use of internet search data to facilitate medical diagnosis faces challenges, including bias, data privacy, and misinformation. The ethical use of patient data is crucial. The study by Wachter and Mittelstadt [<xref rid="ref61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>] titled &#x0201c;A Right to Reasonable Interferences: Rethinking Data Protection Law in the Age of Big Data and AI&#x0201d; analyzes ethical dilemmas surrounding the use of big data in health care, emphasizing the need to balance patient privacy with the benefits of big data analytics [<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] and the importance of consent and transparency in the collection and use of patient data. It also highlighted biases and inequalities resulting from mismanaged data practices [<xref rid="ref61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Yom-Tov and Cherlow [<xref rid="ref50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] further emphasized the need to carefully consider the ethical implications and suggest solutions that balance the benefits and challenges of online screening services.</p><p>In our exploration of the field of information sciences concerning internet search data, a notable challenge emerged&#x02014;the lack of infrastructure for constructing a robust analytic approach to leverage these data in medical and health services research. Thus, we investigated alternative open data research organizational models and discovered the pioneering work of Lane [<xref rid="ref62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. In her book <italic>Democratizing Our Data: A Manifesto</italic> [<xref rid="ref62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>], Lane introduces an organizational model to revolutionize data accessibility and usefulness. Within this context, the Institute for Research on Innovation and Science (IRIS) stands out with its groundbreaking contribution, the Universities: Measuring the Impacts of Research on Innovation, Competitiveness, and Science (UMETRICS) dataset [<xref rid="ref62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. UMETRICS constitutes a burgeoning research asset, harnessing administrative data&#x02014;information collected primarily for administrative purposes, such as record keeping, then repurposed for research to analyze health care patterns&#x02014;from 30 prominent universities that collectively contribute over one-third of federal research and development spending in academia [<xref rid="ref62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. This dataset signifies a shift in data practices, fundamentally reshaping data collection methodologies, fortifying privacy safeguards, and fostering the generation of new products [<xref rid="ref62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Along with pioneering the inception of &#x0201c;big data&#x0201d; social science research infrastructures, IRIS confronted the formidable challenge of comprehending the impact of research funding on scientific and economic activities, doing so by spearheading construction of an entire infrastructure for tracing the effects of research funding on individuals and interconnected networks [<xref rid="ref62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. IRIS developed a highly adaptable data infrastructure, composed of a decentralized network of federal agencies responsible for collecting, analyzing, and disseminating data on various aspects of the country, which caters directly to research universities and provides impactful methods to assess scientific and economic implications of their research pursuits, surpassing the federal statistical system [<xref rid="ref62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Critical to IRIS&#x02019;s approach was establishing a data infrastructure rooted in transparent governance, robust privacy protocols, and effective confidentiality protections, buttressed by a sustainable business model requiring contributions from data providers and sponsored projects [<xref rid="ref62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. This comprehensive approach provides an important foundation and framework for transformative data activities in the realm of social media and promises accessible and purposeful data use [<xref rid="ref62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>].</p><p>Leveraging the work of such organizations may unify researchers&#x02019; approaches in governance, transparency, data sharing, and related aspects essential for using search data effectively. Integrating these insights into our analysis could illuminate pathways to address critical gaps in this field. We need to establish robust infrastructures that equip researchers with the necessary tools and resources to delve into such research at scale. Assessing the true utility of search data in medical diagnosis requires comprehensive frameworks that facilitate large-scale analysis while ensuring data privacy and integrity. Moreover, should research demonstrate the valuable application of these findings, such infrastructures will play a pivotal role in translating discoveries into actionable insights for clinical practice and health care policy.</p></sec><sec><title>Health Care Practice and Policy Implications</title><p>The integration of internet search data with health research datasets suggests profound implications for health care practice and policy, necessitating careful ethical and technical considerations. Such research poses unique challenges, beyond the scope of traditional regulatory frameworks such as HIPAA. While HIPAA governs the use and disclosure of protected health information held by covered entities, it may not fully address the intricacies of internet search data, which contain a wealth of information about individuals&#x02019; health behaviors and concerns and potentially sensitive details not captured by conventional health records.</p><p>In the context of policy implications, IRBs play a crucial role in ensuring ethical research practices and safeguarding participants&#x02019; welfare. For research involving internet search data, IRBs must navigate the nuanced landscape of privacy, consent, and potential risks. Since internet search data may not fall under the strict purview of HIPAA, it is essential that IRBs establish clear guidelines for these data.</p></sec><sec><title>Research Directions</title><p>The findings of this literature review underscore the need for concerted efforts to stimulate research and fully explore the potential clinical utility of integrating internet search data with health research datasets. While our review did not identify a clear clinical utility, it revealed promising dimensions in behavioral health, early rare disease detection, and cancer diagnoses. The limited research in this domain since the seminal work of White and Horvitz [<xref rid="ref51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="ref52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] in 2013 and 2014 and its relative scarcity suggest potential barriers related to researchers&#x02019; familiarity with the data technical complexities in mining the data, or other yet-to-be-identified obstacles [<xref rid="ref53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,<xref rid="ref54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>].</p><p>To address these gaps and challenges, we propose a multifaceted approach in 4 key areas. First, there is an urgent need to assess the value and utility of internet search and activity datasets in conjunction with health research datasets, including clinical records. This evaluation should explore how such integration can enhance the diagnostic process, contribute to early disease detection, provide personalized health insights, inform data-driven decision-making, and improve patient experiences.</p><p>Second, future research should focus on mental health, autism, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and chronic or rare diseases. Tailoring projects to address unique diagnostic and treatment challenges may involve creating customized algorithms and tools that cater to these patients&#x02019; needs and nuanced health conditions.</p><p>Third, the introduction of innovative analytics, including advanced machine learning and AI models, should be a priority [<xref rid="ref63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. These sophisticated techniques can uncover hidden patterns and tendencies within the integrated datasets, offering a new frontier in diagnostic accuracy. Developing predictive models could revolutionize health care delivery by providing more precise insights into patient conditions and optimizing treatment plans [<xref rid="ref64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>,<xref rid="ref65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. The advancement of infrastructure platforms that could aggregate search data with other types of online data (ie, social media and generative AI) and clinical data would allow for this research to be conducted at scale and for the introduction of the kind of innovative analytics described earlier [<xref rid="ref65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>,<xref rid="ref66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>].</p><p>Fourth, enhancing patient involvement in modernizing the consent process is paramount. Research should focus on developing innovative strategies that streamline and modernize consent, prioritizing transparency, trust, and patient comfort with the use of their data. Involving patients in shaping research practices ensures ethical, patient-centered health care research, reduces administrative burdens, and promotes accessibility and efficiency.</p><p>This comprehensive effort aims to propel research in this field, overcoming current limitations and paving the way for transformative applications of internet search and activity data in health care diagnostics. Innovations, such as reusable platforms for consent and data collection, may improve researchers and patient engagement. Standardized platforms that streamline the consent process and facilitate data collection can substantially enhance efficiency and scalability. These platforms should incorporate user-friendly interfaces, clear consent language, and robust security measures to ensure privacy compliance and promote patient trust. Reusable frameworks expedite research, reduce administrative burdens, and foster collaboration, advancing our understanding of the clinical utility of internet search data in medical diagnosis.</p><p>Respecting patient privacy and obtaining informed consent are foundational principles in health care research. Because the integration of internet search data involves potentially sensitive information, careful attention must be paid to ethical considerations. Transparent and user-friendly consent models are needed to ensure that patients understand who will have access to their data and how their data will be used. Innovative approaches to patient engagement should prioritize educating individuals about the benefits and risks of contributing their internet search data to research. In addition, robust security measures and compliance with privacy regulations are imperative to protect patient confidentiality. Policy makers are pivotal in establishing clear guidelines and regulations that balance the potential benefits of research using internet search data and patients&#x02019; medical data with the imperative to uphold patient rights and privacy. Striking the right balance between facilitating research advancements and safeguarding patient interests is critical for the responsible and ethical use of internet search data in health care practice and policy.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>In today&#x02019;s health care system, many patients lack access to timely, accurate diagnoses, missing the benefits of early detection and treatment, leading to suboptimal outcomes, disparities, and economic impacts. Advances in engineering, computing, social science, and data analytics are yielding transformative insights for public health and clinical medicine. Recently, the convergence of these advancements, particularly in LLMs and generative AI, has captured the imagination of health professionals and the public.</p><p>Initial studies have highlighted approaches involving study design, technical innovation, and data management to explore the potential of leveraging internet search data alongside clinical data for early diagnosis. Further research is needed to validate assumptions from search history studies and assess their utility in case-control studies or small cohorts linking symptoms to outcomes. Implementation studies are also necessary to establish the clinical utility of these strategies in real-world settings. Challenges include the costs of diagnostic assessments, particularly for low-frequency conditions or those with high false-positive rates and medical risks. No framework currently exists for integrating internet search queries into clinical assessments, raising questions such as how to distinguish chronic from rare disease indicators.</p><p>Globally, people extensively use internet searches for symptom understanding, self-diagnosis, and treatment, creating a vast volume of health-related queries. An individual&#x02019;s search history is a valuable data source offering insights into their diagnostic journey, enabling researchers to track symptoms and predict conditions. Linking search data with health care use information reveals disparities by factors such as insurance, race, and education. Empowering patients to understand and leverage these data can enhance diagnosis. However, critical issues&#x02014;epidemiological, privacy, consent, infrastructure, and validation&#x02014;remain pivotal for advancing this research.</p><p>The Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation&#x02019;s Diagnostic Excellence Initiative is a step toward a future in which health care is more accessible, patient centric, and driven by IT and data. The field continues to evolve, promising a healthier, more informed society.</p><p>The interrogation of search data is in its infancy. Initial studies have identified the promise of using search data for personal health and population health benefits, including aiding medical diagnoses. While the clinical utility of enabling health care professionals to apply powerful analytic engines to specific diagnoses has yet to be attained, research into achieving this goal is accelerating rapidly. This analysis points to the need for strategic and tactical measures by health services researchers, technology engineers, policy makers, and regulators to advance this research, optimize its social good, and prevent harm or misuse.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>This project was directed by AcademyHealth with funding from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation&#x02019;s Diagnostic Excellence Initiative.
