Its cervical mucus acts as a defense against infections from the lower vaginal tract (<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). The cervix plays a crucial role in sexual activity (<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>), fertilization (<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>), pregnancy (<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), and childbirth (<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Its volume and structure are influenced by age, menstrual cycle, pregnancy, and hormone therapies (<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4&#x02013;8</xref>).</p><p>In nulliparous women, the cervix&#x02019;s topographic morphology is thinner and cone-shaped, while in parous women, it is generally cylindrical and thicker (<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). However, the development of neoplasms, trauma during childbirth, abortions, infections, inflammatory processes, and surgical procedures can all disrupt the cervical shape, architecture, and tissue structure (<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4&#x02013;6</xref>, <xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9&#x02013;14</xref>). These factors contribute to the complexity of cervical health, and conditions like cervical fibroids (CFs) cause anatomical distortion with various clinical symptoms (<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12&#x02013;20</xref>).</p><p>The prevalence of CFs in the literature ranges from 0.6 to 7.7% (<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21&#x02013;26</xref>), and current visualization methods have improved the diagnosis and management of CFs. The increased number of publications with case reports in the worldwide literature described complications in obstetric patients (<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27&#x02013;29</xref>). It demonstrated the increased size of CFs filled in the pelvic cavity (<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>), with a specific appearance as the Lantern on Saint Paul&#x02019;s dome (<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>) and atypical presentation with mimicking symptoms of pathologic conditions of neighboring organs (<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), gastrointestinal, and urologic systems (<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16&#x02013;18</xref>). Symptomatic CFs could lead to life-threatening conditions during pregnancy, delivery, and postpartum periods (<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27&#x02013;29</xref>), hamper the daily routine activity of women, and reduce the quality of their lives (<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27&#x02013;29</xref>).</p><p>Therefore, many diagnostic and treatment technologies to manage CFs were described in the literature (<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23&#x02013;25</xref>, <xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30&#x02013;37</xref>). According to the recent systematic literature review, laparoscopy (LS) was the most frequently used approach in 114 (59.4%) patients among 192 identified cases of surgical and radiologic interventional treatments (<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). Then, laparotomy (LT) was used in 50 (26.0%) cases, interventional radiology in 20 (10.4%) patients, and vaginal myomectomy (VME) only in 8 (4.2%) women. Most papers in this study addressed this topic as case reports, and VME is still a rarely utilized method to treat CFs (<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). Because there is a risk of significant bleeding and other complications, as well as injury to the uterine blood vessels and surrounding organs, the removal of CFs through the vagina demands surgical expertise and experience. As a result, these challenges have restricted the use of the direct anatomic surgical approach.</p><p>This study attempted to explore the feasibility of surgically removing the CFs through the vagina, depending on fibroids size, their single or combined occurrence, and localization sites in the cervix with further comparative analysis of findings with extensive data from the literature. In addition, based on personal experience and a thorough analysis of the English and Chinese literature, an original classification of CFs will be suggested.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec7"><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec8"><label>2.1</label><title>Study design and subjects</title><p>This retrospective cohort observational study was planned by the EQUATOR Reporting Guidelines, which include the STROBE Statement - Checklist of items (<xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). We used the medical records of patients treated in the Division of Experimental Endoscopic Surgery, Imaging, Technology, and Minimally Invasive Therapy, Lecce, and the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology and CERICSAL (Centro di RIcerca Clinico SALentino), &#x0201c;Veris Delli Ponti Hospital,&#x0201d; Scorrano, as well as the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology and CERICSAL (CEntro di RIcerca Clinico SALentino). The local IRB approved our study protocol. Every patient signed an informed consent form granting permission for data collection, analysis, and publication in an anonymous manner (The IRB code of authorization is T7WGSJ3). The creation and dissemination of the intracapsular myomectomy (ME) method, which allows the fibroid to be removed from the uterus inside its pseudocapsule&#x02014;a fibro-neurovascular network that divides the tumor from the myometrium&#x02014;was accomplished by our multinational team. It was then thought that this method could start the myometrial muscle&#x02019;s natural healing process following surgery. This intracapsular myomectomy technique was first applied in open and laparoscopic procedures to treat uterine fibroids. Since 2014, the vaginal method of enucleating CFs has used the application of intracapsular myomectomy. Thus, the term cervical intracapsular myomectomy (CIME) was coined for this novel technique. For this study, we collected anonymous medical records in an Excel table from 32 patients who underwent CIME via the vagina in the 2014&#x02013;2023-time span and were followed up until January 2024 (<xref rid="SM2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 2</xref>).

Twelve hours before surgery, on the day of admission, the anesthesiologist assessed the patients and performed an intestinal purge as a routine protocol in our Hospital.</p></sec><sec id="sec13"><label>2.6</label><title>Surgical protocol</title><p>Under general anesthesia, surgeries were carried out in the lithotomy positions for the patients. Following disinfection, a sterile drape was placed over the surgical site, and a Foley catheter (Teleflex, USA) was placed inside the bladder. The Collins&#x02019; forceps (Integra, USA) clamped the upper and lower cervical lips. The uterine cervix was dragged as far down as possible to exert gentle traction opposite the fibroid. If the fibroid was posterior, it was drawn anteriorly; if it was posterior, it was pulled down. The uterine cervix was later dragged to opposing positions (left or right) in lateral localizations of CFs. The pseudocapsule encircling the fibroid was discovered after the cervical wall above it was cut (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). The fibroid was exposed by bipolar scissors or Harmonic Focus Shears with Adaptive Tissue Technology (Ethicon, J&#x00026;J, Newark, USA). Collins&#x02019; forceps grabbed it and gently pulled it toward the vulva (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Subsequently, the procedure followed the standard intracapsular myomectomy protocol, performed by laparotomy and laparoscopy. This technique allowed us to preserve the neurovascular bundles within the fibroid pseudocapsule (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2C</xref>,<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">D</xref>) performed by selective coagulation. This technique enabled us to successfully remove the fibroid from the cervix (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2E</xref>,<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">F</xref>). Following hemostasis, single or continuous knots were used to stitch the edges of the wounds using either monofilament or interwoven absorbable sutures 5/0 (Ethicon, J&#x00026;J, Newark, USA). Finally, the hemostatic check-up was performed at the end of the procedure. The physical measurement in centimeters of the actual size of the CFs was done with further histological examination to verify the diagnosis. The following day, the hemostatic gauze was taken out from the vagina.</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Steps of the cervical intracapsular myomectomy: <bold>(A)</bold> The protrusion of the uterine cervical fibroid (CF) lower portion; <bold>(B)</bold> hooked and pulled CF by the ring forceps; <bold>(C)</bold> coagulation of the CF pseudocapsule fibro-neurovascular fiber; <bold>(D)</bold> the CF hooked and pulled up with Collin&#x02019;s forceps; <bold>(E)</bold> uterine cervix after CF removal; <bold>(F)</bold> the removed CF placed next to a pen.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fmed-12-1564667-g002" position="float"/></fig></sec><sec id="sec14"><label>2.7</label><title>Additional literature review</title><p>Data on uterine cervical myomectomies were gathered through a comprehensive global English literature assessment, including case reports and original research publications (<xref rid="SM3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Tables 3&#x02013;9</xref>). Furthermore, study articles compiled from Chinese literature discussed cervical myomectomies (<xref rid="SM10" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 10</xref>). The search was limited to cervical fibroids, specifically myomas or leiomyomas. Hysterectomy and trachelectomy were the exclusion criteria. Cases involving vaginal enucleation of CFs, laparotomic or laparoscopic approaches, and subsequent hysterectomy, as well as conservative management of CFs or hysterectomy during Cesarean sections in obstetric patients, were also excluded. All other types of cervical neoplasms, including lipoleiomyoma, were also excluded. When various data, such as uterine body myomas or other surgical procedures, were included in the publications, only cases of cervical myomectomy were extracted. The size of CFs in centimeters was used for analysis. Finally, to avoid bias, only myomectomy cases were selected from all sources (case reports and cohort studies), and individual variables comparable to our findings from patients with CFs were used for statistical analysis grouped depending on surgical approaches, subsequently via vaginal, laparoscopic, and laparotomic ways of surgery in our comprehensive analyses. In addition, for this reason (to avoid bias), only analogous, comparable parameters from cohort studies were used.

Intriguingly, all these cases were observed in two years (from January 2021 to January 2023) at the obstetrics and gynecology department of the PGIMS, University of Health Sciences, Rohtak (Haryana, India). Unfortunately, we could not include the results of this study in our analysis because of the absence of similar variables for comparisons, and myomectomy cases were mixed with the hysterectomy (<xref rid="ref48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). Publications in the global literature concerning CFs have mainly described particularly extraordinary severe cases and large fibroids with suitable illustrations for submission from hospitals equipped with modern diagnostic visualization tools. Doctors in these facilities are usually highly qualified and can solve patients&#x02019; problems with such complicated conditions. Therefore, most CF cases with usual conditions, in which doctors did not use appropriate diagnostic methods to get illustrations for publications, have remained unknown. The increasing number of studies on this subject due to the implication of modern visualization tools has shown that the prevalence of CFs is underestimated, taking into account the high prevalence of uterine myomas in overaged patients and among half of the reproductive-aged women (<xref rid="ref49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>, <xref rid="ref50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>).

We observed three types of growing CFs: Extracervical growth of CFs arising from anterior and posterior lips of the cervix, defined as extracervical anterior&#x02013;posterior localizations (EAPL, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6A</xref>,<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">B</xref>); CFs originating from the lateral sides of the cervix with extracervical and intracervical growth are named extra and intracervical lateral localizations (EILL, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6C</xref>,<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">D</xref>). Combined cervical fibroid localizations (CCFL, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6E</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">H</xref>) were observed in two positions in each case.

Extracervical anterior and extracervical lateral locations; (4). Extracervical and intracervical posterior sites. Depending on their kinds and growth orientations, large-sized CFs may present with severe acute illnesses that need immediate surgical intervention to preserve the patients&#x02019; lives or allow them to resume their regular lives. Since these CFs have grown to maximum size, they produced changes and injured surrounding tissues and organs in the pelvic cavity, disabling women from their daily routines; we named these CFs &#x0201c;the mature fibroids&#x0201d; (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6I</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">L</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>Classification of growing and mature cervical fibroids (CFs): <bold>(A,B)</bold> Extracervical anterior/posterior localizations (EAPL). <bold>(C,D)</bold> Extra/intracervical lateral localizations (EILL). <bold>(E&#x02013;H)</bold> Combined cervical fibroid localizations (CCFL). <bold>(I)</bold> Central upward. <bold>(J)</bold> Central downward. <bold>(K)</bold> Lateral-upward. <bold>(L)</bold> Lateral-side growth of CFs.

These findings demonstrated that surgeons and patients should prefer vaginal CIME to treat CFs.</p></sec><sec id="sec41"><label>4.3.4</label><title>Surgical approaches for cervical myomectomy</title><p>The cervical myomectomies were performed via LS, LT, and vaginal approaches (<xref rid="SM3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 3</xref>), respectively, in 212 (70.66%), 44 (14.67%), and 44 (14.67%) cases among 300 patients in English literature (<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23&#x02013;25</xref>, <xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34&#x02013;36</xref>, <xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38&#x02013;41</xref>), including case report studies represented in (<xref rid="SM6" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Tables 6&#x02013;9</xref>). Analogously myomectomies were performed via LS, LT, and vaginal approaches, respectively, in 431 (47.68%), 191 (21.13%), and 282 (31.19%) cases in Chinese cohort studies (<xref rid="SM10" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 10</xref>). The LSME was the most applied technique of CFs treatment, especially among young populations independently of the study origin. One case of the LS approach was converted to open surgery (<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). This patient was excluded from the LS group (<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>) and included in the case report study (<xref rid="SM9" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 9a</xref>). Analogously, two patients who experienced vaginal and laparotomic cervical myomectomies from the case series article were allocated to case report studies (<xref rid="SM6" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Tables 6&#x02013;9</xref>). There were only 42 case reports describing 44 cases of vaginal myomectomies to treat CFs in the English literature between 1885 and 2022 (<xref rid="SM6" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Tables 6, 7</xref>). In contrast, ten Chinese cohort studies with 282 cases were published between 2007 and 2020 (<xref rid="SM10" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 10a</xref>). It should be noted that vaginal myomectomies in 29 gynecologic patients were performed because of symptomatic CFs in the case report study (<xref rid="SM6" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 6</xref>), whereas 15 in obstetric patients, to treat complications of pregnancy, delivery, and postpartum periods in the case report study (<xref rid="SM7" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 7</xref>). Analogously there was a high activity of Chinese researchers in a short time concerning LS and LT surgeries to treat CFs (<xref rid="SM3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Tables 3, 10b,c</xref>). Several studies applied the robot-assisted LS technique to excision CFs (<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). In the case report study (<xref rid="SM9" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 9</xref>), among 25 LTMEs, 21 cases were gynecologic patients (<xref rid="SM9" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 9a</xref>). Four myomectomies were simultaneous cervical myomectomies during Cesarean sections (<xref rid="SM9" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 9b</xref>). Another ten LTMEs come from a cohort study (<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>), and 9 cases were myomectomies performed during or after Cesarean sections (<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Finally, 44 cases of LTME were collected from the English literature, including cohort, case series, and case report studies.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec42"><label>4.4</label><title>Strengths</title><p>This retrospective study unveils a novel surgical procedure, transvaginal CIME, which was successfully performed on a series of 32 patients. The outcomes showed that transvaginal CIME of CFs may be done regardless of the location and size of CFs. A comparative analysis of the findings with perioperative endpoints of 643 laparoscopic, 235 open, and 326 vaginal myomectomies from the global literature demonstrated the viability and efficacy of the transvaginal CIME. Additionally, a comprehensive description of the various clinical manifestations of growing and mature CFs based on factors such as size, growth direction, localization sites, and depth of lesions was proposed, along with a classification of these patients. Depending on the size, growth direction, and depth of lesions, the classification may make it simple to determine the origin of CFs&#x02019; clinical manifestations and adjust patient care accordingly. Since the daily routines and reproductive objectives of patients are impeded by CFs, this novel transvaginal CIME may enhance patients&#x02019; well-being.</p></sec><sec id="sec43"><label>4.5</label><title>Limitations</title><p>The limitations of this study are evident in the low number of patients, a direct result of the low prevalence of CFs, as indicated by the scarcity of case reports in English literature. The multiplicity of analyses, while a strength, also presents a limitation because many observations were drawn from Chinese language literature, which may limit our readers&#x02019; access to the part of sources.</p><p>Additionally, we performed post-hoc power analysis and sample size calculation (<xref rid="SM11" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 11</xref>) for nulliparous incidence using an online post-hoc power calculator (<xref rid="ref54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). We applied dichotomous endpoints of two independent studies (nulliparous incidence, %), number of patients in groups at the alpha (0.05), beta (0.2), and power (0.8) for two case report studies: LSME (<italic>n</italic>&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;10), LTME (<italic>n</italic>&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;21) and two cohort studies: Matsuoka et al. (<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>), (<italic>n</italic>&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;16), Chang et al. (<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), (<italic>n</italic>&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;28) comparing to our data. Subsequently, post-hoc power was 80 or higher in three studies with sufficient actual sample size (<xref rid="SM11" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 11</xref>) to reject or confirm the study hypothesis (<xref rid="ref55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>), supporting our comparisons using literature data.</p></sec><sec id="sec44"><label>4.6</label><title>General summary</title><p>According to the findings, CFs with a mean size of 8.08&#x0202f;cm with lower/upper 95% CI (7.44&#x02013;8.73&#x0202f;cm) in extracervical anterior and posterior sites, 7.61&#x0202f;cm (7.09&#x02013;8.14&#x0202f;cm) in extracervical and intracervical lateral localizations, and 5.36&#x0202f;cm (4.71&#x02013;6.35&#x0202f;cm) for combined CFs in two different localization sites could potentially be successfully treated with the transvaginal CIME. Through a comparative analysis of perioperative endpoints from 326 vaginal, 643 laparoscopic, and 235 open (laparotomic) myomectomies from the global literature, were demonstrated the feasibility and efficacy of the original CIME technique. Additionally, a unique classification of growing and mature CFs was proposed, along with detailed descriptions of their various clinical manifestations based on size, growth directions, localization sites, and depth of lesions. This classification could make it easy to understand the cause of the clinical manifestation of CFs depending on their locations, growth directions, size, and depth of lesions, with subsequent patient management accordingly. Our study results could increase the attention of practitioners to treat CFs through vaginal access by using current visualization diagnostic methods and also our classification of fibroid localization to manage patients with such severe medical conditions in the future. Both suggested classification and the CIME technique can improve conservative surgical treatment of women, preserving their uterus and reproductive function and saving the quality of their lives.</p><sec id="sec45"><title>Duplicate publication statement</title><p>The new technique of CIME in this study was based on our previously developed method of intracapsular myomectomy for open and laparoscopic approaches for treating uterine body fibroids (<xref rid="ref56" ref-type="bibr">56&#x02013;58</xref>). Therefore, in describing the surgical technique, we have repeated analogous details from the surgical protocols in the previously published articles since the main idea of intracapsular myomectomy is identical in both types of myomectomies. In this study, we adapted the performance of this technique regarding fibroid localization in the cervix and their direct approach via the vagina. There was a publication by Tinelli (<xref rid="ref59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>) entitled &#x0201c;Intracervical fibroid removal: a myomectomy reasoned on biological bases,&#x0201d; where the previously published surgical technique of intracervical intracapsular myomectomy through laparoscopy (<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>) was commented.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Rosario Paolo Zecca (Lecce), Italy, for allowing us to operate with most patients using this innovative technique.
