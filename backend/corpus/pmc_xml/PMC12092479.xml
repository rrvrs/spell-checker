These costs could be greatly reduced through a stronger relocation of medicine and patient care in the outpatient sector. To this aim, the current government has planned to strengthen the outpatient medical sector in the coalition agreement, e.g., by remunerating certain medical services with the same fee, regardless of whether they are provided in a private practice or in a hospital (Osterloh and Ambulantisierung <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2022</xref>).</p><p id="Par6">Moreover, the dramatic shift of care towards ambulatory rather than inpatient setting, in particular in the field of hematology and oncology, is also due to the exponential development of new therapeutic agents that do not require hospitalization like oral targeted therapy or immunotherapy. In Germany non-academical outpatient care centers driven by oncology/hematology specialists with full reimbursement allow a nationwide, high-quality cancer care and cover about 40% of all hemato-oncological patients (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.winho.de">www.winho.de</ext-link>).</p><p id="Par7">With regard to medical education, a stronger integration and promotion of the outpatient sector has already been stipulated in the &#x0201c;Masterplan 2020&#x0201d; and the new Medical Licensing Regulations (NKLM), planned from 2025 and still under intense political debate (Forschung <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2020</xref>; Richter-Kuhlmann and Medizinstudium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2025</xref>). Several problems in teaching arise for physicians working in the outpatient sector. Long journeys for lecturers or students as well as high-cost pressure and time stress in the daily routine make it difficult to hold courses. As a consequence, students gain significantly more insights into inpatient care during their studies. The inpatient cases are often more critically ill and thus not representative of common case presentation.</p><p id="Par8">Furthermore, medical education in the ambulatory care setting and interaction with health professionals provides a valuable learning experience that contributes to the understanding of interprofessional practice (Saunders et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2019</xref>). Thus, the evaluation of intersectoral teaching systems is important to support the development of medical teaching from university hospitals and teaching hospitals to teaching practices in oncology.</p><p id="Par9">In response to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, medical education faculties have quickly transitioned the entire curriculum to online formats. All aspects of medical education were affected, and many challenges were experienced by trainees and potentially compromised their core training&#x02014;including their mental health (Kohls et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2021</xref>; Zis, et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2021</xref>). Social distancing and deferral of clinical rotations had a high impact in providing authentic patient experiences as key component of medical education (Rose <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2020</xref>; Kaul et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2021</xref>). However, there were several opportunities for innovations, creativity and research that contributed to the advancement and transformation of medical education (Loda et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2020</xref>; Herrmann-Werner, et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2021</xref>; Oliveira Franco et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2019</xref>; Becker et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2020</xref>).</p><p id="Par10">The purpose of this study is to describe the experience on medical teaching by faculty members from outpatient or distant institutions starting from the pandemic with online teaching and furthermore to describe feasibility for students to practice in an outpatient cancer center setting with focus on a selected center and to finally analyze challenges and chances for both teachers as well as for medical students.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design and population size</title><p id="Par11">This observational study started with the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in the winter term of 2020 up to summer term 2023 involving faculty members as well as medical students of LMU Munich in their 6th and 7th semester, section hematology/oncology.</p><p id="Par12">Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> summarizes the study population and design: Eleven faculty members from distant (&#x0003e;&#x02009;30 km) institutions and outpatient cancer centers were teaching an average of 90/students/semester in their courses.

Furthermore, a one-day bed side teaching at this outpatient cancer center institution was offered and integrated in the course after the pandemic on a voluntary base for 15 students and evaluated in a second survey. In the following, two students completed a 4-week internship there, and six students chose an oncological mentorship resulting in four students choosing a doctoral thesis in the field of hematology and oncology (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Teaching and evaluation methodology</title><p id="Par14">Online lessons via Zoom were structured upon 90 min to achieve learning goals and competency in interviewing, discussion of differential diagnoses, and outlining diagnostic workflow. Interviews on symptoms were given upon a self-made short movie either by simulation with help of nurses or real-life with selected and informed patients that formally agreed to attend an online lesson. Interactive discussion of further learning goals was conducted with help of the &#x0201c;chat&#x0201d; function, intercalated by multiple choice questions.</p><p id="Par15">All surveys conducted were created and evaluated using the software &#x0201c;evasys&#x0201d; (evasys GmbH, L&#x000fc;neburg, Germany). Established questionnaires from the semester evaluations of the LMU-medical faculty for online bed-side teaching were offered to all attendees on a voluntary base. (Likert-scaled items from 1 to 6 best to worse) was asked on: 1. Organization and technique (2 items); 2. Learning content (4 items); 3. Didactics and supervision (5 items); 4. Learning success (3 items); 5. Overall ranking (1 item) and 6. Open comments on positive and negative aspects of the lessons as well as further proposals were collected additionally from the participating students (results displayed in Tables <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>)</p><p id="Par16">Furthermore, this analysis comprehends the evaluation of the surveys from eleven lecturers working in an ambulant oncological setting or distant to academic institutions (&#x0003e;&#x02009;30 km) participating in the same online teaching course. Lecturers were questioned on feasibility and technical aspects and on outcome of online lectures.</p><p id="Par17">After the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, a one-day clerkship on voluntary base was offered to medical students of the LMU-University. Fifteen students (12 female and three male) of the 6th and 7th semester applied for a full-day (8 am to 5 pm) clerkship. The students attended the one-day clerkship in small groups from 1 to a maximum of 3 students/day. Two medical students attended a four-week internship, and six students asked for a mentorship in oncology. Interprofessional clerkship was offered singularly across all functional units like therapy-room, hematological quick laboratory, ultrasound diagnostic and interview with patients and familiars during routine care.</p><p id="Par18">Adapted new evaluation surveys on the evasys online evaluation platform of the LMU were created and offered to those students participating in the voluntarily clerkship, asking about previous contact of the students to the field of oncology as well as their benefits from the one-day bedside teaching. Furthermore, learning objectives from the national catalog of learning objectives in medical school (Becker et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2020</xref>) were established prior to completing the course and their achievement was evaluated after the course.</p><p id="Par19">Finally, the outcome of the mentoring chosen by six students was evaluated.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Data analysis</title><p id="Par20">The data was collected and analyzed anonymously.

On request of faculty members of outpatient care centers and institutions at long distance this model was prolonged by virtue of being more effective and time/cost saving. At present, this model has been established, and it is now fully integrated in the curriculum.</p><p id="Par36">The current survey of this pilot project with focus on an outpatient primary cancer care setting on the online learning/ as well a voluntary one-day internship demonstrates its feasibility and reveals very positive feedback on content and didactic methodology. Furthermore, the students reported an improvement in knowledge regarding the learning objectives from NKLM 2.0 due to the one-day clerkship (Table <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). The results of the students&#x02019; evaluations show that this model is feasible despite social or geographical distancing restrictions and delivers high quality teaching, improves self-reported knowledge on ambulatory medicine and interprofessional care resulting in satisfaction and wellbeing of students and patients. Finally, this model creates the optimal frame for longitudinal mentoring of medical students and improves motivation and the ethical attitude towards subspecialties.</p><p id="Par37">Especially in the field of hematology/oncology there is a tremendous need for more specialists in the ambulatory setting nationwide as the number of patients as well as the variety, numbers and duration of new therapeutic agents are developing exponentially. On the other hand, after the pandemic there was a significant decrease in the percentage of young physicians choosing oncology as a specialty and of young oncologists changing their direction due to the high burden of stress and responsibility. Hence, this pilot project may suggest a model to integrate outpatient care teaching in several subspecialties in the near future.</p><p id="Par38">There are several advantages of an outpatient setting education: 1. the chance to widen the spectrum of teaching to more subspecialties rather than general medicine like hematology and oncology or other internal/surgical specialties, that, in the German health system, are practiced in the vast majority of patients in ambulatory setting; 2. The chance to improve motivation and education outcomes by smaller groups of students, more individualized and possibly longitudinal mentoring; 3. The chance to teach and learn in a high-efficient, independent, and familiar environment; 4. The chance to involve more academic staff working in outpatient setting improving the bridge of clinical care and research between academic and the real-world ambulatory institutions.</p><p id="Par39">Still, the development of programs for ambulatory training in today&#x000b4;s healthcare environment has many barriers and challenges: A comprehensive review of medical education literature identified both human and structural factors that may negatively influence academic goals in outpatient medical education (Oliveira Franco et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2019</xref>). The main barriers are related to educational environments and institutions e.g., lack of institutional support, conflicts between medical education and healthcare; outpatient and university curricula not being integrated; inadequate financial incentives for academic staff; but also, academic staff-related like lack of preparation or professional training and inadequate service model for students. Barriers are also patient-related like lack of suitable patients or failure to obtain consent or no-follow-up. Finally, a major concern for both students and teachers is the increasing number of students in internship groups (Oliveira Franco et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2019</xref>; DAM, LMU, MeCuM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2007</xref>).</p><p id="Par40">In Germany, integration of outpatient education in the curriculum is partly considered for general medicine as pointed in the &#x0201c;masterplan medical education 2020&#x0201d;; however, for a structured implementation&#x02014;in particular for subspecialties&#x02014;it is necessary to create a legislative framework for cooperation between medical faculties and outpatient healthcare systems (Becker et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2020</xref>).</p><p id="Par41">Limitations of our study include the use of non-validated questionnaires and no measurable feedback (evaluation forms) from patients and nurses. The response rate of 36.5% (102 out of 279 students) for the evaluations of online lessons, as well as the response rate of 66.6% (10 out of 15 students) for those students attending the one-day clerkship, indicates a representative sample of student feedback. However, it is important to acknowledge certain limitations when interpreting these results. The rather small sample size (especially regarding the non-online lessons), alongside the unicentric nature of the data collection, restricts the generalizability of the findings. These factors suggest that the conclusions drawn from this study should be viewed with caution, particularly when considering their applicability to a broader, more diverse cohort of medical students or institutions. Nevertheless, this study serves as a pilot project aimed at exploring the integration of outpatient oncology teaching into the medical curriculum. Given the preliminary nature of this work, further research involving larger and more diverse samples, as well as multicentric data collection, is essential to validate our findings.</p><sec id="Sec11"><title>Perspectives</title><p id="Par42">Because enhancing ambulatory education has high priority in graduate medical education, we promote the continuation and expansion of this model upon licensing regulations and support by academic institutions. In the upcoming semesters, the teaching by outpatient oncologists is planned to be further developed and systematically monitored as a process and chance for future medical education in Germany.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.<supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM1"><media xlink:href="432_2025_6198_MOESM1_ESM.docx"><caption><p>Supplementary file1 (DOCX 17 KB)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher's Note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><p>VM conceptualized the study and supervised the project with MRF.
