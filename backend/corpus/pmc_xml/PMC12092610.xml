While inflammation remains the main presentation in those with canonical <italic>UBA1</italic> mutations, there is variability in the organs involved, glucocorticoid requirements, response to biologic therapies, as well as overall disease course among patients. Besides genotype-phenotype associations based on residual cytoplasmic UBA1b isoform<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, there is little explanation for variable penetrance and target organ involvement in VEXAS.

Although both neutrophils and monocytes harbor <italic>UBA1</italic> mutations, in the marrow, there is a differentiation bias towards neutrophils over monocytes with increased expression in the&#x000a0;<italic>CEBPA</italic> master transcription factor and decreased expression in <italic>IRF8</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>; with notable monocytopenia in 30% of patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Consistent with a previous report<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, in PB, DCs were severely decreased, and monocytes, despite of a&#x000a0;pro-inflammatory transcriptional profile with upregulation of multiple immune response pathways, were dysfunctional. Monocytes from VEXAS patients had a distinct but overlapping transcriptional signature with severe sepsis and other autoimmune diseases; HLA class II genes were downregulated while alarmin-related S100A genes were upregulated. Most of the patients in the scRNA-seq cohort were in the&#x000a0;late phase of their disease (median time from symptom onset was 7.1 [range, from 1.9 to 10.1] years), and prolonged inflammation itself may have diminished the capacity of VEXAS monocytes to release proinflammatory cytokines in response to additional exposure to stimuli, despite intrinsically upregulated immune response pathways. Despite dysfunctional features, monocytes were highly interactive with other immune cells, as inferred computationally from ligand-receptor interactions.</p><p id="Par30">Efferocytosis was blunted in monocytes from patients, irrespective of <italic>UBA1</italic> mutation status. Efferocytosis is critical for tissue homeostasis, and defective efferocytosis results in the accumulation of apoptotic cells, secondary necrosis, and release of pro-inflammatory cellular contents such as damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMP)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Inadequate efferocytosis may be another pathogenic contributor to inflammation in VEXAS. Quantitative and qualitative defects in monocytes may also explain the increased risk of opportunistic serious infections by intracellular pathogens, such as atypical mycobacterial infections and legionellosis, in VEXAS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par31">In contrast to monocytes, <italic>UBA1</italic> mutations directly impacted the transcriptional profile of a subset of NK cells.

As previously shown in BM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in PB of VEXAS were clonally expanded with upregulated IFN-&#x003b3; and cytotoxicity pathways. Within the B cell compartment, there was a striking increase in clonal plasmablasts even in patients with severe B cell lymphopenia; expanded clones displayed high SHM. Autoantibodies produced by these SHM cells have been associated with development of some autoimmune diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. An increased ratio of plasmablasts to total B cells in PB occurs in ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV) and SLE, accompanied by elevated levels of autoantibodies such as anti-dsDNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>.

Since plasmablasts are short-lived and antibody-secreting B cells mature into plasma cells, clonal expansion of these cells may also account for monoclonal gammopathy that is found in 1/3 of VEXAS patients.</p><p id="Par34">Another feature of the B cell compartment in VEXAS was the depletion of transitional B cells, which are thought to represent a link between immature and mature B cells in the marrow and the periphery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. As <italic>UBA1</italic> mutations are absent in mature B cells but present in most lymphoid progenitor cells in BM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, mt<italic>UBA1</italic> B cells appear to be negatively selected during transitional B cell maturation in BM, producing a deficit of terminal cells. Transitional B cells, phenotypically and functionally related to IL-10-producing regulatory B cells, play regulatory roles under inflammatory conditions, and their loss may also contribute to the uncontrolled autoinflammation in VEXAS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par35">Immune dysregulation irrespective of <italic>UBA1</italic> mutations was observed in lymphocytic cells that are often decreased in PB of VEXAS patients; we observed upregulation of the&#x000a0;apoptosis and TNF response pathways in PB cells. As reported for the cytotoxicity of upregulated UPR pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, effects of TNF are highly cell-type dependent; HSCs are resistant to TNF cytotoxicity, but TNF induces apoptosis in committed progenitor and mature cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. In VEXAS, these immune compartments might be subjected to apoptosis due to chronic overactivation of the&#x000a0;TNF response pathway.

The immunological networks by connectome analysis depicted abundant cellular interactions among innate and adaptive immune cells. These data cross-validate findings from other approaches and highlight the scope of VEXAS hyper-immunity; they are relevant for therapeutic approaches in VEXAS, and explain failures of targeted agents such as TNF and IL-1 blockade<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>.

First, all VEXAS patients were treated with corticosteroids, with some other agents to control severe autoinflammation; such therapies could affect responses and cytotoxicity in immune cell samples.

In addition, GoT analysis allowed us to compare mt<italic>UBA1</italic> and wt<italic>UBA1</italic> cells, which were equally subjected to anti-inflammatory drugs. Second, neutrophils could not be investigated due to the low number of cells captured in our scRNA-seq experiments. scRNA-seq analysis of neutrophils is needed for better understanding of the VEXAS pathophysiology. Third, female VEXAS patients are extremely rare, limited to individuals who have monosomy X<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>, there is obvious sex bias.</p><p id="Par38">In summary, systemic inflammation in VEXAS is driven by innate and adaptive immune dysregulation irrespective of <italic>UBA1</italic> mutations.

Subsequently, cellranger built a De Bruijn graph of reads independently, resulting in de novo assembly for each barcode.

It is most often used in economics to measure a country&#x02019;s wealth distribution and has been widely used in the diversity assessment of TCRs. The Gini index and Shannon entropy for diversity and clonality analyses were calculated with the R package of tCR (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://imminfo.github.io/tcr/">https://imminfo.github.io/tcr/</ext-link>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec30"><title>Identification of TCR motifs with shared antigen specificity using GLIPH2</title><p id="Par70">GLIPH2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> was applied to T cells of VEXAS patients and healthy donors to identify clusters of TCRs that recognize the same epitope based on CDR3&#x003b2; amino acid sequence similarities, with default parameters.

Specifically, the output files filtered_contig.fasta and filtered_contig_annotations.csv from cellrangerVDJ were input into AssignGenes.py and MakeDb.py to create a tab-delimited database file to store sequence alignment information. Then, the number of somatic mutations for each sequence was calculated using observedMutations (Shazam v1.1.0). The mutation rate was categorized into four groups: germline (mutation frequency = 0), low (0 &#x0003c;&#x000a0;mutation frequency &#x02264;&#x000a0;3 %), and high (mutation frequency &#x0003e;&#x000a0;3%).
