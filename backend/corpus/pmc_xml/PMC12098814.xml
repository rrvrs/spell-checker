The treatment of uterine fibroids is well-established, with standard treatment guidelines in place; however, there remains a lack of consensus on a standardized approach for cervical fibroids.</p><p>A small prolapsing fibroid polyp may be removed vaginally, and a hysteroscope can be used in such cases to identify and ligate the pedicle. However, large cervical fibroids present&#x000a0;a surgical challenge. Myomectomy is the cornerstone for the surgical management of cervical fibroids in women who wish to preserve their uterus. An enlarged cervix alters the anatomy of adjacent vital structures like the ureters, bladder, rectum, and uterine vessels, increasing the risk of injury to these structures. Due to the narrow operating field and the potential for injury, preoperative catheterization of the ureters through double-J (DJ) stenting is performed to delineate their course prior to surgery.&#x000a0;Here, we report a series of cases in which intracervical fibroids, visible vaginally as a cervical protuberance, were enucleated vaginally using Bonney's principles. The base of the fibroid was clamped and ligated, followed by obliteration of the space and reconstruction of the cervix. Injection of vasopressin was unavailable in our resource-limited hospital; therefore, adrenaline was injected in a 1:200,000 dilution into the fibroid capsule intraoperatively to minimize blood loss. This method of enucleation minimizes the risk of injury to adjacent organs since the dissection occurs intracapsularly. Preoperative prophylactic DJ stenting was also not needed.</p><p>Despite the lack of advanced medical options to reduce fibroid size and vascularity, such as preoperative gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues and uterine artery embolization, in our low-resource setting, our technique of vaginal myomectomy effectively managed the challenges presented by large intracervical fibroids while preserving fertility. The only limitation was that fibroids that were not palpable through the cervical lips could not be enucleated using this approach.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>bonney&#x02019;s principles</kwd><kwd>cervical fibroid</kwd><kwd>leiomyomas</kwd><kwd>myomas</kwd><kwd>vaginal myomectomy</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Uterine fibroids (myomas or leiomyomas) are the most common benign tumours in women of reproductive age, affecting 70% of women globally [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].&#x000a0;Of the total cases of fibroids, only less than 0.6% are cervical fibroids [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The majority of female patients undergoing surgery for&#x000a0;symptomatic fibroids are between 31 and 50 years of age [<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].&#x000a0;Fibroids develop from smooth muscle fibres with concentric spiral patterns and fibrous connective tissue, which tends to be anchored to the myometrium by fibromuscular bridges forming a pseudocapsule [<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Fibroids are mostly asymptomatic, but they are also a significant source of clinical morbidity [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].&#x000a0;Symptomatic fibroids have a clinical presentation of abnormal uterine bleeding, pressure symptoms, pain, infertility, and obstetric complications [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Pressure effects on the bladder or urethra and dystocia are caused by cervical fibroid&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>Fibroid is an oestrogen and progesterone-dependent tumour; therefore, it is rare before menarche and its growth regresses after menopause [<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Various risk factors for fibroids include early menarche, late menopause, nulliparity, family history of uterine fibroids, and high body mass index (BMI) [<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Despite&#x000a0;the introduction of new&#x000a0;nonsurgical treatment techniques like uterine artery embolization and myomectomy,&#x000a0;hysterectomy remains the mainstay for the treatment of fibroids. A conservative surgical&#x000a0;approach, such as vaginal myomectomy or laparoscopic myomectomy, is an excellent option for patients who desire to preserve their fertility [<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Cervical myomas are divided into two types, namely subserosal&#x000a0;(extracervical type: anterior, posterior, or lateral) and submucosal (intracervical type), which&#x000a0;occur within the cervix [<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Depending on their position, cervical fibroids can be anterior, posterior, central, or lateral. The cervix is surrounded by important pelvic structures, such as the ureters, urinary bladder, and rectum, which are at&#x000a0;a high risk of injury as their anatomy may be altered by ballooning of the cervix due to the presence of the fibroid. Significant haemorrhage can occur if the nearby uterine arteries are injured. A narrow operative field and difficult repair of the big cavity render the procedure technically challenging. There is, at present, no consensus on the ideal surgical approach for intracervical fibroids.</p><p>In this case series, we share our experience of a novel technique of vaginal myomectomy of large&#x000a0;intracervical leiomyomas extending into the body of the uterus in&#x000a0;young women desirous of preserving their fertility.&#x000a0;</p></sec><sec sec-type="cases"><title>Case presentation</title><p>In this case series, we have included five cases of women with large intracervical fibroids&#x000a0;desirous to preserve their uterus who underwent successful vaginal myomectomy at Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar Medical College and Hospital, New Delhi, India. All&#x000a0;five cases were done under spinal anaesthesia. The patients were informed of the advantages and risks involved, following which written informed consent was obtained. The patients whose fibroid was accessible from the cervical lip were taken for this study.</p><p>Case 1</p><p>A P1L1&#x000a0;(para 1, living 1)&#x000a0;woman, 35 years old, having a previous normal delivery, presented to our hospital with a history of polymenorrhagia. She did not have any pressure symptoms. The abdomen&#x000a0;was soft&#x000a0;and non-tender, and no abdomino-pelvic mass was felt. On per speculum examination, the anterior lip of the cervix appeared bulky. The posterior lip of the cervix was thin and spread over the mass. On bimanual pelvic examination, an 8 x 7 cm mass was felt in the anterior cervix&#x000a0;extending upwards into the body of the uterus. The upper margin could not be felt. Ultrasonography revealed the uterus was anteverted with 7.5 mm endometrial thickness. A well-defined heteroechoic lesion that measured 6.7 x&#x000a0;7.4 x 7.2 cm (around 180 cc) in the lower uterine body and cervix was noted, likely suggestive of a fibroid, as shown in&#x000a0;Figure <xref rid="FIG1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.</p><fig position="anchor" fig-type="figure" id="FIG1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Ultrasound image showed a well-defined heteroechoic lesion measuring 6.7 x 7.4 x 7.2 cm (around 180 cc) in the lower uterine body and cervix, likely suggestive of a large cervical fibroid</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="cureus-0017-00000082788-i01" position="float"/></fig><p>CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast&#x000a0;revealed a large fibroid in the left lateral wall extending till the cervical region of the uterus, measuring 8.4 x&#x000a0;7.3 cm, with bilateral polycystic ovaries, as shown in&#x000a0;Figure <xref rid="FIG2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>.</p><fig position="anchor" fig-type="figure" id="FIG2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>CT of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast&#x000a0;revealed a cervical fibroid in the left lateral wall extending till the cervical region of the uterus, measuring 8.4 x 7.3 cm</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="cureus-0017-00000082788-i02" position="float"/></fig><p>Operative Steps</p><p>The patient consent was taken for vaginal myomectomy.

A transverse incision was given over the fibroid anteriorly, as shown in Figure <xref rid="FIG4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>. The fibroid was held with a myoma screw (Figure <xref rid="FIG5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). After ascertaining the right plane of cleavage, the fibroid was enucleated with blunt and sharp dissection (Figure <xref rid="FIG6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). The tumour was gradually enucleated down to its base by using the fingers through the plane of cleavage.

In our cases, the diagnosis was established by integrating ultrasonography with MRI or CT. Cervical fibroids are rare; thus, their management can be&#x000a0;challenging. The choice of treatment is crucial for preserving fertility in women of reproductive age. To improve reproductive outcomes and address bleeding episodes, surgical intervention is often necessary.</p><p>Cervical fibroids present&#x000a0;a surgical challenge for the gynaecologist due to their proximity to vital&#x000a0;structures such as the ureters, bladder, rectum, and uterine arteries [<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The ballooning of the cervix due to cervical fibroids alters the anatomical relations of these structures, increasing their risk of injury. A proper preoperative workup, a thorough knowledge of anatomy, and careful dissection of the bladder and ureters are required, as the anatomy is often distorted. Cervical fibroids are&#x000a0;related to the bladder anteriorly, bilateral ureters laterally, and&#x000a0;rectum posteriorly, making surgery quite difficult.</p><p>The treatment of choice for cervical fibroids is myomectomy or hysterectomy [<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Myomectomy is the procedure of choice for cervical fibroids in women who desire to preserve their fertility [<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. A small prolapsing fibroid with a stalk protruding from&#x000a0;the cervix can be removed via hysteroscopy using hysteroscopic scissors, a resectoscope, or a bipolar electrode [<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Hysteroscopy allows for visual inspection of other cervical and endometrial polyps [<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. However, for&#x000a0;large intracervical fibroids, management through open, laparoscopic, and even newer robotic approaches is challenging. There are no guidelines on the optimum surgical route, and treatment is tailored based on the patient's age, desire for fertility preservation, and the number, location, and size of the fibroids.</p><p>Laparotomic myomectomy has been described in a few earlier case reports [<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, the narrow operative field, even in open laparotomy, as well as the proximity to the ureters and bladder, make the procedure difficult. Preoperative ureteric catheterization is performed in most cases to delineate the altered course of the ureters and avoid&#x000a0;injury. The increased postoperative morbidity due to abdominal scar and the higher risk of adhesion formation are other disadvantages of laparotomic myomectomy. Though laparoscopic myomectomy for large cervical fibroids has been attempted,&#x000a0;the use of power morcellator has recently been limited by the US&#x000a0;Food and Drug Administration (FDA), due to their risk of upstaging unsuspected uterine sarcomas, to only appropriately selected women, that too using a tissue containment system [<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>A robotic approach to cervical myomectomy has recently been described, though it remains an abdominal approach [<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The vaginal approach for uterine leiomyoma excision using colpotomy has also been documented&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Liu et al.&#x000a0;described vaginal natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (vNOTES) for myomectomy, where a 6 cm uterine leiomyoma was resected transvaginally through an anterior colpotomy [<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, these myomectomies were done for uterine rather than&#x000a0;cervical fibroids.</p><p>While medical options do not provide permanent treatment for fibroids, the use of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues preoperatively can effectively reduce fibroid size and intraoperative bleeding [<xref rid="REF14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Utilizing&#x000a0;GnRH analogues for three to four months before fibroid surgery reduces both uterine volume and fibroid size [<xref rid="REF14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. However, in our&#x000a0;resource-constrained setting, GnRH analogues were not used for any of our patients.</p><p>In our institution, over five years, we have operated on a series of women with large intracervical fibroids, some extending to the body of the uterus or laterally to the broad ligament. All the women were younger than 40 years, where the incidence of leiomyosarcoma is lower, and the patients desired to&#x000a0;preserve their uterus. The intraoperative injection of diluted vasopressin into the fibroid can reduce&#x000a0;blood loss [<xref rid="REF15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The injection of vasopressin into the fibroid capsule intraoperatively serves as an effective haemostatic measure, especially since tourniquet application is not possible [<xref rid="REF15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. We used adrenaline in a 1:200,000 dilution, which was injected into the fibroid capsule for haemostasis, as vasopressin&#x000a0;was not available due to resource constraints.&#x000a0;Bilateral uterine artery embolization at its origin from the internal iliac artery has been employed in certain cases to reduce blood loss&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. However, its use in women desiring future childbirth&#x000a0;remains controversial. Moreover, being a low-resource setting, the facility was not available at our institution. The shelling out of the myoma was done following Bonney&#x02019;s principles diligently; that is, a transverse incision was made along its prominent proximal portion to ascertain&#x000a0;the plane of cleavage between the tumour and its capsule. The most challenging aspect of cervical myomectomy is suturing the base after enucleation. Traction on the leiomyoma with the myoma screw helped us reach the base of the fibroid, which was then clamped.&#x000a0;In our case, prophylactic double-J (DJ) stenting was not required as the risk of ureteric injury was negligible with the vaginal approach, since the entire process was intracapsular.&#x000a0;</p><p>Overall, the experience was quite satisfying, as all cases were approached&#x000a0;with the understanding&#x000a0;that due to the difficulty of accessing such lesions both vaginally and abdominally, we were skeptical about the outcomes and complications. However, all myomectomy cases were completed vaginally without any complications.</p><p>The drawback of this study is that it necessitated the expertise of an experienced vaginal surgeon. Additionally, cervical fibroids that were&#x000a0;not palpable vaginally&#x000a0;could not be removed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The management of cervical fibroids is challenging, and there is no consensus on the best surgical approach. A narrow operative field,&#x000a0;proximity to the ureters, urinary bladder, and rectum, and consequently their risk of injury, and the risk of haemorrhage due to uterine artery injury, complicates the surgery even with an open laparotomy approach. Our case series demonstrates that vaginal myomectomy of a large intracervical fibroid, when performed by skilled hands, is safe with minimal risk of injury to adjacent organs as the dissection is performed within the capsule of the fibroid. This approach is ideal for women desiring fertility. Unlike open myomectomy, it requires no skin incision and has a minimal risk of postoperative adhesions. The only drawback is that it can only be used when the fibroid is palpable through the cervical lips.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group content-type="conflict"><title>Disclosures</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Human subjects:</bold> Consent for treatment and open access publication was obtained or waived by all participants in this study.</p><p><bold>Conflicts of interest:</bold> In compliance with the ICMJE uniform disclosure form, all authors declare the following:</p><p><bold>Payment/services info:</bold> All authors have declared that no financial support was received from any organization for the submitted work.</p><p><bold>Financial relationships:</bold> All authors have declared that they have no financial relationships at present or within the previous three years with any organizations that might have an interest in the submitted work.</p><p><bold>Other relationships:</bold> All authors have declared that there are no other relationships or activities that could appear to have influenced the submitted work.</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="other"><title>Author Contributions</title><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Concept and design:</bold>&#x000a0; Neha Agrawal, Neeru Malik, Meenakshi Sidhar, Sandhya Jain, Nikita Madan</p><p><bold>Acquisition, analysis, or interpretation of data:</bold>&#x000a0; Neha Agrawal, Neeru Malik, Meenakshi Sidhar, Sandhya Jain, Nikita Madan</p><p><bold>Drafting of the manuscript:</bold>&#x000a0; Neha Agrawal, Neeru Malik, Meenakshi Sidhar, Sandhya Jain, Nikita Madan</p><p><bold>Critical review of the manuscript for important intellectual content:</bold>&#x000a0; Neha Agrawal, Neeru Malik, Meenakshi Sidhar, Sandhya Jain, Nikita Madan</p><p><bold>Supervision:</bold>&#x000a0; Neeru Malik, Sandhya Jain</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="REF1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><article-title>Comprehensive review of uterine fibroids: developmental origin, pathogenesis, and treatment</article-title><source>Endocr Rev</source><person-group>
