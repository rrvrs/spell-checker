Various global immunization programs have nearly/completely eradicated many grievous and potentially deadly diseases. With herd immunity, immunocompromised/allergic individuals have also gained substantial protection against all vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs). This impact has helped relieve the stress on families by providing greater confidence in children participating in childcare, school, and other activities, ultimately contributing to the rise of the economy. Thus, immunization has been a global health success story, saving millions of lives annually [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p id="Par18">Vaccines undergo multiple trials in phases per standard protocols and are issued a license only after rigorous testing, establishing their efficacy and safety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Sometimes, they cause mild, predicted side effects (such as local reactions, pain, irritability and fever) that do not last long. Very rarely, they cause an exaggerated allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) within minutes. Unfortunately, too often, we come across people who suffer from illness/disability caused by diseases or families who mourn the devastating loss of a loved one from a condition that could have been prevented through vaccines.</p><p id="Par19">The World Health Organization (WHO) has listed vaccine hesitancy as one of the greatest threats to global health. The Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE), charged with advising the WHO on immunization, defines vaccine hesitancy as &#x0201c;the delay in acceptance or refusal of vaccines despite availability of vaccination services&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Vaccine hesitancy is complex and context specific, varying across time, place and vaccine. It includes factors such as complacency, convenience and confidence.&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] Even though the country's vaccination rate is high (93.5% for FY 2023&#x02013;24), vaccine hesitancy among parents&#x02014;especially regarding newborn vaccinations&#x02014;remains a problem in India, where studies show a frequency of approximately 21.1%. (Update on Immunization of Children, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par20">An increasing number of strategies are being proposed to encourage parents to accept vaccines. One tactic is to use messaging that is specific to a person's position on the vaccination hesitancy spectrum. For example, asking permission to talk about vaccines should be the first step in a conversation with a parent who has previously denied them. This should be followed by enabling the parent's particular concerns to be explored and asking what would spur a change in stance. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] Also the study&#x02019;s findings by Slam T et al., showed that the primary significant predictors of full vaccination coverage are maternal health care services, child size at birth, household wealth status, and maternal educational attainment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par21">In this study, we aimed to assess the effectiveness of a health education bundle, SuBaDRa, a multicomponent tool that we meticulously tailored to include both in-person and telephone motivational methods to overcome vaccine hesitancy in mothers.

The primary outcome measures were the vaccine delay of infants at 6, 10 and 14&#x000a0;weeks and nine months of age. The secondary measure was the attitudes of mothers regarding immunization after the intervention.

It is better to avoid coaxing vaccination sceptics since attempts can sometimes backfire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p id="Par42">Immunization is the primary health care provider&#x02019;s best investment money. The steps required by the government to maintain high uptake of vaccines include minimizing personal and structural barriers such as transport and money, using tailored communication strategies and recruiting health professionals for vaccine education [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p><p id="Par43">A similar study revealed that motivational interviewing during the postpartum period increased vaccine acceptance. Another randomized control trial demonstrated that stepwise education beginning at the prenatal period until one month postpartum improved immunization schedule adherence.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Limitations</title><p id="Par44">Our study aimed to assess the effectiveness of a health education tool, SuBaDRa, in dealing with vaccine acceptors, refusers and those who are hesitant. Although this was a successful intervention, several limitations exist. Initiation of intervention during the antenatal period or earlier would help target this category since most mothers start evaluating the pros and cons of immunization even before they bear the baby or during pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Most mothers delivering babies at home usually follow primitive traditional practices (including vaccine refusal). Hence, generalizing a community&#x02019;s status on the basis of the response from booked cases will be erroneous. Since our study was based in a government hospital, most of the study population belonged to the lower socioeconomic class. While hesitancy exists in all population strata, it is often associated with highly educated parents, making it another drawback of this study therefore future studies to be done including more samples from different socioeconomic backgrounds. Despite the flaws mentioned above, the results were still effective. Using public health interventions with a global perspective to target subjects is thus rewarding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Such a significant decrease in vaccine refusal also assures us about other vaccines through childhood and adolescence.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par45">Health education bundle SuBaDRa, a multidimensional tool to overcome vaccine hesitancy, is the first to demonstrate the effect of stepwise in-person and telephone motivational methods along with reinforcement, with variants in each category and represent one of the most reassuring approaches to vaccine promotion strategies. In addition to the increase in VA, mothers&#x02019; knowledge and attitudes toward immunization have significantly improved.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>VA</term><def><p id="Par9">Vaccine acceptance</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VH</term><def><p id="Par10">Vaccine hesitancy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VPDs</term><def><p id="Par11">Vaccine-preventable diseases</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WHO</term><def><p id="Par12">World health organization</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SAGE</term><def><p id="Par13">Strategic advisory group of experts</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NIS</term><def><p id="Par14">National immunization schedule</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SIDS</term><def><p id="Par15">Sudden infant death syndrome</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ASHA</term><def><p id="Par16">Accredited social health activist</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher's Note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Not applicable.</p></ack><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><p>Study concept and design:MB,KNB,ANP; Data analysis and/or interpretation: MB,KNB,ANP; Drafting article: MB,KNB,ANB,RSR; All the authors reviewed the manuscript.</p></notes><notes notes-type="funding-information"><title>Funding</title><p>Open access funding provided by Manipal Academy of Higher Education, Manipal.</p></notes><notes notes-type="data-availability"><title>Availability of data and materials</title><p>The datasets used and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.</p></notes><notes><title>Declarations</title><notes id="FPar1"><title>Ethics approval and consent to participate</title><p id="Par46">The trial was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki after approval from the institutional ethics committee. registered in <italic>the</italic> Clinical Trials Registry &#x02013; India (CTRI) with the registration number (CTRI/2021/08/035749).
