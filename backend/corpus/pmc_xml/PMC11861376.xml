Furthermore, it affects approximatively 15% of tunisian couples. However, previous studies have primarily assessed the psychological impact on women, leaving a gap in understanding gender differences.</p></sec><sec id="sec1273"><title>Objectives</title><p>Our study aims to compare the psychological impact of infertility between genders in a Tunisian sample.</p></sec><sec id="sec1274"><title>Methods</title><p>We conducted a cross-sectional study in a public hospital specializing in Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) from August 30th to December 1st, 2022, involving sexually active infertile couples who had been under observation for at least one year. The participants provided information related to socio-demographic data. Additionally, we used the Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS) to assess anxiety and depression, and the Fertility Quality of Life (FertiQol) questionnaire to evaluate the quality of life. These questionnaires were administered in the Tunisian dialect.</p></sec><sec id="sec1275"><title>Results</title><p>A sample of 60 infertile couples were recruited to this study. Primary infertility was present in 97% of cases and male infertility was the most common cause, accounting for 35%. Our findings revealed that women experienced higher rates of depression (35%) and anxiety (52%) compared to men (15% and 28%), with a statistically significant difference (p &#x02264; 0.001).</p><p>Furthermore, women reported a significantly compromised overall quality of life, particularly in the context of treatment-related aspects (p=0.03).</p><p>Notably, anxiety was identified as a significant risk factor for reduced quality of life among women (B = -5.27). In contrast, lower socioeconomic status was associated with diminished overall quality of life in men (B = -7.09).</p></sec><sec id="sec1276"><title>Conclusions</title><p>It is important to consider gender differences in the management of infertility in order to guide and target psychological interventions and to improve the quality of life of infertile couples.</p></sec><sec id="sec1277"><title>Disclosure of Interest</title><p>None Declared</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="2"/></counts></article-meta></front></article>
