Though fulfilling the Berlin definition, CARDS differs from ARDS of other pathophysiology. Patients suffering from CARDS often show signs of severe hypoxia requiring mechanical ventilation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Mortality of CARDS remains high and ventilator-associated lung injury (VILI) might be a major contributor.</p><p id="Par6">Airway pressure release ventilation (APRV) has been used as a &#x0201c;rescue mode&#x0201d; of ventilation in managing patients with ARDS of other origin in the past to improve oxygenation and to keep the lung open (open lung concept) more consistently and more homogeneously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. APRV and other modes of biphasic positive airway pressure (BIPAP) represent a pressure targeted intermittent mandatory ventilation ranging biphasically between an upper and lower pressure level. But in contrast to BIPAP, APRV delivers continuous positive pressure (P<sub>high</sub>) for a preset of prolonged inspiratory time (T<sub>high</sub>) with intermittent releases to a lower pressure level (P<sub>low</sub>) at a preset of a shortened expiratory time (T<sub>low</sub>). This shortened expiratory time in APRV is supposed to create an intrinsic PEEP which ideally avoids cyclic derecruitment and reduces cyclical opening and collapse of lungs. But unfortunately, in APRV intrinsic PEEP and driving pressure can be difficult to measure and may be unreliable predictors of atelectasis.</p><p id="Par7">Moreover, as prolonged inspiratory times resulting in increased mean airway pressures, are characteristic for APRV, this mode is supposed to establish alveolar recruitment, improvement of lung compliance and optimization of ventilation in relation to alveolar perfusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Vice versa, other studies highlight the potential risk of baro- or volutrauma in APRV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. This might especially be problematic in CARDS, a typically heterogenous lung disease.</p><p id="Par8">Unfortunately, conventional ventilator monitoring is an insufficient detector for the risk of VILI. Transpulmonary pressure (TPP) could be a useful tool to detect an increased risk for baro-, volu- and atelectrauma in mechanically ventilated patients. So far, there is little knowledge about the risk of VILI in APRV vs. BIPAP in CARDS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Therefore, this study aimed to assess whether there are differences regarding the risk of volu-, baro- and atelectrauma in patients suffering from CARDS comparing ventilation in APRV- vs. BIPAP- mode by monitoring endinspiratory and endexpiratory TPP.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Setting</title><p id="Par9">After ethical review board approval (21-1553-retro), this observational single center study retrospectively analyzed patients admitted to a surgical German 14-bed ICU between March 2020 to October 2021. The study hospital was a quaternal, referral and teaching hospital with approximately 3500 admissions to Intensive Care Medicine per year. During the COVID pandemic one 14-bed subunit of the ICU focused on the treatment of patients with respiratory failure due to CARDS.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study design</title><p id="Par10">We retrospectively screened 139 ventilated COVID-19 subjects for the fulfillment of the following inclusion criteria: All adult (&#x02265;&#x02009;18 years) SARS-CoV-2 positive subjects suffering from CARDS (ARDS as per Berlin classification), who were admitted to the Intensive Care Unit between March 2020 and October 2021, who were ventilated in BIPAP- mode initially and who consecutively had a trial of APRV for refractory hypoxemia were included in this study. Furthermore, all subjects involved in this study were monitored with TPP as per clinical standard for ARDS patients and as per clinical decision of the treating physician. APRV was chosen in all subjects as a &#x0201c;rescue mode&#x0201d; of ventilation to improve oxygenation in refractory hypoxemia by decision of the treating clinician. Patients without ARDS not requiring intubation, patients who did not have a trial of ventilation in BIPAP- and APRV- mode and patients without TPP monitoring were excluded from the study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Ventilator settings</title><p id="Par11">All subjects were ventilated with Hamilton C6 ventilators (Hamilton Medical AG, Bonaduz Swiss) which have an auxiliary port for monitoring esophageal and transpulmonary pressure via a separate pressure line. Initial ventilator mode after intubation for all subjects was BIPAP- mode (DUOPAP, Hamilton Medical AG, Bonaduz Swiss) as per hospital standard. BIPAP was used as a pressure regulated mode allowing asynchronous spontaneous breathing but without pressure assist. Initial ventilator settings were chosen as per ARDSnetwork recommendations for lung protective ventilation as per hospital protocol: Tidal volume of &#x02264;&#x02009;6&#x000a0;ml / kg predicted body weight (PBW), Plateau pressure&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;30mbar, Driving pressure&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;16mbar, PEEP as defined by ARDSnet table and permissive hypercapnia (if pH&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;7.2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In case of transfer to APRV to improve oxygenation, this mode was set according to initial BIPAP- settings with P<sub>high</sub> &#x0003c;30mbar (aiming for the same plateau pressure as in BIPAP / DUOPAP- mode), P<sub>low</sub> &#x02264;5mbar and the T<sub>high</sub> at 5&#x000a0;s. As per hospital protocol T<sub>low</sub> was initiated at 0.5&#x000a0;s. Then the expiratory flow waveform was assessed and T<sub>low</sub> adjusted accordingly to achieve expiratory flow termination at 75% of peak expiratory flow. This setting of T<sub>low</sub> avoids emptying of the lung, creating an endexpiratory pressure (extrinsic PEEP plus intrinsic PEEP) counteracting lung derecruitment. In both ventilation modes pressure support ventilation (PSV) was removed as per hospital standard to avoid hyperinflation on the upper pressure level by additional spontaneous breaths. In both BIPAP and APRV automated tube compensation was applied in all patients. All subjects with CARDS were deeply sedated (Glasgow Coma scale Score (GCS) 3 and Richmond Agitation and Sedation Scale Score (RASS) -5)) or even paralyzed to avoid spontaneous ventilation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Transpulmonary pressure monitoring</title><p id="Par12">TPP- monitoring was initiated in subjects suffering from CARDS as per decision of the treating physician to optimize ventilator settings (plateau pressure, PEEP, tidal volume): In case of an endexpiratory TPP&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0mbar PEEP was increased (targeting an endexpiratory TPP of 0-10mbar) whereas in case of an endinspiratory TPP&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;20-25mbar plateau pressure or tidal volume was reduced (as per hospital protocol) to target an endinspiratory TPP&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;20mbar. TPP was always measured before and after a change of the ventilation mode or ventilator settings, in case of patient deterioration and as per the treating physician&#x000b4;s request. TPP was monitored using esophageal pressure as a surrogate for pleural pressure with a special nasogastric tube (NGT) (Nutrivent&#x02122;, L&#x000f6;wenstein Medical) with an inflatable esophageal balloon. This NGT was positioned like a regular nasogastric tube after exclusion of contraindications. TPP was consecutively calculated by the difference of plateau pressure in inspiratory hold (representing alveolar pressure) and esophageal pressure. For the description of the correct positioning of the NGT Nutrivent&#x02122; tube and the explanation of the derived parameters (endinspiratory TPP, endexpoiratory TPP, elastance- derived TPP) please see the summary in the supplement (text <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Comparison of APRV- and BIPAP- mode</title><p id="Par13">All subjects included in this study were ventilated in BIPAP in supine position initially with settings according to the ARDSnet recommendations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Patients with refractory hypoxemia in BIPAP- mode had a trial in APRV in supine position at the discretion of the intensive care consultant, according to the local practice. In this analysis, esophageal pressure, TPP, ventilator settings and pressures, arterial blood gas (ABG)-results (PaO<sub>2</sub>, PaCO<sub>2</sub>), sedation requirements, grade of sedation (GCS- and RASS- Score) and hemodynamic parameters (heart rate, systolic, mean and diastolic blood pressure, dosage of vasopressor support) were assessed in BIPAP and APRV. To increase the monitored timeframe in both ventilator modes, the mean / median values of the three last measurements of these parameters in BIPAP were compared to the respective values of the first three measurements in APRV. Intervals between the timepoints of the individual measurements were 1&#x02013;2&#x000a0;h apart.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Data management and collection</title><p id="Par14">Demographic data, illness severity scores (Sequential Organ failure assessment Score (SOFA) and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE III)- Score), variant of SARS-CoV-2, comorbidities, comedications, results from biochemistry and ABGs were retrieved from the patients&#x02019; electronic and paper chart.

But these recommendations are not applicable for APRV- mode. Lung protective settings in APRV have been described using the time- controlled adaptive ventilation (TCAV) method. In APRV, lung protective ventilation should not aim for a specific intrinsic PEEP or target certain tidal volumes. Instead, the goal is to minimize dynamic alveolar strain by adjusting ventilation to the individual lung&#x000b4;s mechanical characteristics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Unfortunately, so far, there is no clear definitions for APRV- settings and this circumstance impedes direct comparison of different studies. There is limited evidence of animal or human studies to support the titration of tidal volumes per kg of predicted body weight in APRV and lung protective ventilation in APRV should not target specific tidal volumes per predicted body weight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Despite the lack of clear recommendations regarding the setting of APRV- mode, some previous studies claimed a benefit of using APRV for recruitment of alveoli in cases of ARDS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], where conventional modes of mechanical ventilation failed to improve gas exchange [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Several animal studies could show an improvement of oxygenation in APRV by increasing ventilation in the dependent areas of the lung [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Regarding human studies analyzing ARDS patients, APRV showed to improve PaO2/FiO2 ratio and was able to reduce FiO2 requirements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. A meta- analysis by Carsetti et al. was able to reveal a reduction of ventilator- free days at day 28 in APRV- mode compared to conventional ventilator modes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Regarding the impact of APRV- mode on mortality of ARDS patients there is inconsistent evidence so far. Whereas Carsetti et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and a study by Zhou et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] were able to show that APRV- mode was associated with a reduced mortality, most studies in the past only detected an improvement of oxygenation without any mortality benefit of APRV- mode [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. On the contrary, an Australian prospective, randomized, single center study by Zorbas et al. 2021 could even show a higher 90-day mortality and fewer ventilator-free days independent of the patients&#x02018; severity of illness in APRV versus low tidal volume BIPAP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par35">In our study, we could not see any improvement in oxygenation and CO<sub>2</sub>- removal or shunt reduction as confirmed by other previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The lack of improvement of oxygenation in APRV in our study might be due to the fact that the patients included in our study were mostly treated in APRV- mode for only&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;6&#x000a0;h.</p><p id="Par36">Nevertheless, APRV has also been seen critically in the past for the potential to promote VILI. This might be especially the case in spontaneous breathing on the upper pressure level resulting in an increased transpulmonary pressure with an increased risk of volu- and barotrauma. In our study, APRV presented with higher tidal volumes and mean airway pressures compared to BIPAP but this did not result in harmfully increased endinspiratory TPP in APRV as confirmed by other studies in the past [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. In contrast to increased lung volumes at endinspiration, increased lung volumes at endexpiration in APRV compared to BIPAP are theoretically assumed to promote a reduction of dynamic alveolar strain and to prevent atelectrauma and VILI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Nevertheless, APRV carries a risk of occult atelectrauma especially with an increased T<sub>low</sub> (which is not adjusted to achieve expiratory flow termination at 75% of peak expiratory flow) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. A negative endexpiratory transpulmonary pressure in APRV vs. BIPAP which may be associated with atelectasis was revealed in our study as well. These signs were not predictable by assessing plateau pressure, total PEEP (set extrinsic PEEP plus intrinsic PEEP) or driving pressure on the ventilator screen. In APRV, intrinsic PEEP and driving pressure can be difficult to measure and are unreliable predictors of atelectasis as seen in findings from compute modelling in the past [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Conclusively, in our study signs of an increased risk of atelectasis were revealed in TPP monitoring only. In our study Tlow was set at &#x02264;&#x02009;0.5&#x000a0;s to achieve expiratory flow termination at 75% of peak expiratory flow as per recommendations of the TCAV approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Despite the adjustment of ventilator settings in APRV according to the results of the TPP monitoring negative endexpiratory TPP values could not be eliminated by the treating team.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Limitations and strengths</title><p id="Par37">Our study has several limitations. The retrospective, monocentric setting of our study restricted to a small number of patients limits the generalizability of the data. Additionally, all patients were ventilated in BIPAP first and consecutively in APRV- mode (on 3.05&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;2.31 days after ICU admission) as a rescue- mode for refractory hypoxemia. This leaves the time effect as a potential confounder and the data can probably not be extrapolated to APRV- mode as a primary mode of ventilation. But as shown in our study, patients were not deteriorating regarding oxygenation, decarboxylation, lung compliance, lung resistance or hemodynamic stability during the study interval assessed. Therefore TPP- measurements during the examined interval in BIPAP and APRV- mode should not be affected by a time component.</p><p id="Par38">Another limitation of our study is, that TPP was not monitored continuously but only at certain timepoints and that only 4 patients of our study were paralyzed. TPP values may not be comparable in non-paralyzed patients and paralyzed patients and TPP values are more prone to artifacts in spontaneous breathing. But all patients in this study were sedated to a RASS Score of -5 and a GCS Score of 3 to avoid spontaneous breathing. None of the patients included in our study were breathing spontaneously. Moreover, TPP as derived from esophageal pressure monitoring, does not reflect all lung regions equally but mainly represents esophageal pressure midesophageal between non-dependent and dependent lung areas. Same can be stated about the intrinsic PEEP which can vary in different regions of the lungs as CARDS is a heterogenous lung disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. To overcome this problem, endinspiratory TPP values were measured directly with the plateau- derived method and additionally calculated using the elastance-derived method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Another limitation of our study is that the duration of ventilation in APRV was potentially too short to see a benefit regarding oxygenation and decarboxylation. In our study, APRV was terminated in most cases within &#x02264;&#x02009;6&#x000a0;h as an increased risk of atelectrauma was witnessed in form of a negative endexpiratory TPP, despite adjustment of ventilator settings as the reduction of T<sub>low</sub>. Since the same patients were ventilated in BIPAP and APRV consecutively, we did not assess outcome parameters such as length of invasive ventilation, length of ICU- / Hospital- stay and 30-day mortality in our study.</p><p id="Par39">On the other hand, our study also has certain strengths. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first analysis comparing APRV vs. BIPAP using TPP monitoring in CARDS patients in a clinical setting. Further, as our intensive care unit was focused on the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 patients at the above-mentioned time-period, therapy was highly standardized within a well-educated team. Thus, despite being a retrospective study, the level of standardization may be assumed to be extremely homogenous.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Implications</title><p id="Par40">Regarding implications, APRV seems to have many theory-based advantages in ARDS, but evidence of large, randomized multicenter trials comparing APRV to other modes of ventilation for CARDS patients are lacking so far [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. APRV is highly dependent on adjusting ventilator settings individually to the patients&#x02019; needs. Inadequate ventilator settings carry a high risk of unwitnessed derecruitment or volu- and barotrauma of the lung leading to VILI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par41">Despite of higher mean tidal volumes and higher mean airway pressures in APRV vs. BIPAP, both modes did not present an increased risk of volu- or barotrauma regarding median endinspiratory TPP. In contrast, in APRV- mode, median endexpiratory TPP was negative (versus positive in BIPAP) implying an increased risk of atelectasis in APRV which would have remained unwitnessed without TPP-monitoring. Conclusively, TPP monitoring could be a useful tool for a safer application of APRV- mode in patients suffering from CARDS.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.</p><p>
