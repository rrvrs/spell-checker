Nigeria rolled out the 3-month Isoniazid-Rifampicin (3HR) shorter regimen TPT as a pilot for use among eligible adult and child contacts. This study assesses acceptance and completion rates of 3HR TPT among contacts and determines the perspectives of healthcare workers (HCWs) and contacts on acceptance and completion of 3HR TPT in Nigeria. In this cross-sectional descriptive study using mixed methods, records of TPT-eligible clients were retrospectively reviewed, while 18 purposely selected HCWs and 18 contacts on 3HR were interviewed. Of the 30,012 eligible contacts, 12,040 (40.1%) were initiated on TPT. Among these, 8213 (68%) were enrolled on 3HR, and 6972 (84.7%) of them completed treatment. Perceived facilitators include belief in its effectiveness, training among HCWs, and a good understanding of TPT from HCW counseling sessions. Barriers reported were linked to stockouts, misconceptions about side effects, non-disclosures, and disincentive follow-up strategies. The acceptance and completion rate for 3HR TPT was good. Scaling up 3HR TPT will require redesigning policies towards addressing identified barriers and utilizing interventions linked to capabilities, opportunities, and motivations among contacts of TB patients and HCWs.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>tuberculosis</kwd><kwd>TB preventive treatment</kwd><kwd>contacts</kwd><kwd>Nigeria</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>the United States Agency for International Development (USAID)</funding-source><award-id>Nigeria STBP/NT/GSA/2022-05</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>The study was funded by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) through the Stop TB Partnership introducing New Tools Project (iNTP).

Introduction</title><p>Every year, about 10 million people develop TB, and it is the 2nd leading cause of death worldwide. In 2022, Nigeria ranked 6th among eight countries, globally accounting for two-thirds of the pandemic [<xref rid="B1-tropicalmed-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Latent TB infection (LTBI) refers to a state of persistent immune response to stimulation by MTB antigens without a clinical manifestation of active TB, and reports show that about 25% of the global population have latent TB infection [<xref rid="B1-tropicalmed-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-tropicalmed-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Tuberculosis preventive treatment (TPT) is the intake of one or more anti-TB drugs by people with latent infection to prevent the progression of LTBI to active TB disease and also to prevent TB infection after exposure to a TB case [<xref rid="B2-tropicalmed-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>In Nigeria, the national TB guidelines recommend six months of isoniazid (6H), three months of Isoniazid and Rifampicin (3HR), three months of Isoniazid and Rifapentine (3HP), and one month of Isoniazid and Rifapentine (1HP) as regimen options for use as TPT for adults and children at increased risk of exposure and progression to active TB [<xref rid="B3-tropicalmed-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The guideline, however, prioritizes adult and child household contacts of an index TB case and persons living with HIV (PLHIV) as high-risk groups for the programmatic intervention of TPT in the country [<xref rid="B3-tropicalmed-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-tropicalmed-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Eligibility for TPT by Nigeria guidelines is for contacts of all ages without active TB disease. In order to rule out active TB disease, symptomatic contacts irrespective of age would undergo further evaluation procedures for TB, while the guideline recommends LTBI screening for HIV negative asymptomatic contacts above 5 years before being placed on TPT. However, due to resource constraints, the quantiferon assay tests are unavailable for use in the TB program [<xref rid="B3-tropicalmed-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Previous studies in settings around the world have shown various levels of acceptance (39&#x02013;91%) and completion (29&#x02013;90%) of the WHO-recommended treatments for LTBI [<xref rid="B5-tropicalmed-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-tropicalmed-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-tropicalmed-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-tropicalmed-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The variations observed in the acceptance and completion of TPT may be due to the challenge of convincing patients without any symptoms of TB that they are infected and at risk of developing the disease. In addition, healthcare workers (HCWs) had reservations about deciding to place a healthy person on the TPT [<xref rid="B9-tropicalmed-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Other factors influencing the acceptance and completion of TPT were the inconsistent supply of TPT medications, the health education and counseling of eligible contacts, fear of adverse drug reactions, pill burden, and a lack of an integrated monitoring and evaluation system for TPT [<xref rid="B10-tropicalmed-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-tropicalmed-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. These may continue to threaten TB elimination in the face of the already existing public health challenge of non-adherence to anti-TB medication in the past years. Similarly, in a systematic review by Szkwarko et al.

This included information on indicators related to contact tracing cascade indicators data. A qualitative approach involved conducting in-depth interviews with contacts who received 3HR and HCWs to assess their perspectives and opinions of factors influencing contacts&#x02019; and HCWs&#x02019; acceptance and completion of the 3HR TPT. The interview guides were adapted from a similar study conducted in Uganda [<xref rid="B13-tropicalmed-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The research coordinator and technical leads provided one-day training session to eighteen professionals who were selected as data enumerators and had similar experience in conduct of studies related to TB activities. They were familiarized during 1-day training with how to conduct and audio-record interviews using pretested discussion guides among TB contacts (greater than 15 years) and HCWs as well as extraction of relevant indicators using contact management register. Audio-recorded information was later transcribed, translated into English as needed, and reviewed for accuracy and completeness by bilingual research staff. Information gathered using TB contact management register contained records of individual enrollees during the period of April 2022 to September 2022 regarding relevant indicators at various points in the TB care cascade. These data were collected longitudinally. Household contacts (individuals living in same household) of TB cases, i.e., confirmed by microbiological testing, had TB symptom assessment by contact tracers at home while those with symptoms had sputum test and chest X-ray performed within hospital settings to rule out active TB. Child (0&#x02013;14 years) and adult (greater than 15 years) household contacts without active TB were placed on 3HR TPT in TB treatment facilities with regular follow-up measures implemented to ensure adherence and treatment completion. The study covered 138 facilities offering 3HR TPT, with 87 primary, 51 secondary, and 10 tertiary, respectively. Mentorship and supervisory visits were provided on weekly basis during the survey period to ensure compliance with the study protocols and regulations approved for the study.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot4-tropicalmed-09-00301"><title>2.4.

Discussion</title><p>This study was conducted to identify potential barriers and facilitators of the acceptance and completion of 3HR TPT, as perceived by contacts of persons diagnosed with TB and health workers in Nigeria using both quantitative and qualitative research methods to better inform the development of effective implementation programs concerning 3HR TPT in Nigeria. Quantitative data collated through a review of the existing record from the TB contact management register showed that 12,040 (40%) of the eligible contacts were initiated on TPT, with 8231 (68%) of the enrollees placed on the 3HR TPT regimen. Findings from the qualitative interviews provide some insight into some reasons for the low TPT enrollment, and they include the challenge of cost of transportation to access TPT care by contacts and a preference by contacts for a home-based care approach, where stigmatization, follow-up visits, and problems with care access are all addressed.</p><p>Our study showed that 32% of the contacts enrolled on 3HR were children &#x0003c; 15 years. Although this is lower than the proportion of children (42%) that make up Nigeria&#x02019;s estimated population, it also indicates that children make up a significant proportion of the household in Nigeria and need to be prioritized, as they are at an increased risk when in contact with a household member with TB [<xref rid="B16-tropicalmed-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>The TPT initiation rate of 40% reported by this study is lower than the rates reported from a study in Ethiopia, which reported 64.3% [<xref rid="B17-tropicalmed-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. This study, however, reports a high completion rate of 85% for 3HR TPT among contacts, although this was still lower compared to findings from an Eswatini study (98%) by Kay et al. in 2023 [<xref rid="B8-tropicalmed-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The reason for this may be due to differences in settings where the study was conducted. Although the treatment completion rate on 6H could not be assessed within the period of the study, higher percentages reported for 3HR could be corroborated with qualitative interview findings among HCWs, where respondents reported a preference and tolerance to 3HR with no negative feedback.</p><p>This study&#x02019;s qualitative survey showed that the acceptance and completion of 3HR TPT can be affected by misunderstandings of TPT&#x02019;s preventive role among HCWs and contacts of persons with TB. Similar findings were reported by Mindachew et al. and Jacobson et al. among people living with HIV/AIDs using six months of isoniazid preventive therapy [<xref rid="B18-tropicalmed-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-tropicalmed-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The result is also consistent with findings of cross-sectional study conducted in Malawi among child contacts by Triasih et al. in 2016 [<xref rid="B20-tropicalmed-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>HCWs in this study were comfortable using 3HR TPT based on experience, the training received, and the shorter duration of treatment. They believed in its safety and benefits in preventing active TB among under five and adult contacts. The evidence of this is shown in the documentation practices based on quantitative data, where more than half of TPT enrollees (68%) were placed on the 3HR TPT regimen. This may be due to preferences for the 3HR TPT regimen supplied to the health facilities and, hence, a reason why a higher proportion of eligible contacts were enrolled on 3HR TPT [<xref rid="B21-tropicalmed-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>During in-depth interview of contacts, it was elicited that poor knowledge of the benefits of 3HR and fear of 3HR TPT side effects were among issues that may prevent eligible contacts from accepting and completing 3HR TPT. It is plausible that the reluctance from contacts accepting TPT may also be due to the lack of TB infection testing, which could persuade clients to initiate TPT.</p><p>Transportation costs and the unavailability or stockout of the 3HR TPT regimen in some facilities have also been mentioned by some HCWs as barriers in this study. Furthermore, research on TPT conducted in Malawi and Indonesia reported on this [<xref rid="B22-tropicalmed-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-tropicalmed-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].

One of these strategies is the use of community enrollment or home delivery as a substitute for facility-based 3HR [<xref rid="B26-tropicalmed-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], while enablers ranging from providing transport incentives for HCWs conducting home visits, telephone calls, and reminder text messages to providing transport incentives for contacts living in distant locations will help in improving the acceptance and completion of 3HR TPT services. Likewise, continuous education through counseling by HCWs on 3HR TPT before initiation and during follow-up monthly refills and refresher training among HCWs on 3HR TPT using updated guidelines will help in addressing issues related to safety, ignorance, and misconception regarding the effectiveness of 3HR TPT therapy identified among contacts of TB patients. Healthcare workers can leverage follow-up monthly visitation to persuade contacts to ensure acceptability and completion.</p><p>In conclusion, acceptance was low but the preference for the shorter regimen 3HR was remarkable, with 68% of patients initiated on 3HR compared with other similar study findings [<xref rid="B8-tropicalmed-09-00301" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Moreover, the scale-up of 3HR TPT will require updating existing policies and guidelines toward addressing barriers and utilizing differentiated care models centered on community-based TPT delivery, where interventions are linked to capabilities, opportunities, and motivations among contacts and HCWs reported during the survey.</p><p>There were some limitations encountered while conducting this study. First, some data extracted using existing TB contact management registers were incomplete; these were excluded during the analysis process for accuracy and consistency. Additionally, a proportion of clients who refused treatment during the study period were not included in the cascade. In addition, only 18 HCWs and 18 TB contacts (who were &#x0003e;15 years) were purposively selected for the qualitative technique of data collection.</p><p>However, the mixed methodology and sampling approach applied in the study are significant strengths that validate the findings from the study.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors acknowledge the support by the National Tuberculosis and Leprosy Control Program, state TB control managers across the 18 USAID TB-LON-supported states in Nigeria, tuberculosis local government supervisors, healthcare workers in the selected sites, and study participants for their contribution and consent to the success of this study.
