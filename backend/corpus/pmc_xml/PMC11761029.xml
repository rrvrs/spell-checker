While primary EBV infection triggers severe diseases in each, lymphomas occur at high rates with XLP-1 but not with XLP-2. Why XLP-2 patients are apparently protected from EBV-driven lymphomagenesis, in contrast to all other described congenital conditions that result in heightened susceptibility to EBV, remains a key open question. To gain insights, we cross-compared newly EBV infected versus immune stimulated B-cells from XLP-2 patients or upon XIAP CRISPR knockout, relative to healthy controls. XIAP perturbation impeded outgrowth of newly EBV-infected primary human B-cells, though had no impact on proliferation of B-cells stimulated by CD40 ligand and interleukin-21 or upon established EBV-immortalized lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs). B-cells from XLP-2 patients or in which XIAP was depleted by CRISPR editing exhibited a markedly lower EBV transformation efficiency than healthy control B-cells. Mechanistically, nascent EBV infection activated p53-mediated apoptosis signaling, whose effects on transforming B-cell death were counteracted by XIAP. In the absence of XIAP, EBV infection triggered high rates of apoptosis, not seen with CD40L/IL-21 stimulation. Moreover, inflammatory cytokines are present at high levels in XLP-2 patient serum with fulminant EBV infection, which heightened apoptosis induction in newly EBV-infected cells. These findings highlight the crucial role of XIAP in supporting early stages of EBV-driven B-cell immortalization and provide insights into the absence of EBV+ lymphoma in XLP-2 patients.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P4">EBV persistently infects more than 90% of the global population and contributes to over 200,000 cancers per year <sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. While acute EBV infection is controlled by immunocompetent hosts and typically results in subclinical disease, EBV is nonetheless a major driver of pathology in hosts with primary or acquired immunodeficiency, in particular lymphoproliferative disease <sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. EBV is associated with 200,000 cancers per year, including lymphomas, gastric and nasopharyngeal carcinoma <sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. Defects in anti-EBV immunity increase rates of multiple EBV-associated lymphomas including Burkitt, Hodgkin and immunoblastic lymphomas <sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">Immune control over EBV is primarily mediated by T-cell responses, particularly CD8<sup>+</sup> cytotoxic T lymphocytes, which target virus-infected cells. Natural killer (NK) cells and antibodies also play crucial roles in regulating EBV activity<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. The importance of these immune mechanisms is underscored by the severe outcomes observed in individuals with compromised immunity, such as those with X-linked lymphoproliferative syndromes (XLP)<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. In these cases, defects in immune signaling pathways can lead to uncontrolled viral proliferation and associated complications, highlighting the critical balance between EBV and host immune responses.</p><p id="P6">Two rare congenital XLP syndromes have been described, which share in common extreme susceptibility to EBV, frequently resulting in fulminant infectious mononucleosis, dysgammaglobulinemia and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). HLH is a T-cell and macrophage hyperactivation state <sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. XLP-1 is caused by loss-of-function mutations in <italic toggle="yes">SH2D1A</italic>, which encodes the protein 128 amino acid SH2-domain containing signaling lymphocyte activation molecule (SLAM)&#x02013;associated protein (SAP) (MIM no. 308240). SAP controls signaling downstream of SLAM family receptors, including CD150, CD229, 2B4, CD84 and NTB-A <sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. XLP-2 instead arises from congenital mutations of the X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP, also termed BIRC4; MIM no. 300635), a 497-amino acid member of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) family that serves as a central regulator of apoptotic cell death by inhibiting caspases 3 and 7 <sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. XIAP has additional roles in many other pathways <sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. Each XLP syndrome is characterized by markedly elevated EBV viral loads <sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>, which trigger severe infectious mononucleosis, HLH and a range of hematological dyscrasias. While rates of HLH and splenomegaly are higher with XLP-2, there are no reported cases of EBV-associated lymphoproliferative disease in this syndrome. This stands in contradistinction to essentially all other primary immunodeficiency syndromes manifest by susceptibility to EBV <sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. Much remains to be learned about why <italic toggle="yes">SH2D1A</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">XIAP</italic> mutations cause XLP syndromes, but each is associated with defects in T and NK cell responses, including the absence of natural killer T-cells <sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P7">A notable difference between SAP and XIAP is their tropism. While SAP is expressed primarily in NK, NKT and T cells, XIAP is ubiquitously expressed in all cell types <sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. This disparity suggests that the lack of B-cell malignancies in XLP-2 may be attributed to intrinsic factors within EBV-infected B-cells themselves, rather than solely to differences in immune cell function. Gene expression analysis highlighted elevated levels of the tumor suppressor cell adhesion molecule 1 (CADM1) in XIAP-deficient B-cells infected by EBV <sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>, which has been implicated in NF-kB activation in B-cells infected by the gamma-herpesvirus Kaposi&#x02019;s Sarcoma Associated Herpesvirus <sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P8">Here, we sought to test the role of XIAP in EBV-driven lymphomagenesis. We found that the knockout or mutation of <italic toggle="yes">XIAP</italic> in primary B-cells impacted the EBV-driven proliferation of newly infected B-cells, leading to reduced efficiency in B-cell transformation. We provide evidence that XIAP supports newly EBV-infected primary B-cell survival, which counteracted upregulation of p53-related apoptosis signaling triggered by EBV infection. B-cell intrinsic XIAP deficiency elevated the apoptosis frequency at early timepoints of EBV-mediated B-cell immortalization but not in cells stimulated by CD40-ligand (CD40L) and interleukin-4 (IL-4), exacerbated by the presence of inflammatory cytokines.</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Cell cultures and Chemical compounds</title><p id="P9">Cells were cultured following the vendor&#x02019;s instructions.

Our CRISPR editing only depleted XIAP in a subset of B-cells, likely due to the inability to deliver Cas9 RNPs across the population. Consistent with a growth advantage for XIAP-expressing cells, immunoblot analysis highlighted that there was a selection against XIAP deficiency evident by day 14 post-infection, with similar XIAP levels present in control vs XIAP edited populations, in contrast to earlier timepoints (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>).</p><p id="P17">To further characterize a potential XIAP role in support of early EBV-mediated B-cell outgrowth, we treated newly infected versus CD40L/IL-21 stimulated B-cells with the small-molecule XIAP antagonist embelin <sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>.

Venous blood was collected from three healthy donors on the same day (Control 1&#x02013;3). B-cells were purified by negative selection and infected by EBV or stimulated by CD40L/IL-21.

This analysis highlighted that EBV infection upregulated expression of P53 (encoded by <italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic>) relative to levels in CD40L/IL-21 stimulated cells. EBV also altered expression levels of multiple apoptosis pathway components, increasing levels of the pro-apoptotic BAX, NOXA (encoded by PMAIP1) and PUMA (encoded by BBC3) in both control and XLP2 patient B-cells (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4B</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S2</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3</xref>).

However, embelin did not significantly reduce CD56+ NK, CD4+ or CD8+ T-cell frequency in PBMC cultures (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">B</xref>), suggesting an XIAP role in infected B-cell survival. To exclude the possibility that embelin exhibits B cell-specific toxicity, we treated primary B cells with embelin prior to either EBV infection or CD40L/IL21 stimulation. Consistent with our XIAP knockout results, embelin-treated cells showed increased cell death only in EBV-infected B cells, while CD40L/IL21-stimulated cells remained unaffected (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). These findings suggest that embelin&#x02019;s effects closely mimic those observed in XIAP-deficient cells, specifically targeting EBV-infected B cells without general B cell toxicity.</p><p id="P25">Embelin reduction of EBV-infected B-cell numbers could be by effects on growth and/or survival. To investigate this further, we stained the PBMC with CellTrace Violet and analyzed the CD19+ B cells with FACS dye-dilution analysis. Interestingly, we observed that markedly less proliferation of EBV-infected CD19+ B-cells in embelin treated PBMC cultures, though analysis was complicated by low numbers of live B-cells at this timepoint in embelin treated PBMCs (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). We therefore next analyzed embelin effects on CD19+ cell death, as judged by 7-AAD uptake. Interestingly, embelin XIAP blockade increased EBV-infected B-cell cell death when cultured with autologous PBMCs than when cultured alone (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>). These results thus suggest that the presence of other immune cells further enhances the apoptosis of EBV-infected cells.</p><p id="P26">We next sought to determine the factor that promotes the apoptosis of EBV infected cells. Notably, multiple pro-inflammatory cytokine levels are elevated in XLP-2 patient serum in particular IL-18, IL-6, interferon gamma (IFN&#x003b3;) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF&#x003b1;) <sup><xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup>. EBV infection also upregulates infected B-cell expression of multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines, and IL-18, TNF&#x003b1; and IFN-&#x003b3; mRNAs are upregulated within the first week of EBV infection <sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup>. Since pro-inflammatory cytokines can sensitize cells to apoptosis, we hypothesized that XIAP deficiency and pro-inflammatory cytokines might exert synthetic effects that together potentiate apoptosis of newly EBV-infected cells. To test this hypothesis, we treated EBV-infected purified B-cells from three healthy donors with vehicle or embelin, together with vehicle, IFN&#x003b3;, TNF&#x003b1;, IL-5 or IL-18. Intriguingly, IFN&#x003b3; and to a lesser extent TNF&#x003b1; treatment significantly increased caspase 3/7 activity in embelin but not DMSO-treated cells (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>). Interestingly, IFNg treatment also strongly suppressed outgrowth of embelin treated but not vehicle treated EBV-infected B-cells over the first two weeks (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref>). These findings indicate that XIAP inhibition in newly EBV-infected cells renders the cells sensitive to inflammatory cytokines.</p><p id="P27">Collectively, our data is consistent with a model in which EBV triggers p53-mediated apoptotic signaling, which results in activation of caspase 3 and 7. Existence of XIAP in the host cells can inhibit this signaling, thus allowing for cell survival and B cell transformation. In patients with XLP2, mutation of XIAP makes the cells sensitive to p53-mediated apoptotic signaling and inflammatory cytokines, resulting in cell death of EBV infected cells, thus abolishing lymphomagenesis (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S14"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P28">The absence of EBV-associated lymphoma is a striking feature of XLP2, which separates it from XLP1 and from nearly all other immunodeficiencies with defective cell mediated control of EBV-infected B-cells. Here, we used multidisciplinary approaches to characterize how XIAP perturbation by XLP2 mutation, CRISPR editing or small molecule inhibition alters EBV/B-cell interactions and early events in EBV-driven B-cell transformation. Multi-omic profiling highlighted that in the absence of XIAP, EBV upregulates caspase 3 and 7 activity in a p53 and BAX dependent manner over the first week of primary B-cell infection, limiting transforming B-cell outgrowth. Co-incubation with IFN&#x003b3; or TNF&#x003b1;, which are found in XLP2 serum at elevated levels in particular in the setting of HLH, strongly further suppressed EBV immortalization of XIAP depleted B-cells.</p><p id="P29">XLP2 lymphocytes display increased susceptibility to extrinsic apoptosis triggered by CD95/FAS, TNF&#x003b1; or TNF related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), and XLP2 T-cells also exhibit increased rates of activation-induced programmed cell death <sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup>. However, EBV can convert XLP2 B-cells with loss-of-function XIAP mutations into continuously growing, immortalized lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) in culture <sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>, which are a key model for EBV-driven immunoblastic lymphomas of immunocompromised hosts. Our findings indicate that XIAP is not critical for growth or survival of infected cells that convert to lymphoblastoid physiology over the first weeks of infection. Furthermore, CRISPR XIAP KO does not significantly alter the growth or survival of established LCLs <sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> and did not score in a human genome-wide CRISPR screen for LCL dependency factors <sup><xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup>. Therefore, the question of why EBV+ lymphomas are not observed in XLP2 patients has remained open.</p><p id="P30">We now suggest that XIAP plays key roles in support of the earliest stages of EBV-mediated primary human B-cell transformation, particularly in the presence of elevated IFN&#x003b3; and TNF&#x003b1;, which are often found at elevated levels in XLP2 patients, who exhibit high rates of recurrent splenomegaly and HLH <sup><xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup>. Over the first three days post-infection, EBV remodels newly infected B-cells, driving elevated levels of MYC expression, altering metabolism and quadrupling their size. EBV then drives Burkitt-like B-cell hyperproliferation between days 3&#x02013;7 post-infection <sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup>. This aligns with our findings, where we observed extensive cell death in EBV-infected <italic toggle="yes">XIAP</italic> knockout cells around day 4 post-infection. EBV then expresses increasing levels of the oncogene LMP1, which mimics aspects of CD40 signaling, to convert B-cells to lymphoblastoid B-cell physiology <sup><xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup>. Key LMP1/NF-kB pathway targets include anti-apoptosis factors including cIAP1, cIAP2, cFLIP and pro-survival BCL-2 family members <sup><xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup>. LMP1 can also inhibit p53-mediated apoptosis by inducing the deubiquitinase A20 <sup><xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup>. However, EBV does not significantly upregulate XIAP in transforming B-cells and p53 expression is sustained <sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup>. Therefore, our results suggest that XIAP exerts key pro-survival roles likely in the Burkitt-like hyperproliferation stage of EBV transformation, prior to the marked upregulation of anti-apoptotic factors by LMP1 and perhaps also prior to maximal inhibition of p53 signaling by EBNA3C <sup><xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup>. Likewise, following LMP1 upregulation, lymphoblastoid cells are not dependent on XIAP for growth or survival.</p><p id="P31">What then triggers apoptosis signaling within the first week of EBV infection? EBV-driven B-cell hyper-proliferation activates DNA damage responses (DDR), which signal through p53 <sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref></sup>. Following the initial phase of rapid proliferation, by approximately day 7 post-EBV infection, the proliferation rate slows. Our results suggest that such elevated p53 levels and upregulation of p53 targets including NOXA and PUMA culminate in activation of BAX, which is a three BH3-only (BCL-2 Homology domain) apoptosis effector. When expressed at elevated levels and not sufficiently counteracted by pro-survival BCL2 family members, BAX undergoes conformational changes, oligomerization and insertion into the mitochondrial outer membrane. This enables egress of cytochrome c and other apoptogenic factors to activate executioner caspase activity, including caspases 3 and 7 <sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup>. Our observations that the inhibition of p53 and BAX can avert cell death in EBV-infected XIAP-deficient cells suggest that this apoptotic pathway constitutes a pivotal mechanism of cell death during the initial stages of EBV infection. Therefore, EBV driven B-cell hyperproliferation and DNA damage signaling creates a dependency on XIAP prior to LMP1 upregulation, and this may serve to protect XLP2 B-cells from undergoing full EBV immortalization, particularly in a hyper-inflammatory cytokine milieu. This may also explain why we did not observe defects in XLP2 B-cell proliferation when stimulated by CD40L/IL-21, which highly upregulates anti-apoptotic factors including cIAP1 and 2.</p><p id="P32">How does XIAP loss of function synergize with IFN&#x003b3; and TNF&#x003b1; to antagonize EBV-mediated B-cell transformation? P53 and IFN&#x003b3; have an intricate cross-relationship, and it is plausible that IFN&#x003b3; treatment heightens sensitivity to p53-driven apoptosis signaling <sup><xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref></sup> in newly EBV-infected B-cells. For instance, IFN&#x003b3; can upregulate nuclear p53 expression and interaction with target genes <sup><xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref></sup>. IFN&#x003b3; can also block EBV-mediated B-cell transformation through incompletely identified mechanisms <sup><xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref></sup>. TNF&#x003b1; may directly trigger apoptosis signaling in newly EBV-infected B-cells that may necessitate XIAP activity for survival, as is observed in XIAP KO murine bone marrow derived macrophages and in XIAP KO mice <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic>
<sup><xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup>. We note that EBV+ lymphoblastoid cells are also dependent on cFLIP to block TNF&#x003b1;-mediated apoptosis <sup><xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup>. IFN&#x003b3; can also induce apoptosis, and this may be exacerbated by XIAP deficiency in infected B-cells undergoing Burkitt-like hyperproliferation. Alternatively, IFN&#x003b3; or TNF&#x003b1; may alter EBV oncogene expression to interrupt EBV-driven B-cell immortalization over the first week of infection. Identifying precise mechanisms by which IFN&#x003b3; and TNF&#x003b1; each antagonize EBV-mediated B-cell immortalization in the absence of XIAP will be an important objective.</p><p id="P33">A recent study identified that LCLs derived from XLP2 patients had modestly elevated lytic gene expression <sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. However, we did not observe significantly elevated lytic gene expression in our transcriptomic or proteomic profiling, suggesting that this phenomenon may be specific to established LCLs and did not likely contribute to inhibition of EBV-infected B-cell outgrowth. Similarly, the tumor suppressor cell adhesion molecule 1 (CADM1) was highly upregulated on LCLs established from XLP2 B-cells. Consistent with this report, our proteomic profiling identified CADM1 upregulation in XLP2 B-cells at 7 days post-infection (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S2</xref>), suggesting that this is an early phenomenon in EBV-infected XLP2 B-cells.</p><p id="P34">In summary, we identified a key role for XIAP in blockade of EBV-induced apoptosis signaling within the first week of infection. Loss of XIAP function impaired proliferation and triggered apoptosis of EBV+ B-cells, particularly at the Burkitt-like stage of hyperproliferation and prior to full LMP1 upregulation and pro-survival signaling. This pro-apoptotic pathway was dependent on p53- and BAX and was exacerbated by treatment IFN&#x003b3; or TNF&#x003b1;, whose expression are elevated with XLP2. Our results provide insights into the curious absence of EBV-driven lymphoproliferative disease in XLP2 patients, despite heightened sensitivity to EBV.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM1"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="SD1" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>Supplement 1</label><media xlink:href="media-1.pdf" id="d67e681" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S15"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p id="P35">This work was supported by NIH R01AI164709, R01CA228700, R01DE033907, U01CA275301, P01CA269043, R21AI170751 and R21AI181873 to B.E.G. and by an American Cancer Society Postdoctoral Fellowship PF-23-1144614-01-IBCD to Y.S.
