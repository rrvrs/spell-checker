It has been shown to be associated with schizophrenia (SZ), Parkinson&#x02019;s disease, and the development of brain tumors. ASCL1 is expressed in the neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y, which is a widely used model for the study of neurodevelopmental diseases, including SZ.</p></sec><sec id="sec3355"><title>Objectives</title><p>The aim of this work was to study the effect of functional <italic toggle="yes">ASCL1</italic> knockout on the transcriptional landscape of SH-SY5Y cells in undifferentiated and neuron-like phenotypes.</p></sec><sec id="sec3356"><title>Methods</title><p>For ASCL1 deletion, SH-SY5Y was sequentially transduced with two lentiviral vectors. One pLV-rtTA-Cas9-(nls)-pCMV-eGFP-PuroR-T2A-rTetR (derived from pCW-Cas9 and pEGFP-Puro) construct encoded Cas9. Stably transduced lines were selected for 3-5 days on puromycin (2 g/L). The inducibility of Cas9 expression was checked after adding the inducer oxytetracycline to the culture medium. The second construct (based on pLK05-tagRFP) encoded, a pair of guide RNAs targeting the start and end of the ASCL1 gene. The sgRNA construct was transduced into the SH-SY5Y-Cas9 cell line in parallel with a nontemplate control (NTC gRNA) as a negative control. Cas9 expression was induced with oxytetracycline for 2 days. Individual clones were obtained by serial dilutions. <italic toggle="yes">ASCL1</italic> partial deletion in the clones was confirmed by PCR followed by Sanger sequencing. Disruption of ASCL1 protein synthesis was confirmed by western blot analysis. SH-SY5Y differentiation was induced by retinoic acid (RA). The transcriptomes of mutant clones and NTC controls before and after RA-induced differentiation were sequenced using Illumina technology.</p></sec><sec id="sec3357"><title>Results</title><p>RNAseq data show that a wide range of genes are differentially expressed between control NTC gRNA and wild-type SH-SY5Y. This can be explained by insertional mutagenesis of lentiviral vectors and/or cellular response to the presence of lentiviral constructs. Therefore, we compared the transcriptomes of the ASCL1-del line with NTC control. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) are predominantly associated with the pathogenesis of SZ, bipolar and depressive disorders. DEGs in ASCL1-del are involved in cell mitosis, neuronal projection, neuropeptide signaling, and formation of intercellular contacts including the synapse. During RA-induced differentiation, ASCL1 activity is restricted to the regulation of a small subset of genes involved in neuroplasticity.</p></sec><sec id="sec3358"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We have established a valid cellular model to study ASCL1-mediated mechanisms associated with SZ. ASCL1 dysfunction promotes SZ development predominantly before neuronal differentiation begins, slowing cell proliferation and preventing the formation of neuronal signatures.</p></sec><sec id="sec3359"><title>Disclosure of Interest</title><p>None Declared</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="2"/></counts></article-meta></front></article>
