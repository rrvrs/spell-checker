Despite its clinical relevance, the structural and dynamic basis of SK1 regulation and inhibition remains poorly understood. Using an integrated spectroscopic and computational approach, we uncover conformational transitions that govern substrate entry, catalysis, and inhibitor binding. Phosphorylation of Ser225 triggers regulatory loop rearrangements and salt bridge reshuffling, priming SK1 for membrane engagement and catalytic activity. We identify a previously uncharacterized catalytic intermediate featuring a distinct conformation with a highly dynamic lipid-binding loop 1 (LBL-1), sensitive to potent inhibitors such as PF-543. This inhibitor locks SK1 in an inactive state by restricting LBL-1 dynamics and globally stabilizing a non-catalytic conformation. Notably, SK1 forms functionally distinct dimers stabilized by ligand or membrane interactions, revealing a dynamic, multilayered regulatory mechanism governed by structural flexibility. These findings define a novel inhibitory mechanism and offer a structural framework for developing next-generation SK1-targeted therapeutics.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="P4">The bioactive lipid sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) plays a key role in regulating mammalian cell growth, survival, and migration<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>.

While a few SK1 crystal structures were solved over a decade ago<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>, key regulatory regions like the C-terminal tail and in some cases the loop bearing the phosphorylation site, Ser225, are missing or dissociated from the core protein. These regions are proposed to regulate conformational dynamics and the membrane recruitment<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. Although existing structures provide valuable insights into the catalytic function and regulation of this important enzyme<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>, experimental validation using the full-length protein is needed to connect structural insights with functional dynamics. Thus, a comprehensive understanding of SK1&#x02019;s structural and functional dynamics underlying its regulation and inhibition is crucial for guiding therapeutic strategies targeting S1P signaling in disease.</p><p id="P5">It is well established that plasma membrane translocation and enzymatic activity of SK1 are enhanced by ERK1/2-mediated phosphorylation of Ser225. However, the structural mechanism by which this modification alters SK1 conformation remains unresolved<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. Ser225 resides on the regulatory loop (R-loop), which is positioned opposite the C-terminal domain (CTD) &#x003b2;-sandwich core from the lipid-binding site (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1d</xref> and <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2i</xref>). A longstanding question is how phosphorylation of this loop enhances membrane recruitment&#x02014;required for sphingosine (Sph) phosphorylation to S1P&#x02014;and catalytic activity. Notably, Ser225 is solvent-exposed in all available structures<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. The R-loop tip packs against the N-terminal domain (NTD), stabilized by Asp235, which inserts into a pocket formed by basic residues (His156, Arg162, His355; <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2i</xref>). It is postulated that phosphorylation of Ser225 displaces the R-loop from its NTD interaction, thereby increasing protein flexibility<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. The functionally important 20 C-terminal residues of SK1 are missing from current crystal structures<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. Truncation beyond residue 363 renders SK1 constitutively active and unresponsive to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>, while also enhancing membrane localization independently of Ser225 phosphorylation.</p><p id="P6">The lipid-binding loop 1 (LBL-1; <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>, purple segment) plays a key role in membrane interaction<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. A hydrophobic patch containing Leu194, Phe197, and Leu198 (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>) mediates curvature-sensitive membrane binding, which is important in endocytosis<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. Together with Lys27, Lys29, and Arg186, these residues serve as key determinants for specific and nonspecific interactions with anionic phospholipid-enriched membranes<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. The mechanism of sphingosine entry into the substrate-binding pocket remains unclear<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. However, structural data suggest that conformational changes involving helices 7 and 8 (LBL-1) regulate substrate access, forming a flap-like structure over sphingosine<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. Moreover, LBL-1 binds to the calcium- and integrin-binding protein (CIB1) via Phe197 and Leu198, which is thought to mediate SK1 membrane translocation<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P7">Some studies suggest that SK1 functions as a dimer<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>, but structural insights into how dimerization affects catalytic efficiency and regulation are limited. A putative dimeric assembly has been proposed based on existing structures<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>, with the N-terminal domains possibly forming the dimer interface. Nonetheless, the conformational ensemble and dynamics of SK1 dimers remain poorly characterized.</p><p id="P8">As a dynamic enzyme, understanding SK1&#x02019;s conformational landscape is vital for the rational design of allosteric modulators<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>. Detailed structural knowledge of how SK1 inhibitors, such as SKI-II and PF-543, engage the enzyme is still emerging<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. PF-543 is a potent and selective SK1 inhibitor that acts via ATP-noncompetitive, substrate-competitive inhibition by mimicking sphingosine and occupying its binding pocket<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>. This prevents sphingosine access and phosphorylation. While PF-543 has proven invaluable in dissecting SK1 function, questions remain regarding its allosteric effects and ability to stabilize inactive conformations. Specifically, does PF-543 induce allosteric conformational changes beyond competitive blockade? How does it influence membrane-binding dynamics and the ATP-binding site, given that most structural studies exclude ATP?</p><p id="P9">Despite considerable progress, several key mechanistic and structural questions remain. These include the conformational transitions involved in allosteric regulation and membrane association, as well as the functional implications of dimerization. The effect of dimerization on activity, substrate affinity, or allosteric modulation remains speculative. Moreover, SK1&#x02019;s dynamic changes upon ligand binding are still insufficiently defined, posing a challenge to structure-based drug design. Although crystal structures of SK1 exist in both inhibitor- and substrate-bound states, high-resolution structures with both sphingosine and Mg<sup>2+</sup>ATP are lacking, and conformational shifts during catalysis remain uncharacterized. To address these gaps, we employed double electron&#x02013;electron resonance (DEER; also known as PELDOR) spectroscopy<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup>, AlphaFold modeling<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>, and all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> to uncover new SK1 conformational states and elucidate the mechanistic basis of its regulation and inhibition&#x02014;advancing our understanding of this important therapeutic target.</p><sec id="S1"><title>Results</title><p id="P10">Mechanistic characterization of SK1 requires identifying its conformational states during substrate binding and catalysis, understanding their dynamic interconversion, and determining how post-translational modifications and inhibitors reshape this landscape to stabilize active or inactive states. To this end, DEER distance distributions were measured for SK1 in its apo form, bound to sphingosine with and without Mg<sup>2+</sup>ATP, bound to the sphingosine analog FTY720 (an immunomodulatory drug), and in complex with the inhibitors SKI-II and PF-543. Most measurements were conducted in the presence of 0.1% Tween 20, a nonionic detergent used in prior studies<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. Additional DEER experiments for select pairs were performed in the presence of large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) composed of a plasma membrane-mimetic composition.</p><sec id="S2"><title>Functional integrity of SK1 mutants</title><p id="P11">To enable DEER spectroscopy, cysteine mutations were introduced into a cysteine-less (CL) SK1 background. The functional integrity of spin-labeled mutants was evaluated using two assays: a fluorescence-based sphingosine kinase assay with 15-NBD-sphingosine<sup><xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> and an ATPase activity assay<sup><xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1</xref>). Most DEER mutants retained activity comparable to the CL SK1. Notably, only the mutant containing the D235N substitution&#x02014;which disrupts R-loop tethering&#x02014;exhibited impaired sphingosine kinase activity (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1c</xref>). In contrast, phosphomimetic (S225D) and phospho-null (S225A) mutations at Ser225 in the R-loop had no significant effect on enzyme activity.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Dynamic lipid-binding loops regulate sphingosine entry, with PF-543 locking a closed conformation</title><p id="P12">The mechanism by which sphingosine accesses its binding site in SK1 has remained unclear. Crystal structures (PDB code 3VZB) show sphingosine enclosed within the CTD, implying full lipid extraction (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>,<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">d</xref>). The only apparent entry is a narrow path through the ATP-binding site, which would require tail-first tunneling past polar residues. A more plausible mechanism involves dynamic opening of LBL-1, which form a flap over the binding site (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>). Structural comparisons between apo and ligand-bound states suggest that LBL-1 rotates outward to expose inner hydrophobic surfaces and the &#x003b2;-sandwich core (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>)<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. However, crystal packing may restrict this movement, necessitating experimental validation. To investigate LBL dynamics during substrate and inhibitor binding, we monitored the T193&#x02013;M298 distance (LBL-1 to LBL-3). In the apo state&#x02014;especially with liposomes&#x02014;measured distances matched the apo structure<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>, indicating an open LBL-1 (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>,<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">e</xref> and <xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 2</xref>). Upon sphingosine binding, a shift toward a shorter distance was observed, more prominently in liposomes, suggesting a closed conformation not captured in crystal structures. Binding of Mg<sup>2+</sup>ATP/sphingosine further stabilized this closed state (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>,<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">e</xref>), while Mg<sup>2+</sup>ATP alone partially shifted the equilibrium (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref>). These findings support a model where transient LBL-1 opening enables substrate recognition at the membrane interface, followed by substrate extraction and LBL-1 closure (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>). In detergent, ligand binding increases LBL dynamics, especially in the catalytic Mg<sup>2+</sup>ATP/sphingosine complex, which samples both closed and open conformations (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>, red arrows). This flexibility likely facilitates phosphoryl transfer and S1P release. Sphingosine analogs FTY720 and SKI-II induce similar LBL behavior (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>), whereas PF-543 strongly favors the closed conformation and reduces LBL mobility, suggesting an inhibition mechanism that locks LBLs in a closed conformation and blocks substrate access (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>,<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">f</xref>). Thus, LBLs dynamics regulate sphingosine entry and S1P release, while potent inhibitors like PF-543 trap SK1 in a closed conformation, blocking substrate access.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Ser225 phosphorylation reconfigures the R-loop into a catalytic state, modulated by PF-543</title><p id="P13">Phosphorylation at Ser225, a key regulator of SK1&#x02019;s activity and membrane localization, induces conformational changes that remain incompletely characterized. Ser225 lies exposed within the R-loop, on the reverse side of the CTD &#x003b2;-sandwich, away from the lipid-binding site (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2i</xref>). The R-loop tip contacts NTD helices &#x003b1;3/&#x003b1;4 and is stabilized by Asp235, which inserts into a &#x003b2;-sandwich pocket formed by His156, Arg162, and His355 (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2i</xref>). It is proposed that phosphorylation displaces Asp235, altering R-loop&#x02013;NTD interactions and aligning membrane-facing residues in the NTD and CTD (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2i</xref>, blue spheres) for optimal membrane binding<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. To monitor the R-loop dynamics, the S159-V234 distance pair reports on R-loop movement near Asp235 (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> and <xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 3</xref>). Across WT conditions, with minor variations, the dominant distance population corresponds to those observed in the apo and sphingosine-bound structures, indicating a stable Asp235 salt bridge critical for catalysis (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>,<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">b</xref>)<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. Interestingly, the D235N mutation enhances R-loop dynamics and shifts the population toward longer distances, indicating salt bridge disruption (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>,<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">d</xref>). This effect is also evident in CW-EPR spectra compared with the WT protein<sup><xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup>. The S159&#x02013;T222 pair monitors changes near Ser225 (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> and <xref rid="F10" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 4</xref>), revealing three distinct conformations: one matching the sphingosine-bound crystal structure (red arrow), and two representing novel intermediates (blue and black arrows; <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref>,<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">f</xref>). Interestingly, AlphaFold modeling of phosphorylated SK1 (Ser225<sup>P</sup>) predicts a conformation where Ser225<sup>P</sup> forms a salt bridge with His156/Arg162, replacing Asp235, while the Asp235&#x02013;His355 salt bridge remains intact (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2j</xref>). Importantly, this configuration matches the experimentally determined DEER ensemble in the Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ATP-bound state (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2f</xref>). Mass spectrometry confirms Ser225 phosphorylation in our constructs, consistent with the DEER data. As expected, the phosphomimetic S225D shifts the equilibrium toward the phosphorylated conformation (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2g</xref>, red arrow), whereas the phospho-null S225A mutation stabilizes an intermediate conformation (between the red and blue arrows) distinct from WT, S225D, and phosphorylated AlphaFold model (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2h</xref>).</p><p id="P14">To further investigate the rearrangement of salt bridges between the R-loop and the strand pair connecting the NTD to the CTD upon Ser225 phosphorylation, we conducted all-atom equilibrium MD simulations in the presence and absence of ligands and R-loop phosphorylation (<xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 5</xref>). MD simulations further show that Ser225 phosphorylation stabilizes salt bridges with His156/Arg162 and reconfigures the R-loop, especially in the presence of substrates (<xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 5b</xref> and Supplementary Video 1). Thus, consistent with the DEER measurements (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">g</xref>), substrate binding mutually and allosterically stabilizes this R-loop conformation. Although phosphorylation alone can form these bridges, they are less stable without substrates (<xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 5b</xref> and Supplementary Video 2). Asp235 consistently maintains interaction with His355, but its salt bridge with His156 weakens upon phosphorylation (<xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 5c</xref>). These results underscore Ser225 phosphorylation as a key allosteric switch for adopting a catalytically competent conformation.</p><p id="P15">A third, long-distance R-loop state is frequently observed in detergent (black arrows, <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>,<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">e</xref>,<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">g</xref>,<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">h</xref> and <xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Figs. 3</xref>,<xref rid="F10" ref-type="fig">4</xref>), potentially representing an oligomeric form of SK1 (see <xref rid="S8" ref-type="sec">Discussion</xref>).

Additional residues, such as Asn89 and Glu93 (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2i</xref>)<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>, may also contribute to phosphorylation-induced membrane targeting.

The longest-distance intermediate is more populated in the catalytic complex (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>,<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">d</xref>), while PF-543-bound state preferentially populates shorter-distance intermediates, with or without Mg<sup>2+</sup>ATP (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>,<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">e</xref>,<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">g</xref>). For the T136-T193 pair, this domain configuration aligns with the PF-543-bound crystal structure, suggesting that PF-543 stabilizes a non-catalytic conformation, unlike sphingosine or SKI-II, regardless of Mg<sup>2+</sup>ATP binding. In contrast, the catalytic complex maintains LBL-1 flexibility (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1b</xref> and <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>), which likely supports S1P production and release.

In contrast, the Trp372R1 spectrum exhibited sharper, narrower lines, suggesting a more flexible conformation and greater mobility for this site and subsequent residues. Given predominant Ser225 phosphorylation in our constructs, this supports a model in which the tail is released from its potential tethering to the core protein. DEER distance distributions between these residues and Thr136 suggest that the C-terminal tail adopts multiple conformations (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>,<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">d</xref> and <xref rid="F13" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 7</xref>), with functional implications that warrant further investigation.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>SK1 forms dimers via distinct interfaces modulated by ligands and membrane context</title><p id="P18">SK1 dimerization has been demonstrated in cells using immunoprecipitation assays<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>.

However, these putative dimer interfaces have yet to be confirmed by biophysical methods and require further investigation. Using mass photometry, we observed SK1 dimerization (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref>). Notably, in the PF-543-bound structure (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>), the hydrophobic residues involved in membrane binding (Leu194, Phe197, Leu198) mediate dimerization, whereas in the SKI-II-bound structure (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>), these same residues remain exposed and aligned for membrane interaction. To probe the quaternary structure of the SK1 dimer in both detergent and liposome-bound states, we used DEER spectroscopy with singly labeled SK1 protomers (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5d</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">n</xref>).

Distance populations consistent with both CTD- and NTD-mediated dimer models were observed at labeled sites T136 and S36 under different ligand-bound conditions. For S36, the predicted distance in the CTD-mediated dimer is too short to be captured in the DEER distance ensemble (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5h</xref>,<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">i</xref>), while the NTD-mediated state appears under multiple conditions. Interestingly, for position T136, the CTD-mediated dimer is more populated in the catalytic complex with Mg<sup>2+</sup>ATP/sphingosine (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5f</xref>). Importantly, primary DEER traces showed increased modulation depth under the PF-543-bound condition (<xref rid="F14" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 8</xref>), indicating enhanced oligomerization under this condition. At position V366 on the C-terminal tail, DEER revealed a well-defined short-distance population in the catalytic complex, alongside a broad, long-distance component. Due to the absence of resolved structural data for the C-terminal tail, the structural significance remains unclear. However, if these intermediates are functionally relevant, they may explain the CW EPR spectrum at this site (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>), which suggests a partially tethered or in contact conformation of the tail&#x02019;s N-terminal region rather than a fully untethered state observed for the position W372.

A key finding is that lipid-binding loop (LBL) dynamics gate sphingosine entry into the active site, with the potent inhibitor PF-543 locking the LBLs in a closed, less dynamic conformation that blocks ligand exchange (<xref rid="F15" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 9a</xref>). A major breakthrough is the discovery that phosphorylation of Ser225 may trigger a reconfiguration of the R-loop and the overall SK1 structure into a catalytically competent state. Comprehensive MD simulations reveal a reshuffling of salt bridges involving positively charged residues on the strand pairs connecting the two SK1 lobes&#x02014;potentially facilitating membrane engagement (<xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Figs. 5</xref> and <xref rid="F16" ref-type="fig">10</xref>) and release of the C-terminal tail. These simulations uncover phosphorylation- and ligand-dependent shifts in the balance between electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions in membrane engagement, suggesting a dynamic mechanism by which SK1 senses and responds to the membrane environment (<xref rid="F16" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 10</xref>). The catalytically active SK1 adopts a previously uncharacterized conformation&#x02014;distinct from known apo or ligand-bound structures&#x02014;featuring a highly dynamic LBL-1 region that is sensitive to PF-543, which globally stabilizes a non-catalytic state (<xref rid="F15" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 9</xref>). Furthermore, SK1 forms dimers through distinct ligand- and membrane-dependent interfaces.</p><p id="P20">Defining the molecular inhibitory mechanism of potent inhibitors like PF-543 is crucial for developing more effective therapeutic modulators.

This dynamic core appears to transition through three intermediates essential for both phosphoryl transfer and release of synthesized S1P. Notably, PF-543&#x02014;regardless of Mg<sup>2+</sup>ATP presence&#x02014;shifts the equilibrium among these intermediates, effectively inhibiting catalysis or ligand exchange (<xref rid="F15" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 9a</xref>). This inhibitory effect extends to the dimeric conformation of SK1 (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> and <xref rid="F15" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 9</xref>) and the regulatory loop (<xref rid="F15" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 9b</xref>).</p><p id="P21">Interestingly, PF-543 appears to stabilize a dimeric configuration similar to that observed in the PF-543 crystal structure (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figs. 5a</xref> and <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref>), suggesting a functionally relevant state rather than a crystallographic artifact. A long-distance intermediate, potentially corresponding to this dimeric form, becomes more populated upon PF-543 binding (purple arrows; <xref rid="F15" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 9b</xref>), indicating a catalytically inactive SK1 state in which key membrane-interfacing elements (Leu194, Phe197, and Leu198 in LBL-1) are sequestered within the dimeric interface (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a</xref>). The presence of a CTD-mediated dimeric structure provides a mechanistic rationale for the CIB1-dependent membrane translocation of SK1, as CIB1 engages SK1 through the same hydrophobic residues in LBL-1 (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6b</xref>). Upon calcium binding, CIB1 undergoes a structural transition that exposes both a membrane-targeting N-terminal myristoyl group and a groove for partner protein interaction&#x02014;the latter formed by the unfolding of a C-terminal helix (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6c</xref>). Simultaneously, Ser225 phosphorylation partially replaces Asp235 in the R-loop, reconfiguring salt bridges with positively charged residues on the strand pair connecting the two domains (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> inset, states 1 to 2; <xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 5</xref>). This reconfiguration may induce conformational changes in the strand pair that stabilize a catalytically competent state for sphingosine extraction from the membrane and Mg<sup>2+</sup>ATP binding at the catalytic core (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6d</xref>). Notably, our MD simulations indicate that with phosphorylation and Mg<sup>2+</sup>ATP/sphingosine binding, one of the connecting strands becomes significantly more stable, potentially stabilizing the catalytic complex (<xref rid="F16" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 10b</xref>). This strand connects to the SK1 C-terminal tail. Consistently, in our DEER constructs where Ser225 is predominantly phosphorylated or mutated to the phosphomimetic S225D, this R-loop conformation appears particularly stabilized in the presence of MgATP or MgATP/Sph (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">g</xref>). Additionally, MD analyses reveal distinct membrane interaction patterns for key membrane-interfacing determinants in phosphorylated versus non-phosphorylated SK1 (<xref rid="F16" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Figs. 10c</xref> and <xref rid="F16" ref-type="fig">10d</xref>). Electrostatic interactions between basic residues and anionic lipids are significantly diminished in the MgATP/Sph-bound phosphorylated protein, while hydrophobic interactions increase. In the apo state, Arg186 and Lys27 preferentially interact with SAPI over POPS, with Arg186 also contacting POPE. In the phosphorylated apo state, the hydrophobic patch shows increased contact with POPS. Overall, the lipid contact frequency of the hydrophobic patch and Arg186 remains high across different states, whereas lipid interactions involving Lys27 are significantly reduced, and those involving Lys29 are slightly increased upon Ser225 phosphorylation (<xref rid="F16" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 10d</xref>). The residues involved in this long-range allosteric transmission will be further investigated through mutational analysis and conformational dynamics studies using DEER spectroscopy. Conserved acidic residues in the C-terminal tail (e.g., Glu381) have also been proposed to interact with the same positively charged residues in the connecting strand pair (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> inset, state 3)<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>, thereby stabilizing an inactive conformation&#x02014;potentially by misaligning key membrane-interacting elements, similar to the conformation stabilized by PF-543 (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e</xref>,<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">g</xref>). In this context, Ser225 phosphorylation and R-loop reconfiguration may release the C-terminal tail, a conformation we observe experimentally (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>), though this observation warrants further investigation.

In the apo state, Arg186 and Lys27 preferentially interact with SAPI over POPS, with Arg186 also contacting POPE. In Apo(Ser225P) state, the hydrophobic patch shows increased contact with POPS.

(<bold>b</bold>) CIB1 (PDB code 1XO5) binds to monomeric SK1 (PDB code 3VZB-A) by recognizing the now-exposed hydrophobic residues in LBL-1. Upon calcium binding, CIB1 undergoes a structural transition that exposes a membrane-targeting N-terminal myris toyl group and forms a groove for SK1 interaction via unfolding of a C-terminal helix (<bold>c</bold>; AF3 model). Simultaneously, phosphorylation of Ser225 partially displaces Asp235 in the R-loop, reshaping the salt bridge network with positively charged residues in the strand pair linking the NTD and CTD (inset: transition from state <bold>1</bold> [PDB code 3VZB-A] to state <bold>2</bold> [AF3 model]). This rearrangement drives conformational changes that stabilize a catalytically active state for sphingosine extraction and Mg<sup>2+</sup>ATP binding (<bold>d</bold>; AF3 model). Conserved acidic residues in the C-terminal tail (e.g., Glu381) may also interact with the same positively charged residues in the strand pair (inset: state <bold>3</bold>; AF3 model), stabilizing an inactive conformation&#x02014;potentially by misaligning membrane-interfacing elements, similar to the PF-543-bound state. In this context, Ser225 phosphorylation and R-loop rearrangement may facilitate release of the C-terminal tail, a conformation supported by our experimental observations.
