Chemotherapeutic agents, such as cisplatin, are commonly used in OS treatment; however, drug resistance markedly undermines treatment efficacy and contributes to reduced patient survival. The mechanisms underlying cisplatin resistance remain poorly understood. Recently, palmitoyl-protein thioesterase 1 (PPT1), a depalmitoylation enzyme, has attracted attention for its role in tumorigenesis and drug resistance. Investigating the mechanisms of PPT1 may offer new strategies to overcome resistance. <bold>Methods:</bold> This study analyzed multiple Gene Expression Omnibus datasets and utilized the OncoPredict tool to demonstrate the elevated expression of PPT1 in OS and its critical role in cisplatin resistance. By combining single-cell analysis with in&#x000a0;vitro and in&#x000a0;vivo experiments, we explored how PPT1 influences OS development through depalmitoylation and assessed the antitumor effects of the PPT1 inhibitor Ezurpimtrostat (GNS561), as well as its synergistic effects when combined with cisplatin. <bold>Results:</bold> We demonstrated that Sprouty 4 (SPRY4) undergoes a dynamic palmitoylation cycle regulated by zinc finger DHHC-type palmitoyl transferase 7 (ZDHHC7) and PPT1, which modulates mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling and subsequently affects tumor cell proliferation, migration, apoptosis, and drug resistance. Further validation confirmed the effectiveness of the PPT1 inhibitor GNS561 in overcoming cisplatin resistance. Notably, GNS561 exhibited a significant synergistic effect when used in combination with cisplatin, greatly enhancing the sensitivity of cisplatin-resistant cells. <bold>Conclusion:</bold> This study highlights the pivotal role of PPT1 in OS resistance mechanisms. PPT1 and ZDHHC7 regulate SPRY4 through a dynamic palmitoylation&#x02013;depalmitoylation cycle that modulates MAPK signaling activation and contributes to OS cell proliferation, migration, and drug resistance. As a PPT1 inhibitor, GNS561 not only inhibits OS cell proliferation but also demonstrates synergistic effects with cisplatin, significantly enhancing cisplatin sensitivity in resistant cells and promoting apoptosis. Our findings offer a novel approach for targeting PPT1 in therapeutic strategies. GNS561 holds promise as an adjunctive therapy when combined with cisplatin, potentially overcoming resistance and improving efficacy, thereby enhancing the prognosis for OS patients. Future studies should further investigate the clinical potential of GNS561 and optimize OS treatment strategies.</p></abstract><funding-group specific-use="FundRef"><award-group id="ID0EJHAG27914"><funding-source>

The estimated annual incidence in children and adolescents has risen to between 3 and 4.5 cases per million, peaking during the pubertal growth spurt, especially at the rapidly growing metaphyseal ends of long bones [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Cisplatin, a widely used chemotherapeutic agent, exerts its cytotoxic effects by disrupting DNA replication [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In recent years, treatment advances have been made with surgery combined with the MAP regimen, which includes cisplatin, methotrexate, and doxorubicin [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. However, chemotherapy resistance not only reduces treatment efficacy but also markedly lowers long-term survival rates, increasing the risk of recurrence and metastasis. For patients with metastatic or recurrent disease, the 5-year survival rate remains below 20% [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Resistance to chemotherapy has become a major therapeutic challenge, and postsurgical resistance to adjuvant chemotherapy further heightens the likelihood of recurrence and metastasis. The mechanisms underlying cisplatin resistance remain incompletely understood, with potential factors including reduced drug accumulation in tumor cells, inactivation of cisplatin following binding to intracellular glutathione and metallothioneins, and enhanced DNA repair by tumor cells to evade immune attack [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The combined effects of these mechanisms markedly impair the anticancer efficacy of cisplatin. Despite progress in understanding these mechanisms, no effective clinical strategies have been developed to overcome cisplatin resistance.</p><p>Recent studies have revealed that palmitoyl-protein thioesterase 1 (PPT1) is closely associated with the initiation, progression, and drug resistance of various malignant tumors [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. PPT1 functions as a critical depalmitoylation enzyme, while palmitoylation, a key posttranslational modification, involves the addition of palmitoyl groups to proteins. This modification influences protein membrane localization, stability, and function, thereby regulating biological processes such as cell signaling, proliferation, and differentiation [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Depalmitoylation, the reverse of palmitoylation, is catalyzed by enzymes like PPT1, which markedly affect cellular behavior. In various tumor types, PPT1 exhibits consistent functions that are closely tied to tumor progression, immune evasion, and chemotherapy resistance. Studies have shown that PPT1 is overexpressed in multiple malignant tumors and is strongly linked to tumor progression. For example, in oral squamous cell carcinoma, PPT1 promotes tumor cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, thereby enhancing tumor cell survival [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In hepatocellular carcinoma, PPT1 induces resistance to sorafenib by regulating autophagy [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. These findings suggest that PPT1 may influence chemotherapy efficacy by modulating the metabolism and survival mechanisms within tumor cells. Therefore, further investigation into the molecular mechanisms underlying OS drug resistance, along with the development of targeted therapeutic strategies, is essential to improve the prognosis of OS patients.</p><p>Building on the previous background, we hypothesize that PPT1 regulates the initiation and progression of OS through depalmitoylation mechanisms. Specifically, PPT1 may enhance drug resistance, as well as tumor proliferation and invasion, in OS cells via depalmitoylation. If validated, this hypothesis will elucidate the specific mechanisms of PPT1 in OS and identify potential new therapeutic targets. Therefore, investigating the role of PPT1 in OS not only is scientifically significant but also holds promise for providing novel therapeutic strategies to improve the prognosis of OS patients.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec3"><title>Elevated expression of PPT1 in OS</title><p>To explore the potential role of PPT1 in OS, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of several publicly available datasets, including GSE11416, GSE12865, GSE28425, and GSE14359, using bioinformatics approaches. The results revealed that PPT1 expression was significantly elevated in primary OS tumor tissues compared to normal tissues (Fig. <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A to D). This finding was further corroborated by analysis of PPT1 expression in different cell lines: compared to normal osteoblast cell lines, PPT1 was markedly up-regulated in various OS cell lines, with the highest expression in MG63 cells and the lowest among OS cells in U2OS cells (Fig. <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>E). To assess the relationship between PPT1 expression and patient prognosis, Kaplan&#x02013;Meier survival analyses were performed using the TARGET and GSE21257 databases. The results indicated that high PPT1 expression was significantly associated with poor prognosis in OS patients (Fig. <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>F and Fig. <xref rid="supplementary-material-1" ref-type="sec">S1</xref>). These findings suggest that PPT1 plays a pivotal role in the onset and progression of OS. Therefore, we conclude that the elevated expression of PPT1 in OS tissues and cells is closely linked to poor prognosis and may markedly contribute to OS progression.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>PPT1 overexpression in osteosarcoma (OS).

To investigate the potential role of PPT1 in drug sensitivity, we utilized the OncoPredict algorithm to systematically analyze gene expression data from multiple datasets, including GSE16091, GSE39055, TARGET, and GSE21257. The analysis revealed that elevated PPT1 expression was strongly correlated with increased 50% inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub> )values for various drugs, suggesting a pivotal role for PPT1 in multidrug resistance mechanisms (Fig. <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A to E). To further support this hypothesis, molecular docking analyses were conducted to examine the direct interactions between the PPT1 protein and 4 commonly used first-line chemotherapy drugs for OS: cisplatin, doxorubicin, ifosfamide, and methotrexate. The results identified multiple potential binding sites between PPT1 and these drug molecules, providing additional evidence for PPT1&#x02019;s involvement in OS resistance mechanisms (Fig. <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>F). Moreover, cisplatin-resistant OS cell lines were established [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], and elevated PPT1 expression levels were confirmed using reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and Western blot analyses (Fig. <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>G and H). These findings indicate that PPT1 overexpression not only is associated with chemotherapy resistance in OS cells but also may drive resistance development through direct interactions with chemotherapeutic agents. In conclusion, our study underscores the critical role of PPT1 in cisplatin resistance in OS and identifies it as a promising therapeutic target for overcoming drug resistance in future treatments.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Fig. 2.</label><caption><p>Elevated PPT1 expression and its role in multidrug resistance in OS.

Tumors derived from PPT1-knockdown cells exhibited substantially reduced volume and weight compared to the control group, whereas tumors in the PPT1-overexpression group displayed notable increases in both parameters (Fig. <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>K to M). Immunofluorescence analysis demonstrated a significant increase in apoptosis within tumor tissues from the PPT1-knockdown group. Furthermore, hematoxylin and eosin (H&#x00026;E) staining and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assays confirmed that PPT1 inhibits tumor cell apoptosis (Fig. <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>N to P). Collectively, these findings highlight the critical role of PPT1 in OS progression by promoting cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, while suppressing apoptosis.</p><p>To further validate the functional role of PPT1 in OS cell migration and invasion, Transwell migration and invasion assays were conducted. The results revealed that PPT1 knockdown significantly suppressed the migration and invasion abilities of MG63/R cells, whereas PPT1 overexpression markedly enhanced these capabilities in U2OS/R cells (Fig. <xref rid="supplementary-material-1" ref-type="sec">S2</xref>A and B). These findings indicate that PPT1 may drive the invasive progression of OS by facilitating migration and invasion.</p><p>To evaluate the impact of PPT1 on the cell cycle, flow cytometry was used to analyze the effects of PPT1 knockdown and overexpression. PPT1 knockdown led to a significant increase in the proportion of cells in the G1/G0 phase and a concomitant decrease in the S and G2/M phases, suggesting that PPT1 deficiency may induce cell cycle arrest (Fig. <xref rid="supplementary-material-1" ref-type="sec">S2</xref>C). Conversely, PPT1 overexpression facilitated cell entry into the S and G2/M phases, indicating that PPT1 up-regulation may promote cell cycle progression and enhance proliferative capacity.</p><p>Furthermore, to investigate the role of PPT1 in apoptosis, apoptosis levels were assessed using flow cytometry. PPT1 knockdown significantly increased the proportions of early and late apoptotic cells, whereas PPT1 overexpression markedly reduced apoptosis rates (Fig. <xref rid="supplementary-material-1" ref-type="sec">S2</xref>D and E). These results highlight a potential role of PPT1 in suppressing apoptosis.</p><p>To corroborate these findings, Western blot analysis was performed to assess the expression of apoptosis- and epithelial&#x02013;mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related proteins. PPT1 knockdown up-regulated the expression of pro-apoptotic proteins BAX and cleaved caspase-3 while down-regulating the anti-apoptotic protein BCL2, further confirming the role of PPT1 in promoting apoptosis (Fig. <xref rid="supplementary-material-1" ref-type="sec">S2</xref>F). Moreover, PPT1 knockdown significantly inhibited the EMT process, as demonstrated by increased E-cadherin expression and decreased N-cadherin and vimentin expression (Fig. <xref rid="supplementary-material-1" ref-type="sec">S2</xref>G). These findings suggest that PPT1 may enhance the migratory and invasive capacities of OS cells by driving EMT.</p><p>Furthermore, we examined whether PPT1 overexpression could enhance cisplatin resistance in the parental OS cell lines MG63 and U2OS. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="supplementary-material-1" ref-type="sec">S3</xref>A, PPT1 was overexpressed in these cell lines, after which their sensitivity to cisplatin was assessed. Following cisplatin treatment, the PPT1-overexpressing group exhibited significantly higher IC<sub>50</sub> values in the Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay compared to the control group, indicating that PPT1 overexpression increased cisplatin resistance in MG63 and U2OS cells (Fig. <xref rid="supplementary-material-1" ref-type="sec">S3</xref>). Additionally, PPT1 overexpression markedly promoted cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, while significantly reducing apoptosis (Fig. <xref rid="supplementary-material-1" ref-type="sec">S3</xref>C to H). These results further support the role of PPT1 in mediating chemoresistance in tumor cells.</p><p>In summary, PPT1 plays a pivotal role in the malignant progression of OS by promoting cell proliferation, migration, and invasion; suppressing apoptosis; and enhancing cisplatin resistance.</p><p>To investigate the effects of PPT1 knockdown on trabecular and cortical bone in an orthotopic OS model, we performed 3-dimensional reconstruction and bone structure analysis of femurs and tibias from the shPPT1 and control (shNC) groups using micro-CT technology, followed by quantification of relevant bone parameters.</p><p>Three-dimensional reconstruction and cross-sectional CT images revealed significant differences between the groups (Fig. <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A to N).

In terms of cellular components, PPT1 was linked to the extracellular matrix, nuclear matrix, and chromatin regions, suggesting involvement in cytoskeletal reorganization and gene expression regulation. At the molecular function level, PPT1 was associated with adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding, nucleotide binding, and catalytic activity, underscoring its roles in energy metabolism and signal transduction. KEGG analysis showed significant enrichment of differentially expressed genes in cancer-related and drug resistance pathways, including the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and FoxO signaling pathways (Fig. <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>G). These results emphasize PPT1&#x02019;s influence on tumor cell behavior, particularly in drug resistance, tumorigenesis, and signal transduction.

GSVA (Fig. <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>H) and GSEA (Fig. <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>I) revealed up-regulation of functional and metabolic pathways in cells with high PPT1 expression, especially those related to drug resistance and tumor progression.

Screening for highly variable genes, QC analyses, and clustering provided a comprehensive perspective on cellular heterogeneity. Further analysis of malignant osteoblasts identified significant differences in PPT1 expression across cell populations. Differential expression and functional enrichment analyses highlighted PPT1-related genes&#x02019; involvement in key biological processes and signaling pathways, particularly the MAPK signaling pathway, underscoring PPT1&#x02019;s pivotal role in OS progression.

Across the MG63/R and U2OS/R cell lines, we identified 37 proteins interacting with PPT1, indicating their potential roles in PPT1-regulated biological processes. To pinpoint key interacting proteins, we selected the 5 most abundant candidates from the mass spectrometry results and validated their interactions using Co-IP experiments. The results demonstrated that PPT1 directly interacts with Sprouty 4 (SPRY4), whereas interactions with CD36, FLOX1, NOD2, and LMNA were negligible (Fig. <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>D). As an inhibitor of the MAPK pathway, SPRY4 negatively regulates ERK activation via feedback inhibition. PPT1&#x02019;s interaction with SPRY4 likely relieves this inhibition, thereby enhancing MAPK pathway activation. Additionally, analysis of the GSE28425 dataset revealed significantly lower SPRY4 expression in OS tissues compared to normal tissues (Fig. <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>H). Kaplan&#x02013;Meier survival analysis further showed that higher SPRY4 expression correlates with better prognosis in OS patients (Fig. <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>I), suggesting that SPRY4 may function as a tumor suppressor in OS. Interestingly, our findings indicated that PPT1 knockdown significantly increased SPRY4 protein levels, while PPT1 overexpression decreased them (Fig. <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>E). However, SPRY4 mRNA levels remained unchanged under these conditions (Fig. <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>F), suggesting that PPT1 regulates SPRY4 protein stability and degradation via posttranslational modifications, such as depalmitoylation. Molecular docking analysis further supported this hypothesis, identifying multiple potential binding sites between PPT1 and SPRY4 (Fig. <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>G).</p><p>Given PPT1&#x02019;s depalmitoylating function, we hypothesized that PPT1 activates the MAPK pathway by regulating SPRY4 activity through depalmitoylation.

In PPT1-knockdown MG63/R cells, resin-assisted capture (RAC) experiments revealed a significant increase in SPRY4 palmitoylation levels (Fig. <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>K). Click chemistry experiments corroborated this finding, demonstrating that PPT1 knockdown significantly enhanced SPRY4 palmitoylation (Fig. <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>L). To identify the critical palmitoylation site, we generated SPRY4 mutants at C165, C224, and C250.

In contrast, PPT1 overexpression suppressed apoptosis, and SPRY4 overexpression further diminished apoptosis levels (Fig. <xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>J).

To investigate their interaction, we performed Co-IP assays and confirmed a direct interaction between SPRY4 and ZDHHC7 (Fig. <xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>A). Furthermore, analysis of the GSE14359 dataset revealed that ZDHHC7 expression was significantly lower in OS tissues compared to normal tissues (Fig. <xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>B). Kaplan&#x02013;Meier survival analysis showed that high ZDHHC7 expression was significantly associated with improved prognosis in OS patients (Fig. <xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>C), suggesting a potential tumor-suppressive role for ZDHHC7 in OS development. Accordingly, we performed both knockdown and overexpression of ZDHHC7 in the MG63/R cell line (Fig. <xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>D). Notably, ZDHHC7 overexpression led to a significant increase in SPRY4 protein levels (Fig. <xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>E), while its mRNA levels remained unchanged (Fig. <xref rid="supplementary-material-1" ref-type="sec">S5</xref>C), suggesting posttranscriptional regulation.

H&#x00026;E staining of major organs (heart, liver, spleen, lung, and kidney) from each mouse group revealed preserved tissue architecture without notable inflammatory cell infiltration, necrosis, or other pathological abnormalities (Fig. <xref rid="supplementary-material-1" ref-type="sec">S9</xref>A), indicating that GNS561 did not cause significant organ toxicity. Furthermore, complete blood count and liver and kidney function analyses showed no signs of systemic toxicity in the GNS561#1 and GNS561#2 groups compared to the control group, further supporting the favorable in&#x000a0;vivo safety profile of GNS561 (Fig. <xref rid="supplementary-material-1" ref-type="sec">S9</xref>B).</p><p>The schematic model further illustrates the palmitoylation cycle of SPRY4 and its regulatory role in OS, highlighting the potential mechanism by which GNS561 modulates the MAPK signaling pathway via PPT1 inhibition (Fig. <xref rid="F10" ref-type="fig">10</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F10"><label>Fig. 10.</label><caption><p>Schematic illustration of the palmitoylation cycle of SPRY4 and its regulatory mechanism in OS.

Despite advancements in treatment combining surgery and chemotherapy, such as cisplatin, the therapeutic efficacy remains markedly limited by the heterogeneity of OS and the development of cisplatin resistance [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. This is particularly evident in cases of recurrence or metastasis, where patients exhibit poor prognoses and an event-free survival rate below 20% [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Although cisplatin is widely utilized in the treatment of various cancers [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], the underlying mechanisms of cisplatin resistance in OS are not yet fully understood [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Recent research indicates that protein depalmitoylation, mediated by depalmitoylating enzymes like PPT1, is crucial in regulating cell signaling, proliferation, and drug resistance by modulating protein stability and function, ultimately influencing tumor cell behavior [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In this study, we systematically investigated the role of PPT1 in OS and observed its elevated expression in OS tissues and cell lines. Our findings demonstrate that PPT1 activates the MAPK signaling pathway through depalmitoylation, thereby enhancing tumor cell proliferation and invasion while contributing to cisplatin resistance. Additionally, we validated the effectiveness of the PPT1 inhibitor GNS561 in&#x000a0;vitro and in&#x000a0;vivo, highlighting its potential to mitigate cisplatin resistance in OS. These findings provide valuable insights into the regulatory mechanisms of PPT1, suggesting novel therapeutic strategies and offering hope for improving the prognosis of OS patients.</p><p>Palmitoylation is a vital posttranslational modification that involves the attachment of palmitoyl groups to proteins, affecting their membrane localization, stability, and function. This modification plays a critical role in regulating cellular processes such as signaling, proliferation, and differentiation [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Conversely, depalmitoylation, the reverse process [<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], is mediated by depalmitoylating enzymes like PPT1, which remove palmitoyl groups from proteins [<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. In this study, we integrated scRNA-seq and bulk sequencing (Bulk-seq) datasets to identify PPT1, a gene highly expressed in OS and linked to depalmitoylation. Using the OncoPredict algorithm, we uncovered a strong association between PPT1 expression and chemotherapy resistance. Experimental validation revealed that elevated PPT1 expression is closely related to tumor cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and drug resistance in OS. Further analyses, including GO, KEGG, GSVA, and GSEA, shed light on the potential functions of PPT1 in OS, emphasizing its roles in drug resistance, tumor-promoting responses, and cellular signaling regulation. Notably, PPT1&#x02019;s significant enrichment in the MAPK signaling pathway highlights its aberrant activation and close association with tumor cell proliferation and survival.</p><p>To further elucidate the mechanism of PPT1, we investigated its potential interaction with SPRY4, a key negative regulator of the MAPK pathway [<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Using various experimental approaches, we comprehensively analyzed how PPT1 regulates SPRY4 function via depalmitoylation, emphasizing the critical role of the C165 site in this process. Co-IP and mass spectrometry analyses confirmed the interaction between PPT1 and SPRY4, suggesting a functional association. Molecular docking simulations further supported this interaction and identified multiple potential binding sites. While these findings provided theoretical evidence, experimental validation of the key target sites was necessary. Accordingly, we conducted RAC and click chemistry experiments to assess PPT1&#x02019;s regulatory effect on SPRY4 palmitoylation. The results showed that PPT1 knockdown significantly increased SPRY4 palmitoylation levels.</p><p>To identify the critical palmitoylation site of SPRY4, we constructed SPRY4 mutants at C165, C224, and C250. The results revealed that only the mutation at the C165 site significantly reduced SPRY4 palmitoylation levels, while mutations at the other sites had no comparable effect. Palmitoylation is an enzyme-mediated modification that typically occurs at cysteine (Cys) residues [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. The mutation of the C165 site disrupts this specific modification site, preventing SPRY4 from undergoing palmitoylation at this position. PPT1 facilitates SPRY4 protein degradation through depalmitoylation, and the significant reduction in SPRY4 palmitoylation caused by the C165 mutation may impair its binding to PPT1 or alter target recognition. Without effective palmitoylation, PPT1 is unable to regulate SPRY4 protein stability, which may disrupt the MAPK signaling pathway. Notably, our study further revealed that SPRY4 stability is regulated by ZDHHC7. As a known palmitoyltransferase [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], ZDHHC7 directly interacts with SPRY4, as confirmed by Co-IP assays. Functional experiments showed that ZDHHC7 overexpression significantly enhanced SPRY4 palmitoylation, whereas ZDHHC7 knockdown markedly reduced this modification. Furthermore, in the C165 mutant, ZDHHC7 overexpression failed to restore SPRY4 palmitoylation, further confirming C165 as the critical site for this modification.</p><p>In summary, we propose a regulatory axis centered on SPRY4: ZDHHC7 promotes SPRY4 stabilization via palmitoylation, while PPT1 facilitates its degradation through depalmitoylation. This antagonistic regulation by ZDHHC7 and PPT1 collectively modulates MAPK pathway activation, thereby influencing OS development. Targeting SPRY4 palmitoylation&#x02014;particularly at the critical C165 site&#x02014;may represent a promising therapeutic strategy for MAPK-driven tumors and for overcoming cisplatin resistance.</p><p>GNS561 is a novel PPT1 inhibitor that has garnered significant attention for its potent antitumor activity across various cancers. By specifically targeting PPT1, GNS561 disrupts the autophagy pathway in tumor cells, leading to lysosomal membrane permeabilization [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. This process ultimately inhibits tumor cell proliferation and survival by inducing apoptosis. Studies have highlighted the therapeutic potential of GNS561 in cancer treatment through mechanisms such as lysosomal dysfunction and zinc accumulation [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In preclinical studies, GNS561 has demonstrated remarkable antitumor activity in solid tumors, including hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma, effectively reducing tumor volume and significantly delaying tumor progression. Its mechanisms of action include lysosomal dysfunction, zinc accumulation, mTOR pathway dysregulation, and autophagic flux blockade mediated by PPT1 inhibition [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. With favorable pharmacokinetic properties and a strong safety profile, GNS561 has shown efficacy and tolerability in multiple clinical trials. Notably, phase I clinical trials for liver and biliary cancers have confirmed its safety and achieved tumor stabilization in some patients [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. For OS, the PPT1 inhibitory effects of GNS561 have also demonstrated significant efficacy. Our in&#x000a0;vitro and in&#x000a0;vivo experiments revealed that GNS561 effectively inhibits OS cell proliferation and migration while inducing apoptosis, with the most pronounced effects observed at IC<sub>50</sub> concentrations. Subsequent experiments showed a clear dose-dependent response, with higher concentrations of GNS561 enhancing tumor cell growth inhibition and apoptosis induction. Stronger antitumor effects at concentrations exceeding the IC<sub>50</sub> further support GNS561&#x02019;s potential as a candidate drug for OS treatment. Moreover, GNS561 exhibited synergistic effects when combined with cisplatin, significantly improving cisplatin efficacy in drug-resistant OS cells. This was evidenced by reduced colony-forming ability and increased apoptosis rates. These findings suggest that GNS561 modulates cisplatin resistance in OS cells through PPT1 inhibition. Our results indicate that combining GNS561 with cisplatin not only enhances the effectiveness of chemotherapy but also holds significant promise as a strategy to overcome cisplatin resistance.</p><p>This study systematically elucidates the pivotal role of PPT1 in the mechanisms underlying drug resistance in OS. We demonstrated that SPRY4 undergoes a dynamic palmitoylation cycle regulated by ZDHHC7 and PPT1, which modulates MAPK signaling and subsequently affects tumor cell proliferation, migration, apoptosis, and drug resistance. Experimental validation confirmed the efficacy of GNS561, a PPT1 inhibitor, in overcoming cisplatin resistance. GNS561 significantly inhibited OS cell proliferation and migration and, when combined with cisplatin, exhibited synergistic effects by enhancing cisplatin sensitivity in resistant cells and markedly increasing apoptosis rates. These findings highlight PPT1 as a critical factor in OS progression and drug resistance, providing a foundation for future therapeutic strategies targeting PPT1. GNS561 holds promise as an effective adjuvant therapy by enhancing cisplatin efficacy, overcoming resistance, and ultimately improving patient outcomes. Further research is warranted to explore the clinical potential of GNS561, focusing on validating its safety and efficacy in OS patients to optimize treatment strategies for this aggressive cancer.</p></sec><sec id="sec10"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec11"><title>Data collection</title><p>scRNA-seq data were retrieved from the GSE152048 [<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] and GSE162454 [<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>] datasets, with GSE152048 including data from 11 OS patients and GSE162454 from 6 OS patients.

The HSA model defines synergism as the response from a combination being greater than the response from either drug alone. The LOEWE model considers the dose&#x02013;response relationship of each drug and calculates the expected additive response; if the response is higher than expected, it is marked as synergistic. The ZIP model evaluates the effect of a 2-drug combination, assuming that each drug does not affect the efficacy of the other.</p></sec><sec id="sec30"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data were analyzed using SPSS 21.0 and GraphPad 9.0.
