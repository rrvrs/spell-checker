The data were collected through a questionnaire comprised of demographic information and the following scales: The Short Form Health Survey-12 (SF-12), the Amputee Body Image Scale (ABIS-R), and the Rosenberg scale (RSES), in order to assess HRQoL, body image disturbance, and self-esteem respectively. The SPSS statistical software (v.26) was used for the statistical analysis of the data.</p></sec><sec id="sec1816"><title>Results</title><p>
The mean SF-12 score of the participants was 70.31 (SD=16.74). The HRQoL was affected by the following sociodemographic factors: age, educational level, profession, income, marital status, and parenthood. It was also influenced by disability-related factors, such as amputation cause and years of prosthesis use. In particular, young participants reported a better level of HRQoL than the older participants (p&#x0003c;0.001). Participants with a higher education level presented better HRQoL than those with lower education level (p&#x0003c;0.001). Unemployed participants and students presented better HRQoL scores compared to all other professional categories (p=0.001). However, participants with lower incomes &#x0003c;10,000 &#x020ac; reported a lower level of HRQoL (p=0.028). Singles had the highest HRQoL score, while widowers had the lowest (p=0.001). Childfree participants experienced the highest level of HRQoL (p=0.001). Participants whose amputation resulted from an accident reported a better HRQoL compared to those who had an amputation due to Type 2 diabetes (p&#x0003c;0.001). As the years of prosthesis use increase, HRQoL decreases (p=0.001). Regarding the associations between HRQoL, body image disturbance, and self-esteem statistically significant relationships were recorded. More specifically, there is a significant positive relationship between RSES and SF-12 (p&#x0003c;0.001); as participants&#x02019; self-esteem increases, so does their HRQoL. Conversely, a statistically significant negative correlation emerged between SF-12 and ABIS-R (p&#x0003c;0.001); as HRQoL increases, body image disturbance decreases.</p></sec><sec id="sec1817"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The aforementioned factors should be considered in the design and implementation of psychosocial interventions aimed at recovery. Qualitative studies are recommended to explore the lived experiences of PLLA in-depth.</p></sec><sec id="sec1818"><title>Disclosure of Interest</title><p>None Declared</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="1"/></counts></article-meta></front></article>
