This diagnostic method is integral to disease diagnosis and treatment in TCM. Recent research suggests a strong correlation between the characteristics of tongue coating and its microbial composition. These microbial variations may influence the formation and changes in tongue coating and are potentially linked to the progression of specific diseases. However, comprehensive research on the association between tongue coating, its microorganisms, and colorectal cancer (CRC) is limited. Notably, the quantitative aspects of tongue diagnosis and the microbial diversity in tongue coatings across different stages of colorectal cancer (from healthy individuals to colorectal adenoma (CRA) and CRC patients) are yet to be fully elucidated. By studying the cross-population characteristics of tongue image and tongue coating microorganisms during the evolution of colorectal cancer, the differences of tongue image characteristics and tongue coating microorganisms among different populations were further evaluated, providing references for early screening, diagnosis and treatment of colorectal cancer.</p></sec><sec id="sec3"><title>Methods</title><p>The tongue image features of the subjects were collected by DS01-B tongue surface information collection system, mainly including tongue quality and tongue coating, and the tongue image was quantitatively analyzed by color space Lab value. The microbial characteristics of tongue coating were detected by high-throughput sequencing (16SrRNA amplicon sequencing). All subjects came from the patients in the Sixth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University and recruited volunteers (divided into health group, CRA group and CRC group), and obtained the ethical approval of the Sixth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University (ethical batch number: 2021ZSLYEC-328).</p></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>Results</title><p>A total of 377 subjects were recruited in this study, including 56 healthy subjects, 65 colorectal adenomas and 256 colorectal cancer patients. The results showed that: in terms of texture of fur, the &#x0201c;thick fur&#x0201d; was a significant statistical difference (<italic>p</italic>&#x0202f;&#x0003c;&#x0202f;0.05) in the 3 groups. In addition, there was also a statistical difference in &#x0201c;greasy fur&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;peeled fur&#x0201d; among the 3 groups (<italic>p</italic>&#x0202f;&#x0003c;&#x0202f;0.05).

Tongue coating microorganisms, there was no significant difference in the richness and diversity of the three groups of subjects (<italic>p</italic>&#x0202f;&#x0003e;&#x0202f;0.05). There were 296 species in the three groups, accounting for 44.65%, and the species in colorectal cancer population was the most, reaching 502. From the differences in community composition among the three groups, it was found that there were certain differences in bacterial community composition between healthy people, CRA and CRC, and the differences became more and more obvious with the development of the disease.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study revealed the specific cross-population tongue image characteristics and the specificity of tongue coating microorganisms in the evolution of CRC, providing new research ideas for early screening, early diagnosis, mechanism exploration, prevention and treatment of colorectal cancer.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>tongue coating microbiome</kwd><kwd>tongue image features</kwd><kwd>colorectal cancer</kwd><kwd>colorectal adenoma</kwd><kwd>traditional Chinese medicine</kwd><kwd>16S rRNA sequencing</kwd><kwd>high-throughput sequencing</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn1"><institution-wrap><institution>Guizhou University</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="doi">10.13039/501100003459</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-type="contract" rid="cn1">[2023]-01</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn2">The Science and Technology Plan Project of Guizhou Province</funding-source><award-id award-type="contract" rid="cn2">[2024] General 408</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn3">Guizhou Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine</funding-source><award-id award-type="contract" rid="cn3">QZYY-2024-008</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><funding-statement>The author(s) declare that financial support was received for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.

Approximately 150,000 CRC cases were diagnosed in the United States in 2019, with an estimated 50,000 fatalities due to tumor progression (<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">Siegel et al., 2019</xref>). CRC ranks as the third most common malignancy and the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide (<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">Keum and Giovannucci, 2019</xref>). CRC etiology is multifactorial, influenced by dietary habits, lifestyle, and the microecological environment. CRC development is a progressive process, evolving from normal mucosa through CRA to CRC. It is found that more than 90% of CRC can progress from CRA, and CRA has been recognized as a precancerous lesion of CRC. Currently, reducing CRC incidence and mortality relies predominantly on early screening, prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. The early diagnosis of CRC is mainly through colonoscopy and genetic screening. Although it has been widely used in clinics, it is expensive, and some tests may even bring certain risks to the subjects. Therefore, CRC research focuses on identifying effective, non-invasive, and affordable methods for early screening and diagnosis.</p><p>Tongue diagnosis is a crucial component of the Four Diagnoses in TCM and serves as an essential method for diagnosing diseases, monitoring illness changes, observing treatment effects, and predicting prognoses. This technique, over 3,000&#x0202f;years old, evaluates health by analyzing various aspects of the tongue, such as quality, color, greasiness, and thickness of the coating. While tongue diagnosis can objectively reflect internal physiological and pathological changes in the human body, traditional TCM tongue diagnosis has primarily relied on visual description rather than objective quantification (<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">Jiang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2005</xref>). This reliance often subjects diagnosis to variability influenced by factors like practitioners&#x02019; experience and environmental lighting, raising questions about its objectivity and repeatability. Additionally, the lack of specific quantitative standards has historically limited the advancement of diagnostic methods and technologies in Chinese medicine. However, recent advancements in digital image processing technology have significantly enhanced the objectivity of tongue diagnosis. For instance, the utilization of the Shanghai Daosheng tongue image acquisition system (DS01-B) has made tongue diagnosis more objective (<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">Han et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, employing the Lab color model (<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">Qi et al., 2016</xref>) for comparative analysis introduces quantifiable metrics to tongue diagnosis, marking a significant improvement in this traditional method.</p><p>The tongue coating is a fundamental aspect of tongue diagnosis, defined as a layer on the tongue&#x02019;s surface influenced by stomach qi, and holds significant value in clinical assessments of health and prognostic predictions. Modern medicine attributes the formation of tongue coating to factors such as excessive keratinization and elongation of tongue papillae, accompanied by oral bacteria, fungi, blood metabolites, saliva, exfoliated epithelial cells, and food residues (<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">Seerangaiyan et al., 2018</xref>). Changes in tongue coating color, often turning yellow-brown or black, can occur due to pigment-producing bacteria. Abnormal tongue coatings are associated with factors like diminished immunity, poor oral hygiene, and aging.</p><p>Tongue-coating microorganisms constitute a highly diverse and specific microbial population on the back of the tongue and are a crucial part of the body&#x02019;s microbial communities (<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">Kazor et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">Dewhirst et al., 2010</xref>). This flora, predominantly comprising Bacteroides, Fusobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Firmicutes (<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">Wilbert et al., 2020</xref>), reflects the majority of the microorganisms in the body. Previous studies have highlighted the significant role of these microorganisms in the formation of tongue coatings, suggesting their potential in disease diagnosis and treatment evaluation. The integration of microecological studies of tongue coatings into tongue diagnosis research provides biological substantiation for this traditional practice and enhances its scientific connotation.</p><p>In this study, the Shanghai Daosheng Tongue Image Acquisition System (DS01-B) was employed for tongue image analysis and processing, accompanied by microbial detection using 16S rRNA sequencing technology. This study compared the characteristics of tongue images and the microbial differences in tongue coatings among healthy individuals, CRA patients, and CRC patients. The findings substantiated tongue diagnosis as a potential and objective method for the early screening and diagnosis of CRC, offering valuable insights for its early detection.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec7"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec8"><title>Study subjects</title><p>The research of this project has been registered with the Clinical Research Center of the Sixth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, and ethical approval was received from the Ethics Committee of the hospital (Ethical approval number: 2021ZSLYEC-328).

The physical examiner takes an upright position, with the mandible placed on the mandibular rest of the collection window, and the forehead pressed against the face frame and kept still. Tongue extension method: before shooting, train the subject&#x02019;s tongue extension posture, that is, when extending the tongue, try to open your mouth as much as possible, fully extend the tongue out of the mouth, with the tip of the tongue down, and keep the tongue relaxed. It is not advisable to extend the tongue too hard, so that the tongue surface is flat and the tip of the tongue naturally droops. If repeated observation is needed, the subject can take a short break and repeat the tongue sticking process.</p></sec><sec id="sec14"><title>Tongue image observation and recording</title><p>According to the captured tongue image, the DS01-B system will automatically separate the tongue from the entire image and eliminate the background area around the tongue image to promote the recognition and extraction of the tongue image. If the DS01-B system stripping is not ideal, it can be manually adjusted. Then, by using standard values such as aspect ratio, color composition, position, color distribution of the tongue, and values of adjacent pixels, the DS01-B system automatically analyzes and pulls out the tongue image results.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec15"><title>TCM tongue diagnosis criteria and inclusion criteria</title><p>According to the standard of tongue diagnosis in Diagnostics of Traditional Chinese Medicine (<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">Wenfeng, 2007</xref>), the tongue picture includes the characteristics of tongue quality and tongue coating, the characteristics of tongue quality include tongue color and tongue shape, and the characteristics of tongue coating include tongue color and tongue coating, as follows: &#x02460; Tongue color: light white, red, crimson, blue and so on; &#x02461; Tongue shape: it can be divided into chubby, dented, pricked and cracked; &#x02462; Moss color: including white, yellow and gray-black; &#x02463; Moss quality: including thick, thin, greasy, rotten, peeling and so on.</p></sec><sec id="sec16"><title>Quantitative parameter analysis of tongue image by lab</title><p>Lab color space calculation method of Daosheng (DS01-B) tongue image detection system was adopted.

Tongue image is an important basis for tongue diagnosis, in which the changes of tongue quality and tongue coating are closely related to the deficiency of viscera, the rise and fall of qi and blood, and the depth of evil spirits. The changes of tongue picture characteristics such as tongue quality and tongue coating provide important information for clinical diagnosis of traditional Chinese medicine (<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2008</xref>). Tongue coating is a kind of coating on the surface of human tongue, which can not only reflect the characteristics of pathogenic factors, but also reflect the condition of internal organs, especially the gastrointestinal tract (<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">Sun et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The traditional tongue diagnosis method is mainly to observe the tongue directly, which is influenced by external factors such as light and subjective factors such as practitioners&#x02019; experience, knowledge and diagnostic skills. Due to various external and subjective factors, there are certain limitations (<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2014</xref>). In recent years, with the development of science and technology, the objectification of tongue images has become one of the hot spots in Chinese medicine research, among which DS-01 tongue information acquisition of Chinese medicine, jointly developed by Shanghai Daosheng Medical Technology Co., Ltd. and Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, is commonly used and has been included in the industry standard (<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">Zhiyi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">Yingshui, 2020</xref>; <xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">Bing et al., 2015</xref>). In DS-01 tongue diagnostic instrument, Lab color parameters are used for quantitative analysis of tongue image characteristics, among which L*a*b* color model was first developed by CIE (International Lighting Committee) (<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">Kainuma et al., 2015</xref>). The objective information of tongue diagnosis can also be used to predict the occurrence of tumors, which is in line with the idea of &#x0201c;preventing diseases&#x0201d; in traditional Chinese medicine and is of great significance in disease prevention. As a non-invasive, simple and objective diagnostic method, tongue picture parameter detection provides new ideas and means for establishing a diagnosis and curative effect evaluation system with Chinese medicine characteristics.</p><p>In this study, according to the routine observation points of tongue diagnosis in clinical Chinese medicine, we used DS01-B tongue surface information acquisition system to make a detailed qualitative analysis of tongue image characteristics. Combined with the results of colonoscopy and pathology, we found that there was no significant statistical difference in tongue color, tongue shape and fur color among different populations in the development and evolution of colorectal cancer (<italic>p</italic>&#x0202f;&#x0003e;&#x0202f;0.05), but in terms of fur quality, the three groups were mainly &#x0201c;thick fur,&#x0201d; and there were significant statistical differences among the three groups (<italic>p</italic>&#x0202f;&#x0003c;&#x0202f;0.05), accounting for 75, 86.2% and 87.1, respectively. Traditional Chinese medicine believes that thick coating is caused by the steaming of stomach qi mixed with damp and turbid pathogens, so thick coating dominates the pathogen to flow into the stomach, or there is phlegm, dampness and food stagnation in it. The research results are basically consistent with the etiology and pathogenesis of colorectal cancer. There was also a statistical difference in &#x0201c;greasy fur&#x0201d; among the three groups (<italic>p</italic>&#x0202f;&#x0003c;&#x0202f;0.05), accounting for 73.2, 92.3 and 90.2%, respectively. Most greasy fur is caused by dampness and turbidity, and yang is suppressed. In addition, there was a certain difference in the peeling among the three groups (<italic>p</italic>&#x0202f;&#x0003c;&#x0202f;0.05), accounting for 3.6, 13.8 and 17.2%, respectively. Observing the peeling of tongue coating can measure the survival of stomach qi and stomach yin and judge the prognosis of the disease. The results show that the healthy group is significantly lower than the colorectal adenoma group and colorectal cancer group.</p><p>The color parameter model of tongue picture Lab can quantitatively analyze the tongue picture of TCM, which is one of the important methods for objective study of tongue picture of TCM. In this study, the Lab values of tongue color and fur color of people in different development stages of CRC were compared and analyzed. The results showed that the L values of tongue color and fur color were significantly different between healthy group and CRC group, which could be considered as one of the primary screening indexes to distinguish healthy people from CRC. Secondly, the A value of tongue color is significantly different between healthy group and intestinal cancer group, which can also be considered as one of the primary screening indexes for healthy people and patients with intestinal cancer. This study provides theoretical basis for quantitative study of tongue picture characteristics of CRC and early clinical screening. In addition, we further analyzed the correlation between tongue picture characteristics and the occurrence and development of CRC (that is, from healthy people&#x02014;colorectal adenoma&#x02014;colorectal cancer).

The L, a, b values of tongue color and the L, b values of coating color have certain correlation with the development and evolution of CRC, and the correlation coefficients are 0.125, 0.253, 0.136, 0.159, and 0.107, respectively (<italic>p</italic>&#x0202f;&#x0003c;&#x0202f;0.05), and a positive correlation.</p><p>In recent years, with the development of microecology, 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing technology has been widely used and the research of microbiology has been deepened. It has been reported from Science and Cell Host &#x00026; Microbe that <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and <italic>Fusobacterium nucleatum</italic> can induce colorectal cancer (<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">Rubinstein et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">Arthur et al., 2012</xref>), which is the first to explore the mechanism of CRC from the perspective of intestinal bacterial infection. As the two largest microbial ecosystems of human body, the relationship between oral flora and intestinal flora has gradually attracted researchers&#x02019; attention. As an important part of oral microecology, tongue coating microecology has become the main research object of traditional Chinese medicine microecology. The complexity of the micro-ecology of the tongue is various. First, the back of the tongue is covered with filiform papillae structures and tiny gullies, which greatly increase the surface area to which bacteria attach. In addition, the warm, humid and nutritious background environment of the oral cavity also creates conditions for its growth. The number and types of microorganisms on the back of the tongue are much higher than those in other parts of the oral cavity (<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">Nakano et al., 2002</xref>), so we can study the microorganisms on the tongue coating as the representative of oral microorganisms. Tongue coating in oral cavity, as one of the microbial communities, has a highly diverse and specific microbial population, which is an important part of the microbial community in human body (<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">Dewhirst et al., 2010</xref>). <xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">Han et al.

(2021)</xref> proposed that the change of microbial community in tongue coating is related to many diseases, which can be used as a long-term monitoring and diagnosis tool for precancerous lesions or cancer cases. According to the research of <xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al. (2022)</xref>, primary liver cancer can be accurately distinguished from healthy controls by the characteristics of tongue coating microorganism, and the tongue coating microorganism can be used as a potential noninvasive biomarker, which is suitable for long-term monitoring of primary liver cancer.</p><p>According to the Alpha diversity analysis of tongue coating microorganisms in different stages of CRC development, we found that there was no significant difference in microbial community richness (Sobs index) and diversity (shannon index) among the three groups (<italic>p</italic>&#x0202f;&#x0003e;&#x0202f;0.05). Top5 of microbial species composition of tongue coating in Ao, Bo, and Co groups is consistent with the first five species of common species, mainly including g_Prevotella (19.09%), g_Streptococcus (12.91%), g_Neisseria (8.90%), g_Veillonella (8.03%) and g_Actinomyces (6.02%). However, the proportion is different, especially the proportion of g_Prevotella in CRC group is significantly lower than that in normal people (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>). It is considered that Prevost is usually regarded as a kind of bacteria related to a healthy plant-based diet, which plays the role of &#x0201c;probiotics&#x0201d; in human body, and the decrease of Prevost is related to some diseases (<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">Ley, 2016</xref>). Colonization of Prevotella intestinalis leads to changes in microbial metabolism, which reduces the production of IL-18, thus exacerbating intestinal inflammation and may lead to systemic autoimmunity. <xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">Flemer et al. (2018)</xref> found that there is also a great difference between patients with CRC and healthy people in the genus g_Prevotella. Prevost&#x02019;s bacteria not only live in the intestine, but also in the oral cavity. Among them, <italic>Prevotella intermedia</italic> and <italic>Prevotella nigrescens</italic> are related to inflammatory periodontitis, such as pregnancy gingivitis, acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis and adult periodontitis. The composition and metabolic activities of Przewalskii are largely regulated by diet, and they can also affect the metabolism of food. <xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">Sandberg et al. (2019)</xref> also proposed that the abundance of Enterobacteriaceae/Bacteroides might be beneficial to metabolism. Our research found that actinomycetes g__Actinomyces and ciliates g__Leptotrichia showed a gradual increase trend in the three groups of Ao, Bo, and Co, and there was a significant difference (<italic>p</italic>&#x0202f;&#x0003c;&#x0202f;0.05). <xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">Yachida et al.

At present, there is relatively little research on the genus g__Leptotrichia, which is a common colonization bacterium in human mouth and gums, and can cause local inflammation such as periodontitis and gingivitis. When immunity is low and accompanied by oral and/or gastrointestinal mucosal damage, it can also cause abdominal infection and blood flow infection. Combined with the results of this study, we consider that the occurrence of colorectal cancer may be related to the decrease of Prevotella in oral cavity and the increase of g__Actinomyces and g__Leptotrichia.</p><p>In addition, we made a single-factor Network analysis of the microbial composition of tongue coating in Ao, Bo, and Co groups, and found that the core species of tongue coating microorganisms in the three groups were: g__Stomatobaculum, g__Peptostreptococcus, g__Actinomyces, g__Oribacterium and g_Lachnoanaerobaculum, respectively. Interestingly, we found that the core species top5 of tongue coating microorganisms in patients with colorectal cancer are g__Porphyromonas, g__Actinomyces, g__Alloprevotella, g__Oribacterium, g__Haemophilus. <xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al. (2021)</xref> found that g__Porphyromonas can promote colorectal cancer by activating inflammatory corpuscles of hematopoietic system NLRP3. <xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">Li et al.

In many studies, it has been found that the increase or decrease of the first three core species of tongue coating microorganisms in patients with CRC is closely related to the occurrence and development of colorectal cancer, and can even be used as specific microorganisms for early screening of colorectal cancer.</p><p>In summary, combined with the clinical colonoscopy and pathological results, we found that the characteristics of tongue picture and the microorganisms on tongue coating in different populations in the development stage of CRC showed obvious changes with the evolution of the disease (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figures 10A</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">C</xref>). The characteristics of tongue picture and the changes of microorganism on tongue coating are of great significance to the occurrence and development of CRC and even other tumors. If tongue diagnosis in traditional Chinese medicine is combined with microorganism on tongue coating as a means to screen patients with CRC, the results will be more objective and accurate, which will provide new research ideas for early screening, early diagnosis, mechanism exploration, prevention and treatment of CRC.</p><fig position="float" id="fig10"><label>Figure 10</label><caption><p>The alterations in tongue image characteristics and the shifts in tongue coating microorganisms throughout the progression of CRC. <bold>(A)</bold> Healthy controls; <bold>(B)</bold> Colorectal adenomal; <bold>(C)</bold> Colorectal cancer.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fmicb-16-1442732-g010" position="float"/></fig></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="sec33"><title>Data availability statement</title><p>The raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will be made available by the authors, without undue reservation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="ethics-statement" id="sec34"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>The studies involving humans were approved by the Sixth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University.
