</self-uri><abstract><p>The purposes of this paper are to develop measurement scale of value co-creation among spectators in professional spectating sporting events by means of Study I and to examine the effects of social media strategies on value co-creation among spectators through Study II. In Study I, a five-phase framework for developing a measurement scale is adopted including items generation, items refinement and edition, exploration of the latent factor structure of the scale and confirmation of reliability, examination of the structure of the factors, and scale validation. In Study II, four quasi-experiments are conducted to investigate the effects of electronic word of mouth, second screen, social media influencer promotion and online donation on value co-creation among spectators. The sample size for Study I and Study II is 830 and 993, respectively. Results obtained from Study I reveal three dimensions of value co-creation among spectators in the context of professional spectating sporting events: event atmosphere, word of mouth, and spectator interaction. Findings from Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) in Study II indicate that in Experiment I, positive electronic word of mouth does not help improve value co-creation among spectators while negative electronic word of mouth does decrease value co-creation among spectators. In Experiment II, the second screen under the condition of either positive or negative electronic word of mouth does not exert an influence on value co-creation among spectators. In Experiment III, the effect of social media influencer promotion on value co-creation among spectators is partially supported. In Experiment IV, under the condition of positive electronic word of mouth, the group of donation reveals greater mean score of event atmosphere than that of the counterparts for the group without donation. The findings of this study not only enrich sport management literature in terms of value co-creation, but also provide empirical evidence and practical implications for decision makers of professional spectating sporting events in terms of social media strategies.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source>

This concept is relevant in the context of the sports industry, where spectators and fans not only engage with sports but also share their opinions about events, brands, and services within communities of like-minded individuals [<xref rid="pone.0320927.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. This interaction affects sports organizations and other spectators, leading spectators to assume the roles of coproducers and cocreators of value in new services [<xref rid="pone.0320927.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Consumers often derive enjoyment from and feel passionate about spectator sports, supporting the idea that consumers can cocreate value for others [<xref rid="pone.0320927.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Although extensive research has been conducted on value cocreation, few studies have focused on customer-to-customer value cocreation, with even fewer considering spectators at sports events [<xref rid="pone.0320927.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0320927.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Insufficient research has explored how value cocreation can be measured in the field of sports event marketing [<xref rid="pone.0320927.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Although several empirical studies have proposed multidimensional and hierarchical scales for this purpose [<xref rid="pone.0320927.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0320927.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], these scales have not been specifically designed for the context of sports event marketing, which limits their ability to measure value cocreation among spectators. For example, one study focused only on helping in the context of value cocreation, which deviates from the goal of developing comprehensive measurement tools and conflicts with existing scale structures [<xref rid="pone.0320927.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. To address this gap in the literature, the present study developed a scale specifically for measuring value cocreation among spectators in the context of sports event marketing, providing a valid and reliable tool that can be used in future research.</p><p>The rapid advancement of information technology has extensively influenced business landscapes, including consumer value cocreation [<xref rid="pone.0320927.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Digital transformation involves radical economic and social changes driven by information technology [<xref rid="pone.0320927.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Changes related to social media exemplify such transformation because the hyperconnectivity of social media allows for instantaneous communication among users [<xref rid="pone.0320927.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Sports events also have unique characteristics, such as spectators viewing themselves as experts, which encourages them to share opinions for psychological benefits [<xref rid="pone.0320927.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The hyperconnectivity of the modern world resulting from the ubiquitousness of social media and the unique characteristics of sports events renders current research on value cocreation less applicable to the modern world and the sports event context. Therefore, further research is required to explore value cocreation among spectators in the contexts of social media and sporting events.</p><p>User-generated content is a key feature of social media and is often used to share information [<xref rid="pone.0320927.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0320927.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. User-generated content includes electronic word of mouth, which is a key success factor in e-commerce [<xref rid="pone.0320927.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Using a second screen has been reported to increase an individual&#x02019;s learning capability [<xref rid="pone.0320927.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0320927.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In addition, social media influencers (SMIs) have become increasingly popular, and therefore, social media influencer endorsement is a critical strategy in business communication [<xref rid="pone.0320927.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0320927.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Another strategy used on social media involves donations, with audiences sponsoring social media influencers. Instagram users pay more attention to brand tags in photos [<xref rid="pone.0320927.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Research indicates that sports fans often share their opinions on social media [<xref rid="pone.0320927.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. These findings have led to increased academic and professional interest in social media strategies. However, the relationship between these strategies and value cocreation among spectators of sports events remains an underexplored area.</p><p>This research offers two key contributions to the literature regarding value cocreation. First, it developed a measurement scale for value cocreation among spectators at professional sports events. Second, the findings from four experiments offer valuable insights that can assist sports event organizers in using social media to enhance value cocreation among spectators at these events.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Literature review</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Customer-to-customer value cocreation</title><p>Value cocreation is commonly defined as a process through which businesses and customers interact to create value [<xref rid="pone.0320927.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Numerous studies have confirmed that such interaction is crucial [<xref rid="pone.0320927.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0320927.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. However, value cocreation also occurs among customers. When companies are not perceived to be the sole creators of value, the process is determined by the environment and participants involved [<xref rid="pone.0320927.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Customers who make similar purchases often share interests and motivations, and this influences their service experience and value creation [<xref rid="pone.0320927.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Therefore, customer-to-customer interaction is a potential factor in value cocreation [<xref rid="pone.0320927.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However, few studies have explored customer-to-customer value cocreation [<xref rid="pone.0320927.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], which involves benefits gained through resource integration during customer interactions [<xref rid="pone.0320927.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Value cocreation constitutes a distinct social structure and shared image [<xref rid="pone.0320927.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Value cocreation involves customers providing ideas to organizations, shaping organizational processes, and influencing other customers [<xref rid="pone.0320927.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. These interactions involving the shared interests and motivations affect service experience and value creation, and therefore, customer interaction is a key factor in value cocreation [<xref rid="pone.0320927.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Customer-to-customer value cocreation is influenced by various factors and social attitudes in addition to potential social interactions [<xref rid="pone.0320927.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. When individuals are more aware of others and engage in longer interactions, value cocreation becomes more complex. User experience sharing may explain value cocreation behavior; it allows companies and customers to benefit from resource integration and interactivity through, for example, social media platforms [<xref rid="pone.0320927.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. A study reported that customer interactions on social media lead to value cocreation primarily through information sharing. Therefore, high levels of value cocreation are likely to occur in social media environments [<xref rid="pone.0320927.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Although the importance of value cocreation has been recognized in the literature, its role in sports contexts remains underexplored.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Theoretical background of value cocreation in the context of sports events</title><p>Service-dominant logic suggests that both producers and consumers are involved in the process of value creation [<xref rid="pone.0320927.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Therefore, value cocreation is not solely the responsibility of a firm; consumers also play a role [<xref rid="pone.0320927.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In the sports industry, value cocreation involves activities related to teams, leagues, and media entities [<xref rid="pone.0320927.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Sports organizations cocreate value with consumers rather than independently creating value [<xref rid="pone.0320927.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0320927.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Both sports service providers and consumers offer value propositions that can be integrated into the sports community through the sharing of various resources, such as knowledge, skills, and technology [<xref rid="pone.0320927.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. A sports management study examined interactions between club employees and consumers from a service-dominant logic perspective [<xref rid="pone.0320927.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].</p><p>Value cocreation is a well-studied phenomenon; however, few studies have focused on customer-to-customer value cocreation in a sports context [<xref rid="pone.0320927.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0320927.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Spectator sports events are hedonic services, and spectator enthusiasm is a key feature of the events [<xref rid="pone.0320927.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Sports events also have other unique features, including competition and cooperation among organizations, consumers acting as experts, fluctuating demand, intangible products, simultaneous production and consumption, social facilitation, product inconsistency, product uncontrollability, reliance on ancillary products, and involving both consumer and industrial products [<xref rid="pone.0320927.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. These features suggest that interactions among spectators on social media platforms can attract new participants. As a result, exploring spectator-to-spectator value cocreation in sports is theoretically justified.</p><p>Value cocreators may be individual customers with partners (e.g., spouses), known groups (e.g., friends), temporarily unknown groups (e.g., spectators at a sports event), or persistent groups (e.g., loyal and organized members of sports event spectator groups) [<xref rid="pone.0320927.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. In the present study, spectator-to-spectator value cocreation in sports event marketing is defined as the process of creating value through interactions among these different types of spectator groups.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Value cocreation scales</title><p>Existing scales for measuring value cocreation focus on such cocreation between businesses and customers, not that among customers [<xref rid="pone.0320927.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0320927.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Therefore, these scales are inadequate for measuring spectator value cocreation in sports events. This mismatch was evident in a study that measured value cocreation by considering word-of-mouth behavior and helping as customer citizenship behavior [<xref rid="pone.0320927.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].

To elaborate, positive electronic word of mouth promotes spectator-to-spectator value cocreation (H1-1) while negative electronic word of mouth discourages spectator-to-spectator value cocreation (H1-2). The overall model for the event atmosphere dimension from one-way analysis of covariance was statistically significant (<italic toggle="yes">F</italic> = 72.038, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &#x0003c;.01).

Overall, these findings indicate that H4 was partially supported.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec032"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="sec033"><title>Study I: Development of spectator-to-spectator value cocreation scale</title><p>From the results of Study I, spectator-to-spectator value cocreation scale consists of three dimensions; event atmosphere, word of mouth, and spectator interaction. The first dimension, event atmosphere, was the most notable feature in this study as it differs from factors proposed in other studies on value cocreation. In other words, event atmosphere has not been proposed in the literature on value cocreation but rather exhibits a unique characteristic within the context of spectator sports. Such a finding echoes that atmosphere in sports environments is a significant factor in explaining fan behavior. Empirical studies have reported on the influence of physical, social, and environmental factors in creating atmospheres [<xref rid="pone.0320927.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0320927.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. In commercial settings, the presence of other customers has the potential to exert a strong influence on atmosphere and to make the atmosphere relevant to other customers [<xref rid="pone.0320927.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Similarly, a study [<xref rid="pone.0320927.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>] reported that fans&#x02019; experiences with respect to sports venue environments can influence their willingness to participate, suggesting that atmosphere may be a key factor in spectator-to-spectator value cocreation. Therefore, this study posits that event atmosphere is an irreplaceable factor in value cocreation in spectator sports events.</p><p>The second dimension was word of mouth. This finding aligns with that of another study [<xref rid="pone.0320927.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. One of the shared characteristics among sports fans is their tendency to spread word of mouth through social media networks [<xref rid="pone.0320927.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Sports events involve various elements, such as live activities, cheerleading squads, online promotions, and the excitement of the event itself. Enthusiasm is a common characteristic among sports event spectators [<xref rid="pone.0320927.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The aforementioned elements may stimulate excitement among spectators [<xref rid="pone.0320927.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Additionally, individuals tend to trust information from recommenders; they often make purchase decisions on the basis of recommendations, leading to a reward for successful recommendations made to relatives, friends, and family [<xref rid="pone.0320927.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. A previous study [<xref rid="pone.0320927.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>] reported that potential customers are more likely to be influenced by word of mouth from existing customers when they perceive themselves to be similar to those existing customers. In a sports context, this influence can affect customers&#x02019; willingness to attend future sports events. Research [<xref rid="pone.0320927.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>] on value creation in the context of live sports events revealed that environmental elements, such as venue aesthetics and seating comfort, and core services, such as player skills and team performance, are highly valued by spectators. Creating social experiences can prompt spectators to share team or sports-related information through word of mouth recommendations on social media platforms. Spectators may also engage in extended discussions on social media platforms or elsewhere after an event, including exchanging opinions on the event process, team performance, and other factors. These discussions are crucial for fans. This finding echoes previous findings [<xref rid="pone.0320927.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] indicating that feelings induced by other spectators may lead to behaviors related to word of mouth.</p><p>Spectator-to-spectator value cocreation is unique in that it involves spectator interaction, which includes communication with the environment and people. Service providers should be aware of the importance of social interaction to spectators and should provide a platform that facilitates communication and interaction among athletes, fans, sports brands, and sports organizations. This would enable spectators to connect with each other and cocreate event experiences [<xref rid="pone.0320927.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Research [<xref rid="pone.0320927.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>] suggests that value cocreation can be indirectly viewed as interaction, where customers support brands through rich experiences and reinforce identification with the brand through other customers. This encourages customer identification and builds cohesion among customers. The characteristics of sports event spectators may encourage new spectators, such as spouses and friends, to interact on communication platforms [<xref rid="pone.0320927.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], where sports event spectators may discuss the conditions of a game. Spectators who are attending a game for the first time may be unfamiliar with certain aspects of the event. However, spectators with experience may introduce or explain the event to these new spectators. In addition, those who hold season tickets may feel a stronger loyalty to the team, players, and event, positively reinforcing related behaviors.</p></sec><sec id="sec034"><title>Study II: Four quasi-experiments on spectator-to-spectator value cocreation</title><p>The findings from Experiment 1 were that positive electronic word of mouth did not improve spectator-to-spectator value cocreation. However, negative electronic word of mouth reduced spectator-to-spectator value cocreation. Overall, the results of Experiment I are consistent with those reported in the literature, indicating that consumers who value cocreation behavior tend to be influenced by electronic word of mouth [<xref rid="pone.0320927.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0320927.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The finding that positive electronic word of mouth does not enhance value cocreation may be partially explained by confirmation bias. Confirmation bias refers to the tendency of individuals to favor information that confirms their beliefs [<xref rid="pone.0320927.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. In line with confirmation bias, the reason value cocreation is not elevated by positive electronic word of mouth can be inferred from sports fans&#x02019; often strong psychological attachment to a particular sports franchise. This may, in turn, explain the finding of positive electronic word of mouth being less effective in boosting spectator-to-spectator value cocreation.</p><p>The results from Experiment II indicate that a second screen did not influence spectator-to-spectator value cocreation. This finding contradicts that of a study that demonstrating that sport fans with a second screen tend to make recommendations on social media [<xref rid="pone.0320927.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Methodological differences may help explain the different results. Specifically, the current research adopted an experimental design approach. Other studies have been correlational and have used structural equation modeling. Further research may be required to confirm this finding.</p><p>Experiment III partially supported H3. Under conditions of positive electronic word of mouth, social media influencer promotion increased the mean score for the event atmosphere dimension. This finding aligns with those of other studies that have demonstrated that repetitive promotion by social media influencers influences consumers&#x02019; engagement on social media and recommendation of brands [<xref rid="pone.0320927.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0320927.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. The findings of this study can be explained by the concept of the parasocial relationship. Parasocial relationships occur when after viewing their content on social media, audiences perceive social media influencers as friends, leading to trust on and reliance in the influencer [<xref rid="pone.0320927.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>].</p><p>Experiment IV partially supported H4. Under conditions of positive electronic word of mouth, online donations resulted in a higher mean score for the event atmosphere dimension. This finding is consistent with that of a study demonstrating that Instagram users pay salient attention to brand tags presented in the form of photograph [<xref rid="pone.0320927.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The finding that online donations are often presented in the form of a photograph and placed in a position that can be easily seen aligns with the theory of prosocial behavior. Prosocial behavior refers to actions that conform to social norms and benefit individuals, groups, or society [<xref rid="pone.0320927.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec035"><title>Implications</title><p>This study has several managerial and academic implications. The scale for measuring spectator-to-spectator value cocreation can be used in several areas of sports management practice to assess strategies for increasing spectator-to-spectator value cocreation. First, sports organizations can use this scale to survey and understand the tendency to engage in spectator-to-spectator value cocreation at sports events to gain insights and maximize behaviors conducive to spectator-to-spectator value cocreation. Second, understanding the effects of social media strategies on spectator-to-spectator value cocreation can enable organizations to develop relevant activities and tactics to further encourage value cocreation behavior on social media. Additionally, regularly measuring spectator-to-spectator value cocreation behavior can help managers monitor changes in value cocreation behavior and devise relevant strategies for different periods. Last, the measurement scale developed in and the experimental findings from this research enriches the literature related to value cocreation in sports event management and to social media strategies for sports events.</p></sec><sec id="sec036"><title>Research limitations and directions for future studies</title><p>This study has several limitations. First, the study focused on spectator-to-spectator value cocreation only in the P. LEAGUE+ professional basketball league, which may limit its generalizability. Given the diversity of sports events, future research may investigate spectator-to-spectator value cocreation behaviors in different sports, cultural settings, and league structures to enhance the scale&#x02019;s generalizability. Additionally, this study was a cross-sectional study. A longitudinal study should be conducted to track spectator-to-spectator value cocreation over time. Future research could also expand upon this study by identifying relevant influencing variables, such as whether spectator-to-spectator value cocreation can predict team loyalty.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec037"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study developed a valid and reliable psychometric measurement scale of spectator-to-spectator value cocreation. The scale considers the characteristics of spectator sports events and comprehensively captures consumer behavior in this context. Four experiments were conducted to examine the effects of social media strategies on spectator-to-spectator value cocreation, and valuable insights were derived from these experiments. Overall, this study not only advances our academic and practical understanding of spectator-to-spectator value cocreation but also enriches the literature regarding social media strategies for
