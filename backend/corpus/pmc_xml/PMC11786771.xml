Here, we describe a biocatalytic process to produce nonhydrolyzable NAD+&#x000a0;analogs based on the ADP-ribosyltransferase activity of pertussis toxin PtxS1 subunit. First, in identical manner to normal catalysis, PtxS1 activates NAD+&#x000a0;to form the reactive oxocarbenium cation. Subsequently, the electrophilic ribose 1&#x02032; carbon of the oxocarbenium cation is subject of an attack by the nitrogen atom of an amino group coupled to nicotinamide mimicking compounds. The nitrogen atom acts as the nucleophile instead of the natural sulfur atom substrate of the human G&#x003b1;i protein. The invention builds on structural data indicating the presence of an NAD+&#x000a0;analog, benzamide amino adenine dinucleotide, at the NAD+&#x000a0;binding site of PtxS1. This was witnessed upon cocrystallization of PtxS1 with NAD+ and 3-aminobenzamide (3-AB). A pharmacophore-based screening on 3-AB followed by quantum mechanical simulations identified analogs of 3-AB with capacity to react with the oxocarbenium cation. Based on HPLC and mass spectrometry, we confirmed the formation of benzamide amino adenine dinucleotide by PtxS1, and also identified two new chemical entities. We name the new entities as isoindolone amine adenine dinucleotide, and isoquinolinone amine adenine dinucleotide, the latter being a highly fluorescent compound. The new NAD+&#x000a0;analogs emerge as valuable tools to study the structural biology and enzymology of NAD+&#x000a0;binding and consuming enzymes, such as human poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases and bacterial ADP-ribosyltransferase exotoxins, and to advance the ongoing drug development efforts.</p></abstract><kwd-group id="kwrds0010"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>ADP-ribosyltransferase</kwd><kwd>NAD+</kwd><kwd>enzyme promiscuity</kwd><kwd>biocatalysis</kwd><kwd>nucleotide analog</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta><def-list><title>Abbreviations</title><def-item><term id="kwrd0035">ART</term><def><p>ADP-ribosyltransferase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="kwrd0045">AUC</term><def><p>area under curve</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="kwrd0055">3-AB</term><def><p>3-aminobenzamide</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="kwrd0065">BaAD</term><def><p>benzamide amino adenine dinucleotide</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="kwrd0075">BAD</term><def><p>benzamide adenine dinucleotide</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="kwrd0085">BSA</term><def><p>bovine serum albumin</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="kwrd0095">DSF</term><def><p>differential scanning fluorimetry</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="kwrd0105">G&#x003b1;i</term><def><p>inhibitory alpha subunit of the heterotrimeric G-protein</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="kwrd0115">GBSA</term><def><p>generalized born surface area</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="kwrd0125">HCD</term><def><p>high-energy collisional dissociation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="kwrd0135">IiaAD</term><def><p>isoindolone amine adenine dinucleotide</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="kwrd0145">IqaAD</term><def><p>isoquinolinone amine adenine dinucleotide</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="kwrd0155">MD</term><def><p>molecular dynamics</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="kwrd0165">MQ</term><def><p>Milli-Q water</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="kwrd0175">PARP</term><def><p>poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="kwrd0185">PtxS1</term><def><p>pertussis toxin S1 subunit</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="kwrd0195">QM</term><def><p>quantum mechanical</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="kwrd0205">ROC</term><def><p>receiver operator characteristic</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="kwrd0215">SEC</term><def><p>size-exclusion chromatography</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="kwrd0225">TBST</term><def><p>Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20</p></def></def-item></def-list><notes><p id="misc0010">Reviewed by members of the JBC Editorial Board.

Hundreds of other enzymatic reactions also rely on these dinucleotides. Notably, NAD+ is functionally essential for a large group of non-redox NAD+&#x000a0;cleaving enzymes, including poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs), which are important molecular players, for example, in the maintenance and repair of DNA to safeguard genomic stability and epigenetic regulation and chromatin remodeling (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). There is a high catalytic variability with the non-redox NAD+&#x000a0;cleaving enzymes. For example, nicotinamide is released from NAD+ and the rest of the molecule is either released into solution as ADP-ribose or acetyl-ADP-ribose, covalently attached on target macromolecules, mostly on proteins as mono- and poly-ADP-ribose chains, or is subject of cyclization reaction to form cyclic-ADP-ribose (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). In addition to the mammalian NAD+&#x000a0;cleaving enzymes, there are a number of bacterial exotoxins that in the host cell cytosol either covalently modify host cell proteins <italic>via</italic> mono-ADP-ribosylation, <italic>e.g.</italic>, pertussis toxin (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>), or deplete NAD+&#x000a0;<italic>via</italic> concomitant nicotinamide and ADP-ribose release, <italic>e.g.</italic>, tuberculosis necrotizing toxin (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Some bacterial NAD+&#x000a0;cleaving enzymes act inside the bacterium. For example, the MbcT toxin of the MbcTA toxin-antitoxin system of <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> depletes NAD+&#x000a0;<italic>via</italic> concomitant release of nicotinamide and phosphate-ADP-ribose (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). It is characteristic of the NAD+&#x000a0;cleaving enzymes that they release nicotinamide but the second reaction product, <italic>i.e.</italic>, soluble or covalently conjugated to macromolecules, varies with the specific enzymatic activity.</p><p id="p0015">The NAD+&#x000a0;cleaving nonredox enzymes are potent drug targets. The drug developmental pipelines have focused mostly on NAD+&#x000a0;binding site targeting molecules, which mimic NAD+&#x000a0;or parts of it (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Most notably, due to the central role of PARP1 in the DNA damage response, small-molecule drugs interfering with NAD+&#x000a0;binding, <italic>e.g.</italic>, olaparib and rucaparib, have entered clinical use in cancer treatments, <italic>e.g.</italic>, in ovarian cancer, in particular in patients with homologous recombination defects due to BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). In addition, multiple preclinical development pipelines of pathogen-specific antibacterial small molecular weight drugs are focused on bacterial ADP-ribosyltransferase (ART) exotoxins (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), <italic>e.g.</italic>, to therapeutically or to prophylactically inhibit pertussis toxin (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).</p><p id="p0020">The NAD+&#x000a0;cleaving enzyme-targeted drug development is challenging due to the high abundancy of homologous and nonhomologous NAD+&#x000a0;binding proteins. For example, several PARP1 inhibitors inhibit the activity of other PARPs, such as PARP2 and PARP3 (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Thus, more detailed understanding of the NAD+&#x000a0;binding modes would be useful to improve the fit and specificity of inhibitors. To this end, catalytically compromised mutants (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), wt forms with NAD+&#x000a0;under catalytically nonpermissive conditions, <italic>e.g.</italic>, under cryogenic flash freezing (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) or under incubation with catalysis-inhibiting salt ion (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), or wt forms with NAD+&#x000a0;analogs that have diminished or neglectable nicotinamide displacement, <italic>i.e.</italic>, carba-NAD+ (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), thioribose-NAD+ (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) and benzamide adenine dinucleotide (BAD) (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>), have been used in crystallization studies. Carba-NAD+ and thioribose-NAD+&#x000a0;are synthetic compounds identical to NAD+&#x000a0;except for one substitution, where an oxygen atom adjacent to the anomeric linkage bearing nicotinamide is replaced with a methylene group (carba-NAD+) or sulfur atom (thioribose-NAD+). These modifications make carba-NAD+ and thioribose-NAD+&#x000a0;inert in nicotinamide displacement reactions, although they bind to NAD+&#x000a0;consuming enzymes in a manner similar to NAD+. Carba-NAD+&#x000a0;has been used, for example, to obtain NAD+&#x000a0;binding mode information of sirtuins, SIRT3, and SIRT5 (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). BAD is another nonhydrolyzable NAD+&#x000a0;analog where the nitrogen atom of the nicotinamide ring is replaced with a carbon atom converting the benzamide moiety into a poor leaving group (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). The BAD has, for example, been used to obtain NAD+&#x000a0;binding mode information of PARP1 in order to understand how DNA damage leads to the activation of PARP1 (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>).</p><p id="p0025">The nonhydrolyzable NAD+&#x000a0;analogs carba-NAD+ and BAD are commercially available, but expensive to purchase in large quantities, and not widely used, despite their clear benefits in structural elucidation of NAD+&#x000a0;binding modes to proteins. Recently, we detected the binding of a novel chemical entity, which we named benzamide amino adenine dinucleotide (BaAD) at the NAD+&#x000a0;binding site of pertussis toxin (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). The binding pose was acquired after the crystallization of a Cys41Ser-mutant of the truncated ART subunit PtxS1 (pertussis toxin S1 subunit) together with NAD+ and 3-aminobenzamide, which is a weak millimolar inhibitor of PtxS1 (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Here, we set out to confirm the formation of BaAD by PtxS1, to investigate the structural and mechanistic basis of its formation, and to assess the feasibility of PtxS1-mediated biocatalytic process to produce BaAD for downstream applications.</p><sec id="sec1"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec1.1"><title>Analysis of the binding pose of BaAD in PtxS1</title><p id="p0030">The glycosidic bond between the anomeric 1&#x02032; carbon, and the nitrogen of 3-aminobenzamide (3-AB) remnant in BaAD is in alpha configuration (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Despite this stereochemical difference to &#x003b2;-NAD+, the binding pose of &#x003b1;-BaAD (Protein Data Bank (PDB) <ext-link ext-link-type="PDB" xlink:href="https://www.rcsb.org/7SNE" id="intref0010">7SNE</ext-link>) in PtxS1 is remarkably similar with the binding pose of &#x003b2;-NAD+ (PDB <ext-link ext-link-type="PDB" xlink:href="https://www.rcsb.org/7SKY" id="intref0015">7SKY</ext-link>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref><italic>A</italic>). The adenine end, phosphate groups, and the nicotinamide end (&#x003b2;-NAD+) or the 3-AB remnant (&#x003b1;-BaAD) are positioned similarly. This is also evident when &#x003b1;-BaAD binding pose is compared with post &#x003b2;-NAD+&#x000a0;hydrolysis structure with bound &#x003b1;-ADP-ribose and nicotinamide (PDB <ext-link ext-link-type="PDB" xlink:href="https://www.rcsb.org/7SKK" id="intref0020">7SKK</ext-link>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref><italic>A</italic>). There is a tight fit of the nicotinamide end (&#x003b2;-NAD+) or the 3-AB remnant (&#x003b1;-BaAD) in the catalytic pocket (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref><italic>B</italic>). Accordingly, binding of the BaAD 3-AB remnant, which in comparison to &#x003b2;-NAD+&#x000a0;nicotinamide has one nitrogen extension, is associated with significant movement of the ribose group (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref><italic>A</italic>). In order to gain further insights into the binding properties of &#x003b1;-BaAD, we performed docking and binding free energy analysis based on the cocrystallized poses of &#x003b2;-NAD+ and &#x003b1;-BaAD (PDB <ext-link ext-link-type="PDB" xlink:href="https://www.rcsb.org/7SKY" id="intref0025">7SKY</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="PDB" xlink:href="https://www.rcsb.org/7SNE" id="intref0030">7SNE</ext-link>, respectively, <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;1</xref>). The molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were also conducted, and, subsequently, binding free energy values were calculated and averaged over the simulation time. Upon comparing the modeled interaction patterns, it became evident that &#x003b1;-BaAD exhibited similar kinds of interactions with PtxS1 as compared with &#x003b2;-NAD+ (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>). In contrast, the interaction pattern of a hypothetical stereoisomer &#x003b2;-BaAD was notably distinct and displayed weaker interactions with PtxS1. Moreover, the binding free energy values of &#x003b1;-BaAD (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;1</xref>) were more favorable as compared with the &#x003b2;-NAD+&#x000a0;hydrolysis intermediate oxocarbenium cation and the &#x003b2;-NAD+&#x000a0;hydrolysis product &#x003b1;-ADP-ribose. The modeling data imply that &#x003b1;-BaAD has affinity to the NAD+&#x000a0;binding site of PtxS1 where it has a binding pose similar to &#x003b2;-NAD+.<fig id="fig1"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p><bold>Binding pose of BaAD in PtxS1.</bold><italic>A</italic>, the cartoon representation of structures of PtxS1 complexed with &#x003b2;-NAD+ (7SKY and &#x003b2;-NAD+ in <italic>orange</italic>), &#x003b1;-BaAD (7SNE and &#x003b1;-BaAD in <italic>gray</italic>) and post NAD+&#x000a0;hydrolysis products ADP-ribose and nicotinamide (NA) (7SKK, ADP-ribose, and nicotinamide in <italic>pink</italic>).

This implies somewhat altered biochemical features of this mutant form of rPtxS1. Cys41 is located at the middle of a flexible loop (referred to as the NAD+&#x000a0;loop) that moves from the apo conformation (PDB <ext-link ext-link-type="PDB" xlink:href="https://www.rcsb.org/1PRT" id="intref0035">1PRT</ext-link>, (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>)) on top of NAD+&#x000a0;upon NAD+&#x000a0;binding (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;3</xref><italic>A</italic>) (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).

To investigate the effect of C41 mutations, we first performed MD simulations on the structure of rPtxS1 cocrystallized with &#x003b2;-NAD+ and two <italic>in silico</italic> mutant structures, C41S and C41G. The RMSD values were compared over a 500-ns MD simulation. The RMSD of the wt and C41G mutant converged early, reaching stability at around 30-ns and remaining consistent throughout the simulation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;3</xref><italic>B</italic>). In contrast, the C41S mutant exhibited higher RMSD values, indicating increased structural fluctuations. To identify the specific amino acid residues responsible for these fluctuations, the root mean square fluctuation was analyzed. For the C41S mutant, higher fluctuations were observed in the H3-helix residues (amino acids 56&#x02013;80), followed by the flexible loop region (amino acids 112&#x02013;127), the loop between &#x003b2;8 and &#x003b2;9 (amino acids 150&#x02013;155), and the NAD+&#x000a0;binding site loop (amino acids 38&#x02013;49). In comparison, the root mean square fluctuation of the wt structure remained relatively stable in the flexible loop region, compared to both the C41S and C41G mutants. However, it exhibited less stability than the C41G mutant in the H3-helix loop and NAD+&#x000a0;binding site loop regions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;3</xref><italic>C</italic>). We also analyzed the specific amino acid interactions with &#x003b2;-NAD+ (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Fig.&#x000a0;S1</xref>). We observed that both the wt and the C41S mutant exhibited direct hydrogen bond and water-mediated interactions between the amino acid residue at the 41 position and &#x003b2;-NAD+. However, these interactions were lost in the C41G mutant. There was also a loss of interactions with H32, L36, and V42 in the C41G mutant, which was compensated by increased interactions with Y8, Q42, S54, Y59, T60, L123, and Y126. Overall, the modeling exercise indicates that catalytic alterations are probable with both PtxS1 mutants, but, in particular, with the C41S mutant of rPtxS1.<fig id="fig3"><label>Figure&#x000a0;3</label><caption><p><bold><italic>In silico</italic> and biochemical characterization of a series of PtxS1 mutants.</bold><italic>A</italic>, location of Cys41 in the flexible NAD+&#x000a0;loop of rPtxS1.

This indicates that the ca. 7.25 retention time peak compound is mostly getting released into solution after its formation.

To study the molecular nature of the ca. 8&#x000a0;min eluting compound, we pooled material of different HPLC injections and ran an LC-MS analysis (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;5</xref><italic>D</italic>&#x02013;<italic>G</italic>). The LC-MS analysis led into identification of BaAD with three different adducts (+H, -e, and&#x000a0;+NH<sub>4</sub>) in multiple independent runs. Next, having established the identity of the ca. 8&#x000a0;min eluting compound as BaAD, we estimated the biocatalytic yield. Based on an area under curve (AUC) analysis, we estimated that the amount of BaAD was ca. 0.5%, as in proportion to the original NAD+&#x000a0;inoculum. Using UV absorbance of &#x003b2;-NAD+&#x000a0;solution as a reference at two different wavelengths, we estimated that one representative BaAD preparate (30&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l) contained 631&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M (254&#x000a0;nm absorbance) or 627&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M (260&#x000a0;nm absorbance) of BaAD.

In fact, the AUC analysis of BaAD and IiaAD peaks indicated that more of these compounds were present after incubation in 0.1&#x000a0;M NaOH for 72&#x000a0;h. Moreover, HPLC analysis of the high pH treated rPtxS1-free BaAD and IiaAD biocatalysis reaction controls led into detection of BaAD and IiaAD (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Figs.&#x000a0;S10</xref> and <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">S11</xref>). This observation implies that hydrolysis of &#x003b2;-NAD in 0.1&#x000a0;M NaOH generates a chemical entity, most likely an oxocarbenium cation similar to PtxS1 catalysis, which reacts with the precursors of BaAD and IiaAD.

Recently, we detected binding of a novel chemical entity that resembles NAD+&#x000a0;at the NAD+&#x000a0;binding site of pertussis toxin PtxS1 subunit (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). We named this chemical entity as BaAD. The binding pose was acquired after crystallization of a C41S-mutant of the truncated form of PtxS1 (C41S-rPtxS1) with NAD+ and 3-AB. Here, we set out to confirm the formation of BaAD by PtxS1, to investigate the structural and mechanistic basis of its formation, and to assess the feasibility of PtxS1-mediated biocatalytic process to produce BaAD for downstream applications.</p><p id="p0075">Compelling evidence was obtained on PtxS1-catalyzed formation of BaAD. We witnessed a distinct peak in two different HPLC methods that was missing from the controls of rPtxS1 incubations with NAD+ and 3-AB. The ca. 7.25&#x000a0;min HPLC method A peak was evident with wt-rPtxS1, C41S-rPtxS1 and C41G-rPtxS1, but not with Q127D/E129D-rPtxS1, which has a radically reduced NADase and ART. The height of the ca. 7.25&#x000a0;min HPLC peak also correlated with the amounts of PtxS1 and 3-AB in the reaction. Furthermore, the ca. 7.25&#x000a0;min peak was witnessed in the 10&#x000a0;kDa cutoff filtrates of the wt-, C41S-, and C41G-rPtxS1 reactions, not in the proteins trapped to the centricon filters. The HPLC method B with isocratic elution mobile phase turned out to be superior due to its ability to clearly resolve all the reaction components. When the material in the ca. 8&#x000a0;min HPLC method B peak was analyzed with mass spectrometry, three different adducts (+H, -e, and&#x000a0;+NH<sub>4</sub>) of BaAD were detected in multiple independent runs. The neutral molar masses ranged from 677.1120 to 677.1291&#x000a0;g/mol, which closely matched the expected neutral molar mass of BaAD (677.12477&#x000a0;g/mol). The detection of numerous BaAD matching fragments with the high cone voltage energy supported the notion that the molecular identity of the ca. 8&#x000a0;min eluting compound was indeed BaAD. We conclude that rPtxS1 catalytically produces BaAD, and that the formed BaAD is mostly released into solution. However, BaAD has clear affinity to the NAD+&#x000a0;binding site of rPtxS1 supported by our current modeling exercise as well as our 1.0&#x000a0;&#x000c5; resolution PtxS1/BaAD cocomplex structure that we recently published (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). It is plausible that the hampered NADase activity of C41S-rPtxS1 with spatial NAD+&#x000a0;binding site alterations contributed to the success with C41S-rPtxS1/BaAD cocomplex crystallization.</p><p id="p0080">In our 1.0-&#x000c5; resolution BaAD/PtxS1 structure (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), the glycosidic bond between the anomeric 1&#x02032; carbon, and the nitrogen of 3-AB is in alpha configuration (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;7</xref><italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic>). The alpha configuration is different as compared to the two commercially available nonhydrolyzable NAD+&#x000a0;analogs, carba-NAD+, and BAD, which both have the same beta configuration stereochemistry as with the natural substrate NAD+ (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;7</xref><italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic>). It is plausible that the formation of &#x003b1;-BaAD by PtxS1 involves the canonical stereospecific ART-catalyzed reaction producing &#x003b1;-ADP-ribosyl linkages from &#x003b2;-NAD+ (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;7</xref><italic>C</italic>), as witnessed already in a number of early ART studies, <italic>e.g.</italic>, (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Accordingly, we envision that PtxS1/&#x003b2;-NAD+&#x000a0;-complex first undergoes activation of &#x003b2;-NAD+&#x000a0;to form the reactive oxocarbenium cation (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Next, nucleophilic attack of the electrophilic ribose 1&#x02032; carbon of the oxocarbenium cation takes place by the nitrogen atom of the 3-AB amino group, instead of the oxygen atom of water molecule or the sulfur atom of a cysteine side chain of the human G&#x003b1;i, which is the natural substrate protein for PtxS1 (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). The nucleophilic attack could proceed <italic>via</italic> nicotinamide pocket-bound 3-AB, <italic>i.e.</italic>, nicotinamide has been replaced by 3-AB after the oxocarbenium cation formation. Alternatively, the nucleophilic attack could occur by free solution form of 3-AB followed by BaAD 3-AB remnant insertion into the nicotinamide pocket, which would at that very moment either be nicotinamide-free or become nicotinamide-free due to BaAD 3-AB remnant insertion. It is possible, however, that BaAD could be formed after the oxocarbenium cation has moved out of its initial formation binding pose, either with a nicotinamide pocket-bound or free solution form of 3-AB. Based on our modeling exercise, oxocarbenium cation has a lower affinity as compared to NAD+&#x000a0;at the NAD+&#x000a0;binding site and thereby potential to move from its initial formation binding pose. Also, we experimentally detected three nucleophilic amino acids (Cys41, Tyr126, and Thr125) of the rPtxS1 NAD+&#x000a0;binding site to be auto-ADP-ribosylated that are relatively far from the position of the electrophilic ribose 1&#x02032; carbon (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;4</xref><italic>E</italic>) (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). The closest atomic distance is 8.2&#x000a0;&#x000c5; between the sulfur atom of Cys41 and the electrophilic ribose 1&#x02032; carbon. Accordingly, PtxS1 might in fact create a diffusible cloud of oxocarbenium cations, which would react with any suitable nucleophile even across long distances, <italic>e.g.</italic>, water molecule, nucleophilic amino acids such as Cys41 or the amino group of 3-AB. However, we regard this mechanistic scenario in BaAD formation somewhat questionable as the lifetime of oxocarbenium cation is short as in picoseconds (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Also, there is currently no evidence showing that the NAD+&#x000a0;binding site of PtxS1 would be able to exclude water, which is one potent oxocarbenium cation attacking nucleophile quickly yielding chemically inert ADP-ribose from the oxocarbenium cation. Furthermore, we cannot be sure that the detected automodified residues in PtxS1 are result of a catalytic process within single PtxS1 molecules (cis) and not of a catalytic process between different PtxS1 molecules (trans), or even between PtxS1 and some unknown endogeneous <italic>E.&#x000a0;coli</italic> ART during overnight expression prior to purification and biochemical experimentation. Overall, we propose here that rPtxS1 catalytically produce &#x003b1;-BaAD from &#x003b2;-NAD+ and 3-AB involving a process where the oxocarbenium cation intermediate stays relatively static at its initial position of formation thereby allowing efficient stereospecific attack of the electrophilic ribose 1&#x02032; carbon by 3-AB.<fig id="fig7"><label>Figure&#x000a0;7</label><caption><p><bold>Formation mechanism of BaAD in PtxS1.</bold><italic>A</italic>, comparison of BaAD structure with two known nonhydrolyzable NAD+&#x000a0;analogs.

The nonhydrolyzable NAD+&#x000a0;analogs carba-NAD+ and BAD, which are now commercially available, are expensive to purchase in large quantities, and not widely used, despite their clear benefits in structural elucidation of the NAD+&#x000a0;binding modes to proteins. Biocatalytic processes also would limit the use of industrial chemical processes that would be in line with the global sustainable development goals. However, based on our HPLC chromatograms (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figs.&#x000a0;5</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>), the yields of our typical BaAD, IiaAD, and IqaAD were relatively low in respect of the precursor amounts. Our most optimal reaction setups used rPtxS1 concentration (200&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M) at the upper limit of rPtxS1 solubility, as well as 3-AB/3-AB analog concentration (20&#x000a0;mM) at the near possible maximum, which already starts to inhibit the enzyme (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Also, during the catalytic process, nicotinamide and ADP-ribose are getting formed, which occupy the NAD+&#x000a0;binding site, and thereby most likely interfere with BaAD, IiaAD, and IqaAD formation. We therefore think that in-solution PtxS1-mediated biocatalysis of &#x003b1;-BaAD cannot be significantly optimized. Acquisition of sufficient amount of material for downstream applications simply needs replicates, which is supported by the fact that purification of rPtxS1 is easy, and all the precursor molecules are cheap and easily accessible. In addition, covalent or noncovalent immobilization of rPtxS1 to a solid carrier particle or a surface (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>) could allow more control with cyclical spiking of reaction components and product retrieval thereby possibly resulting in more efficient production yields. The only major catalysis-limiting factor in solid-phase could be the auto-ADP-ribosylation of amino acids at the NAD+&#x000a0;binding site of PtxS1 that was detected in this study. It appears likely that the ADP-ribose attached to the amino acids of the NAD+&#x000a0;binding site would limit the catalytic activity of PtxS1 by sterically interfering with &#x003b2;-NAD+&#x000a0;binding. Other ARTs and NAD+&#x000a0;consuming enzymes, <italic>e.g.</italic>, the efficient NADase tuberculosis necrotizing toxin (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>), or the <italic>E.&#x000a0;coli</italic> pertussis-like toxin (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>), could provide alternative enzymatic basis for BaAD and BaAD analog production. In the end, these enzymes rely in their catalytic process on the production of oxocarbenium cation intermediate. We envision that whenever there is an enzyme that is capable of forming the oxocarbenium cation from &#x003b2;-NAD+ in sufficient quantities, and additionally to accommodate 3-AB/3-AB analog into the NAD+&#x000a0;binding site close to the electrophilic ribose 1&#x02032; carbon, there is a possibility that nonhydrolyzable NAD+&#x000a0;analogs are formed. Overall, we have confirmed the previous indications (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>) that the PtxS1 ART subunit of pertussis toxin catalytically produces a new kind of an NAD+&#x000a0;analog BaAD from &#x003b2;-NAD+ and 3-AB. We also extended the concept of PtxS1-based biocatalysis to produce other nonhydrolyzable NAD+&#x000a0;analogs. The new biocatalytically produced NAD+&#x000a0;analogs emerge as valuable tools to study the structural biology and enzymology of NAD+&#x000a0;binding and NAD+&#x000a0;consuming enzymes, such as human PARPs and bacterial ART exotoxins. As the first proof of concept of broader applicability, we detected that IiaAD, but not BaAD, inhibited the NAD+&#x000a0;consumption activity of human PARP10 (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Fig.&#x000a0;S12</xref>). This finding was supported by our molecular modeling exercise (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Fig.&#x000a0;S13</xref>).

The purpose of the simulations was to study the behavior of the ligand-PtxS1/PARP10 complexes over a time period of 500&#x000a0;ns. The simulation systems were prepared using the System Builder tool of Desmond. An orthorhombic simulation box with periodic boundary conditions was generated to create an environment resembling bulk solution. The solute, which consisted of the ligand-enzyme complex, was solvated with single point charge water molecules. To prevent artificial interactions between the solute and its periodic images, a 10&#x000a0;&#x000c5; buffer space was maintained between the solute and the box edges. Additionally, sodium and chloride ions were added to the system to achieve neutralization and a concentration of 15&#x000a0;mM. The simulation system underwent relaxation to equilibrate the solute and the surrounding water molecules. Two relaxation steps were performed - one with restraints on the solute heavy atoms and another without restraints. In the first step, a stepwise relaxation protocol was used. The system was initially subjected to 12&#x000a0;ps of Brownian dynamics in the NVT ensemble at 10K, using a Berendsen thermostat and a 1-fs time step, while applying restraints to the solute. This was followed by 12&#x000a0;ps of Langevin dynamics in the NPT ensemble at 300&#x000a0;K and 1&#x000a0;atm pressure, using a Berendsen thermostat and barostat, with restraints applied to the solute. In the final relaxation step, the system was allowed to relax for 24&#x000a0;ps without any restraints. After relaxation, the production simulations were carried out in the NPT ensemble for a duration of 500&#x000a0;ns, using a 2-fs time step. The temperature was maintained at 300&#x000a0;K, using the Nos&#x000e9;-Hoover chain thermostat (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>), while the pressure was maintained at 1.01325&#x000a0;bar using the Martyna-Tobias-Klein barostat (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). The pressure and temperature relaxation times were set to 1&#x000a0;ps and 2&#x000a0;ps, respectively, with isotropic coupling. To handle short-range Coulombic interactions, a cutoff radius of 9.0&#x000a0;&#x000c5; was used. The long-range electrostatic interactions were calculated using the u-series decomposition of the Coulomb potential (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). The resulting simulation trajectories were analyzed using the Simulation Interactions Diagram tool in Maestro.

(ii) Ptx holotoxin experiments: To first activate the Ptx holotoxin, <italic>i.e.</italic>, to reduce the autoinhibitory Cys41-Cys202 disulfide bond, 0.2 or 1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g of Pertussis Holotoxin (Biotrend, LL-179A) was coincubated with 20&#x000a0;mM DTT for 30&#x000a0;min at room temperature. Next, 1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M of biotinylated NAD+ (Trevigen, 4670&#x02013;500&#x02013;01) was added with or without 2&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M rG&#x003b1;i substrate followed by incubation for 40&#x000a0;min at room temperature with shaking at 300&#x000a0;rpm. Reactions were conducted in 100&#x000a0;mM Hepes (pH 7.5), 500&#x000a0;mM NaCl, 10% (w/v) glycerol, and 2&#x000a0;mM DTT with a final volume of 50&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l. Reactions were stopped by addition of Laemmli loading dye to 1x and heating for 10&#x000a0;min at 95 &#x000b0;C. The samples were run on SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, followed by analysis for proteins and ADP-ribose conjugants as described above. Additionally, the anti-PT monoclonal antibody (S1) (NIBSC, 99/512) (1:1000) for Pertussis S1-subunit was used using membrane blocking and primary antibody washes with 5% (w/v) nonfat milk in TBST.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.7"><title>Mass spectrometry analysis of ADP-ribose conjugates</title><p id="p0125">(i) Mass spectrometry sample preparation: The wt rPtxS1 (10&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M) was incubated at room temperature for 3&#x000a0;h in a 100&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l reaction volume [100&#x000a0;mM Hepes (pH 7.5), 500&#x000a0;mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 2&#x000a0;mM DTT] under the following conditions (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>): rPtxS1 (10&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M) (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>), rPtxS1 (10&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M), and 10&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M NAD+ (Sigma-Aldrich, N1511), and (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>) rPtxS1 (10&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M), rG&#x003b1;i (10&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M) and 10&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M NAD+ (Sigma-Aldrich, N1511). For denaturation and cysteine reduction, the proteins were incubated in 3&#x000a0;M urea (Sigma-Aldrich, U4884) and 0.01&#x000a0;M of DTT (Sigma-Aldrich, 43819) for 1&#x000a0;h at room temperature. Then, samples were alkylated with 0.05&#x000a0;M of iodoacetamide (Sigma-Aldrich, I6125) at room temperature for 1&#x000a0;h in the dark (iodoacetamide is light-sensitive). A 10K Amicon Ultra Centrifugal Filter (Merk, UFC501008) was used to exchange the buffer to 25&#x000a0;mM ammonium bicarbonate (Sigma-Aldrich, 09830). Proteins were digested with addition of trypsin [1:30 (w:w) trypsin to protein, Promega, V5117] overnight at 37 &#x000b0;C. The 10K Amicon Ultra Centrifugal Filter was used to remove undigested proteins. The eluted peptides were dried in a vacuum centrifuge system (Savant Speedvac Concentrator SVC-100) and stored at&#x000a0;&#x02212;20 &#x000b0;C. (ii) Mass spectrometry runs: Mass spectrometry analyses were performed at the Turku Proteomics Facility supported by Biocenter Finland. The LC-ESI-MS/MS analyses were performed using a nanoflow HPLC system (Easy-nLC1200, Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled with an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer. The peptides were first loaded on a trap column (100&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m ID x 2&#x000a0;cm) and subsequently separated inline on an analytical column (75&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m ID x 15&#x000a0;cm). Both columns were in-house packed with ReproSil-Pur 3&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m 120&#x000a0;&#x000c5; C18-AQ bulk media (Dr Maisch HPLC GmbH, Ammerbuch-Entringen, Germany). The mobile phase consisted of H<sub>2</sub>O and 0.1% formic acid (solvent A), and acetonitrile/H<sub>2</sub>O (80:20 (v/v)) and 0.1% formic acid (solvent B). Peptides were eluted with the following 30&#x000a0;min gradient of solvent B: from 5% to 35% in 20&#x000a0;min, from 35% to 100% in 5&#x000a0;min followed by a wash for 5&#x000a0;min at 100%. The flow rate was 300&#x000a0;nl/min. Mass spectrometry analysis was carried out in a data-dependent acquisition mode with a cycle time set to 3&#x000a0;s. MS1 spectra were acquired with a resolution of 120,000, a scan range of m/z 350&#x02013;m/z 2000, an automatic gain control target value of 200,000 and a maximum injection time of 50&#x000a0;ms. Precursor ions were at first fragmented with high-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) fragmentation using a quadrupole isolation window of m/z 1.6, a normalized collision energy of 38%, an orbitrap resolution of 15,000, and a maximum injection time of 22&#x000a0;ms. If at least three ADP-ribose fragment ions (m/z 136.06, m/z 250.09, m/z 348.07, or m/z 428.04) were detected, second HCD fragmentation, and EThcD fragmentation were triggered for ADP-ribosylated peptide candidates. Precursors for the first HCD fragmentation were filtered using a monoisotopic peak selection set to peptide, a charge state filter allowing only charge states 2 to 6, a minimum intensity threshold of 50,000 and a dynamic exclusion time of 15&#x000a0;s. Spectra in second HCD fragmentation and in EThcD fragmentation were acquired with a quadrupole isolation window set to m/z 1.6, an orbitrap resolution of 30,000, an automatic gain control target of 500,000, a maximum injection time of 54&#x000a0;ms and a dynamic exclusion time of 15&#x000a0;s. A normalized collision energy of 30% was used in second HCD fragmentation and a supplemental activation energy of 25% was used in EThcD fragmentation. A number of dependent scans was set to 10. The mass spectrometry proteomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.proteomexchange.org" id="intref0055">https://www.proteomexchange.org</ext-link>) <italic>via</italic> the PRIDE (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>) partner repository with the dataset identifier PXD050185. (iii) Mass spectrometry data analysis. Data analysis was performed by using Proteome Discoverer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, version 2.5) connected to the Mascot search engine (Matrix Science, London, UK; version 2.8.2). Peptide and protein identifications were performed by the Mascot search engine. The data were searched against the pertussis toxin subunit 1 protein sequence (<italic>Bordetella pertussis</italic>, UniProt SwissProt accession P04977) and the UniProt SwissProt human database (UniProt release 2023_01). A fragment ion mass tolerance of 0.02&#x000a0;Da and a parent ion mass tolerance of 10&#x000a0;ppm were used. Enzyme specificity was set to trypsin, allowing up to two missed cleavages. Carbamidomethylation of cysteine was specified as a fixed modification, and oxidation of methionine and ADP-ribosylation were set as variable modifications. Arginine, asparagine, aspartic acid, cysteine, glutamic acid, glutamine, histidine, lysine, serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues were selected as potential ADP-ribose acceptor sites. The neutral losses from the ADP-ribose modification equal to 249.09&#x000a0;Da, 347.06&#x000a0;Da, and 583.08&#x000a0;Da were used for scoring in HCD fragment ion spectra. The ADP-ribose fragment ions at m/z 136.06, 250.09, 348.07, and 428.04 were excluded from scoring in HCD and in EThcD spectra (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). The Mascot search engine calculated ADP-ribosylation site localization probabilities. Peptide spectrum matches featuring site localization probability above 75% and Mascot expectation value below 0.05 were included in the final results. In house written R scripts were used to extract data from the Mascot reports.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.8"><title>Biocatalytic production of BaAD and analogs</title><p id="p0130">(i) Reactions: The reactions (10&#x02013;25&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l) contained 25 to 400&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M rPtxS1 wt or mutants (C41S, C41G, and Q127D/E129D), 2 to 50&#x000a0;mM 3-AB (Princeton Bio, PBMR044728 or Selleckchem, S1132, both dissolved in water)/3-AB analogs (Molport, see <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Table&#x000a0;S1</xref> and <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Fig.&#x000a0;S5</xref>, all dissolved in water) and 2 to 20&#x000a0;mM NAD+ (Sigma-Aldrich, N3014, dissolved in water) in 100&#x000a0;mM Hepes (pH 7.5), 500&#x000a0;mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 2&#x000a0;mM DTT. First, rPtxS1 and 3-AB/3-AB analogs were combined in the reaction buffer and incubated for 30&#x000a0;min at room temperature. Next, NAD+ was added and the reactions were incubated for 3 to 72&#x000a0;h at room temperature. The reactions were stored frozen at&#x000a0;&#x02212;80 &#x000b0;C until HPLC and LC-MS analysis. (ii) Yield estimation with the AUC method. The concentrations of the NAD+&#x000a0;analogs were estimated by comparing the AUC of the analogs with that of a known concentration of NAD+ from the HPLC chromatograms. The AUC of NAD+ was measured without the PtxS1 to establish a reference. The concentrations of the NAD+&#x000a0;analogs were then calculated based on the proportional relationship between the AUC and concentration. (iii) Yield estimation with the calibration curve method. A calibration curve was prepared using standard concentrations of NAD+ and measuring absorbance at 260&#x000a0;nm using a UV-Vis Nano Drop spectrophotometer. The concentration of the NAD+&#x000a0;analogs was subsequently estimated by interpolating its absorbance on the NAD+&#x000a0;calibration curve. (iv) Hydrolytic stability estimation. To determine the hydrolytic stability of BaAD, IiaAD, and IqaAD, the nucleotides were first biocatalytically produced for 72&#x000a0;h at room temperature in 25&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l reactions (80&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M wt rPtxS1, 20&#x000a0;mM NAD+, and 20&#x000a0;mM 3-AB/3-AB analogs). Subsequently, 100&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l of either 0.1&#x000a0;M NaOH or MQ H<sub>2</sub>O was added. The reactions were centrifuged (9270g, 10&#x000a0;min, room temperature) through a 10K centrifugal filter unit (Pall Nanosep 10K &#x003a9; Centrifugal Devices, OD010C34) to remove the enzyme.

The reactions were diluted 4 to 10-fold with water, and after careful mixing they were incubated for 15&#x000a0;min at room temperature. The reactions were centrifuged (9270g, 10&#x000a0;min, room temperature) through a 10K centrifugal filter unit (Pall Nanosep 10K Omega Centrifugal Devices, OD010C34) to remove the enzyme. The filtrate was collected and injected into HPLC in varying volumes between 10 and 50&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l. Also, the BaAD content in the centricon-trapped proteins was analyzed. Accordingly, the proteins were recovered to a fresh tube from the centricon filters by adding 100&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l of H<sub>2</sub>O. The solutions were heated for 5&#x000a0;min at 75 &#x000b0;C and centrifuged through a 10K centrifugal filter to remove the denatured enzyme, as described above.

The method involves a gradual increase in the solvent C percentage from 0 to 30% over a duration of 15&#x000a0;min, while simultaneously keeping the solvent A percentage constant at 20%. (iii) HPLC analysis<italic>&#x02014;</italic>method B.

To confirm the absence of any coeluting impurities, peak purity determination was carried out for all eluting components by taking five UV spectra per peak. (iv) LC-MS analysis: To perform LC-MS analysis, peaks were collected (HPLC analysis&#x02014;method B), vacuum dried using Savant integrated SpeedVac concentrator system, and dissolved in LC-MS grade water. LC-MS analyses were performed using Waters Acquity RDa system with a C18 column (30&#x000a0;mm&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;4.6&#x000a0;mm&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;3.5&#x000a0;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>m, 130&#x000a0;&#x000c5;, XBridge BEH). The mobile phase (0.8&#x000a0;ml/min flow rate) in gradient elution mode with the following solvents combinations was used: solvent A, H<sub>2</sub>O&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;0.1% formic acid; solvent B MeOH&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;0.1% formic acid.

The solvent composition was brought to initial condition at 4.8&#x000a0;min and was kept constant up to 5.0&#x000a0;min. The detection was carried out using ACQUITY RDa Detector in small molecule positive ion mode using full scan with fragmentation mode. The cone voltage was set at 30V while fragmentation cone voltage was set at 60 to 120V. The capillary voltage was set to default value of 1.5&#x000a0;kV with desolvation temperature of 550 &#x000b0;C.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.10"><title>Fluorescence analysis</title><p id="p0140">The fluorescence analysis of BaAD and its two analogs dissolved in MQ water was performed using NADH (Sigma-Aldrich, N8129) dissolved in MQ water as a reference compound.
