SLAMF8 expression levels in AD models were analyzed using the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Validation of SLAMF8 expression was conducted through RT-PCR and Western blot in A&#x003b2;<sub>1&#x02212;42</sub>-exposed SH-SY5Y cells, LPS-exposed HMC3 cells, and APP/PS1 transgenic mice. The interaction between SLAMF8 and NINJ2 was explored through co-immunoprecipitation, confocal immunofluorescence, and Western blot analyses, focusing on their roles in the TLR4/NF-&#x003ba;B signaling pathway. SLAMF8 was significantly upregulated in AD models, and its overexpression activated the TLR4/NF-&#x003ba;B signaling pathway, leading to increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress. NINJ2 was identified as a direct functional partner of SLAMF8, with co-localization observed in the cytoplasm. Knockout of NINJ2 abolished SLAMF8-mediated activation of the TLR4/NF-&#x003ba;B pathway, neuroinflammation, and oxidative stress. The SLAMF8-NINJ2-TLR4/NF-&#x003ba;B axis is a crucial signaling pathway in AD progression. SLAMF8 and NINJ2 emerge as potential therapeutic targets for managing AD, with significant implications for future research and clinical interventions.</p><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1038/s41598-025-02097-6.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease (AD)</kwd><kwd>SLAMF8</kwd><kwd>NINJ2</kwd><kwd>TLR4/NF-&#x003ba;B pathway</kwd><kwd>Neuroinflammation</kwd><kwd>Oxidative stress</kwd><kwd>Therapeutic targets</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Cell biology</kwd><kwd>Neuroscience</kwd><kwd>Medical research</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>the Key Research and Development Program of Liaoning Province</institution></funding-source><award-id>2020JH2/10300047</award-id><award-id>2020JH2/10300047</award-id><award-id>2020JH2/10300047</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Shuo</given-names></name><name><surname>Bai</surname><given-names>Tao</given-names></name><name><surname>Feng</surname><given-names>Juan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer Nature Limited 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par15">Alzheimer&#x02019;s Disease (AD) is a major global health disorder, ranking among the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorders and a primary contributor to dementia-related mortality on a global scale<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. AD is a complex and highly heterogeneous disease, arising from multiple interactions among genetic alterations, epigenetic changes, and environmental factors. Despite extensive research, the exact pathogenesis of AD remains elusive. However, there is substantial evidence suggesting that neuroinflammation and oxidative stress are closely associated with AD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Furthermore, studies have indicated that AD patients might benefit from treatments targeting inflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> and oxidative stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par16">Members of the Signaling Lymphocytic Activation Molecule Family 8 (SLAMF8) have been recognized as crucial contributors to immune responses and inflammation. By modulating immune cell activity via pathways such as TLR4/NF-&#x003ba;B, PI3K/AKT, and MAPK, SLAMF8 influences the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6 and TNF-&#x003b1;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Furthermore, SLAMF8 has been shown to amplify immune responses by regulating these cytokines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. These cytokines are known to play a critical role in driving neuroinflammation, a hallmark of Alzheimer&#x02019;s Disease (AD). Thus, SLAMF8 may serve as a pivotal modulator in the inflammatory processes underlying AD pathology. However, despite these indications, the precise role of SLAMF8 in the progression of AD remains insufficiently characterized.</p><p id="Par17">Nerve Injury-Treated Protein (NINJ2) is an adhesion molecule involved in neuron growth and regeneration through homophilic interactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>.

The location navigation phase consists of four repeated trials conducted daily over a span of three consecutive days. During each trial, the animal is immersed in the water, positioned towards the pool wall in one of the quadrants, and given a maximum of 60&#x000a0;s to locate the concealed platform. Failure of an animal to find the platform within the designated time is met with manual guidance and a 20-second period of time spent there to enhance learning. The investigation phase takes place on the fourth day, precisely 24&#x000a0;h following the last learning trial, when the educational platform is no longer available. It is anticipated that each rat will swim for a duration of 60&#x000a0;s, with the greatest amount of time spent in the quadrant where the platform was previously positioned, known as the target quadrant. Behavioral parameters, including distance travelled, escape latency (time to locate the platform), swimming speed, time spent in the target quadrant, and number of platform crossings during the probe phase, are captured by a video camera and analysed using the EthoVision program. After completing the behavioral assessments, the mice were thoroughly sedated and administered 15&#x000a0;ml of phosphate-buffered saline through transcardial perfusion.

This differential expression was validated both in vivo and in vitro. RT-PCR and Western blot confirmed elevated SLAMF8 levels in A&#x003b2;<sub>1&#x02212;42</sub>-treated SH-SY5Y cells, LPS-treated HMC3 cells, and APP/PS1 mice. Additionally, immunohistochemistry staining demonstrated significantly higher SLAMF8 protein expression in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice.</p><p id="Par57">SLAMF8 is a member of the signaling lymphocyte activation molecule (SLAM) family, which includes nine structurally related proteins. The SLAM family is divided into classical and non-classical categories, with SLAMF1-7 classified as classical members and SLAMF8 and SLAMF9 as non-classical members. Unlike the classical SLAM receptors, the functions of the non-classical SLAM receptors are less well characterized. Limited studies have suggested that SLAMF8 may influence inflammation and oxidative stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. In this study, we demonstrated that SLAMF8 expression is significantly upregulated in AD models. Elevated SLAMF8 expression was associated with increased neuroinflammation and oxidative stress, which are both linked to the pathogenesis of AD and may exacerbate disease progression. These results highlight the potential role of SLAMF8 in the progression of Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease by contributing to neuroinflammation and oxidative stress. Given its upregulation in AD models, SLAMF8 may serve as a valuable biomarker for predicting disease severity and could be a promising target for therapeutic intervention.</p><p id="Par58">Next, we investigated the molecular mechanisms through which SLAMF8 contributes to Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease (AD) pathology. Emerging evidence has linked SLAMF8 to the TLR4/NF-&#x003ba;B pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Our findings further identified this pathway as a critical downstream mediator of SLAMF8&#x02019;s effects in AD. Overexpression of SLAMF8 activated the TLR4/NF-&#x003ba;B signaling cascade, resulting in elevated TLR4 levels and increased phosphorylation of p65 and I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1;. This activation subsequently upregulated TLR4/NF-&#x003ba;B target genes, amplifying the inflammatory response. The role of the TLR4/NF-&#x003ba;B pathway in AD is well-established, with its activation known to drive neuroinflammation and contribute to disease progression through increased pro-inflammatory cytokine production and oxidative stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par59">Increasing evidence suggests that proteins rely on multi-protein complexes to exert their functions. Here, we queried the IntAct database and identified NINJ2 as a potential Interacting partner of SLAMF8 in the TLR4/NF-&#x003ba;B signaling pathway. NINJ2 is a transmembrane protein encoded by a gene located on chromosome 12p13. It plays a crucial role in mediating cell-cell interactions during nervous system development and regeneration, particularly by promoting neurite outgrowth and supporting the regeneration of sensory and enteric neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Research has shown that NINJ2 is upregulated following nerve injury, where it contributes to neuroinflammation by regulating the NF-&#x003ba;B pathway through its interaction with TLR4<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. In this study, we demonstrated a direct interaction between SLAMF8 and NINJ2 through Co-IP and confocal immunofluorescence. Additionally, we found that overexpression of SLAMF8 led to a significant upregulation of NINJ2, suggesting that NINJ2 may serve as an interacting partner of SLAMF8. Furthermore, knockout of NINJ2 eliminated SLAMF8-mediated TLR4/NF-&#x003ba;B signaling, along with the associated increases in neuroinflammation and oxidative stress. Therefore, the SLAMF8-NINJ2-TLR4/NF-&#x003ba;B axis may represent a newly identified component of the pathogenic mechanism underlying Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>k).</p><p id="Par60">In conclusion, our study demonstrates that SLAMF8 and NINJ2 are key drivers of neuroinflammation and oxidative stress in Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease by activating the TLR4/NF-&#x003ba;B pathway. These findings open new avenues for Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease research, suggesting that SLAMF8 and NINJ2 could serve as potential therapeutic targets. Further exploration of this may lead to the development of novel treatment strategies for AD.</p></sec><sec id="Sec27" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.</p><p>
