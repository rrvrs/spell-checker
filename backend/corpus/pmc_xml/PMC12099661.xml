This innovative teaching strategy has been implemented across all educational levels (<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>) and has proven effective in fostering technical, social, and emotional competencies (<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). However, university education continues to face challenges in adapting to a rapidly evolving society while sustaining student interest and engagement (<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Moreover, digital overstimulation among young people has been shown to negatively impact concentration and motivation in educational settings (<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>).</p><p>Gamification has emerged as a strategy not only to enhance motivation but also to improve engagement and facilitate the knowledge acquisition process (<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Notably, it provides accessibility to diverse social groups and promotes inclusivity by fostering engagement and personalizing learning experiences (<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). This combination of inclusivity and ease of implementation highlights its potential as a transformative educational approach (<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Despite these benefits, further research is required to assess the long-term impacts of gamification in higher education (<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).</p><p>Gamification in higher education can be implemented through various strategies to enhance student engagement and learning outcomes. General gamification involves incorporating game-like elements, such as points, badges, and leaderboards, into the course structure to foster motivation and participation by leveraging the intrinsic appeal of games (<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Alternatively, targeted gamification activities, such as interactive storytelling, challenges, or problem-solving tasks, can be used to reinforce specific topics or address learning objectives (<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Tools like Kahoot! exemplify gamification platforms that create interactive and dynamic learning environments, promoting active student participation and engagement through quizzes and discussions (<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>).</p><p>It has been shown to improve comprehension, retention, and motivation in both flipped classroom and traditional teaching models (<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Additionally, Kahoot! supports the reinforcement of key concepts and promotes peer interaction, contributing to a collaborative and enjoyable learning experience (<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). These features collectively enhance educational outcomes through gamified strategies.</p><p>Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) is revolutionizing university teaching by introducing advanced tools that enhance learning environments through personalization, efficiency, and innovation. These systems adapt educational content to individual student needs, fostering engagement and improving performance (<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Real-time feedback and tailored support enable students to learn at their own pace, which is especially valuable in complex subjects (<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>).</p><p>For educators, GAI optimizes teaching efficiency by automating repetitive tasks, allowing them to focus on more complex instructional strategies (<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Additionally, various GAI tools can create interactive and immersive experiences, enriching the quality of instruction and promoting dynamic classroom interactions (<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). However, implementing GAI in higher education presents challenges, including ethical concerns about data privacy, biases, and equitable access to technology. Addressing these issues through clear institutional policies is essential to harness the benefits of GAI while minimizing risks (<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><p>The aim of this study was to implement and evaluate various innovative strategies to enhance student motivation and engagement while achieving the educational objectives of the first-year Biology course in the Veterinary degree.

Zoology</title><p>The classic game Who&#x02019;s Who? involves guessing the opponent&#x02019;s secret character by asking yes-or-no questions, progressively eliminating characters until the correct one is identified. In this adaptation for the Zoology module, 16 evolutionary traits were selected to classify 24 animals into 19 taxonomic groups, following the criteria outlined by Hickman et al. (<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Structuring the inquiry process around these evolutionary traits and the taxonomic hierarchy provides players with a strategic advantage, which can be crucial for winning the game.</p><p>After selecting appropriate species, a comprehensive script was developed, including concise game instructions and explanations of the evolutionary features present in the game (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref>). This was accompanied by individual cards for each species, which included illustrations, scientific and common names, conservation status, distribution maps, taxonomic characteristics, and scientific fun facts (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1b</xref>). Additionally, a simplified phylogenetic tree of the animal kingdom was created for students to use as a &#x0201c;map&#x0201d; of the taxa featured in the game, highlighting the evolutionary traits that position them within the animal kingdom (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1c</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Materials included in the Who&#x02019;s Who?

The surveys included various questions with five response options based on the Likert scale, ranging from 1 (nothing/disagree) to 5 (a lot/strongly agree). A QR code linked to the surveys was provided to facilitate access via mobile devices.</p><p>All materials were printed on 300-gram paper, cut to fit the game boards, and inserted into generic Who&#x02019;s Who? boards (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1d</xref>). These customized boards, along with the game manuals and the phylogenetic scheme, were distributed among the students for gameplay.</p><p>To explore the potential of GAI, PromeAI, an online tool based on GAI, was utilized. By uploading the original drawings created by the authors, the tool generated new illustrations inspired by the originals. Using Adobe Photoshop 2020&#x000ae;, these AI-generated images were further refined and blended with the original illustrations to produce a hybrid image that was superior to the initial version.</p></sec><sec id="sec4"><label>2.2</label><title>Kahoot as a tool for reviewing content in practical classes</title><p>The online platform Kahoot! was used to review key concepts in biology practical sessions. Over the course of three laboratory days, six practical sessions were conducted, with a Kahoot created for each session consisting of five questions, each offering four possible answers.</p><p>To assess the effectiveness of this activity, the practical grades of two different cohorts were compared. In the first cohort, Kahoot was not used in any of the practical sessions, while in the second cohort, it was incorporated into all sessions. As a control, the total course grade was used. For data analysis and graphical representation, GraphPad Prism 9 v.9.4.0 software was used, and Student&#x02019;s t-test was applied.

At the end of each discussion, the teacher analyzed the strengths and weaknesses of each proposal and provided a theoretical and scientific potential solution to each problem.</p><p>To encourage participation, students were not allowed to act as a spokesperson more than once. To foster inclusivity and prevent students from staying within their existing friend groups, a token system was implemented to ensure random group assignments (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b</xref>). At the beginning of the session, each student received a token, which determined their group for each problem: colors for the first problem, symbols for the second, and numbers for the third and final problem.</p></sec><sec id="sec6"><label>2.4</label><title>Students&#x02019; general perception of the subject after gamification</title><p>At the end of the academic year, a survey was conducted to assess students&#x02019; perceptions of the biology signature, following the implementation of <italic>Kahoot</italic> in practical sessions, the gamification activity &#x0201c;<italic>Who&#x02019;s Who?

Each activity uniquely contributed to reinforcing knowledge, fostering interaction, and promoting a more dynamic learning environment. However, while the findings are promising, several factors must be considered when interpreting the results.</p><p>One of the most successful strategies was the integration of Kahoot! as a gamified tool for reviewing key concepts in practical sessions. This approach significantly improved students&#x02019; performance in practical exams, demonstrating its effectiveness as a reinforcement tool. Its ease of implementation, minimal time investment (approximately 10&#x0202f;min per quiz), and low cost make Kahoot! a highly accessible strategy for reinforcing key concepts in an interactive manner. However, one limitation of this study is the potential influence of instructor changes during the first year of implementation. Although the structure of practical sessions, presentations, and exams remained unchanged, newly appointed instructors may have also contributed to the observed improvement in student performance. Future studies should control this variable by assessing the long-term impact of Kahoot! across multiple academic years and different instructors.</p><p>Another innovative approach involved the adaptation of the classic Who&#x02019;s Who? game for the Zoology module. This tool proved highly effective in reinforcing complex taxonomic and evolutionary concepts through a strategic and engaging format. Notably, the integration of generative artificial intelligence (GAI) in the development of visual materials provided valuable insights into its applicability in education. While GAI was particularly useful for enhancing low-quality illustrations, its application to high-quality images sometimes resulted in a decline in visual clarity and esthetic appeal. Moreover, survey responses indicated that students highly valued the fact that the game&#x02019;s illustrations were created by their instructors, underscoring the importance of maintaining a human touch in educational resources.</p><p>Beyond gamification, the implementation of dynamic class sessions further contributed to fostering student interaction and engagement. The randomized group formation system encouraged students to collaborate with peers outside their usual social circles, which was particularly beneficial for those who struggle with socialization. This approach not only facilitated teamwork and problem-solving but also contributed to the development of essential soft skills, such as public speaking and critical thinking. These findings align with existing literature suggesting that interactive, student-centered learning environments enhance engagement and improve knowledge retention.</p><p>The combination of gamification activities and dynamic class sessions led to a highly positive student perception of the Biology subject. While these findings reinforce the effectiveness of innovative teaching methodologies, it is important to acknowledge other contributing factors, such as the course content, instructional materials, and lecture quality. The Biology subject in this study covers inherently engaging topics, and instructors invest effort into designing visually appealing and scientifically rigorous presentations. Nevertheless, these results support the broader argument for transforming university education to align with contemporary students&#x02019; needs. Modernizing teaching strategies by making courses more interactive, engaging, and motivating does not undermine the scientific rigor of higher education; in fact, it enhances knowledge acquisition and fosters a more meaningful learning experience.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="sec13"><title>Data availability statement</title><p>The original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/supplementary material, further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding author.</p></sec><sec sec-type="ethics-statement" id="sec14"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>Ethical review and approval were not required for this study involving human participants, as per local legislation and institutional guidelines.
