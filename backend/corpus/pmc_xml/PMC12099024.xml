</xref> This study, conducted in partnership with the Victorian Government Department of Health and Human Services, made 12 recommendations to optimise MAC structure and function and identified opportunities for MACs to transition from a reactive to a proactive model of quality improvement.

</xref> The Audit Tool was designed to support self&#x02010;reflection by residential care provider organisations to identify improvement opportunities. However, there were no national baseline data on the structure and function of MACs for residential care provider organisations to benchmark against. Benchmarking self&#x02010;audit results against national data may help to drive quality improvement.

</xref> The survey included all questions in the Audit Tool, but several multi&#x02010;part questions in the Audit Tool were divided into separate survey items and additional response options were added for some items (i.e. in addition to yes/no). The content validity and face validity of the survey instrument were evaluated by a multidisciplinary panel comprising representatives from two residential care provider organisations. Minor amendments were made to the survey based on the panel feedback, such as improving clarity of some questions by providing definitions of key concepts.</p><p>The survey instrument was divided into two sections and included closed&#x02010;ended (e.g. dichotomous, multiple choice and multi&#x02010;answer questions) and open&#x02010;ended free&#x02010;text items. Section A related to establishing and implementing MACs and included six items from the Audit Tool and 10 items on MAC and residential care facility demographics and structure. Section B related to the four roles of MACs outlined in the Audit Tool: (1) develop and endorse policies, procedures and guidelines and advise on legislation and standards (three items), (2) advise on risk management systems associated with medication management (seven items), (3) identify education and training needs for medication management (eight items) and (4) monitor effectiveness and performance as well as implement quality improvement strategies for medication management (nine items).</p></sec><sec id="ajag70048-sec-0010"><label>2.2</label><title>Participants and sample size</title><p>The survey instrument was designed for completion by MAC chairs or members employed (e.g. registered nurses) or contracted (e.g. general practitioners, accredited pharmacists [now known as credentialled pharmacists], and community pharmacists) by residential care provider organisations. In the absence of a register or list of Australian MACs, we adopted a broad but purposive sampling strategy to elicit responses from MAC chairs or members in metropolitan and non&#x02010;metropolitan areas across all Australian states and mainland territories. The survey was open for a 9&#x02010;week period. The study did not involve hypothesis testing and so we did not perform an a priori sample size calculation. However, we aimed to recruit participants that represented MACs covering more than 10% of Australia's 2639 residential care facilities.<xref rid="ajag70048-bib-0013" ref-type="bibr">

Advising on risk management, through collaborative development of strategies to control, reduce or eliminate medicine&#x02010;related risks was the most common reported function of MACs (117, 98%) (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="ajag70048-tbl-0003" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Risk management activities were informed by internal audits (95, 79%), National Quality Indicator Program data (90, 75%), electronic medication incident reporting systems (84, 70%), medication use patterns and trends (84, 70%), quality improvement strategies (83, 69%) and serious incident response scheme (SIRS) reports (83, 69%). Twenty MACs (18%) reported they were not responsible for informing and updating risk assessments and the risk management system associated with medication management. More than half of MACs had reviewed and self&#x02010;reported being adherent with the &#x02018;Guiding Principles for Medication Management in Residential Aged Care Facilities&#x02019; document (75, 63%). A further 23% (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;27) reported they planned to review the Guiding Principles within the next 6&#x02009;months.

When this was not the responsibility of the MAC, participants qualitatively described this role was commonly reported to be the responsibility of the residential care facility or the facility manager, head office or other quality, governance or education committees. Education was mostly delivered face&#x02010;to&#x02010;face (106, 88%) and via e&#x02010;learning (86, 72%).

Almost all MACs reported being proactive and responsive to medication management issues and risks (115, 96%), and three&#x02010;quarters of those MACs (90/115, 78%) reported that they developed action plans in response to identified issues and risks. Nearly all MACs reported that they utilised a pharmacist to support QUM activities (116, 97%). The existing strategies or sources of data most used to evaluate QUM included number and type of medication incidents (98, 82%), the psychotropic register (93, 78%) and numbers of residential medication management reviews completed (90, 75%). Eighteen (15%) MACs reported they did not evaluate existing QUM strategies. Less than half of the MACs measured resident experiences with medication management (57, 48%), with most responding that this was completed by facility&#x02010;level staff (e.g. registered nurses, care staff, facility managers or pharmacists) or not at all.

However, developing action plans, implementing and monitoring the effectiveness of quality improvement initiatives were among the least reported functions.

</xref> Potential limitations include the recruitment methodology. In the absence of a register or comprehensive list of Australian MACs, we employed a broad recruitment strategy. This maximised the number of MACs, but we were not able to directly calculate a response rate. It is possible that well&#x02010;functioning MACs were more likely to participate (self&#x02010;selection bias). The study relied on self&#x02010;reporting, and it is possible that MAC representatives over&#x02010; or under&#x02010;estimated each role/function. The high proportion of MACs that involved accredited pharmacists may reflect recruitment of MAC representatives through pharmacist organisations and Facebook groups. This may have influenced the prevalence of reporting certain functions of the MACs. For these reasons, the results of the study may not be generalisable to all MACs in Australia.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="ajag70048-sec-0022"><label>5</label><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>MACs are diverse in their structure and function, and operate largely in accordance with Australian Government recommendations. However, opportunities exist for MACs to have a greater role in planning, implementing and monitoring quality improvement initiatives. Optimising the structure of MACs, including ensuring multidisciplinary representation and up&#x02010;to&#x02010;date terms of reference, may be important first steps. Future work should explore the impact of the variation in structure and function of MACs on resident and medication management outcomes, and evaluate the effectiveness and cost&#x02010;effectiveness of interventions designed to optimise the function of MACs.</p></sec><sec id="ajag70048-sec-0024"><title>FUNDING INFORMATION</title><p>This study was supported by the Commonwealth of Australia represented by the Department of Health and Aged Care Medical Research Future Fund (MRFF) Quality, Safety and Effectiveness of Medicine Use by Pharmacists, 2022 grant (grant ID: MRFMMIP000025).
