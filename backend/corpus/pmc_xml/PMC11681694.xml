Research has established numerous associations with disruptive behavior symptoms. For example, elevated CU-traits predict greater severity and persistence of delinquency and aggression, involvement with the criminal justice system, substance abuse, and animal cruelty in youth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par20">In contrast, studies focusing on the relevance of CU-traits for internalizing psychopathology (e.g., depression, anxiety) during childhood and adolescence are less numerous than for externalizing psychopathology. Moreover, they often yield inconsistent findings. With respect to anxiety, for example, some studies have reported that increased fearless behavior and lower levels of trait anxiety are related to CU-traits (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]), whereas other studies have reported no correlation between CU-traits and anxiety levels (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]), or even positive correlations (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]). When controlling for conduct problem (CP) severity, most studies revealed a negative association between CU-traits and anxiety levels (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]). Some studies found a moderating effect of CU-traits on associations between externalizing disorders and anxiety levels. Children and adolescents with externalizing disorders and higher CU-traits exhibited lower anxiety levels than those with externalizing disorders and lower CU-traits. They also had less anxiety than children and adolescents with other clinical disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Frick and Ray [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] summarize a growing body of research showing that even the high CP and high CU-group cannot be considered homogeneous. They proposed that different developmental pathways lead to differences in anxiety scores. According to the authors, this yields two groups: Children and adolescents with high CU-traits and high levels of anxiety versus children and adolescents with high CU-traits and low levels of anxiety.</p><p id="Par21">A limited number of studies exist with respect to the relationship between CU-traits and depression. For example, in a 10-year follow-up study, mood disorders in childhood predicted CU-traits in adulthood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. CU-traits also showed a negative relationship with ratings of suicidality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In a recent study, elevations in conduct problems [CP] and CU-traits over the course of a year during adolescence were associated with elevations in levels of anxiety and depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In female adolescents, CU-traits, and especially the unemotional subscale, were positively correlated with social phobia, depression, and internalizing symptoms generally in a school sample but not in a clinical sample [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Moreover, female adolescents with both high anxiety and high CU-traits presented more significant symptoms of depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p id="Par22">An explanation for the conflicting results, particularly regarding anxiety and CU-traits, may lie in the multidimensionality of CU-traits. Factor analyses of the Inventory of Callous-Unemotional Traits (ICU; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]), often used to measure CU-traits, have identified three CU subdimensions: uncaringness (i.e., indifference towards other people&#x02019;s feelings and performance on essential tasks), unemotionality (i.e., deficient emotional affect), and callousness (i.e., lacking empathy and remorse). A meta-analytic review of the validity of the ICU found that the uncaringness and callousness subscales reliably correlate with psychopathic traits generally and with externalizing behaviors, such as aggression, delinquency, and hyperactivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In contrast, the unemotional subscale showed weak or no correlations to externalizing behaviors, psychopathy, and the other two subscales, suggesting that it may be less relevant to these constructs. These findings indicate that different dimensions of CU-traits may be differentially associated with externalizing and internalizing symptoms. Most studies treat CU-traits as a unidimensional construct by relying on the ICU total score, which obscures whether elevated CU-traits are primarily driven by the unemotional subscale or by the callous or uncaring subscales. This methodological approach may help explain the inconsistent findings in previous research.</p><p id="Par23">Another aspect of the multidimensionality of CU-traits refers to at least two distinct aetiological pathways underlying the presence of CU-traits: a primary and a secondary pathway. Primary CU-traits are thought to be present from birth. They are associated with diminished socioemotional responses to distress (i.e., hypoarousal), fearless temperament, and deficits in emotional processing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Consequently, the relationship between primary CU-traits and internalizing symptoms should be negative, particularly between primary CU-traits and anxiety. In contrast, secondary CU-traits are believed to develop during childhood and adolescence as a possible response to adverse events and environmental factors (e.g., trauma, maltreatment, low parental warmth, and environmental adversity) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Patients with secondary CU-traits are characterized by hyperarousal, in contrast to hypoarousal, and increased sensitivity to socioemotional stimuli. This hyperarousal may then trigger negative affect and lead to higher rates of internalizing symptoms, such as depression and anxiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. It is also possible that in patients who have experienced many adverse life events, CU-traits and internalizing symptoms develop comorbidly as a response to these experiences. Secondary CU-traits could explain results from studies finding positive associations and comorbidities between internalizing symptoms (e.g. depression and anxiety) and CU-traits (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]). CU-traits could then be regarded as a transdiagnostic phenomenon relevant across the spectrum of internalizing and externalizing symptoms. The concept of CU-traits as a potential transdiagnostic construct also fits well within the framework of network theory. Network analysis can test the proposed associations between CU-traits and internalizing symptoms. It can also investigate possible transdiagnostic mechanisms of CU-traits.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Network theory</title><p id="Par24">Within network theory, a disorder is regarded as a cluster of functionally related symptoms. These symptoms are not caused by a latent variable but rather constitute the disorder itself [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. More specifically, symptoms of a certain disorder (e.g., depression) are regarded as nodes (e.g., anhedonia, depressed mood) within the network and are directly related to each other via edges (e.g., the relationship between anhedonia and depressed mood). In a real-world translation, network theory proposes that when a sufficient number of symptoms are activated for a sufficient amount of time, activation spreads across the network, resulting in the manifestation of the disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Typically, it is hypothesized that symptoms within a certain disorder are related to each other; however, some symptoms exhibit greater centrality to the network (i.e., they have more and stronger connections to the other symptoms). These central symptoms can be regarded as the core symptoms of the disorder that have a high impact on the network. Consequently, (de)activating them, for example, by trauma or psychotherapy, should result in the (de)activation of the disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Network theory further proposes that there are symptoms that do not clearly belong to a distinct disorder but rather show connections to the symptom networks of different mental disorders. These bridge symptoms (e.g., rumination) create overlap between different mental disorders by displaying edges to one disorder (e.g., depression) and another disorder (e.g., anxiety) and, when activated, are thought to explain the pathway that underlies comorbidity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Within network theory, bridge symptoms can then be regarded as transdiagnostic factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], and CU traits could be one of these transdiagnostic factors for internalizing and externalizing psychopathology.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>CU-networks</title><p id="Par25">Network analysis has been applied several times to study the architecture of CU-traits as well as associations with psychopathology. Most studies employed the ICU [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] to measure CU-traits. Two studies assessed the network structure of the ICU among children and adolescents. Bansal and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] constructed a CU-network within a group of preschool children (<italic>M</italic><sub><italic>age</italic></sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;4.76) in which more than two-thirds had a diagnosis of an externalizing disorder. The most central items in their network belonged to the callousness dimension. Deng and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] compared the CU-networks of juvenile offenders (<italic>M</italic><sub><italic>age</italic></sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;17.14) and community youths (<italic>M</italic><sub><italic>age</italic></sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;10.82). Their results also identified callousness items to be most central in both groups and unemotional items to be peripheral. However, psychopathology was not assessed in their study and there was a significant difference in age between the groups: Whereas juvenile offenders were, on average, in late adolescence, community youth were in late childhood. Since adolescence is a critical period for developmental trajectories of CU-traits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], this age difference might have confounded the results. Two studies focused on the associations between CU-traits and externalizing psychopathology. Bansal and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] again investigated a sample of preschool children (<italic>M</italic><sub><italic>age</italic></sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;4.76) in which more than two-thirds had a diagnosis of an externalizing disorder. A combined network with symptoms of ODD, CD, and CU-traits was constructed. The results revealed that an irritable mood, argumentative behavior, aggression, and callousness were the primary bridges for ODD, CD, and CU-traits. Goulter and Moretti [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] investigated associations between CU-traits and CD via network analysis with children and adolescents (<italic>M</italic><sub><italic>age</italic></sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;13.98) suffering from serious behavioral and social-emotional problems. Again, the results showed callousness items to be most central to the network and an important bridge between CD and CU. In sum, within the field of externalizing psychopathology, callousness seems to be the most important factor contributing to the comorbidity between behavioral problems and CU-traits. All network analyses with developmental samples within the field of CU-traits focused on externalizing psychopathology and did not include internalizing symptoms; only the study by Goulter and Moretti [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] included youth suffering from internalizing and externalizing psychopathology. In adults, three network analyses have assessed associations between psychopathic traits and internalizing symptoms. Zhang and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] investigated links between psychopathy, anxiety, and depression in a sample of adult male offenders. They found anxiety and depression to be peripheral in the network. Associations with psychopathy facets arose within the affective, behavioral, and antisocial domains. Oba and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] explored associations between primary and secondary psychopathy and externalizing and internalizing symptoms within an adult community sample. They found primary psychopathy (more closely resembling CU-traits) to be negatively associated with trait anxiety and secondary psychopathy to be positively related to trait anxiety. Li et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] examined the interrelations among Machiavellianism, narcissism, psychopathy, and depression in university students. Their results showed that psychopathy exhibited high centrality within the network and had significant relations to suicidal ideation. These studies provide preliminary evidence for the potential relevance of CU-traits to internalizing psychopathology in adults. Due to the inconsistencies in studies regarding the role of CU-traits in internalizing symptoms in childhood and adolescence, it remains unclear whether CU-traits should be addressed in the treatment depression and anxiety, or whether they are more relevant for externalizing disorders in these age groups. This is particularly relevant for adolescence, a period marked by a heightened risk for developing internalizing symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]&#x02014;however, most network analyses have been based on child or adult samples.</p><p id="Par26">With regard to the associations between anxiety and depression in adolescence, to our knowledge, three network analyses have been conducted in samples with clinical levels of psychopathology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Results showed that depression and anxiety were closely connected. The studies found the following bridges between the two constructs: restlessness or trouble relaxing, sad mood and lack of cheerful emotions, excessive crying, low self-esteem, disturbed appetite, school impairments, physical symptoms of depression, and worrying.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Present study</title><p id="Par27">The primary aim of the present study was to identify central symptoms and bridge symptoms in a combined network of CU-traits, internalizing psychopathology (i.e., depression, anxiety), and externalizing psychopathology (i.e., CP) in an adolescent clinical sample while controlling for age and gender as covariates. With respect to the heterogeneity of findings in the studies that investigate the relationship between CU-traits and internalizing symptoms, the network analysis is thought to be hypothesis-generating rather than hypothesis-testing. Our second aim was to test, using a network comparison test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], whether the aforementioned network would differ significantly between adolescents with CDs and adolescents with internalizing disorders (INT). We expect that the networks of CD- and INT-patients differ significantly with respect to global strength invariance and centrality invariance. We hypothesize that the network of CD-patients is denser than the network of INT-patients, indicating stronger associations between CU-traits, internalizing, and externalizing symptoms in CD than in INT. Moreover, we expect CU- and CP-nodes to be more central in the CD-network and depression and anxiety nodes to be more central in the INT-network. With respect to other network comparisons (i.e., network structure, edge invariance), no specific hypotheses can be formulated owing to the lack of studies in this area.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec7"><title>Participants</title><p id="Par28">Data from 1002 adolescent inpatients with varying psychiatric symptomatology of the LWL-University Hospital for Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Hamm in Germany were used for the study.

In step one, a network of CU-traits, internalizing symptoms (i.e., depression, anxiety), and externalizing symptoms (i.e., conduct problems (CP)) was analyzed within 978 inpatients with a range of psychopathological conditions (network analysis 1). In step two, the network was compared between individuals with conduct disorder (CD) and individuals with internalizing (INT) psychopathology (network analysis 2).</p><sec id="Sec40"><title>Core symptoms of the CU-INT comorbidity network</title><p id="Par58">This study aimed to identify the most central symptoms within the combined network of CU-traits and internalizing psychopathology. Depressive symptoms (i.e., <italic>depressed mood</italic>), anxiety symptoms (i.e., <italic>sudden fear, feeling afraid</italic>, <italic>obsessive thoughts, worry about school performance</italic>), and CU-symptoms (i.e., <italic>uncaring about hurting others, not showing emotions</italic>) emerged as core symptoms. The centrality of <italic>depressed mood</italic> might be explained by the fact that half of the sample had a diagnosis of depression as the main diagnosis, and depressive symptoms also co-occur frequently with other diagnoses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>].</p><p id="Par59">Surprisingly, <italic>depressed mood</italic> remained the only depression item among the most central items, whereas anxiety items played an especially prominent role. This might be explained by the high degree of comorbidity between depression and anxiety disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>] and the transdiagnostic nature of questionnaire items. Whereas <italic>sudden scare</italic> and <italic>feeling afraid</italic> are typical symptoms of anxiety disorders, <italic>worrying about school performance,</italic> as well as <italic>obsessive thoughts</italic> are rather transdiagnostic symptoms. For example, worrying about school might also result from concentration problems and lower performance levels typically associated with depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>] or substance abuse disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>] or from disruptive behavior problems typically occurring in CD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. Although the item regarding <italic>obsessive thoughts</italic> is meant to measure obsessive thoughts occurring in obsessive&#x02013;compulsive disorder, the item is framed in rather general language. Thus, depressive patients might experience suicidal thoughts as obsessive, whereas, for example, youth with substance abuse might experience thoughts about taking drugs as obsessive. Worrying or rumination about a certain topic might, therefore, be a transdiagnostic symptom rather than a pure anxiety symptom.</p><p id="Par60">Rather surprisingly, two CU-items were among the most central nodes. The first CU-item, <italic>not showing emotions</italic>, points to a connection between the unemotionality facet of CU-traits and internalizing symptoms. Within (primary) CU-traits, unemotionality is regarded as a trait present from birth and is already observable in 6-month-old babies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>], accompanied by deviations at the neural level (e.g., reduced amygdala activity toward emotional stimuli; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]). In this concept, unemotionality refers not only to expressing emotions but also to not experiencing emotions as strongly (e.g., lessened threat reactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and reduced affective empathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]). The item, however, measures not showing emotions more generally. Youths with depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>], social phobia (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]) and CU-traits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] all seem to have diminished emotional expressions; however, the reasons underlying this facet of unemotionality possibly differ strongly between the diagnostic categories. Whereas adolescents with social phobia might show less emotional expression to avoid interaction and due to an internal state of fear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>], diminished expression in depressed individuals may serve the purpose of inhibiting ongoing emotional reactivity in adverse and potentially dangerous environments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. Thus, not expressing emotions can be regarded as a transdiagnostic symptom that occurs in diverse psychopathologies, and this transdiagnostic mechanism could potentially help explain the results of studies finding positive associations between measures of CU-traits and anxiety and depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p id="Par61">The relevance of the second central CU-item, <italic>uncaring about hurting others,</italic> seems counterintuitive at first glance. Although correlations with other CU-symptoms and with CPs seemed likely, associations with depressive and anxiety symptoms were rather unexpected. An explanation might be the concept of a secondary variant of CU-traits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. In patients who experienced a high number of adverse life events, CU-traits and internalizing symptoms may have developed comorbidly in response to adverse experiences. In patients with primary CU-traits, however, no associations or negative associations with internalizing symptoms might arise. Independent of their origin (primary or secondary pathway), the CU-traits expressed by patients are theoretically thought to be the same (for conflicting evidence, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]). The ICU, which was employed in the present study, cannot differentiate between the variants. Yet, the high number of internalizing diagnoses in the total sample (i.e., more than half of the participants had a primary diagnosis of depression) makes the presence of secondary CU-traits more likely. These secondary CU-traits might drive correlations between CU-traits and anxiety or depressive symptoms, resulting in a relatively high centrality of CU-symptoms.</p></sec><sec id="Sec41"><title>Transdiagnostic mechanisms between anxiety, depression, and CU-traits</title><p id="Par62">In the network analysis, <italic>losing temper</italic> and <italic>lying/cheating</italic> emerged as relevant bridge symptoms, or transdiagnostically relevant symptoms, in the CP-cluster. Within the anxiety cluster, <italic>obsessive thoughts</italic>&#x000a0;were the most important bridge item. Within the depression cluster, <italic>psychomotor functioning</italic> and <italic>suicidal ideation</italic> were the most important bridges. With respect to CU-traits, <italic>uncaring about hurting others</italic> was also a bridge item, together with <italic>feeling guilty*</italic>. CU-traits did not have substantially lower bridge values than the other clusters did. The bridge strength value was even greater for some CU-items than for depression items. This result seems to provide evidence for a potentially transdiagnostic mechanism of CU-traits. With respect to CPs, CU-traits seem to be a risk factor: There were positive bridges between <italic>not feeling guilty*</italic> and <italic>obedience*</italic> and between <italic>uncaring about hurting others</italic> and <italic>fighting/forcing others</italic>, which fits well with the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. For anxiety and depressive symptoms, the picture was more complex. <italic>Feeling guilty*</italic> seemed to be a protective factor as it has negative bridge associations with <italic>worrying</italic> and <italic>depressed mood</italic>. This finding is consistent with the literature showing that guilt is positively associated with internalizing disorders and negatively associated with externalizing disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. In contrast, <italic>uncaring about hurting others</italic> may be a risk factor for the activation of <italic>psychomotor functioning</italic> and <italic>checking behavior</italic> through positive bridges. One reason for this might be the hyperarousal found in adolescents with high CU-traits and high comorbid internalizing psychopathology (i.e., secondary CU-variant) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. <italic>Checking behavior</italic> might be a strategy to cope with hyperarousal and associated stronger responses to socioemotional stimuli. <italic>Psychomotor functioning</italic> captures slowing down or being restless. Restlessness might also be a symptom of the hyperarousal associated with secondary CU-traits.</p></sec><sec id="Sec42"><title>Comparisons of the CD- and INT-networks</title><p id="Par63">The results of the network comparison between the CD- and INT-subsamples were contrary to our expectations. We expected the CD-network to be denser than the INT-network, as indicated by strength invariance. We also expected CD and CP nodes to be especially central in the CU-network, and depression and anxiety to be especially prominent in the INT-network, expressed by centrality invariance. Instead, our results all pointed in one direction: CU-traits were relevant in both networks. Moreover, the INT-network had a greater density (i.e., greater connectivity among symptoms) than the CD-network. Based on the literature, one would expect that the higher density scores might be explained by stronger edges between anxiety and depressive symptoms owing to their symptomatic overlap and comorbidity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>] in internalizing samples. However, most of the variables that were significantly more central in the INT-network were CU-nodes. These CU-items included symptoms from all three CU-facets: unemotionality, callousness, and uncaringness. This surprising finding fits well with the model of secondary CU-traits and is in line with previous findings of increased anxiety and depression in this patient group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Interestingly, CD seemed to have an impact on these relations: Within the CD-network, CU-symptoms exhibited mostly positive associations with CPs and depression symptoms but negative associations with anxiety symptoms. This matches the pattern associated with primary CU-traits (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]). In contrast, in the INT-network, only a few (mostly negative) pathways were observed between CU-traits and anxiety symptoms, which shows that CU-traits and anxiety might be unrelated in INT-samples. This was also reflected in the edge invariance test that pointed to significant differences among CU-internalizing pathways between the networks. The results are consistent with the contradictory findings in the literature that have established positive associations between CU- and internalizing symptoms (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]), no associations (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]), or negative associations (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]). The data further show that depression and anxiety should not be combined when looking at associations with CU-traits.</p></sec><sec id="Sec43"><title>Translation to psychopathology and psychotherapy</title><p id="Par64">Our results contribute to the current understanding of the architecture and transdiagnostic role of CU-traits. CU-items were central and influential not only in the CD-network but also in the INT-network and the overall transdiagnostic network&#x02014;even when controlling for CPs, age, and gender. Interestingly, items from the unemotional facet of CU-traits were not the only ones&#x000a0;associated with internalizing symptoms. Items from the callousness and uncaringness dimensions of CU-traits also served as bridges between the disorders. This finding extends the results from previous network analyses that identified these dimensions as bridges to externalizing symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], highlighting their relevance for internalizing symptoms as well.</p><p id="Par65">The network comparison pointed to somewhat differential associations of CU-traits and internalizing symptoms between the CD- and INT-patient groups. These divergent results might be related to differences in CU-variants: primary and secondary CU-traits, respectively. Whereas the CD-network might have contained a higher proportion of participants characterized by primary CU-traits, the INT-network might have contained a higher proportion of participants with secondary CU-traits. As the ICU used in this study to measure CU-traits does not account for the aetiology of CU-traits, further studies are needed to shed light on this hypothesis. In sum, our results point to the relevance of CU-traits across diagnostic categories in line with the previous work of Herpers and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>], rather than having relevance only for externalizing behavior problems, as proposed by Frick and Moffitt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. Clinically, our results have implications for psychotherapeutic approaches within CU-traits. CU-traits are traditionally only targeted in the treatment of externalizing patient groups; however, our results imply that it might be helpful to address CU-traits in the treatment of internalizing patients. There is accumulating evidence (for a review, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]) that adolescents who are high on both&#x000a0;CU-traits and internalizing psychopathology are at higher risk for adverse outcomes. Therefore, studies should investigate the effects of including CU-traits in treatment programs for internalizing patients.</p><p id="Par66">Comorbidities traditionally present a challenge for clinicians because they have a negative impact on treatment success, and it is often unclear which symptoms should be prioritized during treatment. Central and bridge symptoms might be a reasonable choice to address first in treatments because targeting them may disrupt pathways that maintain comorbidity and spread across several symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. Our results suggest that when combining results regarding node and bridge centrality, clinicians should focus especially on the anxiety item <italic>obsessive thoughts</italic>. This item was among the items with the highest (bridge) centrality and was the only node in the network nominated in all categories. Furthermore, no difference in the centrality of this node between the subsamples was found, indicating an equally high relevance of this item in both subgroups. As mentioned above, it remains unclear whether the high centrality of <italic>obsessive thoughts</italic> is due to the wording of the item, which might capture very different types of thoughts experienced as obsessive (e.g., suicidal or negative thoughts in depression, thoughts about substances in addiction, or thoughts about a specific anxiety-related stimulus in phobic disorders). If the item captures worrying or rumination, as speculated, then the current results match results from another network analysis in an adolescent clinical sample: in Ruan et al.&#x02019;s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] network analysis, worrying was established as an essential bridge between anxiety and depression. Further studies are needed to investigate whether <italic>obsessive thoughts</italic> are also central to other symptom networks in adolescent psychiatric samples.</p></sec><sec id="Sec44"><title>Limitations</title><p id="Par67">The present study has several limitations. The sample was not equally balanced across the categories of anxiety, depression, CPs, and CU-traits. Whereas approximately half of the sample had a primary diagnosis of depression, less than one-fifth of the participants had a primary diagnosis of CD, and only a small number of participants suffered primarily from an anxiety disorder. Additionally, our sample was highly comorbid and had a high level of psychopathology in general, as we recruited psychiatric inpatients. The study has been conducted in Germany, which might have implications on the sample's composition in terms of the most prevalent diagnostic categories. Symptoms were assessed via self-reports, which might be more reliable for internalizing (depression, anxiety) than for externalizing (CP, CU) symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>] and might be biased by the participants&#x02019; current emotional state. Future studies should include a more balanced sample regarding internalizing and externalizing disorders. Symptoms should be assessed with multi-informant reports.</p><p id="Par68">The data collected in the study are cross-sectional. Therefore, we cannot make any statements regarding the causality and predictive value of the results. The identified bridge and core symptoms may be influenced by other symptoms, actively influence other symptoms, or both within the causal chain. Future studies should assess symptoms longitudinally to obtain a clearer understanding of developmental trajectories among symptoms.</p><p id="Par69">The groups compared with the network comparison test had unequal group sizes. Therefore, the results for the INT-group have more statistical power than those for the CD-group. Future studies should recruit more patients for both groups. Finally, we cannot generalize our findings across cultures or age groups, as this was not a multicenter international study that spans the lifespan.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec45"><title>Conclusions and future directions</title><p id="Par70">The present study sheds light on the nature of the comorbidity between CU-traits and internalizing symptoms and contributes to a currently understudied field of research. Our findings suggest a complex interplay between CU-traits and internalizing psychopathology. Future studies should further investigate the transdiagnostic potential of CU-traits and clarify whether transdiagnostic mechanisms of CU-traits only emerge in cross-sectional research or whether these associations can be observed in longitudinal studies. For example, future studies should shed light on the predictive validity of CU-traits for internalizing and externalizing symptoms and for the development of individual symptom networks over time. Future clinical research should investigate the effectiveness and practicability of targeting suggested bridges and core symptoms identified via network analysis in intervention studies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec46" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>
