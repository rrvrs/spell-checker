Making the response more effective is one of the solutions to meet the growing needs.

The review focused on the empirical application of MCDA to support decision-making during health emergencies. The review was guided by the Joanna Briggs Institute methodology for scoping reviews and adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews.

The articles described the MCDA application to support a variety of decision problems related to health emergency management.

The review emphasizes that while MCDA is already used for infectious hazards, it is underutilized for other types of health emergencies.

Unsurprisingly, COVID-19 alone caused over eight million deaths and the loss of one-tenth of the global economy (<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Nevertheless, it is essential to keep an all-hazards perspective, acknowledging the considerable impact on human health caused by natural disasters and armed conflict and their frequent overlap with outbreaks of infectious diseases. In total, 399 disasters related to natural hazards were reported in 2023 (<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). These events resulted in 86,473 fatalities, affecting almost a hundred million people and causing US$202,7 billion in losses. However, the total funding for the health sector in the Unaided Nations&#x02019; Global Humanitarian Overview was only 34% covered in 2024 and 42% in 2023, which indicates a considerable mismatch between the needs of the affected population and the resources available to meet those needs (<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Furthermore, the occurrence and scale of all of the above hazards are only expected to increase (<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Thus, the mismatch between the health needs of the population affected by emergencies and the resources devoted to response will be further exacerbated.</p><p>Making emergency response more effective and efficient is one of the solutions to the above problem, and it has been the focus of the health emergency community for some time (<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). While considerable improvements have been achieved in many areas of the national and international response, criticism of the current state of affairs continues to persist, with decision-making at its forefront (<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Not surprisingly, making rational, evidence-based decisions during a health emergency can be challenging due to the high uncertainty, scarce evidence and its often-conflicting nature, and lack of decision-makers&#x02019; ability to process the evidence, as well as pressure for them to act quickly (<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Furthermore, the involvement of stakeholders in the decision-making process is also difficult in such a context. Maintaining transparency and accountability of the decision taken is another critical challenge.</p><p>Multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) is a set of techniques used to improve decision making process using structured, explicit approaches to decision involving multiple criteria (<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). This set of techniques helps decision makers to define which criteria are relevant, importance attached to each criterion, systematically consider opinion of stakeholders and to use this information to assess available alternatives. Data that feed into MCDA can range from the informed opinions of stakeholders to objective quantitative data, depending on its availability. It has been successfully used to support decision-making in various fields, such as finance, engineering design and environmental management. It has proven to be a useful tool to increase consistency, transparency and legitimacy of decisions. In recent years, MCDA has been increasingly used in health care for a variety of decision objectives, ranging from health technology assessments to priority settings (<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>).</p><p>The MCDA has been used for health emergencies especially for prioritization of pathogens. For example, the MCDA approach is used at the global level by the World Health Organization for regular updates of the list of bacterial pathogens of public health importance and at regional and national levels by the United States Center for Disease Control and Prevention to conduct One Health Zoonotic Disease Prioritization Workshops (<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). It has seen further uptake to a broader range of decision objectives, beyond prioritization of pathogens, during the COVID-19 response. For example, it has been applied to prioritize patients (<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), select public health interventions (<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>), prioritize locations to deliver interventions (<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>), among others. Such extensive use of MCDA during the COVID-19 response suggests that it may benefit a broader range of health emergency-related decisions. While several literature reviews looked into application of MCDA within health care in general (<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), in One Health (<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), and in COVID-19 (<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>); to the best of our knowledge, no reviews have investigated MCDA application for managing all hazard&#x02019;s health emergencies. By taking a closer look at this experience, we hope to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the use of this approach in health emergencies and suggest future directions for the development of specific MCDA tools for health emergency management.</p><p>Thus, our review aimed to study how the MCDA methodology is used to support decision-making during health emergencies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec6"><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec7"><label>2.1</label><title>Design</title><p>This study employed a scoping review methodology of peer-reviewed articles guided by the Joanna Briggs Institute Manual for Evidence Synthesis (<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) and reported using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) (<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>).

</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>The <italic>interest</italic> of our review was the use of multi-attribute decision-making MCDA techniques, as they are the most commonly applied MCDA techniques for decision support in health care (<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), mainly due to the simplicity of their application. While multi-objective decision-making MCDA techniques are widely used for optimal resource allocation and may play an important role in emergencies, especially humanitarian logistics (<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), we considered them beyond the scope of this study due to their relatively more complex application, which may not be suitable for group deliberation that we thought is an important feature of any emergency specific MCDA tool. Furthermore, we excluded articles that did not provide sufficient information on the methods. To meet the inclusion criteria, the decision problem described in the article had to be addressed in the <italic>context</italic> of any stage of a health emergency, including prevention, preparedness, response and recovery.</p><p>Furthermore, the articles included are relevant to the following <italic>study characteristics</italic>. We limited our search only to peer-reviewed articles. An initial search of gray literature revealed that while recommendations on conducting MCDA are present in gray literature (<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>), the experience of their empirical application is rarely reported. We considered articles published in English in the last 20&#x0202f;years (Jan 2004 &#x02013; May 2024). We excluded systematic and non-systematic reviews, letters to the editors and commentary, and dissertations and theses.

Objective rating and point allocation were the second most used methods for calculating weights, each accounting for 10% (<italic>n</italic>&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;7) of all studies.</p></sec><sec id="sec21"><label>3.5</label><title>MCDA methods used</title><p>Similar to criteria weighting methods, the included studies employed various MCDA methods to compute the final model output.

The second most popular method was Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) (<italic>n</italic>&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;9; 12.7%), predominantly used in studies that set priorities.

Sensitivity analysis was primarily directed at testing output stability with changing weights. Several studies (<italic>n</italic>&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;5; 10.9%) also used objective validation of the model result to address uncertainty.</p></sec><sec id="sec23"><label>3.7</label><title>Involvement of stakeholders</title><p>The majority (<italic>n</italic>&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;61; 85.9%) of the studies involved stakeholders at one or several stages of the MCDA process. The median number of stakeholders involved was 12.5 (range 1&#x02013;108), with the prioritization of pathogens involving the highest number of stakeholders (median: 37; range: 17&#x02013;80) and the prioritization of patients the lowest (median: 3; range: 1&#x02013;108).</p><p>Subject matter experts were the most frequently engaged group of stakeholders in all included studies (<italic>n</italic>&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;52; 73.2%), followed by academics (<italic>n</italic>&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;24; 33.8%) and government representatives (<italic>n</italic>&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;21; 29.6%).

None of the included studies included donors/commissioners of the response to the MCDA process.</p></sec><sec id="sec24"><label>3.8</label><title>Strength and limitations</title><p>The reviewed studies identified several strengths and limitations of using MCDA in health emergency settings, namely, studies conducted by Bilal and &#x00130;&#x000e7; (<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) and Bouwknegt et al. (<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>) mentioned transparency, objectivity and reproducibility of results derived from the MCDA as its strengths. Another study, by Klamer et al. (<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>) reported MCDA&#x02019;s ability to combine qualitative and quantitative data as another strength. Furthermore, Ekenberg et al. (<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). emphasized the possibility of implementing the technique with imprecise evidence, and Guillot et al. (<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>) emphasized its flexibility and adaptability as an additional strength.</p><p>Another common strength mentioned in several articles, namely Hongoh et al. (<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>), Aenishaenslin et al. (<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>), and Thukral et al. (<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>), was the MCDA&#x02019;s ability to meaningfully involve diverse stakeholders in decision processes. This reportedly led to an increase in the quality of the decisions taken and collaboration between stakeholders more broadly.</p><p>On the other hand, the included studies highlighted various limitations of using the MCDA for health emergencies. Bouwknegt et al. (<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>) reported that when objective data is limited and prioritization relies only on professional opinion, MCDA output can be subjective. Studies by Klamer et al. (<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>), Thukral et al. (<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>), and Nguyen et al. (<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>) emphasized that including only a small number of stakeholders or giving an unequal representation of different stakeholder groups involved in the prioritization exercises may also introduce potential biases. A further limitation of the method, highlighted in Hongoh et al. (<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>), is the time-consuming nature of the exercise, especially with elicitation methodologies requiring stakeholders to answer numerous pairwise comparison questions, which may make the engagement of necessary stakeholders challenging.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec25"><label>4</label><title>Discussion</title><p>The results provide insights into the types of emergencies where MCDA was applied, decision objectives it was aimed to support, approaches taken for identification of alternatives and criteria, methodologies for measurement of weights and performance, aggregation techniques, stakeholder engagement in the process, as well as strengths and limitations highlighted by the authors of the included studies.</p><p>The review showed that MCDA methodology can be applied to various decision objectives, ranging from prioritization of locations, health threats, and priority setting to selecting the best intervention to implement in response to an emergency. It can also be applied at different levels, starting from the facility, sub-national, national, and international levels, and used for decision objectives in anticipation of an emergency and after its occurrence.</p><p>The studies in the review highlighted that the MCDA also offers flexibility regarding methodology and data required for its deployment (<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). It can be scaled depending on availability, time, and resource constraints. Furthermore, using the MCDA methodology increases transparency and accountability for decisions made during the response, potentially improving the response&#x02019;s efficiency (<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31&#x02013;33</xref>). This is a common quality of MCDA applications across contexts (<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>).</p><p>Our review demonstrated the initial application of MCDA methodology to support the management of health emergencies that occurred as early as two decades ago (<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). After that, it was seldom used until a substantial increase happened during the COVID-19 response. While it proved to be a valuable tool for infectious disease management, especially for COVID-19, at national and international levels, it is underutilized for other types of health emergencies, such as natural disasters and conflicts, despite the listed advantages.</p><p>Our review demonstrated that standardized methodology across all stages of the MCDA process is lacking, except for MCDAs applied for prioritizing pathogens that follow somewhat standardized steps and methods. These findings are consistent with similar reviews that looked at the application of MCDA for other aligned health issues (<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Relatively low uptake among non-infectious disease emergencies can also be attributed to the lack of standard guidelines, as <italic>ad hoc</italic> methods must be developed for each exercise, increasing the time needed and requiring expertise. Furthermore, the absence of a standard approach limits the comparability and reproducibility of results and can increase biases. Thus, defining common MCDA steps and methods and a set of high-level criteria per emergency type or decision objective, drawing from successful MCDAs for disease prioritization, can reduce subjectivity and assist emergency managers in swiftly deploying the process in anticipation or shortly after an emergency.</p><p>The review also highlighted that stakeholders&#x02019; engagement in MCDA can positively influence the quality of the model output, as well as the broader coordination of stakeholders. Because the MCDA can involve a wide group of stakeholders with diverse views and systematically consider their preferences in the decision-making process. This finding coincides with another review by Zhao et al. (<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) that highlighted a similar benefit of the MCDA process in the OneHealth field.</p><p>However, despite the clear benefits of stakeholder involvement in the MCDA, a standardized approach for selecting and engaging stakeholders is lacking, which may increase subjectivity and bias in the model outputs. Moreover, despite the opportunity to involve the population affected by emergencies in MCDA, which is in line with emergency response and humanitarian best practices, it is rarely done. Similarly, no explicit involvement of representatives of donors/commissioners of the response was observed in the MCDA studies included in our review. Including such a critical group of stakeholders can potentially strengthen trust and cooperation. Instead, the included studies seem to primarily rely on subject matter experts, who may provide a one-sided view of the situation. Therefore, if a specific MCDA tool for health emergency management were to be developed, it is essential to integrate standardized stakeholder engagement strategies.</p><p>Our study had several limitations. Firstly, we only included articles published in peer-reviewed journals in English, overlooking other languages and gray literature. Although we performed an initial scoping of gray literature and did not find any studies meeting predefined inclusion/exclusion criteria, conducting further searches with less stringent criteria and in different languages may reveal more information on the current state of MCDA use for health emergency management.</p><p>Secondly, we excluded studies that did not explicitly focus on health-related decision objectives, such as flood/tsunami/earthquake risk zoning, evacuations, and logistics of humanitarian supplies, such decision objectives also use MCDA techniques and studying them can provide further information for developing MCDA for health emergencies; however, decision objectives other than directly health-related were beyond the scope of this review.</p><p>Thirdly, the included studies used various MCDA techniques for weighting and aggregation, their combination, and some even proposed novel methods. Our review provided a high-level overview of those techniques and their practical application. However, additional analysis by researchers with mathematical expertise is warranted to identify the strengths and limitations of the used methods from a computational perspective.</p><p>In conclusion, the review provides an overview of the current use of the MCDA to support decision-making in health emergency management, which, to our knowledge, is the first review to investigate MCDA use in this context. The review emphasizes that while MCDA is already successfully used for specific decision objectives within some emergencies, such as infectious diseases prioritization, it is underutilized for other types of emergencies and decision objectives.
