The aim of orthognathic surgery is to treat skeletal dysgnathias in order to improve both the function of the stomatognathic system as well as the facial profile and, thus, aesthetics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Even though, today orthognathic surgery is considered a standard procedure in oral and maxillofacial surgery it is still a highly technically sensitive operation which requires a thorough spatial understanding of the complex anatomy in the head and jaw region and years of training in order to prevent intra-operative complications like major bleedings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], damaging of the neuro-vascular bundle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] or a bad split of the mandible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In order to gain the required expertise, resident surgeons typically undergo various stages of learning, starting with observation and progressing to providing surgical assistance, until they eventually conduct specific parts of surgeries independently while being supervised. This traditional &#x0201c;See One, Do One&#x0201d; approach has been a cornerstone of surgical education since its introduction by William Halsted in 1890; however, many argue that one can not safely perform a surgery only by observing it once [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Moreover, the increasing economisation in health services as well as ethical restrictions offer less opportunities for a on-the-job training of young surgeons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">Given this context, modern simulation training, originating from the aviation industry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], has gained significant traction in surgical education. This approach is growing in popularity because it allows trainees the opportunity to make errors without jeopardizing the patients&#x02019; health, leaves out the added stress of performing surgery on a live patient and reduces surgical errors which ultimately helps to increase patient safety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In recent years a variety of possible simulators for the training of surgical procedures in Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery have been decribed ranging from the use of animal cadavers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] over human anatomical specimen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] to high fidelity virtual simulators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Animal cadavers like pig jaws are relatively affordable to purchase and often used in the training of surgical procedures; howewer, when it comes to mimicing the human anatomy, they often lack realism. Human anatomical specimen are very realistic but ethical and financial restrictions strongly limit their use. High fidelity simulators are more frequently used but also cost-intensive which also limits their use especially in non-industrialized countries.</p><p id="Par8">Additive manufacturing also known as 3D-printing (3DP) was first introduced in 1986 by Charles Hull [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and has since undergone an explosive increase in use in many industries including the medical sector. Today, there are a multitude of open-source software solutions and affordable 3D-printers that allow clinicians to easily print a physical model obtained from (cone-beam) CT or MRI data sets. Clinically used applications for such models include preoperative planning and visualization, low cost implant production via moulding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], pre-bending of osteosynthesis material [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] or patient education [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Due to their capacity to replicate any given pathology in a physical model 3D-printed simulator also have extensively been used in surgical education over the last years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Due to the complexity of the procedure there only have been a few working groups that tried to build a surgical simulator for the training of orthognathic surgery. Bertin et al. used a 3D-printed model of a mandible to train residents in the performance of a bilateral sagittal split osteotomy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Likewise, Yoshida et al. used 3D-printed models of a maxilla and a mandible to train undergraduate dental students in the performance of a LeFort I osteotomy and a bilateral sagittal split osteotomy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Even though both studies used 3D-printed models as simulators, apects like the soft-tissues, the limited space of movements in the oral cavity and the positional relation and articulation of the maxilla and mandible were not considered in these studies.</p><p id="Par9">Hence, the aim of the current study was to develop a 3D-printed simulator for the training in orthognathic surgery and evaluate its use regarding surgical realism and cost-effectiveness.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Production of the replaceable facial skull model</title><p id="Par10">A anonymized CBCT data set of a male patient with a skelletal dysgnathia (maxillary prognathism, mandibular retrognathism, frontal open bite) was used for the production of the replaceable facial skull model. To convert the existing DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) data sets into an.stl (Standard Triangle Language) format file the freely available software 3DSlicer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] was used. Further modifications on the resulting.stl files were made in the also freely available software Meshmixer (Autodesk inc., USA). The surface was post-processed, artifacts were removed and the skull and maxilla were separated from the mandible (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Small recesses were added to the condylar process to attach ball-joint magnets later on. Likewise, corresponding recesses were designed in the area of the mandibular fossa. The virtual skull was reduced behind the temporomandibular joints in the coronal layer around the back of the head. Instead, a flat holding surface was constructed, on which two recesses were also configured for later fixation with screws.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Computer-assisted design of the simulators components</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="40902_2025_462_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p id="Par11">A virtual gingival mask was designed using the upper and lower jaw surfaces. To generate a printed, accurately fitting gingival mask, the surface to be covered with was marked in the Meshmixer software and separated from the rest of the data set. This new surface was then extruded outwards by 2.5 mm, thus generating a new surface that is an exact fit to the facial skull and represents a 2.5-mm-thick virtual gingiva (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).</p><p id="Par12">The resulting.stl-files of the skull model and gingival masks were prepared for 3D printing with freely available Chitubox software (Chitubox, Guangdong, China) with the following settings for the skull model: layer thickness 0.1 mm and exposure time 4 s. For the gingival masks, the layer thickness was 0.2 mm and the exposure time was 10 s. The components were then printed using the digital light processing (DLP) technique on a Anycubic Photon Mono X Desktop 3D-printer (Anycubic, Shenzhen, China) using the white Anycubic rapid resin (Anycubic, Shenzhen, China) for the skull model and the Resione F80 elastic resin in gum color (Resione, Guangdong Province, China) for the gingival masks. After each print, the models were post-processed as follows: removal of all support structures, cleaning of the models with 99%isopropanol and curing with UV light in the Anycubic Wash and Cure unit (Anycubic, Shenzhen, China) for 6 min. A threaded pin was glued to the mandibular models in the area of the condylar process in order to screw in the reusable ball joint magnet (MagnaC GmbH, Wendlingen, Germany). The cup of the reuseable ball joint magnet was inserted at the maxillary recesses in the area of the mandibular fossa. The gingiva was finally attached to the bone models by polymerising liquid resin (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Final 3D-printed simulator with attached gingival mask, table/chair mounting and silicone face mask</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="40902_2025_462_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Production of the reusable bench top phantom head and facial mask</title><p id="Par13">A virtual phantom head dummy model was imported from the Blender software databank [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] into the Meshmixer software (Autodesk Inc., USA).

It was found to be effective when training the LeFort I osteotomy (average rating of 8.26, SD =&#x02009;2.14), the Bilateral Sagittal Split Osteotomy (BSSO) (average rating of 8.16, SD =&#x02009;2.08), the osteosynthesis of bony segments (average rating of 8.19, SD =&#x02009;2.09), and the operational steps of a bimaxillary osteotomy (average rating of 8.58, SD =&#x02009;1.64).</p><p id="Par26">However, participants generally did not find the haptic feedback provided by the gingival mask to be particularly realistic, giving it an average rating of 4.51, with a standard deviation of 2.66.</p><p id="Par27">In the free-text comments, participants notably commended the 3D-printed simulator for its accurate representation of human anatomy (mentioned by 10 participants) and its ability to facilitate structured simulations of bimaxillary osteotomies (mentioned by 5 participants). Suggestions for improvement mainly centered around the hardness of the gingival mask, with many participants expressing that the material was too rigid (mentioned by 8 participants).</p><p id="Par28">The total cost of producing a 3D-printed simulator mounted up to 181.55 Euro (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).

The motivation for development arose from the observation that the surgical training, both quantitatively and qualitatively, varies significantly on a nationwide scale. The reasons for this variation are manifold and range from staffing shortages and limited surgical capacities to objective agreements and unstructured internal continuing education curricula. Advancements in the field of 3DP technology are continually opening up more innovative opportunities in the development of surgical simulators[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p id="Par30">Unlike previous models by Bertin et al. and Yoshida et al., our simulator incorporates multiple innovations: (1) realistic articulation of the maxilla and mandible via magnetic ball joints, (2) intraoral space restriction through a realistic silicone face mask and (3) a soft-tissue layer to simulate mucosa. Although no direct comparison was made, these additions represent a significant technical advancement. Quantitative comparisons with existing simulators are planned for future studies.</p><p id="Par31">The 3D-printed simulator presented in this study im summary was regarded as a realistic and proved valuable for training in specific surgical techniques such as LeFort I osteotomy, BSSO, osteosynthesis, and bimaxillary osteotomy. However, the gingival mask&#x02019;s haptic feedback left room for improvement. The low rating for soft tissue haptic feedback (4.51/10) highlights the need for material innovation. One proposed solution is the use of multi-material printing or integration of advanced silicone blends that better replicate the viscoelastic properties of human soft tissue. Ongoing work is focused on developing such materials to enhance realism.</p><p id="Par32">While VR simulators offer immersive visual training, they often lack tactile feedback and require costly equipment, limiting accessibility. Our approach emphasizes physical simulation with reusable, low-cost components. This makes it particularly suitable for broader dissemination, especially in resource-limited settings.</p><p id="Par33">Cadaveric training continues to be an invaluable asset for surgical education, offering unparalleled opportunities for anatomical exploration and tactile exposure to diverse tissues. However, the declining availability of body donors poses a significant limitation. In contrast, animal models serve as a viable alternative, albeit subject to ethical considerations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Nonetheless, the utility of animal models in acquiring surgical skills is deemed both meaningful and necessary by participants from various disciplines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. With the enhanced availability of 3DP technology and the development of innovative printing materials, the rapid and relatively cost-effective fabrication of individualized training models has been integrated into the practical, model-based hands-on training for both medical students and residents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The primary challenge in this context has consistently been the accurate reproduction of anatomical structures with corresponding tactile fidelity. The viscoelastic characteristics of tissues, including hysteresis, creep, and stress relaxation, are attributable to the presence of biopolymers as well as intracellular and extracellular fluids. Consequently, the replication of specific anatomical structures may necessitate the utilization of multiple materials within each tissue type [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. This challenge is underscored in the current study by the relatively low scores attributed to the haptic properties of the mucosal tissue.</p><p id="Par34">A general limitation common to all surgical models&#x02014;whether cadaveric, animal-based, or 3D-printed&#x02014;is the frequent absence of quantifiable outcomes. Hence, commonly, the focus of evaluations lies on comparing two types of training models or entities, rather than assessing the model-dependent improvement in surgical skills when applied in a real-world operating room. This can be viewed as a limitation of this study. A prospective study design with pre- and post-training skill assessments would be necessary to objectively quantify skill acquisition. Future studies will aim to incorporate such objective metrics, including performance-based assessment tools.</p><p id="Par35">Emerging approaches are exploring the utilization of virtual reality, mixed reality, and augmented reality devices through various apparatuses such as head-up displays or glasses. Although new systems incorporating haptic modules do exist, the sense of authenticity is often compromised due to the primary focus on visual experience; haptic feedback and physical interaction experiences remain suboptimal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. A general limitation common to all surgical models&#x02014;whether cadaveric, animal-based, or 3D-printed&#x02014;is the frequent absence of quantifiable outcomes hence, commonly, the focus of evaluations lies on comparing two types of training models or entities, rather than assessing the model-dependent improvement in surgical skills when applied in a real world operating room, which can be viewed as a limitation of this study.</p><p id="Par36">The 3D-printed model in this study is the first surgical simulator for the training of orthognathic surgery that takes the soft tissue situation into account.</p><p id="Par37">Another aspect currently lacking in the simulator is the integration of neurovascular structures, especially the inferior alveolar nerve. Since nerve preservation is critical in orthognathic surgery, future iterations of the simulator may benefit from embedding a nerve pathway using colored silicone or conductive materials to provide a tactile cue for its identification and protection.</p><p id="Par38">In addition, the limited space of movement in the oral cavity was realistically depicted with a face mask and the position and freedom of movement of the lower jaw compared to the upper jaw was also considered during the simulator planning and production. Even though the soft tissue haptic feedback was rated poorly, this is already a significant improvement compared to the previously published studies, which do not include parameters such as soft tissue and the intraoperative restriction of the surgeon&#x02019;s freedom of movement in the simulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. It can therefore be assumed that if the innovative simulator used here was directly compared with one of the previously developed ones, the assessment of the soft tissue haptics and the overall rating would have been significantly better. However, this shows a limitation of the study, which did not evaluate the new surgical simulator for the training of orthognathic surgery against another one. On the other hand, the simulators used previously, which basically only show the bony situation of individual jaws, are not comparable to the one used in this study. The simulator in this study was assessed by two very experienced maxillofacial surgeons and the course participants also had a relatively high level of experience with an average of six bimaxillary osteotomies performed, too, which means that the evaluation results of this study are also based on a certain comparison of the simulator with the real patient situation. In contrast, the study by Yoshida et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] was conducted with dental students and in the study by Bertin et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] oral and maxillofacial surgery residents were trained, but the number of dysgnathic surgery procedures performed by the residents was not recorded. In addition to the improved reproduction of anatomical structures, the cost-effectiveness of the simulators can also be assessed as very high, as they do not cost more than the previous models (US$155) despite the soft tissue and jaw joint components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. While the total cost of &#x020ac; 181.55 was carefully itemized, durability testing over multiple uses is ongoing. Preliminary use in two workshops indicates that key components, including the phantom head and joint system, remain intact after repeated use. A direct cost comparison with the Bertin model (&#x020ac;155) supports our claim of high cost-efficiency despite enhanced features.</p><p id="Par39">To make the simulator even more realistic, besides the improvements in simulating soft tissue, the integration of a soft tissue inferior alveolar nerve simulation would be conceivable, since the intraoperative handling and protection of this structure can have a decisive influence on the patient&#x02019;s postoperative quality of life.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par40">Although the acquisition of actual surgical skills is ultimately achieved through human-based practice, the use of surgical simulators presents a sustainable, innovative and financially viable approach to standardize and continually enhance the surgical education of aspiring surgeons. The present study introduces, for the first time, a realistic surgical simulator for training in orthognathic surgery. Noteworthy aspects include the cost-effective production and the reusability of many simulator components.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>3DP</term><def><p id="Par4">Threedimensional printing</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BSSO</term><def><p id="Par5">Bilateral sagittal split osteotomy</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher's Note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements
