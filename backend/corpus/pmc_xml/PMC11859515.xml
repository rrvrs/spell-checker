Some of these are based on scientific underpinnings, and others appear to have less evidence to support them. The present report focuses on the evidence regarding SMF's effects on blood flow. Fortuitously, the author has direct experimental experience in this area.&#x000a0;The approach for this review was to search three major databases (Web of Science, PubMed, and Embase) for peer-reviewed articles written in English in which an SMF was used in humans or other animals and measurements of parameters related to blood flow or velocity before SMF application and either during or after application were reported. After screening the initial 1,954 articles, 108 studies were retrieved and evaluated for relevancy. Of these, 23 were found to satisfy the inclusion criteria and be relevant. This included 10 studies on humans and 13 studies on other animals.&#x000a0;The methods employed in many of these studies are illustrated in this review to enhance understanding of the findings. With regard to human studies, none showed an increase in blood flow, and one showed a decrease in flow. With regard to the animal studies, one showed a transient post-exposure increase that was later explained as due to an actual reduction during SMF exposure.&#x000a0;Four studies showed a decrease, four showed no change or difference from sham-exposed animals, and four reported an increase. Of these four, two were from the same author using a method that may not have reflected a blood flow change. Based on these findings, it is concluded that claims of an SMF providing an increase in blood flow or circulation are not supported by human studies and not well supported by animal studies.&#x000a0;However, this does not close the door to a possible effect for at least four considerations or limitations that may have impacted the absence of a positive finding in human studies: (1) the number of subjects included is relatively small, which affects the study power; (2) the duration of the SMF application of most studies was relatively short; (3) most studies were done on healthy individuals; and (4) the SMF was delivered perpendicular to the body surface, so the effects of tangential field directions are unknown.&#x000a0;Although these provisos may impact the detection of a possible SMF effect, they do not alter the current findings, as no reviewed human study has demonstrated a statistically significant increase in blood circulation attributable to an SMF.&#x000a0;Thus, the clinical use of an SMF to improve blood circulation is not supported by experimental evidence.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>blood circulation</kwd><kwd>blood flow</kwd><kwd>blood velocity</kwd><kwd>magnetic field</kwd><kwd>magnetic therapy</kwd><kwd>magnets</kwd><kwd>permanent magnet</kwd><kwd>review article</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction and background</title><p>A static magnetic field (SMF) is produced by a steady, non-time-varying electrical current or a permanent magnet. Both forms have been used to investigate the possible impacts of SMFs on various biological processes and clinical conditions. The breadth of targets studied has been extensive. The potential role of SMF in treating pain of various origins has received much attention but with varying results&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Other studies have focused on an SMF's potential utility in diabetes&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>-<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], wound healing&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>-<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], and a host of other conditions&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>-<xref rid="REF15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. There are also reports concerning using SMF to affect brain functions via transcranial applications&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>-<xref rid="REF18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].&#x000a0;Some scientific reports have ruled out SMF efficacy concerning some aspects of pain&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="REF20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], and others have severely criticized SMF as therapy&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="REF22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. This type of criticism is in part directed toward claims that are non-scientifically supported and particularly observable in some commercial advertisements and some non-peer-reviewed softcover books that offer lists of conditions that could be helped by SMF therapy&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>-<xref rid="REF30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Although some of the text in these volumes provides pertinent references, much is speculative. One claim, which is the main focus of the present study, is that an SMF can promote increased blood circulation or blood flow.&#x000a0;Examples claiming such benefits can be found in the text of books&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="REF25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="REF29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="REF30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]&#x000a0;and on multiple websites. For such a claim to be accepted, sufficient direct evidence of a blood flow, blood velocity, or blood perfusion increase in humans or experimental animals exposed to an SMF would be needed.&#x000a0;Some scientific studies have assessed the impact of SMFs on vascular tone and vasomotion in experimental animals&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>-<xref rid="REF35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. However, any link between such vascular changes and increased blood flow would be speculative. The significance of increased blood flow in many aspects of therapy makes it an important topic of study.&#x000a0;Thus, the present study focuses only on those studies in which actual blood flow, velocity, or perfusion parameters have been measured before and either during or after the application of an SMF. The main aim is to present and discuss the available evidence of a linkage between the application of an SMF and a blood flow increase.</p></sec><sec sec-type="review"><title>Review</title><p>Methods</p><p>Databases Searched</p><p>Three databases (Web of Science, PubMed, and Embase) were searched for peer-reviewed published articles in English through 12/2/2024.</p><p>Search Method</p><p>For the Web of Science search, the initial Boolean search string was as follows: (static magnet* OR permanent magnet* OR steady magnet* OR constant magnet*) AND (blood flow OR blood perfusion OR blood velocity OR laser Doppler). This yielded 3,051 citations. A follow-up modified search string incorporated terms to exclude irrelevant citations if they were related to pumping, imaging, or MRI use. The final search term was&#x000a0;(static magnet* OR permanent magnet* OR steady magnet* OR constant magnet*) AND (blood flow OR blood perfusion OR blood velocity OR laser Doppler) NOT (pump OR imag* OR MRI). This reduced the total number of citations found on the Web of Science to 987. These were then filtered to accept only full articles for a final count of 904.&#x000a0;A corresponding search string was used in the PubMed database to yield 455 articles and in Embase 595 articles for a total of 1,954 records, as shown in Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="FIG1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.</p><fig position="anchor" fig-type="figure" id="FIG1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Search sequence</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="cureus-0017-00000078007-i01" position="float"/></fig><p>These 1,954 records were examined for duplicates, and 890 were found and removed, leaving 1,064 records. These were reviewed by title and, if needed and available, by abstract to assess relevancy. Of the 1,064 records screened, 956 were excluded as irrelevant, leaving 108 as potentially relevant. Full versions of these 108 studies were obtained and reviewed. After reviewing the full documents, 85 were eliminated because they were theoretical, just mathematical, were not done in vivo (human or animal), contained no new experimental data, or did not provide data documenting before SMF treatment values and either during or after SMF treatment. Also, 42 were eliminated as irrelevant upon full reading of the report. This left 23 studies to be included in this review.</p><p>Studies on humans</p><p>Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="TAB1" ref-type="table">1</xref>&#x000a0;summarizes the major elements of the 10 studies in which SMF was applied to humans, and some aspects related to blood flow were measured. These studies will be considered in further detail in the discussion section. However, it is notable that the range of measurement methods was variable. Six of the 10 studies estimated skin blood flow (SBF) using the method of laser Doppler flowmetry. This method does not measure blood flow but measures a quantity proportional to blood flow. This quantity is often termed perfusion and is the product of the red blood cell (RBC) volume concentration multiplied by the RBC velocity and by a constant&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>-<xref rid="REF40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. One study uses temperature changes, which indirectly reflect blood flow. The other three studies use methods also recognized as measuring blood flow changes. None of these studies reported an increase, and one indicated a decrease in blood flow.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="TAB1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Summary of human study results</title><p>Column 1 shows the first author, year of publication, and reference number.

These studies will be considered in further detail in the discussion section. Regarding the blood flow parameter measurements in these animal studies, six utilized a form of video recording of microscopic images followed by offline tracking of RBC movement that provides a measure of RBC velocity (V<sub>RBC</sub>). If the blood vessel in which these measurements are made does not change, then V<sub>RBC</sub>&#x000a0;changes are proportional to blood flow changes&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="REF40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Three of the studies use a method described as microphotoelectric plethysmography (MPPG). This method records the change in opacity of the recorded microscopic field, and it is assumed that an increase in opacity reflects an increase in RBC volume within the microvascular network. As noted in the table, eight studies reported no change or a decrease in response to SMF exposure, while six reported an increase.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="TAB2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><title>Summary of animal study results</title><p>Column 1 shows the first author, year of publication, and reference number.

In this study, several measurement types were made; blood flow was measured in the brachial artery using ultrasound in 15 subjects while lying on a mattress with the embedded magnets and a mattress without the magnets. They report no significant differences in forearm blood velocity after one hour of supine lying on either mattress (p &#x0003e; 0.05). A potential criticism of this study is that it is unclear how far the magnets were positioned within the mattress from the body surface. This is especially relevant since the investigators report that the field intensity was indistinguishable from the Earth's field at a distance of 9 cm from the magnet surface.&#x000a0;A more anatomically focused study was conducted by Yan and co-workers, who investigated the impact of an SMF produced by a neodymium-iron-boron magnet on finger dorsum SBF assessed via laser Doppler&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>].

There is also a potential issue concerning the magnitude of the magnetic dose. In some studies, the dose at the target was not specified, and it is unknown if a threshold dose is needed for a blood flow effect. Although these provisos may impact the detection of a possible SMF effect, they do not alter the current findings, and no reviewed study has demonstrated a statistically significant increase in blood circulation attributable to an SMF.</p><p>Animal studies</p><p>In 1998, Ichioka and colleagues reported on a study in which the whole body of 20 rats was exposed to a strong SMF of 8,000 mT for 20 minutes&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. To observe the potential effects of the microcirculation, they used a surgical procedure to create a skinfold transparent chamber.

Post-exposure measurements were then done. This procedure was completed in 10 rats and in 10 other rats that were handled similarly, except that the magnetic field was not turned on and constituted a sham treatment. Blood velocity increased one to five minutes after exposure in the actively exposed group (p &#x0003c; 0.05). This increase was not observed in the sham-exposed group (p &#x0003e; 0.05).&#x000a0;Based on measurements of rectal and skin temperature decreases during exposure, the investigators speculated that the post-exposure transient blood velocity increase was a hyperemic response triggered by a flow reduction during exposure and not directly to the SMF.&#x000a0;A study was conducted to follow up on this, using the same exposure method, but measurements were allowed during the SMF exposure using laser Doppler methods&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Data from 35 rats exposed to the 8,000 mT SMF for 20 minutes clearly showed a significant decrease in flow during the SMF exposure compared to 15 other rats exposed to sham treatment (p &#x0003e; 0.05). Based on simultaneous skin temperature measurements, the investigators concluded that the decrease in flow may have been caused by a skin temperature decrease associated with the SMF interaction with microclimate within the magnet&#x02019;s bore.</p><p>Measurements from a much larger creature, a horse, showed no significant effect (p &#x0003e; 0.05) of a magnetic commercial blanket on blood flow in the metacarpus of six healthy horses&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Magnets within the blanket had a surface field of 27 mT, but at 7 mm from the magnet, the field was no more than the Earth&#x02019;s field (0.05 mT). Each of the six horses had their legs wrapped with the blanket containing magnets and, at another time, wrapped with a blanket with the magnets removed. Blood flow at each time was measured using radiolabeled RBCs with 75 microcuries of technetium and capturing images of the metacarpal with a gamma counter.

The results indicated that the peak blood velocity was increased by exposure to the SMF compared to that measured in the sham treatment (p &#x0003c; 0.05). The largest increase reported was with the 10.0 mT exposure, which resulted in a 45% increase as measured at the end of the 10-minute exposure and then rapidly declined. A potential limitation of this study was that RBC tracking was done frame-by-frame on video playback, limiting the number of capillaries that could be included in the sample. Furthermore, the number of capillaries measured was not indicated.

Based on data from eight animals, the results indicated a decrease in the opacity signal with time if no magnet was used (p &#x0003c; 0.05) but an increase in opacity (p &#x0003c; 0.05) when the SMF was applied. This resulted in a statistically significant difference (p &#x0003c; 0.05). Although the authors state that this represented an increase in blood flow, it should be noted that the parameter they measured was not blood flow directly.</p><p>A novel use of laser Doppler measurements of SBF to test the effects of an SMF targeted the trochanter region of mice that had experienced loading on their trochanter for five days at a pressure of about 100 mmHg&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Although much of this study was concerned with spectral analysis of flow motion, the investigators reported that the average SBF measured during 40 minutes of exposure to an SMF of 30 mT at the target resulted in an increase in SBF only in those animals that had been subjected to the effects of tissue loading (p &#x0003c; 0.05). In the animals that had experienced the five-day loading, the increase in SBF was 19% compared to pre-exposure (p0.05) but was not sustained beyond the exposure interval. No effect on SBF was observed when the SMF was applied to animals that had not previously experienced the effects of tissue loading (p &#x0003e; 0.05). These findings suggest that some changes attributable to the loading altered the responsiveness of the underlying vasculature to the SMF.</p><p>In contrast to an increase in SBF, an SMF of 587 mT applied to a hamster dorsal skin fold preparation resulted in a reduction of 41% (p &#x0003e; 0.05)&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. The preparation method used was similar to that shown in Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="FIG9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>, except instead of a rat, a hamster was used.

The reported data is based on a reasonable sample that included eight regions of interest within the recorded microvascular image and three vessels within each region.&#x000a0;An important aspect of this study was that the animals were not anesthetized, so the SBF decrement was observed in the awake state, and potential impacts of anesthesia were absent. Another notable finding of this study was that the SMF's impact was rapid and reversible. A decrease in RBC velocity (p &#x0003c; 0.05) was also reported when implanted tumors were exposed to an SMF of 587 mT&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>].

RBC velocity was reported to be reduced by 40% (p &#x0003c; 0.05) soon after application of the SMF and was also reversible.&#x000a0;A similar finding using a similar method was subsequently reported for implanted tumors&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>].</p><p>In 2013, an additional series of experiments using the REC method were done&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>], as illustrated in Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="FIG11" ref-type="fig">11</xref>. Animals were exposed for 40 minutes to a magnet array that caused an SMF of 250 mT at the target. In another group, shams were used for the same amount of time.&#x000a0;Using changes in the MPPG as an indicator, they report a 17.8% increase during the SMF exposure and a decrease during sham exposure (p &#x0003c; 0.05). There are two potential issues associated with this report. The first is that the parameter MPPG is not a proven indicator of blood flow. The second relates to the statistics used by the investigator. A paired t-test was used based on the number of experimental runs, indicated as 20, rather than the number of animals used.</p><p>A longer-term application of an SMF was attempted when magnetized and unmagnetized rods of samarium-cobalt were implanted in the caudal vertebrae of rats for up to six weeks, and caudal artery blood flow parameters were measured with near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. The maximum surface field strength of the magnetized rod was 160 mT. The investigators reported no significant differences between magnetically and sham-implanted caudal artery blood flow parameters measured three, five, and seven weeks post the initial implants (p &#x0003e; 0.05). It should be noted that blood flow was not measured in this study. Instead, the NIRS method provides parameters related to oxygen utilization within the caudal muscle. Thus, the absence of a change in these oxygen-related parameters suggests but cannot directly demonstrate that there was no change in actual blood flow.</p><p>In 2015, another group aimed to investigate the impact of a magnetic blanket on muscular blood flow in horses&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Data were obtained on six horses exposed to a magnet-embedded blanket at one session and a blanket without magnets applied at another session. The application lasted 60 minutes. An index of blood flow was obtained using a photoplethysmographic (PPG) sensor operating together with near-infrared wavelength light-emitting diodes. This measurement assumes that the peak-to-peak change in the PPG signal measures pulsatile blood volume and flow. The investigators report no statistical difference (p &#x0003e; 0.05) in either group during the treatment interval.</p><p>The impact of long-term SMF exposure was evaluated in mice housed in a cage exposed to peak intensities of approximately 58, 107, and 116 mT for 60 days&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>].&#x000a0;In this study, 10 mice per group were housed together at each SMF intensity, and subsequently, each was evaluated for blood velocity using video imaging and RBC tracking.&#x000a0;Results showed no difference in auricular muscular cutaneous blood flow compared to those similarly housed without an SMF (p &#x0003e; 0.05).</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Concerning human studies, none showed an increase in blood flow (p &#x0003e; 0.05), and one showed a decrease in flow (p &#x0003c; 0.05). One of the animal studies showed a transient post-exposure increase (p &#x0003c; 0.05) that was later explained due to an actual reduction during SMF exposure.&#x000a0;Four studies showed a decrease (p &#x0003c; 0.05), four showed no change or difference from sham-exposed animals (p &#x0003e; 0.05), and four reported an increase (p &#x0003c; 0.05). It is concluded that claims of an SMF providing an increase in blood flow are not supported by human studies and not well supported by animal studies.&#x000a0;However, this does not close the door to a possible effect for at least four considerations that may have impacted the absence of a positive finding in human and animal studies: (1) the number of subjects or animals included is relatively small, which affects the study power; (2) the duration of the SMF application of most studies was relatively short; (3) most studies were done on healthy individuals or animals; and (4) the SMF was delivered perpendicular to the body surface, so the effects of tangential field directions are unknown. There is also a potential issue concerning the magnitude of the magnetic dose since it is unclear if a threshold dose is needed for a blood flow effect. Although these provisos may impact the detection of a possible SMF effect, they do not alter the current findings, as no reviewed human study and few animal studies have demonstrated a statistically significant increase in blood circulation attributable to an SMF.&#x000a0;Thus, the experimental evidence does not support the clinical use of an SMF to improve blood circulation.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group content-type="conflict"><title>Disclosures</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Conflicts of interest:</bold> In compliance with the ICMJE uniform disclosure form, all authors declare the following:</p><p><bold>Payment/services info:</bold> All authors have declared that no financial support was received from any organization for the submitted work.</p><p><bold>Financial relationships:</bold> All authors have declared that they have no financial relationships at present or within the previous three years with any organizations that might have an interest in the submitted work.</p><p><bold>Other relationships:</bold> All authors have declared that there are no other relationships or activities that could appear to have influenced the submitted work.</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="other"><title>Author Contributions</title><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Concept and design:</bold>&#x000a0; Harvey N.
