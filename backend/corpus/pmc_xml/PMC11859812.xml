Our group has shown that histone deacetylases (HDACs) inhibitors increase the sensibility of <italic toggle="yes">Cryptococcus neoformans</italic> to certain antifungal treatments. Therefore, the aim of this work was to investigate whether curcumin pretreatment increases the effect of photodynamic therapy (PDT) mediated by aluminum phthalocyanine in nanoemulsion (AlPc-NE) against <italic toggle="yes">C. neoformans</italic>. <bold>Methods:</bold> The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of AlPc-NE and curcumin, along with the 72-h growth curve of cells exposed to the combined treatments, were evaluated in the <italic toggle="yes">C. neoformans</italic> reference strain H99. Additionally, further analysis was performed using HDAC gene deletion mutant strains, <italic toggle="yes">hda1</italic>&#x00394; and <italic toggle="yes">hos2</italic>&#x00394;. <bold>Results:</bold> Curcumin reduces the effect of PDT on <italic toggle="yes">C. neoformans</italic> reference strain H99, likely due to its antioxidant properties. In the <italic toggle="yes">hda1&#x00394;</italic> strain, 50% MIC of curcumin reduced the effect of PDT, but this effect was not observed in response to 75% MIC of curcumin. Conversely, in the <italic toggle="yes">hos2</italic>&#x00394; strain, pretreatment with curcumin at 75% MIC enhanced the efficacy of PDT in combination with 50% MIC of AlPc-NE. <bold>Conclusions:</bold> These results indicate that curcumin inhibits <italic toggle="yes">C. neoformans</italic>. Moreover, at lower concentrations, curcumin protects cells against oxidant damage, while at higher concentrations, it may trigger epigenetic mechanisms that compromise cell viability. In conclusion, both curcumin and PDT are active against <italic toggle="yes">C. neoformans</italic>, with HDACs affecting their efficacy, and the effectiveness of the combined treatment depends on the concentration of both curcumin and AlPc-NE.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>cryptococcosis</kwd><kwd>epigenetics</kwd><kwd>histone deacetylase inhibitors</kwd><kwd>nanotechnology</kwd><kwd>pathogenic fungi</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>FAP-DF/Brazil</funding-source><award-id>00193.00001053/2021-24</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>CNPq</funding-source><award-id>403536/2021-9</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>CAPES</funding-source><award-id>001</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>This work was funded by the Brazilian agencies FAP-DF/Brazil (00193.00001053/2021-24), CNPq (403536/2021-9) and Coordena&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o de Aperfei&#x000e7;oamento de Pessoal de N&#x000ed;vel Superior&#x02014;Brasil (CAPES)&#x02014;Finance Code 001.</funding-statement></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-pharmaceuticals-18-00240"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>In 2022, the World Health Organization (WHO) published the first list of priority fungal pathogens to guide research, surveillance, and public policy efforts. Leading the list is <italic toggle="yes">Cryptococcus neoformans</italic>, the most common cause of cryptococcosis, a globally prevalent systemic mycosis that primarily affects immunocompromised individuals [<xref rid="B1-pharmaceuticals-18-00240" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. One of the main limitations in the treatment of cryptococcosis is the sole reliance on chemotherapy, which is based on three of the four families of available systemic antifungal drugs: azoles, polyenes, and pyrimidines. Amphotericin B remains the first-line treatment, despite its toxicity, often in combination with flucytosine or fluconazole. However, a 12% incidence of fluconazole-tolerant isolates has already been reported, as reviewed elsewhere [<xref rid="B2-pharmaceuticals-18-00240" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>In the search for new approaches against <italic toggle="yes">C. neoformans</italic>, our group has shown that the efficacy of photodynamic therapy (PDT) is significantly increased by pretreating the cells with either sodium butyrate or tricostatin A, both inhibitors of histone deacetylases (HDACs) [<xref rid="B3-pharmaceuticals-18-00240" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. PDT is based on the generation of reactive species following the photoactivation of a photosensitizer within the target cell and has been used for several biological applications [<xref rid="B4-pharmaceuticals-18-00240" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-pharmaceuticals-18-00240" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-pharmaceuticals-18-00240" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Using HDAC gene deletion mutant strains, <italic toggle="yes">hda1</italic>&#x02206; and <italic toggle="yes">hos2</italic>&#x02206;, our group has further evidenced that HDACs protect <italic toggle="yes">C. neoformans</italic> against PDT and other antifungal treatments [<xref rid="B7-pharmaceuticals-18-00240" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. HDACs catalyze the hydrolysis of acetyl groups from post-translationally modified lysine residues in histone proteins, increasing the net positive charge of these proteins and therefore enhancing their affinity to DNA. This process leads to chromatin condensation, which typically results in gene repression, as the tighter chromatin structure makes it more difficult for the transcriptional machinery to access DNA [<xref rid="B8-pharmaceuticals-18-00240" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Therefore, HDACs play a critical role in chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation, influencing fungal pathogenesis, stress responses, and drug resistance mechanisms [<xref rid="B8-pharmaceuticals-18-00240" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Studies have shown that HDAC inhibitors can modulate fungal virulence traits, including biofilm formation and resistance to oxidative stress, suggesting their potential as antifungal adjuvants [<xref rid="B7-pharmaceuticals-18-00240" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B9-pharmaceuticals-18-00240" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Thus, these epigenetic modulators represent potential therapeutic targets in <italic toggle="yes">C. neoformans</italic>, and the discovery of effective HDAC inhibitors offers promising prospects for the future treatment of cryptococcosis.</p><p>In this context, curcumin has been pointed out as a potent inhibitor and suppressor of HDAC expression in cancer cells, likely as a result of its ability to modulate epigenetic regulation by altering histone acetylation patterns [<xref rid="B10-pharmaceuticals-18-00240" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-pharmaceuticals-18-00240" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-pharmaceuticals-18-00240" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Curcumin has been shown to increase histone acetylation levels by inhibiting HDAC enzymatic activity, leading to chromatin relaxation and transcriptional activation of genes involved in stress responses, apoptosis, and cell cycle regulation [<xref rid="B13-pharmaceuticals-18-00240" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Additionally, curcumin may influence HDAC activity indirectly by modulating signaling pathways such as those involving mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/PKB), which are known to regulate epigenetic modifiers [<xref rid="B14-pharmaceuticals-18-00240" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. These mechanisms suggest that curcumin could similarly affect fungal HDACs, potentially altering the gene expression networks that control virulence, stress adaptation, and antifungal resistance in <italic toggle="yes">C. neoformans</italic>. Although the literature indicates that curcumin is active against <italic toggle="yes">Cryptococcus</italic> spp. [<xref rid="B15-pharmaceuticals-18-00240" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-pharmaceuticals-18-00240" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], there is a scarcity of studies focusing on its effects on the epigenetic machinery of fungi. Moreover, the use of curcumin to potentiate PDT against <italic toggle="yes">C. neoformans</italic> has not yet been investigated. Our hypothesis is that curcumin may affect HDACs activity in <italic toggle="yes">C. neoformans</italic>, and thus may be able to potentiate the effect of PDT against this pathogen. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate whether curcumin enhances the effect of AlPc-NE-mediated PDT against <italic toggle="yes">C. neoformans</italic> and to explore the involvement of HDACs using the <italic toggle="yes">hda1</italic>&#x02206; and <italic toggle="yes">hos2</italic>&#x02206; mutant strains.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec2-pharmaceuticals-18-00240"><title>2. Results and Discussion</title><sec id="sec2dot1-pharmaceuticals-18-00240"><title>2.1.

However, no statistically significant difference for this variable was found between the strains.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-pharmaceuticals-18-00240"><title>2.2. MIC of AlPc-NE in PDT Against C. neoformans Strains</title><p>The effect of PDT mediated by AlPc-NE was evaluated against <italic toggle="yes">C. neoformans</italic> strains. HDAC mutants were more susceptible (MIC of 3 nM) to PDT than the reference strain (MIC of 6 nM), as shown in <xref rid="pharmaceuticals-18-00240-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. A previous study by our group has demonstrated these <italic toggle="yes">C. neoformans</italic> strains to be susceptible to PDT, with AlPc-NE MIC values ranging from 6.25 to 12.5 nM [<xref rid="B7-pharmaceuticals-18-00240" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The fact that MIC values for <italic toggle="yes">C. neoformans</italic> are consistently in the nanomolar range shows that this pathogen is particularly sensitive to AlPc-NE-mediated PDT. This, together with the fact that PDT&#x02019;s effects can be limited to the irradiated site, with minimal side-effects in non-irradiated, non-target tissues [<xref rid="B17-pharmaceuticals-18-00240" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], points to the possibility that this PDT protocol could be used to treat certain manifestations of cryptococcosis, such as those in the lungs, skin, and eyes.</p><p>The HDAC mutant strains were more susceptible to PDT treatment than the reference strain, indicating that HDACs are involved in cellular defenses against oxidative damage caused by this therapy, as previously suggested [<xref rid="B3-pharmaceuticals-18-00240" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B7-pharmaceuticals-18-00240" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B18-pharmaceuticals-18-00240" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Therefore, the use of HDAC inhibitors as pretreatments is a possible approach to increasing the susceptibility of <italic toggle="yes">C. neoformans</italic> to PDT [<xref rid="B3-pharmaceuticals-18-00240" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Regarding the higher susceptibility of HDAC gene deletion strains, our results corroborate the findings described by Ranjan and collaborators [<xref rid="B7-pharmaceuticals-18-00240" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B18-pharmaceuticals-18-00240" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In 2021, Ranjan et al. [<xref rid="B7-pharmaceuticals-18-00240" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] investigated the role of <italic toggle="yes">C. neoformans</italic> HDAC genes in its response to antifungal drugs, sodium butyrate or trichostatin A&#x02014;classical epigenetic modulators&#x02014;and PDT. They found that inhibition of HDAC genes increases the susceptibility of the pathogen to PDT and drug treatments, highlighting their potential as therapeutic targets for enhancing efficacy against <italic toggle="yes">Cryptococcus</italic> spp. In 2024, Ranjan et al. [<xref rid="B18-pharmaceuticals-18-00240" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] reported that the effects of PDT against <italic toggle="yes">Cryptococcus</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Candida</italic> species are enhanced by <italic toggle="yes">Streptomyces</italic> spp. extracts, suggesting a potential synergistic approach for treating fungal infections in vitro. This effect was more pronounced in <italic toggle="yes">hda1</italic>&#x00394; and <italic toggle="yes">hos2</italic>&#x00394;, the HDAC gene deletion mutant strains of <italic toggle="yes">C. neoformans</italic>. In the present work, our goal was to verify whether pretreatment with curcumin, a potential HDAC inhibitor in <italic toggle="yes">C. neoformans</italic>, could increase the susceptibility of <italic toggle="yes">C. neoformans</italic> to PDT. To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate this approach.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3-pharmaceuticals-18-00240"><title>2.3. Combined Effect of Curcumin and PDT</title><p>The prior exposure of yeast to MIC<sub>50</sub> and MIC<sub>75</sub> of curcumin, followed by the application of PDT mediated by MIC<sub>50</sub> and MIC<sub>75</sub> of AlPc-NE, led to a significant decrease in cell proliferation (<xref rid="pharmaceuticals-18-00240-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Inhibition of cell growth was observed in all tested combinations, but not in the individual use of curcumin at values below the MIC.</p><p>The pretreatment with curcumin followed by PDT had a protective effect, since the yeasts started to grow at around 42 h (<xref rid="pharmaceuticals-18-00240-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). This growth is delayed in comparison to that of cells treated with curcumin only, but a stronger effect was observed in response to PDT alone, which abolished cell growth for the tested time. This suggests that curcumin can act as an antioxidant agent at the concentrations tested in the reference H99 strain of <italic toggle="yes">C. neoformans</italic>, possibly by neutralizing oxidant species generated by the photoactivated phthalocyanine. The antioxidant activity of curcuminoids is widely reported in the literature [<xref rid="B19-pharmaceuticals-18-00240" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]; thus, this protective effect was expected, considering the pro-oxidant nature of PDT.</p><p>The possible photosensitizing effect mediated by curcumin in these experiments can be disregarded, as this compound does not absorb light at &#x003bb; 660 nm, the wavelength used in the PDT protocol in this work. Curcumin, as a photosensitizer, requires violet/blue light, with wavelengths normally within the range from 408 to 434 nm, as reviewed elsewhere [<xref rid="B20-pharmaceuticals-18-00240" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The absence of curcumin-based photodynamic activity can be further confirmed by our results, as H99 cells exposed to curcumin then irradiated with red light, i.e., irradiated 50% CURC and 75% CURC, did not show any decrease in their growth in comparison to the control (<xref rid="pharmaceuticals-18-00240-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>The results presented in <xref rid="pharmaceuticals-18-00240-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> and <xref rid="pharmaceuticals-18-00240-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> for the mutant <italic toggle="yes">C. neoformans</italic> strains <italic toggle="yes">hda1</italic>&#x00394; and <italic toggle="yes">hos2</italic>&#x00394;, respectively, corroborate our data on the MIC of curcumin, suggesting that the mechanism of action of this compound involves alterations in HDAC activity. The protective effect of curcumin against PDT, observed in the reference strain H99, was not seen in certain conditions in the mutants.</p><p>At MIC<sub>50</sub>, curcumin slightly protected <italic toggle="yes">hda1</italic>&#x00394; cells against PDT, as observed for the H99 strain, an effect that is probably due to its antioxidant activity. However, at MIC<sub>75</sub> curcumin did not protect <italic toggle="yes">hda1</italic>&#x00394; cells against PDT. This might seem paradoxical, as at higher concentrations, one can expect curcumin to have a more pronounced antioxidant effect and thus exert a proportionally more intense protective effect against the oxidant stress generated by PDT. However, this finding can be explained by other mechanisms by which curcumin affects cell metabolism, which are not related to redox events. Indeed, as previously shown in cancer cells [<xref rid="B11-pharmaceuticals-18-00240" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and in <italic toggle="yes">Cryptococcus</italic> spp. [<xref rid="B15-pharmaceuticals-18-00240" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-pharmaceuticals-18-00240" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], curcumin exerts inhibitory effects at specific concentrations.</p><p>Different results were observed in <italic toggle="yes">hos2</italic>&#x00394;. Curcumin at MIC<sub>50</sub> did not alter the viability of cells subjected to PDT mediated by either the MIC<sub>50</sub> or the MIC<sub>75</sub> of AlPc-NE. The same was observed for curcumin at MIC<sub>75</sub>, which did not protect cells against PDT mediated by AlPc-NE at MIC<sub>75</sub>. However, curcumin at MIC<sub>75</sub> increased the effectiveness of PDT mediated by AlPc-NE at MIC<sub>50</sub>.</p><p>Taken together, these results suggest that <italic toggle="yes">hda1</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">hos2</italic> genes are involved in the cellular pathways that modulate the effects of the pretreatment with curcumin, including its antioxidant and potentially non-redox-related mechanisms, in the tested PDT protocols. The absence of the <italic toggle="yes">hda1</italic> gene increased the protective effect of curcumin in <italic toggle="yes">C. neoformans</italic>, suggesting that the enzyme histone deacetylase 1 increases the sensitivity of <italic toggle="yes">C. neoformans</italic> to the inhibitory effects of curcumin. This conclusion is corroborated by the higher MIC exhibited by <italic toggle="yes">hda1</italic>&#x00394; strain (<xref rid="pharmaceuticals-18-00240-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The enzyme histone deacetylase 2, coded by the <italic toggle="yes">hos2</italic> gene, seems to play a less significant role in the response of <italic toggle="yes">C. neoformans</italic> to low concentrations of curcumin. The deletion of the <italic toggle="yes">hos2</italic> gene even increased the susceptibility of <italic toggle="yes">C. neoformans</italic> to curcumin at MIC<sub>75</sub>, as observed by the increased inhibition when combined with PDT mediated by AlPc-NE at MIC<sub>50</sub>.

Conclusions</title><p>This study examined the effects of curcumin and PDT, used individually or in combination, on the growth of <italic toggle="yes">C. neoformans</italic> strains, including both wild-type and HDAC gene deletion mutants. Both curcumin and PDT inhibit <italic toggle="yes">C. neoformans</italic> and have significant potential as therapeutic agents for controlling cryptococcosis. Each treatment used individually was effective in inhibiting <italic toggle="yes">C. neoformans</italic> growth, and this work provides evidence that the HDAC genes <italic toggle="yes">hos2</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">hda1</italic> are involved in the response of this pathogen to these approaches. The efficacy of the combined treatment, however, depends on the concentration of both the photosensitizer AlPc-NE and curcumin.</p><p>These findings support the continued investigation and development of this approach as a potential option for treating fungal infections caused by <italic toggle="yes">C. neoformans</italic>, with the potential to improve the efficacy of existing treatments and address the growing antifungal resistance.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclaimer/Publisher&#x02019;s Note:</bold> The statements, opinions and data contained in all publications are solely those of the individual author(s) and contributor(s) and not of MDPI and/or the editor(s).
