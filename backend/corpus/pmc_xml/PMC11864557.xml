The study employed three neuroscientific and behavioral experiments to address these questions. Study 1, with 78 college-level EFL learners, examined the effect of teachers&#x02019; positive feedback on learners&#x02019; positive psychology and found a significant positive impact. Study 2, conducted with 102 EFL learners, tested the neural efficiency hypothesis and revealed that higher positive psychology improved neural efficiency, with positive feedback moderating this effect. Study 3, involving 54 EFL learners, explored the relationship between neural efficiency and learning outcomes, confirming that enhanced neural efficiency leads to better learning performance. Beyond education, the results underscore the broader relevance of positive psychology and neural efficiency in other domains, such as workplace performance, skill acquisition, and personal development, where maintaining cognitive efficiency and well-being is crucial. These findings highlight the importance of positive feedback in fostering positive psychology, improving neural efficiency, and enhancing learning outcomes. The study offers theoretical contributions and practical recommendations for EFL educators to leverage positive feedback and promote effective learning.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source>

Among these, affective factors are critical in foreign language learning [<xref rid="pone.0314730.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0314730.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Positive psychology (PP), a psychological framework pioneered by [<xref rid="pone.0314730.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], seeks to enhance subjective well-being and improve quality of life by focusing on concepts that promote individual happiness and psychological health [<xref rid="pone.0314730.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Since 2014, research has increasingly explored the relationship between PP and language learning, though the field remains in its formative stages, with further empirical validation needed [<xref rid="pone.0314730.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The integration of PP into language learning and teaching has opened new avenues of inquiry [<xref rid="pone.0314730.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], driving a paradigm shift toward enhancing learners&#x02019; experiences&#x02014;particularly in second language (L2) acquisition [<xref rid="pone.0314730.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0314730.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Scholars argue that incorporating PP offers a transformative lens for language education [<xref rid="pone.0314730.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Over the past decade, studies investigating L2 acquisition through PP have increased significantly, highlighting its potential to revolutionize pedagogical practices, boost learner engagement, and improve learning outcomes [<xref rid="pone.0314730.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0314730.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However, existing studies have primarily focused on the general benefits of PP in fostering motivation and well-being [<xref rid="pone.0314730.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], leaving gaps in our understanding of how these psychological mechanisms operate on a cognitive-neural level to enhance language learning outcomes. Additionally, many studies have emphasized subjective emotional experiences but have not systematically investigated the physiological processes underlying these benefits, such as the role of neural efficiency.</p><p>This study addresses these gaps by adopting a neuroscientific approach to examine the impact of teachers&#x02019; positive feedback on learners&#x02019; PP and its connection to improved cognitive functioning in second language (L2) acquisition. Specifically, we apply the <italic toggle="yes">neural efficiency hypothesis</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0314730.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] to explain how positive psychological states enhance cognitive performance through optimized neural resource allocation. While prior research (e.g., [<xref rid="pone.0314730.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]) has identified connections between emotion, cognition, and neural responses, the current study offers new insights by showing how positive feedback interacts with learners&#x02019; affective states to foster neural efficiency, which, in turn, leads to better language learning outcomes. This present research advances the field by going beyond behavioral observations to integrate neurophysiological measures, providing a deeper understanding of the cognitive processes that underlie the role of PP in language learning. This focus on neural mechanisms marks a significant departure from earlier studies, which have primarily examined PP at the behavioral or emotional level without directly linking it to brain efficiency or learning performance.</p><p>In language learning, feedback is critical in shaping learners&#x02019; progress, motivation, and engagement [<xref rid="pone.0314730.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. While the effects of corrective feedback have been extensively studied, the significance of positive feedback remains underexplored, particularly within the context of EFL education [<xref rid="pone.0314730.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. This research seeks to address this gap by examining the impact of positive feedback on EFL learners&#x02019; PP, mental well-being, self-confidence, and learning outcomes. Furthermore, the study highlights the practical advantages of adopting positive feedback strategies in EFL classrooms by analyzing empirical evidence, theoretical frameworks, and pedagogical implications.</p><p>The overall objective of this study is to examine how teachers&#x02019; positive feedback influences PP in EFL learners and investigate how PP enhances learning outcomes using the neural efficiency hypothesis. Specifically, it aims to answer the following questions:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Does teachers&#x02019; positive feedback improve EFL learners&#x02019; PP?</p></list-item><list-item><p>How does EFL learners&#x02019; PP affect their neural efficiency?</p></list-item><list-item><p>Does improved neural efficiency lead to better learning outcomes?</p></list-item></list><p>The novelty of this research lies in its experimental design, using frontal alpha asymmetry (FAA) of EEG to objectively quantify the impact of positive feedback (compared to no feedback and criticism) on learners&#x02019; PP. The findings provide valuable theoretical insights and practical implications for educators across diverse educational contexts beyond Taiwan. The study underscores the importance of creating supportive and encouraging classroom environments by demonstrating that positive feedback enhances learners&#x02019; PP, neural efficiency, and learning outcomes. Educators in multicultural or multilingual settings can leverage positive feedback strategies to boost learners&#x02019; confidence, motivation, and engagement, which is particularly crucial for students facing challenges such as language anxiety or low self-efficacy. Furthermore, incorporating positive reinforcement into teaching practices can also foster resilience and well-being in learners, which is essential in both formal and non-formal education settings worldwide.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Literature review and hypotheses development</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Positive psychology and EFL learning</title><p>PP emphasizes the positive dimensions of human experience, such as happiness, strengths, and life satisfaction, contrasting with conventional psychology, which often addresses mental health issues [<xref rid="pone.0314730.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Foundational theories within PP, such as <italic toggle="yes">broaden-and-build theory</italic> of [<xref rid="pone.0314730.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and <italic toggle="yes">control-value theory</italic> of [<xref rid="pone.0314730.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], have shaped second language acquisition (SLA) research since 2012 (Li, 2020). Specifically, PP examines psycho-emotional constructs, including happiness, life satisfaction, optimism, gratitude, and resilience [<xref rid="pone.0314730.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0314730.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>In the context of SLA, PP facilitates learners&#x02019; ability to identify personal strengths and overcome challenges [<xref rid="pone.0314730.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Empirical studies suggest that learners&#x02019; engagement with positive psychological factors significantly affects their motivation and academic success. For instance, a study of [<xref rid="pone.0314730.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] found that fostering a positive classroom environment and promoting a growth mindset increase students&#x02019; willingness to communicate in English, particularly when supported by teachers. Similarly, a survey conducted by [<xref rid="pone.0314730.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] of Chinese EFL learners demonstrated that enjoyment of English learning correlates with higher self-confidence and improved self-assessments of proficiency, findings echoed by [<xref rid="pone.0314730.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. [<xref rid="pone.0314730.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] further reported that PP interventions effectively reduced anxiety among EFL learners over time.</p><p>PP enhances linguistic outcomes and cultivates non-linguistic competencies, such as intercultural awareness and general learning abilities [<xref rid="pone.0314730.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. [<xref rid="pone.0314730.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] highlighted the value of balancing positive and negative emotions in language learning, showing that learners who practiced emotion regulation across three experimental trials with 209 EFL students experienced improved motivation, reduced anxiety, and enhanced proficiency. However, despite these advances, the neural mechanisms underlying PP in language learning remain unexplored. This study seeks to investigate these mechanisms and their influence on learning outcomes.</p><p>Various surveys and instruments assess PP in educational contexts [<xref rid="pone.0314730.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. PP interventions are typically designed to foster positive emotions, including happiness and well-being [<xref rid="pone.0314730.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Electroencephalogram (EEG) research has linked positive emotional traits to frontal EEG asymmetry, particularly frontal alpha asymmetry (FAA), which has been implicated in emotional well-being [<xref rid="pone.0314730.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Corroborating this, [<xref rid="pone.0314730.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0314730.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] identified significant correlations between FAA and subjective well-being, building on the findings of [<xref rid="pone.0314730.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. [<xref rid="pone.0314730.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] also employed the FAA to assess improvements in medical students&#x02019; well-being following positive psychological interventions.

Effective teacher feedback is crucial in improving student achievement [<xref rid="pone.0314730.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], with high-information feedback&#x02014;particularly when coupled with self-regulation strategies&#x02014;proving especially beneficial [<xref rid="pone.0314730.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0314730.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].</p><p>Feedback is essential for EFL learners&#x02019; proficiency in language acquisition.

[<xref rid="pone.0314730.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] further observed that positive feedback improves EFL learning outcomes, even when conveyed through emojis.

However, the mechanisms through which teachers&#x02019; positive feedback enhances EFL learners&#x02019; PP remain an open question for further investigation. Thus, this study proposes the following hypothesis to be examined:</p><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p><italic toggle="yes">H1</italic>: <italic toggle="yes">Receiving teachers&#x02019; positive feedback significantly increases EFL learners&#x02019; PP in learning English</italic>.</p></list-item></list></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>The neural efficiency hypothesis in language learning</title><p>The neural efficiency hypothesis posits that individuals with higher intelligence exhibit reduced brain activation during cognitive tasks, reflecting greater efficiency [<xref rid="pone.0314730.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>].

The findings of Study 3 indicated that traits of neural efficiency coordinate neural resources, which has been suggested as a defining characteristic of proficient reading [<xref rid="pone.0314730.ref080" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. Moreover, the results of Study 3 extended the postulation of [<xref rid="pone.0314730.ref081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>], who argued that at the cerebral cortical level, elite performers in EFL learning exhibit high neural efficiency by reducing neural effort within the constraints of the imposed task demand.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec023"><title>General discussions, limitations, and implications</title><sec id="sec024"><title>General discussion</title><p>PP has significantly influenced educational practices since the early 21st century, highlighting the benefits of positive emotions like gratitude, kindness, optimism, zest, and joy on students&#x02019; well-being and academic performance [<xref rid="pone.0314730.ref082" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. Recognizing PP&#x02019;s role in education, it has been applied to EFL learning to enhance students&#x02019; welfare and success in learning English [<xref rid="pone.0314730.ref083" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. However, more research is needed on incorporating PP interventions into language teaching and learning [<xref rid="pone.0314730.ref084" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. This study addresses this gap by conducting three experiments to explore the neural mechanisms in EFL learners&#x02019; PP, focusing on the impact of teachers&#x02019; positive feedback and neural efficiency.</p><p>Studies 1 and 2 found positive teacher feedback significantly improved EFL learners&#x02019; PP. Moreover, PP positively affected neural efficiency, and the interaction between PP and positive feedback significantly enhanced neural efficiency. Positive feedback combined with learners&#x02019; PP promotes a positive attitude, self-confidence, and resilience, leading to better educational outcomes. Learners with strong PP are more prepared to face challenges and stay committed to their studies, achieving academic goals even without the teacher&#x02019;s feedback [<xref rid="pone.0314730.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Moreover, large effect sizes observed in the impact of PP interventions (e.g., positive feedback) indicate meaningful practical improvements. For example, even small improvements in learners&#x02019; emotional well-being can increase motivation and persistence, essential for long-term success in language learning. Learners experiencing enhanced well-being are likelier to engage with challenging tasks and maintain focus during complex activities, such as preparing for high-stakes exams like TOEFL or IELTS. The positive psychological gains observed in this study&#x02014;such as reduced anxiety, increased confidence, and greater emotional resilience&#x02014;contribute to learners&#x02019; ability to communicate effectively in real-world scenarios, such as presentations, interviews, or daily conversations in English.</p><p>From the neuroscientific perspective, evidence from this present research indicates that the alpha band of EEG suppression during task performance, observed in learners with higher emotional well-being, reflects reduced cognitive effort and improved neural efficiency. This suggests that when learners experience positive emotions, they are more likely to engage with language tasks in a relaxed state, allowing cognitive processes to become more automatic and efficient.</p><p>Study 3&#x02019;s findings align with the statement of [<xref rid="pone.0314730.ref085" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>], who show that neural efficiency varies with different interactional contexts. Previous research [<xref rid="pone.0314730.ref086" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>] indicates that higher cognitive abilities are linked to reduced brain activity, suggesting better neural efficiency. Individuals with higher cognitive abilities use fewer brain resources [<xref rid="pone.0314730.ref087" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. Our study demonstrated that PP, combined with positive feedback and neural efficiency, improved EFL learners&#x02019; cognitive abilities and learning outcomes. [<xref rid="pone.0314730.ref080" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>] suggested that superior inhibitory control, facilitated by neural efficiency, leads to more effective use of the language network during reading, explaining the link between neural efficiency and learning outcomes in EFL learners. Accordingly, it is important for EFL teachers to leverage PP-based strategies to enhance learners&#x02019; emotional well-being, which in turn supports neural efficiency. For example, uplifting feedback, peer encouragement, and intrinsic motivation through personalized learning goals can reduce learners&#x02019; cognitive load, promoting more efficient learning. Case in point, this finding supports the integration of PP strategies, such as consistent positive reinforcement, goal-setting, and autonomy support, into language instruction to boost learners&#x02019; emotional engagement and motivation over time, leading to tangible improvements in their language proficiency.</p></sec><sec id="sec025"><title>Limitations</title><p>This study encountered several limitations. All three studies were conducted as laboratory experiments, allowing controlled examination of variable interactions and causality. However, this approach needs ecological validity. Future research should investigate the effects of PP interventions in real-world classroom settings where environmental variables (e.g., peer interaction, task complexity) may influence learners&#x02019; emotional and cognitive engagement differently from lab conditions. Secondly, despite calculating sample sizes based on effect size, statistical power, and alpha values, the findings&#x02019; generalizability could be improved due to the small sample sizes. Larger-scale surveys are recommended to enhance generalizability.</p><p>Moreover, examining the long-term impact of positive feedback strategies on language proficiency could offer deeper insights into how sustained interventions shape learning outcomes over time. Equally important, since learner responses to feedback may vary across different cultural contexts, future research should explore the effectiveness of positive feedback strategies (e.g., autonomy support vs. praise) across different EFL environments, such as in Western and Asian educational systems. This approach would offer cross-cultural validation of the study&#x02019;s findings and identify culturally sensitive teaching practices.</p><p>Additionally, while the study designs suggested a correlation between EFL learners&#x02019; PP and their learning achievements, direct evidence is still lacking. Lastly, individual differences such as personality traits (e.g., openness contributing to positive emotions and personal growth, as noted by [<xref rid="pone.0314730.ref088" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]), cognitive abilities, working memory capacity, and prior language exposure influence PP and neural efficiency [<xref rid="pone.0314730.ref089" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0314730.ref090" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. Further investigation into these factors is necessary. It is also important to note that while PP is associated with increases in FAA, they are not necessarily the same [<xref rid="pone.0314730.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], and future research is advised to develop a direct approach to measure one&#x02019;s PP.</p><p>Feedback types could have various effects. Verbal feedback (e.g., spoken praise during lessons) may have a more immediate emotional impact, fostering a sense of connection between teachers and learners and helping to build confidence in oral communication tasks. Conversely, written feedback (e.g., comments on assignments or online messages) provides learners a permanent reference to revisit, potentially reinforcing positive emotions over time and supporting self-directed learning. It may be especially beneficial in asynchronous online learning environments, where learners process feedback at their own pace. Therefore, future research should compare the effectiveness of these feedback types in different learning contexts, such as face-to-face and online classes, to determine which methods are most effective for enhancing emotional well-being and improving language outcomes.</p><p>While innovative in combining neuroscientific and behavioral methods, the study&#x02019;s experimental design is not without potential confounding variables that could influence the results. One such confound is the individual differences in learners&#x02019; baseline PP and motivation levels. Some students may naturally have higher levels of psychological well-being or intrinsic motivation, which could affect how they respond to feedback. Additionally, language proficiency and prior exposure to English could vary among participants, influencing their cognitive load and neural efficiency during learning tasks. Cultural differences in how feedback is perceived could also play a role, as learners from certain cultures may respond differently to positive reinforcement.</p><p>Another confound could arise from teacher-student rapport; participants with better relationships with instructors may perceive feedback more positively, which affects their performance. Moreover, fatigue or attention levels during EEG sessions could impact neural measurements, as participants with higher fatigue might exhibit reduced neural efficiency, regardless of feedback. To mitigate these potential confounds, the study employed random assignment and controlled for participants&#x02019; proficiency levels. However, future research could further address these issues by using larger, more diverse samples and longitudinal designs to monitor changes over time.</p></sec><sec id="sec026"><title>Theoretical implications</title><p>The originality of this study lies in its three-experiment design to explore whether the teacher&#x02019;s positive feedback enhances EFL learners&#x02019; PP, thereby improving neural efficiency and learning outcomes. These findings have significant theoretical implications, confirming the role of the teacher&#x02019;s positive feedback in cultivating EFL learners&#x02019; PP from a neuroscientific perspective. The study discovered a possible effect of EFL learners&#x02019; PP on the relationship between the teacher&#x02019;s positive feedback and neural efficiency. The interaction between PP and positive feedback significantly affected neural efficiency, highlighting their importance in EFL learning, as neural efficiency is strongly associated with positive learning outcomes. The empirical evidence provides new insights into cultivating and using PP in EFL learning. This research establishes a new pathway to understand EFL learners&#x02019; PP through a neuroscientific foundation, with follow-up research potentially expanding knowledge and contributions in this area.</p></sec><sec id="sec027"><title>Practical implications</title><p>The findings of this study suggest that online EFL instructors can enhance learners&#x02019; PP by incorporating positive reinforcement strategies and fostering learner autonomy, helping to alleviate students&#x02019; fear of failure [<xref rid="pone.0314730.ref091" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. Improved PP is linked to more efficient neural processing and can positively impact learning outcomes. However, educators need to recognize that positive feedback alone is insufficient to enhance neural efficiency&#x02014;it must be paired with perceptual processing tasks (e.g., lexical decision or timed reading exercises) that engage students cognitively.</p><p>This study highlights that PP plays a pivotal role in learners&#x02019; neural efficiency, reinforcing that cognitive and emotional support must be integrated into teaching methods. Supporting findings of [<xref rid="pone.0314730.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>], our research underscores the importance of meaningful feedback in shaping learners&#x02019; emotional experiences. Constructive and uplifting feedback promotes language acquisition and learners&#x02019; well-being, fostering a positive learning environment. By integrating these research-based approaches into teacher training programs, educators can develop more effective pedagogical strategies and provide personalized support to learners. The study&#x02019;s insights can also inform the development of innovative language learning technologies, such as adaptive platforms that offer tailored feedback and support. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of optimizing language learning experiences in the digital age by exploring the broader implications for online learning contexts and feedback mechanisms.</p><p>The implications of these findings may also extend beyond Taiwan and are relevant to EFL instructors globally, particularly in online and non-immersion settings. Educators can balance positive feedback with structured cognitive challenges to build learners&#x02019; confidence while developing their language proficiency. Moreover, these strategies are adaptable to different educational systems, helping teachers create effective learning environments across various cultural contexts.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec028"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Although the significance of the teacher&#x02019;s positive feedback and learners&#x02019; PP in EFL learning has been extensively researched, the mechanisms through which positive feedback promotes PP and how PP leads to better learning outcomes require more empirical evidence. This research advanced understanding by designing three experiments to explore these issues, aiding EFL education scholars and practitioners in understanding how positive feedback fosters or enhances learners&#x02019; PP in the EFL context. Additionally, the study examined how PP and positive feedback improve EFL learners&#x02019; neural efficiency. The results demonstrated that the teacher&#x02019;s positive feedback effectively enhanced PP. The interaction between positive feedback and PP significantly influenced neural efficiency. Furthermore, a significant positive association was found between neural efficiency and learning outcomes, supporting the neural efficiency hypothesis in EFL learning.

Technical Soundness and Data Support</p><p>The manuscript presents a sound piece of research with well-conducted experiments and clear data that support the conclusions. Below are the details for each experiment:</p><p>Study 1: The experiment involved 78 college students and tested whether positive feedback enhances EFL learners' PP. The study design (single-factor between-subjects) and the use of ANCOVA to adjust for baseline differences were appropriate. The results show significant effects of positive feedback on PP (F (2) = 22.952, p &#x0003c; .001, &#x003b7;&#x000b2;p = .383). The study's conclusion is well-supported by the data (e.g., Figure 5 and Table 2), showing a clear enhancement of FAA, an indicator of PP, in the experimental group.</p><p>Study 2: This study examined neural efficiency using a within-subjects 3&#x000d7;2 factorial design. The authors appropriately used a two-way ANOVA to examine the interaction between PP and positive feedback, finding significant effects on neural efficiency (F (2) = 6.599, p = .002, &#x003b7;&#x000b2;p = .121). This supports the hypothesis that positive feedback enhances neural efficiency, which is detailed with proper statistical reporting (Table 3, Figure 6).</p><p>Study 3: This final study explores the relationship between neural efficiency and learning outcomes. Pearson correlation analysis revealed a strong and significant relationship (r = .563, p &#x0003c; .001), supporting the hypothesis that neural efficiency is positively associated with better learning outcomes (Table 4, Figure 7).</p><p>Evidence: The statistical evidence provided in Tables 2, 3, and 4, along with corresponding figures, strongly supports the conclusions drawn from the experiments.</p><p>Recommendation: The experiments are sound, and the data support the conclusions. However, it may be beneficial to include a deeper discussion of potential confounding variables in the experiment design.</p><p>2. Statistical Analysis</p><p>The statistical analysis is rigorous and appropriate, with detailed reporting of effect sizes and significance values. The authors use ANCOVA, two-way ANOVA, and Pearson correlation, all of which are correctly applied to their respective datasets.</p><p>Study 1 (ANCOVA): The authors properly adjusted for baseline FAA differences, and the results are significant (F (2) = 22.952, p &#x0003c; .001). The use of &#x003b7;&#x000b2;p (partial eta squared) for effect size gives further insight into the strength of the effect (&#x003b7;&#x000b2;p = .383), which is considered a large effect size.</p><p>Study 2 (Two-Way ANOVA): The authors used a two-way ANOVA to examine the interaction between feedback and PP on neural efficiency. The interaction term was significant, with &#x003b7;&#x000b2;p = .121, indicating that the feedback and PP interaction had a notable impact on neural efficiency. The assumptions for ANOVA appear to be met, but it would be helpful to include a check for normality or homogeneity of variances.</p><p>Study 3 (Pearson Correlation): The correlation between neural efficiency and learning outcomes (r = .563, p &#x0003c; .001) is both statistically significant and strong, indicating a robust relationship.</p><p>Evidence: Tables 2, 3, and 4 provide sufficient statistical details, with p-values and effect sizes correctly reported.</p><p>Recommendation: Consider adding a check for assumptions (e.g., normality for ANOVA) and ensure this is mentioned in the methods or discussion section for completeness.</p><p>3. Data Availability</p><p>The data availability statement in the manuscript states that data are available upon request from the corresponding author. However, PLOS ONE prefers that the data be fully available without restrictions. The authors should ideally provide the data through a public repository or include it as part of the supporting information.</p><p>Evidence: The Data Availability Statement on page 21 indicates that the data can be requested but is not directly available through a repository or as supplementary material.</p><p>Recommendation: To fully comply with PLOS ONE&#x02019;s data policy, I recommend that the authors upload their data to a public repository or include it in the supporting information.</p><p>4. Presentation and Language</p><p>The manuscript is generally well-written, but there are areas where clarity can be improved. For example:</p><p>Introduction: While the background is thorough, some sections could benefit from more concise phrasing. For example, in the paragraph explaining positive psychology (page 3), the phrase "It has been asserted that incorporating PP provides a transformative perspective on language education" could be tightened to improve flow.</p><p>Grammatical Issues: There are minor grammatical issues throughout, such as in Study 2's description: "Participants of the low PP group sat in front of the computer and watch the scene of April's Breakdown of the movie Revolutionary Road," where "watch" should be "watched."</p><p>Clarity in Statistical Reporting: In Table 2 (Study 1), the authors mention a "&#x003b7;&#x000b2;p" effect size without explaining this term in the text. Although this is a commonly used metric, it would be helpful to briefly clarify it for readers who may not be familiar with this statistic.</p><p>Evidence: Examples of unclear or awkward phrasing can be found in Study 2 (page 15) and the introduction (page 3).</p><p>Recommendation: A light proofreading for grammatical issues and clarity is recommended. Some phrasing can be tightened, and statistical terms should be briefly explained where necessary.</p><p>Summary of Recommendations</p><p>Technical Soundness: The study is technically sound, but a discussion of potential confounding variables would strengthen the conclusions.</p><p>Statistical Rigor: The statistical analysis is appropriate, but it is advisable to mention checks for assumptions (e.g., normality for ANOVA).</p><p>Data Availability: The authors should make their data publicly available, either through a repository or as supplementary material, to fully comply with PLOS ONE's data-sharing policy.</p><p>Language and Presentation: The manuscript is clear overall, but minor grammatical issues should be addressed, and the phrasing could be made more concise in some sections.</p><p>Reviewer #3:&#x000a0;The present study is interesting, the language is good, and the content and analysis match the title. Yet some points are recommended to amend some issues mainly related to the section of Methodology. The review report is attached.</p><p>Reviewer #4:&#x000a0;1. Title and Abstract</p><p>&#x02022; Title: The title reflects the article&#x02019;s content, but it might benefit from being more specific about the research&#x02019;s unique contribution (e.g., neural efficiency in EFL learning and positive psychology).</p><p>&#x02022; Abstract: The abstract effectively summarizes the research; however, it could benefit from explicitly mentioning the sample size in each experiment and clarifying the significance of findings beyond the educational setting.</p><p>2. Introduction</p><p>&#x02022; Strengths: The introduction provides a comprehensive background on Positive Psychology (PP), EFL learning, and the Neural Efficiency Hypothesis. The justification for combining neuroscientific and behavioral methods is clear.</p><p>&#x02022; Weaknesses: The introduction could benefit from a clearer explanation of how this study differs from previous studies on PP and neural efficiency in language learning. It would be useful to elaborate on the practical implications of the findings for educators in different contexts beyond Taiwan.</p><p>3. Literature Review</p><p>&#x02022; Strengths: The literature review is well-rounded, integrating recent research and theoretical frameworks on positive feedback, PP, and neural efficiency.</p><p>&#x02022; Weaknesses: Some of the references are quite general, and a few more specific studies directly linking PP with neural efficiency in EFL contexts would strengthen the argument. Additionally, a clearer distinction between previous findings and the current study&#x02019;s unique contribution is needed.</p><p>4. Methodology</p><p>&#x02022; Strengths: The three experiments are clearly described, with a solid justification for the use of EEG and behavioral measures. The experimental design is robust, especially the random assignment of participants and the use of control and experimental groups.</p><p>&#x02022; Weaknesses: The methodology could provide more details on how the tasks were adapted to the proficiency levels of the participants, especially given the inclusion of TOEIC scores as a criterion. It would also help to include more information on potential confounding factors and how they were controlled.</p><p>5. Results</p><p>&#x02022; Strengths: The statistical analysis is thorough and appropriate for the research questions. The use of ANCOVA and two-way ANOVA tests is justified, and the results are clearly presented with tables and figures.</p><p>&#x02022; Weaknesses: While the findings are significant, the discussion could be expanded to explain the practical significance of the effect sizes (e.g., how much PP improvement translates into real-world language learning outcomes). The interpretation of EEG results, particularly the alpha band, should be linked more explicitly to practical applications in language learning.</p><p>6. Discussion</p><p>&#x02022; Strengths: The discussion links the results back to the research questions and hypotheses and provides a clear narrative on how positive feedback enhances PP and neural efficiency.</p><p>&#x02022; Weaknesses: The limitations section mentions the need for ecological validity but does not suggest concrete future directions. It would be helpful to propose specific field-based studies or cross-cultural validations. Moreover, the discussion could benefit from a deeper exploration of how different types of positive feedback (e.g., written vs. verbal) might affect learning outcomes differently.</p><p>7. Conclusion and Implications</p><p>&#x02022; Strengths: The conclusion appropriately summarizes the main findings and their implications for EFL teaching and learning.</p><p>&#x02022; Weaknesses: The practical implications for educators could be expanded. For instance, how can these findings be integrated into teacher training programs? Additionally, the broader implications for language learning technology and feedback mechanisms in online learning contexts could be more thoroughly explored.</p><p>8. References</p><p>&#x02022; The references are up-to-date and relevant, but there might be room to include more recent studies that specifically address the neural mechanisms underlying PP in language learning.</p><p>9. Figures and Tables</p><p>&#x02022; The figures are clear and informative, but some tables (e.g., Table 1 on the overview of studies) might benefit from additional footnotes explaining key terms for readers unfamiliar with the neuroscience aspect.</p><p>10. Ethical Considerations</p><p>&#x02022; The ethical statement is clear, and the study follows proper guidelines. However, it could include more information on how the researchers ensured the emotional well-being of participants who were in the control group (receiving criticism or no feedback).</p><p>General Comments</p><p>&#x02022; Overall, this article presents an innovative and well-executed study. It makes a valuable contribution to the understanding of how positive feedback and PP enhance neural efficiency in EFL learners. However, there are areas where more practical implications and cross-contextual discussions could enhance the article&#x02019;s relevance to a broader audience of educators and researchers.</p><p>**********</p><p><!-- <font color="black"> -->6.

Title: Why it shouldn&#x02019;t be like this: &#x0201c;Enhancing EFL Learning: The Impact of Positive Feedback on Neural Efficiency and Positive Psychology&#x0201d;?</p><p>Response: </p><p>Many thanks for the reviewer&#x02019;s suggestion. After considering Reviewer 1 and other reviewers&#x02019; comments and suggestions, I have changed the title to &#x0201c;Neural Efficiency in EFL Learning and Positive Psychology.&#x0201d; </p><p>2. Abstract: There are no objectives of the study or questions in the abstract. There is very detail about procedure. So, the procedure should be short and precise.</p><p>Response: </p><p>I am grateful for the reviewer&#x02019;s suggestion on the abstract, which has been revised accordingly. I hope that this revision meets the reviewer&#x02019;s expectations. </p><p>&#x0201c;This study aims to investigate how teachers&#x02019; positive feedback influences learners&#x02019; positive psychology (PP) in English as a Foreign Language (EFL) instruction and to examine how PP enhances learning outcomes through the neural efficiency hypothesis. The study employed three neuroscientific and behavioral experiments to address these questions. Study 1, with 78 college-level EFL learners, examined the effect of teachers' positive feedback on learners' PP and found a significant positive impact. Study 2, conducted with 102 EFL learners, tested the neural efficiency hypothesis and revealed that higher PP improved neural efficiency, with positive feedback moderating this effect. Study 3, involving 54 EFL learners, explored the relationship between neural efficiency and learning outcomes, confirming that enhanced neural efficiency leads to better learning performance. Beyond education, the results underscore the broader relevance of positive psychology and neural efficiency in other domains, such as workplace performance, skill acquisition, and personal development, where maintaining cognitive efficiency and well-being is crucial. These findings highlight the importance of positive feedback in fostering PP, improving neural efficiency, and enhancing learning outcomes. The study offers theoretical contributions and practical recommendations for EFL educators to leverage positive feedback and promote effective learning.&#x0201d;</p><p>3. Literature review is more detail and too much. I prefer to be short and precise. There are no objectives or research questions in introduction. Introduction should be concluded with a brief statement of the overall aim of the work and a comment about whether that aim was achieved, but it lacks.</p><p>Response: </p><p>I sincerely appreciate the reviewer&#x02019;s constructive feedback and insightful suggestions. The literature review section has been revised accordingly and included here.</p><p>&#x0201c;Moreover, the overall objective of this study is to examine how teachers&#x02019; positive feedback influences PP in EFL learners and investigate how PP enhances learning outcomes through the neural efficiency hypothesis. Specifically, it aims to answer the following questions:</p><p>1. Does teachers' positive feedback improve learners' PP?</p><p>2. How does PP affect learners&#x02019; neural efficiency?</p><p>3. Does improved neural efficiency lead to better learning outcomes?</p><p>The novelty of this research lies in its experimental design, using frontal alpha asymmetry (FAA) of EEG to objectively quantify the impact of positive feedback (compared to no feedback and criticism) on learners&#x02019; PP. Furthermore, it empirically tests the neural efficiency hypothesis to explore how PP enhances performance. The results confirmed the study&#x02019;s aims, demonstrating that positive feedback enhances PP, which improves neural efficiency, ultimately leading to better learning outcomes. These findings provide valuable theoretical insights and offer practical recommendations for EFL educators seeking to improve learners' experiences and outcomes.&#x0201d;</p><p>4. Materials and Methods: Study methods and materials are not clear for me. I think it should be expressed shortly and precisely. The Materials and Methods section should provide enough detail to allow suitably skilled investigators to fully replicate your study. Specific information and/or protocols for new methods should be included in detail. If materials, methods, and protocols are well established, authors may cite articles where those protocols are described in detail, but the submission should include sufficient information to be understood independent of these references.</p><p>Response: </p><p>In the Overview of this Research, the following sentences have been added to point out the purpose of the designed tasks. </p><p>&#x0201c;The tasks mainly focused on fundamental areas where learners with TOEIC scores between 500 and 650 typically need improvement, such as vocabulary expansion, sentence structure, and comprehension of academic texts.&#x0201d; In the Course Content section, the following information was reported to explicitly state how the designed tasks echoed the participants&#x02019; current level of proficiency in English. </p><p>"Reading passages are chosen carefully to align with participants&#x02019; current abilities, with initial texts drawn from general-interest sources and simplified academic content. Over time, the texts become longer and denser, reflecting TOEFL&#x02019;s requirements for handling academic reading material.&#x0201d;</p><p>5. Results, Discussion, Conclusions</p><p>These sections may all be separate or may be combined to create a mixed Results/Discussion section (commonly labeled &#x0201c;Results and Discussion&#x0201d;) or a mixed Discussion/Conclusions section (commonly labeled &#x0201c;Discussion&#x0201d;). These sections may be further divided into subsections, each with a concise subheading, as appropriate. These sections have no word limit, but the language should be clear and concise. So, this part should part should fill the above requirements.</p><p>Response:</p><p>I appreciate and have carefully considered the reviewer&#x02019;s suggestions regarding the structure and content of the Results, Discussion, and Conclusions sections. However, I believe the current format is appropriate and aligns with academic research standards for the following reasons:</p><p>1. Flexibility in Structure: The reviewer's suggestion to allow for separate or combined sections offers flexibility in presenting the research findings. This approach can be tailored to the study's specific nature and clarity of arguments.</p><p>2. Clarity and Conciseness: Clear and concise language is essential for effectively communicating research results. This ensures that readers can easily understand the key findings and their implications.</p><p>3. Subsection Structure: The suggestion for subsections with concise subheadings helps organize the content logically, making it easier for readers to navigate and understand the different aspects of the research.</p><p>4. No Word Limit: The absence of a word limit allows for a thorough presentation of the results, discussion, and conclusions. This ensures the research is adequately represented and all relevant points are addressed.</p><p>In conclusion, the current format for the Results, Discussion, and Conclusions sections effectively addresses the reviewer's recommendations while maintaining a balance between flexibility, clarity, and comprehensiveness. I appreciate the reviewer's feedback and believe that the proposed revisions will further enhance the quality and impact of the research.</p><p>6. Acknowledgments</p><p>I think it was not correctly said. It should be stated correctly.</p><p>Response:</p><p>The acknowledgment has been rewritten thoroughly. Thank you very much for the kind reminder.</p><p>7. References</p><p>8. It should be written by &#x0201c;Vancouver&#x0201d; style.</p><p>Response:</p><p>I appreciate the reviewer&#x02019;s reminder and I have changed the reference style from APA to Vancouver Style. </p><p>Reviewer #2: </p><p>1. Technical Soundness and Data Support</p><p>The manuscript presents a sound piece of research with well-conducted experiments and clear data that support the conclusions. Below are the details for each experiment:</p><p>Study 1: The experiment involved 78 college students and tested whether positive feedback enhances EFL learners' PP. The study design (single-factor between-subjects) and the use of ANCOVA to adjust for baseline differences were appropriate. The results show significant effects of positive feedback on PP (F (2) = 22.952, p &#x0003c; .001, &#x003b7;&#x000b2;p = .383). The study's conclusion is well-supported by the data (e.g., Figure 5 and Table 2), showing a clear enhancement of FAA, an indicator of PP, in the experimental group.</p><p>Study 2: This study examined neural efficiency using a within-subjects 3&#x000d7;2 factorial design. The authors appropriately used a two-way ANOVA to examine the interaction between PP and positive feedback, finding significant effects on neural efficiency (F (2) = 6.599, p = .002, &#x003b7;&#x000b2;p = .121). This supports the hypothesis that positive feedback enhances neural efficiency, which is detailed with proper statistical reporting (Table 3, Figure 6).</p><p>Study 3: This final study explores the relationship between neural efficiency and learning outcomes. Pearson correlation analysis revealed a strong and significant relationship (r = .563, p &#x0003c; .001), supporting the hypothesis that neural efficiency is positively associated with better learning outcomes (Table 4, Figure 7).</p><p>Evidence: The statistical evidence provided in Tables 2, 3, and 4, along with corresponding figures, strongly supports the conclusions drawn from the experiments.</p><p>Recommendation: The experiments are sound, and the data support the conclusions. However, it may be beneficial to include a deeper discussion of potential confounding variables in the experiment design.</p><p>Responses: </p><p>I sincerely appreciate the editor and reviewers&#x02019; constructive feedback and insightful suggestions. The following revisions have been made in the Limitations section. </p><p> &#x0201c;While innovative in combining neuroscientific and behavioral methods, the study's experimental design is not without potential confounding variables that could influence the results. One such confound is the individual differences in learners' baseline PP and motivation levels. Some students may naturally have higher levels of psychological well-being or intrinsic motivation, which could affect how they respond to feedback. Additionally, language proficiency and prior exposure to English could vary among participants, influencing their cognitive load and neural efficiency during learning tasks. Cultural differences in how feedback is perceived could also play a role, as learners from certain cultures may respond differently to positive reinforcement. </p><p> Another confound could arise from teacher-student rapport; participants with better relationships with instructors may perceive feedback more positively, which affects their performance. Moreover, fatigue or attention levels during EEG sessions could impact neural measurements, as participants with higher fatigue might exhibit reduced neural efficiency, regardless of feedback. To mitigate these potential confounds, the study employed random assignment and controlled for participants&#x02019; proficiency levels. However, future research could further address these issues by using larger, more diverse samples and longitudinal designs to monitor changes over time.&#x0201d; (p. 25)</p><p>2. Statistical Analysis</p><p>The statistical analysis is rigorous and appropriate, with detailed reporting of effect sizes and significance values. The authors use ANCOVA, two-way ANOVA, and Pearson correlation, all of which are correctly applied to their respective datasets.</p><p>Study 1 (ANCOVA): The authors properly adjusted for baseline FAA differences, and the results are significant (F (2) = 22.952, p &#x0003c; .001). The use of &#x003b7;&#x000b2;p (partial eta squared) for effect size gives further insight into the strength of the effect (&#x003b7;&#x000b2;p = .383), which is considered a large effect size.</p><p>Study 2 (Two-Way ANOVA): The authors used a two-way ANOVA to examine the interaction between feedback and PP on neural efficiency. The interaction term was significant, with &#x003b7;&#x000b2;p = .121, indicating that the feedback and PP interaction had a notable impact on neural efficiency. The assumptions for ANOVA appear to be met, but it would be helpful to include a check for normality or homogeneity of variances.</p><p>Study 3 (Pearson Correlation): The correlation between neural efficiency and learning outcomes (r = .563, p &#x0003c; .001) is both statistically significant and strong, indicating a robust relationship.</p><p>Evidence: Tables 2, 3, and 4 provide sufficient statistical details, with p-values and effect sizes correctly reported.</p><p>Recommendation: Consider adding a check for assumptions (e.g., normality for ANOVA) and ensure this is mentioned in the methods or discussion section for completeness.</p><p>Response: </p><p>I am grateful for the reviewer&#x02019;s comments and suggestions. The normality for ANOVA has been done and reported in the text as follows: &#x0201c;Moreover, skewness and kurtosis were computed to evaluate the data distribution's normality. The skewness registered at 0.992, fitting within the normality criteria of -2 to +2. Meanwhile, the kurtosis measured at 0.172, aligning with acceptable norms of -7 to +7. These findings suggest that the data distribution closely resembles normality. Put together, it was sound to use ANCOVA for statistical analysis in Study 1.&#x0201d; (pg. 15) </p><p>In Study 2, a normality test was also performed, and the report is as follows: &#x0201c;The residuals of the dependent variable show minimal skewness (0.248) and kurtosis (-0.261), which are well within the acceptable thresholds for normality. These results indicate that the residuals are approximately normally distributed, satisfying the normality assumption of ANOVA.&#x0201d; (p. 18)</p><p>3. Data Availability</p><p>The data availability statement in the manuscript states that data are available upon request from the corresponding author. However, PLOS ONE prefers that the data be fully available without restrictions. The authors should ideally provide the data through a public repository or include it as part of the supporting information.</p><p>Evidence: The Data Availability Statement on page 21 indicates that the data can be requested but is not directly available through a repository or as supplementary material.</p><p>Recommendation: To fully comply with PLOS ONE&#x02019;s data policy, I recommend that the authors upload their data to a public repository or include it in the supporting information.</p><p>Response: </p><p>Thanks for the reviewer&#x02019;s suggestion. The data for this present study have already been uploaded and shared as per request. </p><p>4. Presentation and Language. The manuscript is generally well-written, but there are areas where clarity can be improved. For example:</p><p>Introduction: While the background is thorough, some sections could benefit from more concise phrasing. For example, in the paragraph explaining positive psychology (page 3), the phrase "It has been asserted that incorporating PP provides a transformative perspective on language education" could be tightened to improve flow.</p><p>Response:</p><p>Thank you for the reviewer&#x02019;s constructive suggestions and comments. I have carefully revised the introduction in response to the reviewer's suggestion. It is more concise and direct, maintaining the core meaning while enhancing the overall flow of the paragraph. The sentence highlighted above has been changed as follows: &#x0201c;Scholars argue that incorporating PP offers a transformative lens for language education.&#x0201d;</p><p>Grammatical Issues: There are minor grammatical issues throughout, such as in Study 2's description: "Participants of the low PP group sat in front of the computer and watch the scene of April's Breakdown of the movie Revolutionary Road," where "watch" should be "watched."</p><p>Response:</p><p>Thank you very much for the feedback. I have hired a professional editing service to check the grammar throughout the manuscript.</p><p>Clarity in Statistical Reporting: In Table 2 (Study 1), the authors mention a "&#x003b7;&#x000b2;p" effect size without explaining this term in the text. Although this is a commonly used metric, it would be helpful to briefly clarify it for readers who may not be familiar with this statistic.</p><p>Response: </p><p>I am grateful for the rev</p><supplementary-material id="pone.0314730.s004" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>Attachment</label><caption><p>Submitted filename: <named-content content-type="submitted-filename">Rebuttal_letter_.docx</named-content></p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0314730.s004.docx"/></supplementary-material></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="editor-report" id="pone.0314730.r003" specific-use="decision-letter"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0314730.r003</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision Letter 1</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Dibekulu</surname><given-names>Dawit</given-names></name><role>Academic Editor</role></contrib></contrib-group><permissions><copyright-statement>&#x000a9; 2025 Dawit Dibekulu</copyright-statement><copyright-year>2025</copyright-year><copyright-holder>Dawit Dibekulu</copyright-holder><license><ali:license_ref xmlns:ali="http://www.niso.org/schemas/ali/1.0/" specific-use="textmining" content-type="ccbylicense">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</ali:license_ref><license-p>This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution License</ext-link>, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.</license-p></license></permissions><related-article ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.1371/journal.pone.0314730" id="rel-obj003" related-article-type="reviewed-article"/><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>Submission Version</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></front-stub><body><p>
