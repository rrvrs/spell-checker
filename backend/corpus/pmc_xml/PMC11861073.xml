While the potential benefits of NMs for a wide range of industries are clear, concerns over the impact of human and environmental exposure remain. Since NMs can exist in many diverse forms, each of which may cause different biological effects, reliance on traditional <italic>in vivo</italic> models for safety assessment is not feasible, sustainable or ethical, considering the volume of materials that need to be tested (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Burden et al., 2021</xref>). This has stimulated efforts to design alternative strategies to streamline the risk assessment process and Novel Approach Methods (NAMs) to predict human hazard without the need for animal testing (<xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">Stucki et al., 2022</xref>). Many of these NAMs are adapted from cell culture protocols that historically involve the use of animal-derived products therefore, to fully humanise the hazard assessment process it is pertinent to incorporate 3Rs principles into the design of NAMs and novel testing frameworks at this early stage of development. The central focus of this study is to assess the impact of removing animal-derived products from standard acellular and <italic>in vitro</italic> assays in order to reduce ethical concerns and increase the human relevance of toxicity testing.</p><p>Integrated Approaches to Testing and Assessment (IATAs) are a tool which can be utilised to streamline the hazard assessment process (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Sakuratani et al., 2018</xref>). Structured as decision trees, IATAs enable the user to efficiently identify the key information required to support hazard assessment and risk decision making with regards to NM(s) under investigation (<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">Stone et al., 2020</xref>). IATAs, delineated by the primary routes of NM exposure, have successfully been used as the basis of similarity assessment to support grouping of NMs which pose a comparable inhalation, ingestion, or dermal hazard (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Di Cristo et al., 2022</xref>; <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Braakhuis et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Murphy et al., 2021</xref>) and incorporated into a risk decision making framework for the injection of nanobiomedicines (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Powell et al., 2022</xref>). Recognizing the need to reduce the burden of animal testing in toxicology, the IATAs follow a tiered structure and prioritize data generation utilizing <italic>in silico</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> models to categorize hazard before progressing to <italic>in vivo</italic> systems in limited, high priority cases (<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">Stone et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>To meet the necessary demand for improved <italic>in vitro</italic> models required to build confidence in the IATA outcome, a concerted effort has been made to develop NAMs which prove effective for predicting hazard (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Doak et al., 2022</xref>). NAMs are generally defined as toxicological methods that serve as (replacement, reduction or refinement) alternatives to animal testing (e.g., <italic>in silico</italic>, <italic>in chemico</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> methods) (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Burden et al., 2021</xref>). The shift to wider adoption of NAMs will have a seismic impact on the reduction of animal numbers used directly in toxicology studies, however the use of animals to generate reagents and supplements currently required in the standard operating protocols (SOPs) for many NAMs remains as a significant burden. The replacement of animal-derived products incorporated into the NAMs protocols has received less attention to date but as NAMs progress towards validation it is timely to consider how to optimise the NAM underdevelopment without the need for animal-derived products.</p><p>The removal of animal-derived products is likely to have biological, safety as well as ethical benefits, improving assay performance and reproducibility. Species-species differences in animal-derived products may have a significant impact on the performance of NAMs due to species-specific interactions between cells and proteins from different animal sources. For example, serum transferrin functions in transport and delivery of iron to cells (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Aisen and Listowsky, 1980</xref>). Penhallow et al., showed a difference in the ability of human-derived cells to utilise iron from transferrins (Tf) isolated from the sera of human, equine or bovine sources which had an on impact cell growth (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Penhallow et al., 1986</xref>). Enhanced assay specificity and sensitivity may be an additional benefit as human or synthetic-based reagents eliminate the potential for cross-reactivity or interference associated with animal-derived components within an assay (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2023</xref>). Reducing the potential for xenobiotic immunological responses is particularly relevant for to the toxic outcome is understood allowing structure-activity relationships between NM characteristics and toxic outcomes to be recognised.</p><p>The overall aim of this paper is to assess the impact of replacing animal-derived reagents with human-based alternatives when designing IATA and conducting tiered testing, in response to the current drive towards adopting animal-free approaches in toxicology.</p><p>A published IATA for inhalation exposure of NM was selected as an exemplar testing strategy for the hazard assessment of NM as inhalation is the primary route of concern (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Braakhuis et al., 2021</xref>). The initial objective of this project was to conduct an audit of the assays and methods recommended within the IATA to identify where animal-derived products were included, whether these were necessary or, if appropriate, human-derived, or synthetic alternatives were available. As a case study, the impact of replacing animal-derived products was evaluated for both acellular assays and simple Tier 1 <italic>in vitro</italic> toxicity testing using A459 alveolar epithelial cells. A panel of well-characterised high and low toxicity NMs, were selected to assess the suitability of the animal-free approach to NM hazard assessment leading to the potential for an alternative &#x02018;humanised&#x02019; IATA which minimises or avoids the use of animal-derived products.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>2 Methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>2.1 NM suspensions</title><p>The panel of case study NMs (CuO, ZnO, CeO<sub>2</sub>, BaSO<sub>4</sub>, obtained from the EC Joint Research Centre Nanomaterial repository, Ispra, Italy) were selected based on an abundance of existing toxicity data from <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> models [7].

Key characteristics driving toxicity via the inhalation route of exposure were identified including dissolution, reactivity, cytotoxicity, inflammogenicity and genotoxicity. The inclusion of animal-derived products in the methods and models included at each tier of the IATA testing strategy were reviewed and animal-free alternatives were considered (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Briefly, protocols recommended for assessment of dissolution do not require animal-derived products and are not considered further (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Koltermann-J&#x000fc;lly et al., 2018</xref>). A number of assays can be selected for the assessment of intrinsic NM reactivity including electroparamagnetic resonance (EPR), ferric reduction ability of serum (FRAS) assay and the reactive oxygen species (ROS) sensitive probe, DCFH<sub>2</sub>-DA.

Although considered a success in the promotion of 3Rs principles a recent systematic review of 156 articles utilising <italic>in vitro</italic> methods to assess skin sensitization was carried out by Marigliani et al., who reported the use of several animal-derived products from different species in many protocols, with the use of FBS being cited in 78% of studies (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Marigliani et al., 2019a</xref>). Therefore, further optimisation of skin sensitization NAMs is still required to completely remove the use of animals from cosmetics testing. Although in their infancy compared to the NAMs used to detect skin sensitization, efforts to develop advanced models to assess hazard of NM and substances via other exposure routes have made significant progress in recent years (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Fentem et al., 2021</xref>). It is therefore timely to consider the hidden burden of animal use at this stage of NAM development to ensure animal-derived products are excluded where possible. To meet this need we conducted an initial audit of an IATA developed for the assessment of NMs hazard via inhalation and identified a number of key areas where animal reagents such as BSA or FBS are commonly used, from initial preparation of NM suspensions to <italic>in vitro</italic> cell-based assays. Critical assays were then selected for further assessment to explore the feasibility of removing and/or replacing animal-derived components, focussing on the replacement of FBS with HPL.</p><p>Worldwide production of FBS is estimated at approximately 600,000 to 800,000&#x000a0;L collected from around 1 to 2 million foetuses each year (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Jochems et al., 2002</xref>). Although included in <italic>status quo</italic> cell culture protocols FBS is a complex mixture of different factors and introduces a degree of complexity and variability that can have a substantial impact on experimental results.

Reducing the potential for xenobiotic immunological responses is also particularly relevant for NM toxicity testing to ensure potential hazard is accurately identified and to mitigate against artefactual responses.</p><p>Issues with data reproducibility have been shown to arise from batch-to-batch variation between FBS sources leading to inconsistencies in results (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Barosova et al., 2021</xref>). As a result, the transition to FBS-free media is encouraged by scientific organizations worldwide; the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) began to discourage the use of FBS in 2017, especially for human health risk assessments of chemicals (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Pedersen and Fant, 2018</xref>). Additionally, to address both reproducibility and ethical concerns related to the use of FBS the EU Reference Laboratory for Alternatives to Animal Testing (EURL ECVAM) Scientific Advisory Committee (ESAC) requires justification when non-animal alternatives to serum are not used in methods forwarded to the organization for validation/pre-validation (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Directive, 2010, 2022</xref>; <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">ECVAM News and Views, 2008</xref>).

Furthermore, factors such as the size, surface chemistry (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Mortensen et al., 2013</xref>), charge and shape of the NM, as well as the binding affinity of particular media proteins for specific NMs, can majorly impact the formation and composition of the protein corona (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Ahsan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Kopac, 2021</xref>) which may explain the interesting observation that switching to HPL lead to a measurable increase in hydrodynamic diameter and polydispersity of CuO NM but decrease of BaSO<sub>4</sub> diameter. Once formed, the protein corona can influence various characteristics of the NM such as the agglomeration of particles, e.g., in a study from Vertegel et al., (<xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">Vertegel et al., 2004</xref>), lysozymes were shown to bind to silica NMs and cause enhanced NM aggregation, with Park et al. (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Park, 2020</xref>), postulating that this was due to the interaction of positively charged residues on the bound lysozymes interacting with other proteins. Adsorbed proteins are also able to act as physical bridges between NMs and thus promote agglomeration (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Falahati et al., 2019</xref>) while on the other hand serum albumin has been shown to coat some NMs and decrease agglomeration through inhibition of electrostatic and attractive forces between individual particles (<xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">Zook et al., 2011</xref>). Particle agglomeration is a key factor that must be considered in nanotoxicity testing, as it has been shown to affect NP toxicity and reactivity. Murugadoss et al. (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Murugadoss et al., 2020</xref>), reported a size-dependent decrease in glutathione levels and increase in IL-8 and IL-1&#x003b2; levels and increase in DNA damage when THP-1 macrophages were exposed to large and smaller TiO<sub>2</sub> agglomerates. Furthermore, TiO<sub>2</sub> prepared in various media reportedly caused differences in particle agglomeration, cellular interactions and chromosomal damage in BEAS-2B cells, with differences attributable to changes in protein corona (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Prasad et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Evaluation of intrinsic NM reactivity is a core component of the inhalation IATA and considered a key driver of NM toxicity. Ensuring the methods employed to assess NM reactivity are sufficiently robust to differentiate high from low reactivity NM is therefore critical. Here we showed the choice of media supplement used in the preparation of NMs can result in significantly different responses when ROS production is detected by the DCFH<sub>2</sub>-DA probe which will fundamentally affect the interpretation of relative hazard or NM hazard ranking. Therefore, care should be taken when comparing DCFH<sub>2</sub>-DA results from across the literature. We also demonstrated the FRAS assay, which does not require animal-derived products, can differentiate between high reactivity CuO and low reactivity BaSO<sub>4</sub> confirming results previously reported by (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Ag Seleci et al., 2022</xref>). Interesting in this study the authors reported significant reactivity of ZnO when measured by the FRAS assay but not when the DCFH<sub>2</sub>-DA assay was used, suggesting the FRAS assay is a more sensitive read-out. It is tempting to recommend the FRAS assay as the first-choice reactivity assay in &#x02018;humanised&#x02019; IATA however a number of key limitations should first be considered. The FRAS assay may not be suitable for all material types, e.g., colorimetric assays, including the FRAS assay, are not recommended for NM with high absorption coefficient (i.e., where traces of NM may produce a false positive result due to optical interference) as demonstrated with NM pigments in (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Ag Seleci et al., 2022</xref>). Another challenge associated with FRAS assay are comparatively high exposure doses required to obtain a signal (e.g., 60&#x000a0;mg per 1.5&#x000a0;mL of serum as the highest dose) which could pose a problem when only a limited amount of the material is available.</p><p>We focussed our study on the IATA tailored towards inhalation, as the primary route of particle exposure. The IATA recommends a tiered approach to toxicity testing initially utilising simple monocell cultures of a cell-line relevant to the exposure route to screen acute toxicity and pro-inflammatory and/or genotox changes. The A549 cell-line isolated from a basal cell adenocarcinoma from a 58-year old Caucasian male (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Lieber et al., 1976</xref>) are commonly used as a model system for Type II alveolar epithelial cells, however A549 cell phenotype and behaviour has been shown to be manipulated by culture conditions (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Cooper et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2017</xref>) further exemplified by the reduction of cell growth rate and change of morphology we have observed here.</p><p>It has been reported that HPL in general has the higher concentration of growth factors than any other cell culture supplements including FBS (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Guiotto et al., 2020</xref>). Correspondingly, the majority of recent reports assessing the use of HPL in expansion of mesenchymal stem cells agree that HPL supports cell expansion to a higher degree, compared to FBS, cells proliferate faster and maintain undifferentiated phenotype (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Guiotto et al., 2020</xref>). <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Hildner et al. (2015)</xref> reported both human articular chondrocytes and human adipose-derived stem cells cultured with 5% HPL showed strongly enhanced proliferation rates compared to cells grown in 10% FBS. <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Rauch et al. (2011)</xref>, showed almost identical growth promoting effect of 5% HPL is compared to that of 10% FBS for renal epithelial cells and human leukemia cell lines. <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Hofbauer et al. (2014)</xref>, demonstrated use of HPL on different EC types did not reveal any substantial negative effects on EC growth however a slight decrease in metabolic activity was noted. Conversely here we see a reduction in A549 cell growth rate and change in morphology. To normalise our comparative cell culture conditions we opted to reduce the concentration of HPL to more closely align with the total protein content of FBS which may have led to the reduction in proliferation rate, however this adjustment was based on total protein content and not tailored to matching levels of specific proteins with known functional impact on cell growth. Comprehensive characterisation of FBS and HPL-supplemented media composition should be conducted in future mechanistic studies to elucidate the impact of specific factors present in each media. It has also been reported that HPL may stimulate cells to mature which may account for reduction in proliferation as cells differentiate (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Bieback et al., 2009</xref>). The evident change in morphology and expression of structural proteins identified in our study may therefore be indicative of differentiation or phenotypic switching to a less proliferative state. Confirming the relative reduction of cell proliferation observed here, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Fazzina et al. (2016)</xref>, showed that FBS resulted in a faster replication rate for haematopoietic cell lines (KG-1, K562, JURKAT, HL-60), with an average of doubling time 14% higher than HPL cultures. A lack of standardisation in preparation of HPL and protocols for use are likely to be responsible for the contradictory impacts on cell culture proliferation and differentiation reported in the literature. Here we report the impact of different media composition on cell growth, phenotype and behaviour using a direct approach to switching from FBS to HPL-supplemented media. It would be interesting to compare the impact of different HPL concentrations and alternative strategies for adaption periods, e.g., gradual, or staggered replacement over prolonged time (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Marigliani et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">Weber et al., 2022</xref>). Suggesting an optimal protocol for adaptation to HPL-supplemented media was considered out with the scope of this manuscript rather the results reported here provide direct evidence for the need to careful consideration of cell culture conditions and processes when developing NAMs which deviate from standardised protocols such as the growth of cells in FBS-containing media.</p><p>Commercially available HPL usually consists of a pool of at least three different blood donors, to get a standardised product and prevent undesired donor-dependent characteristics. <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Hesler et al. (2019)</xref>, tested effect of non-pooled, single patient-derived HPL on A549, HepG2 and Caco-2 human cell lines. The relative proliferation of A549 cells decreased when cultured in the presence of 10% single doner HPL (74.5 + 10.1%), 6% single doner HPL (74.0 + 11.0%) and 10% human serum (78.7 + 13.4%) compared to cells grown in 10% FBS. Here we compared a single batch of FBS with a single batch of HPL as a limited, proof-of-concept to highlight the need to consideration of media composition in the interpretation of hazard results. Future detailed studies considering impact of batch-to-batch variation on the phenotypic changes reported here will be required to delineate the critical factors driving different responses, for example, additional mechanistic studies tailored to better interpret the influence of the protein corona derived from different serum sources on nanomaterial toxicity.</p><p>Discrepancies between studies highlight the fundamental limitation of all protein mixtures used as cell culture supplements regardless of origin. Hormones, growth factors and other signalling molecules are abundant in serum, but tightly regulated in interstitial fluid in which cells in the body are bathed (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Baker, 2016</xref>). The microenvironment of cells, most of which are not directly exposed to serum and its higher concentration of proteins <italic>in vivo</italic>, may be better modelled in serum-free cultures compared to those supplemented with FBS (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Muoio et al., 2021</xref>). However, the growth and maintenance of cell lines using serum-free media is not always possible, or pragmatic. Most serum-free formulations apply only to a specific cell type or closely related group of cell lines, may be prohibitively expensive for widespread application in cell culture lab where multiple cell lines and types are used routinely. As novel media formulations which may have broader applications across a wide variety of cells start to become available (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Rafnsd&#x000f3;ttir et al., 2023</xref>; <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">Weber et al., 2024</xref>) it would be interesting to assess the comparative growth, phenotype and behaviour of cells and impact of use of new formulations on NAM performance. However, weaning cells off serum and transferring to novel media formulations can take time, resources, and effort. <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Chary et al. (2022)</xref> compared a number of commercial serum-free defined media and showed that A549 cells can be successfully transitioned to FBS-free media under submerged and air-liquid interface conditions, however only 2 out of 4 media tested were effective. Each serum-free formulation resulted in distinct cell phenotypes typified by differences in doubling time ranging from 21.3 &#x000b1; 1.5&#x000a0;h (DMEM +10% FBS) to 51 &#x000b1; 6.6&#x000a0;h (CnTPrime Airway). A change in morphology was also observed with A549 cells grown in either DMEM +10% FBS or X-VIVO&#x02122; media showing a similar morphology of smaller, cuboidal cells (about 10&#x02013;20&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m in diameter) whereas CnT-Prime Airway cultured cells were a heterogeneous mixture of large cells (&#x0003e;50&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m in diameter), medium cells (about 20&#x02013;50&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m in diameter), and smaller, cuboidal cells. Significant differences in cell sensitivity to toxic insult were also reported as dependent on culture conditions. The authors concluded that A549 cells cultured in CnTPrime Airway may lose their adenocarcinomic phenotype in favour of differentiation towards an ATI and ATII epithelial cell-like phenotype. Therefore, the choice of media and culture conditions may have an impact on the physiological relevance of a NAM.</p><p>To support the replacement of FBS in cell culture systems used in toxicity testing it is critical to assess how changes in cell phenotype or functionality stimulated by the new culture environment may affect the response of cells to toxic agents and therefore alter the perception of hazard compared to other studies or previous data collected. To address this important factor, we assessed the cytotoxicity of a panel of well characterised NMs prepared as suspensions in FBS- or HPL-supplemented media and exposed to A549 cells cultured under each media condition. Interestingly although CuO NM showed much greater ROS production in the DCFH<sub>2</sub>-DA assay when prepared in HPL-medium compared to FBS this was not replicated in a corresponding increase in cytotoxicity suggesting the level of ROS production under FBS-media conditions is sufficient to trigger mechanisms of cell death within the parameters of the experimental set-up (NM exposure concentration x exposure time). Therefore, although the acellular reactivity assay ranks CuO-HPL higher in potential hazard the toxicology implications are comparable to CuO-FBS in a cellular system. On the other hand, ZnO-HPL and ZnO-FBS both produced very low levels of acellular ROS, however ZnO-HPL was significantly more toxic to A549 cells grown in HPL media compared to the cytotoxicity caused by ZnO-FBS exposure to A549 cells cultures in media with FBS. The degree of cytotoxicity observed resulted in a necessary re-ordering of the hazard ranking of the NM panel when potential to cause cytotoxicity to A549 cells was compared; CuO NM, the highest toxicity material identified under FBS conditions, was surpassed by ZnO when FBS was switched for HPL. Furthermore, the hazard ranking for all NMs generated from cytotoxicity study was different when compared to acellular DCFH<sub>2</sub>-DA reactivity (DCFH<sub>2</sub>-DA: CuO_HPL &#x0003e;&#x0003e; CuO_FBS = ZnO_HPL &#x0003e;&#x0003e; ZnO_FBS &#x0003e; CeO<sub>2</sub>_HPL = BaSO<sub>4</sub>_HPL = BaSO<sub>4</sub>_ FBS = CeO<sub>2</sub>_FBS <italic>versus</italic> cytotoxicity: CuO &#x0003e;&#x0003e; ZnO &#x0003e; CeO<sub>2</sub> = BaSO<sub>4</sub> in FBS-media or ZnO &#x0003e;&#x0003e; CuO &#x0003e; CeO<sub>2</sub> &#x0003e; BaSO<sub>4</sub> in HPL-media).</p><p>The protein corona can impact the NM toxicity profile via altering the nano-bio interface; alternative epitopes on the adsorbed proteins can become exposed upon binding to the NM which can allow for binding to different receptors (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Ge et al., 2015</xref>) altering uptake of NMs in biological systems, as well as their distribution and clearance. Adsorption of different protein preparations (human serum albumin (HSA), bovine serum albumin (BSA), high-density lipoprotein (HDL) to the surface of silver NPs were shown to induce conformational changes in the structures of bound proteins, for example, the number of &#x003b1;-helices decreased in both HSA and BSA but increased in HDL, whereas the number of &#x003b2;-sheets remained unchanged in all 3 protein coronas. This, in fact, altered the cellular uptake of NPs (specifically through scavenger receptors) and initiated cytotoxicity and an inflammatory response (increased mRNA expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6) in <italic>vitro</italic> cellular models (epithelial and endothelial cells) (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Shannahan et al., 2015</xref>). These studies along with the data presented here exemplify how a change in protein corona due to a change in NM suspension media can influence biological responses at the nano-bio interface should be carefully considered when altering media composition. We hypothesise differences in particle uptake mechanisms triggered by the ZnO-HPL protein corona directly accounts for the increase in cytotoxicity of the ZnO NM compared to FBS-media conditions (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Hassanian et al., 2021</xref>). It is well acknowledged that ZnO NM mediated toxicity is largely due to the &#x02018;Trojan Horse&#x02019; mechanism which describes how the internalisation of ZnO NM leads to rapid dissolution of ZnO NM to highly reactive Zn<sup>2+</sup> in the low pH of the phagolysosome (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Sabella et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, an increase in the rate of ZnO NM uptake can account for the more rapid onset of cell death observed in response to ZnO-HPL compared to ZnO-FBS.</p><p>The results of our nanotoxicity testing demonstrate how differences in cell culture set-up can have a fundamental impact on NM hazard assessment with implications for the interpretation of results both within specific assay and across a tiered testing strategy. Therefore, we consider it possible to remove and replace animal derived products from the inhalation IATA while acknowledging that the switch may greatly affect both cell growth a phenotype as well the results of toxicity assays which will need to be carefully considered when interpreting the results of both acellular and cellular toxicity assays in comparison to previously generated hazard data. Further work needs to be done to investigate in detail the impact of HPL as a protein source on cell growth and behaviour and the nano-bio interface. A better understanding of how changes in medium composition may affect the interpretation of specific NM hazard but also importantly <italic>in vitro</italic> assay predictability of human hazard will be fundamental to promote the adoption of NAMs to replace <italic>in vivo</italic> models for understanding risk.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s5"><title>Data availability statement</title><p>The datasets presented in this study can be found in online repositories.
