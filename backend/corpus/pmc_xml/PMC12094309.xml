This study explored nursing students' experiences in using objective structured video examination (OSVE) and role-play to develop essential psychiatric nursing competencies. A qualitative approach was used, gathering data through focus group discussions and individual interviews with students in a psychiatric nursing course. Various themes emerged, highlighting the advantages and limitations of each teaching method. OSVE offered structured scenarios that improved clinical reasoning and self-assessment, while role-play encouraged real-time interactions and adaptive thinking. Students found that OSVE helped them connect theoretical knowledge to practical applications by allowing them to observe and analyze model behaviors in different psychiatric situations. On the other hand, role-play promoted deeper engagement through realistic patient interactions, boosting confidence and emotional readiness. However, students also faced challenges like performance anxiety during role-play and the need for guidance in OSVE sessions. This study emphasizes the complementary nature of OSVE and role-play in enhancing psychiatric nursing competencies and suggests integrating both methods for comprehensive skill development. The findings offer valuable insights for educators to enhance teaching strategies in psychiatric nursing education, aligning with evidence-based practices to meet student learning needs.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Psychiatric nursing education</kwd><kwd>objective structured video examination (OSVE)</kwd><kwd>role-play</kwd><kwd>nursing competencies</kwd><kwd>lived experiences</kwd><kwd>skills acquisition</kwd><kwd>qualitative study</kwd><kwd>student perceptions</kwd><kwd>clinical reasoning</kwd><kwd>and psychiatric nursing skills</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="S1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Integrating simulation-based education, such as objective structured clinical examinations (OSCE) and role-play, is essential in training psychiatric nursing students to bridge the gap between theory and practice. These methods enhance students' clinical competencies, especially in communication, empathy, and therapeutic interaction, which are crucial in psychiatric care.</p><p>Experiential learning techniques like objective structured video examinations (OSVE) and role-playing are integrated into psychiatric nursing education to prepare students for the dynamic nature of practice. OSVE uses video simulations to improve diagnostic reasoning and decision-making skills, while role-playing enhances empathy and communication abilities [<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>Psychiatric nursing education has been strengthened to meet the demands of modern healthcare by integrating experiential learning techniques, such as OSVE and role-playing, into the curriculum. Traditional teaching methods, which are primarily focused on theoretical instruction, often fail to adequately prepare students for the dynamic and interpersonal nature of psychiatric nursing practice. Consequently, innovative pedagogical strategies are adopted to enhance students&#x02019; clinical competencies, especially in areas like communication, empathy, and therapeutic interaction, which are essential in psychiatric care [<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>OSVE, which utilizes video simulations of clinical scenarios, enables nursing students to conduct structured reflection and critical analysis of psychiatric cases. This method has been shown to improve diagnostic reasoning, therapeutic communication, and decision-making skills, providing a risk-free environment where students can practice before engaging with real patients [<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Role-playing is another widely utilized technique in psychiatric nursing education that allows students to simulate real-life interactions, developing their empathy and interpersonal communication skills [<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Research indicates that role-playing can significantly enhance students' confidence, critical thinking, and problem-solving abilities in the psychiatric setting [<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>While the benefits of OSVE and role-playing are well documented, understanding students' perspectives on these methods in psychiatric nursing education is crucial for refining teaching approaches. Research shows that simulation-based education improves clinical reasoning, critical thinking, and decision-making skills in nursing students.</p><p>Moreover, the use of simulated patients and role-play helps bridge the theory-to-practice gap by allowing students to apply their knowledge in real-life scenarios. Various studies have endorsed this approach as a vital component of undergraduate nursing curricula, especially in mental health education [<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. A study by Labrague <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] found that nursing students who participated in simulation-based education demonstrated better clinical reasoning, critical thinking, and decision-making skills than those who received traditional classroom-based instruction [<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Furthermore, research has highlighted the benefits of integrating OSCE and role-play in psychiatric nursing education. A study by Poore <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] revealed that OSCE scenarios focusing on mental health assessment and intervention skills improved students' confidence and competence in managing psychiatric patients [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Similarly, a study by G&#x000f6;r&#x000fc;c&#x000fc;, T&#x000fc;rk, and Kara&#x000e7;am [<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] demonstrated that role-play with standardized patients (SPs) enhanced nursing students' communication skills, empathy, and therapeutic relationships with mental health clients. Exploring students' perspectives is vital for refining these educational approaches and ensuring they effectively prepare students for clinical practice. Simulation-based learning, including OSVE and role-playing, has been linked to improved self-efficacy and clinical competency across various domains of nursing practice [<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], yet specific studies focusing on psychiatric nursing are limited [<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>This qualitative study explored nursing students' perceptions of OSVE and role-play in acquiring essential psychiatric nursing skills. By understanding their experiences, the research aims to enhance the development of core competencies in psychiatric care and improve their application in nursing education.</p><sec id="S1_1"><title>Significance of the study</title><p>The significance of this research lies in bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical skills in psychiatric nursing. Understanding how students comprehend and encounter essential competencies in managing psychiatric symptoms can improve curricula and instructional approaches, leading to better patient outcomes and increased mental health awareness.</p><p>This investigation plays a vital role in enhancing nursing education and psychiatric care by examining how undergraduate students comprehend and encounter the instruction of essential competencies related to managing psychiatric symptoms, including hallucinations, delusions, suicidal ideation, aggression, and anxiety. The results can aid in improving curricula and instructional approaches, better equipping nurses to navigate the intricacies of psychiatric care. By enhancing symptom management abilities, the study contributes to improved patient safety, increased mental health awareness, reduced stigmatization, and patient-centered care. Its broader influence extends to healthcare quality, fostering improved patient outcomes and encouraging ongoing research and professional growth in psychiatric nursing.</p></sec><sec id="S1_2"><title>Conceptual framework</title><sec id="S1_2_1"><title>Integration of Benner's novice to expert theory and constructivism</title><p>This study combines Benner's novice to expert theory and constructivism to provide a comprehensive conceptual framework for understanding nursing education. Benner's theory outlines the progression from novice to expert in nursing, emphasizing experiential learning and mentorship [<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Constructivism highlights the active role of nursing students in constructing knowledge through their educational experiences. Simultaneously, constructivism serves as a foundational perspective that underscores the active role of nursing students in constructing knowledge and understanding through their educational experiences [<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In this framework, nursing students engage in clinical contexts, simulations, and collaborative interactions with peers and instructors. They reflect on these experiences, integrate new knowledge, and adapt their approaches to symptom management, aligning with constructivist principles [<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>By integrating these theories, the study explored how nursing students develop competencies in symptom management, particularly in psychiatric nursing, considering their educational experiences, progression, and professional development. This dual framework offers a holistic perspective on nursing students' journey from novice to expert and the active construction of knowledge in their educational experiences. This integrated framework aligns the progressive development of nursing competence with active knowledge construction, providing a holistic perspective for the study's exploration of nursing students' experiences in psychiatric symptom management.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S1_3"><title>Aim of the study</title><p>This study explored students' experiences in psychiatric nursing using OSVE and role-play as learning methods.

All students participated in the study's eight competency-based sessions under uniform guidelines. OSVE sessions were crafted to bolster students' capabilities in diagnosing and assessing psychiatric patients. These sessions incorporated pre-recorded video scenarios, either sourced from platforms such as YouTube or produced by the course instructors. The latter involved instructors portraying simulated patients exhibiting various psychiatric conditions, including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and personality disorders. Each OSVE scenario, meticulously designed to mirror authentic clinical interactions, spanned approximately 20&#x02013;25 minutes.</p><p>After viewing the OSVE scenarios, students engaged in a structured series of analytical and reflective enquiries. These encompassed identifying patient symptoms, formulating nursing diagnoses based on assessment, and conducting a mental status examination to evaluate the patient's condition. The mental status examination scrutinized objective (e.g., patient's general appearance and behavior) and subjective data (e.g., delusions, mood, and cognitive functioning). These discussions connected the observed clinical presentations and theoretical knowledge, fostering a comprehensive understanding of psychiatric assessments.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Combined benefits of role-play and OSVE for psychiatric nursing competency development</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JMedLife-18-364-g002" position="float"/></fig><p>This study utilized two interactive pedagogical approaches: OSVE and role-play.</p></sec><sec id="S2_5"><title>Role-play sessions</title><p>Role-playing activities offered students practical experience cultivating vital competencies such as therapeutic communication, history-taking, and symptom management.

This educational approach enhances knowledge, fosters a more profound understanding, and promotes respect for mental healthcare.Krumwiede [<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] highlighted that simulation in nursing education improves students' clinical skills and knowledge retention, leading to increased confidence and enthusiasm in their abilities. McCaughey &#x00026; Traynor [<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] emphasized that simulation-based learning in psychiatric nursing enhances students' understanding of mental health conditions and therapeutic communication skills. Ferr <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] also observed a positive shift in nursing students' attitudes towards mental health, moving from fear and stigma to empathy and admiration. Hands-on experiences with patients during simulations, as noted by Alrashidi <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], help students develop a more empathetic approach to care. Akbari <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] reported that simulation experiences in psychiatric settings inspire students to pursue careers in mental health fields, recognizing the impact they can have. Khalil, Hantira, and Alnajjar [<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] found positive simulation experiences could increase undergraduate students' interest in psychiatric nursing careers. However, B&#x000f8; <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] raised concerns about the cost-effectiveness of simulation-based education and questioned whether the benefits justify the expenses. Kim <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] found that while simulation is beneficial, its long-term impact on skill and knowledge retention might not be significantly higher than traditional teaching methods. Some students, as highlighted by Abdalrahim [<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], may not respond well to simulation-based learning and may experience increased anxiety and stress. Similarly, Jallad [<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] noted that the effectiveness of a simulation could vary based on the quality of scenarios and facilitation provided.</p><p>The second theme, <italic>learning challenges in video simulations and role-play</italic>, delves into the challenges students face, particularly with the language used in video simulations and role-plays. It underscores the significant impact of these barriers on their learning journey and emphasizes the need for adaptations to improve learning outcomes. Students often encounter apprehension and uncertainty when interacting with psychiatric patients, compounded by language barriers in video simulations. Many participants struggled with understanding accents, had poor audio quality, and lacked resources in their native Arabic language. This language complexity impeded their comprehension and retention of information, especially since English was not their first language.</p><p>One participant mentioned, &#x0201c;<italic>The language barrier, as English is not my first language, made it difficult to understand certain words or phrases</italic>&#x0201d; (P1).</p><p>The rapid delivery of content in video simulations posed another significant challenge. Participants expressed the need for more time and repetition to grasp the material.</p><p>One participant suggested, &#x0201c;<italic>The competencies should be delivered more through increasing the number of videos and extending the time for OSVE or replaying the video to capture the information</italic>&#x0201d; (P4).</p><p>Even when language was not a barrier, students found multiple viewings beneficial in understanding the complexity of the content.</p><p>One student stated, &#x0201c;<italic>Language was not a barrier; however, watching the video multiple times proved more beneficial</italic>&#x0201d; (P6).</p><p>Recognizing the challenges students face in video simulations is essential for optimizing teaching methods in psychiatric nursing. Language barriers are prevalent, highlighting the need for inclusivity in educational resources. Bandura&#x02019;s Social Learning Theory [<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] suggests that learning occurs through observation, imitation, and modeling, emphasizing the importance of clear language and simulation content for students' learning and performance in real-life scenarios.</p><p>The third theme, <italic>advantages of videos and role-play simulations</italic>, highlighted the significant benefits of using videos and role-play simulations in psychiatric nursing education. Participants emphasized that these tools greatly improved their understanding, competence, and confidence in dealing with mental health conditions.</p><sec id="S4_1"><title>Fostering empathy and enhancing communication</title><p>The role of empathy in psychiatric nursing is crucial, as noted by the participants. Simulations were seen as instrumental in fostering empathy by allowing students to view scenarios from the patient's perspective.</p><p>One student shared a poignant experience: "<italic>A specific moment highlighted the importance of effective communication, empathy, and cultural competence in psychiatric nursing practice. I learned about the pivotal role of communication in patient care through a therapeutic communication video simulation</italic>." This underscores the idea that empathy can be developed through experiential learning and reflection [<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="S4_2"><title>Enhancing communication skills</title><p>Simulated patient roles provided a valuable platform for practicing and refining communication strategies. After applying these strategies in practice, participants reported significant improvements in their patient interactions. For example, one student mentioned how a video simulation helped them learn from YouTube and apply those skills effectively in a real hospital setting [<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].</p><p>The advantages of video and role-play simulations in psychiatric nursing education are diverse and contribute to the holistic development of nursing students. These tools align with experiential learning theories, emphasizing the importance of concrete experiences and reflective observation in learning [<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Students undergo a transformative learning journey by engaging in simulations, developing empathy, and refining their communication skills essential in psychiatric nursing.</p><p>Simulations offer a safe environment for students to practice and learn from mistakes without real-world consequences, enhancing their professional identity and readiness for clinical practice. This aligns with Bandura's Social Learning Theory [<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], which suggests that learning occurs through observation, imitation, and modeling. Students can build the skills and confidence to handle clinical situations effectively through simulated scenarios.</p><p>Consistent feedback from instructors and peers supports the development of communication and therapeutic skills, fostering continuous improvement and competence in psychiatric nursing. This iterative process of practice and feedback is crucial for building the confidence and skills necessary to deliver high-quality patient care.</p><p>Contrasting structured and active learning approaches, the distinction between OSCE/OSVE and role-play simulations in psychiatric nursing education highlights the unique advantages of both approaches. OSCEs and OSVEs provide a structured framework that ensures standardized assessment and development of critical clinical competencies. This approach is particularly beneficial for enhancing observational skills, applying theoretical knowledge in a controlled environment, and fostering a comprehensive understanding of patient care practices. In contrast, role-play simulations offer a more flexible and dynamic learning environment that emphasizes active engagement and hands-on experiences. This approach allows students to immerse themselves in the patient's world, fostering empathy and a deeper understanding of psychiatric symptoms' emotional and psychological impacts. The active preparation required for role-play simulations ensures that students fully engage in learning, leading to a personalized and impactful educational experience. Both approaches are complementary and provide a well-rounded educational experience for nursing students. While OSCEs and OSVEs offer the necessary structure and standardization for developing essential clinical skills, role-play simulations provide the flexibility and immersion required to foster empathy and active learning. These methods equip nursing students with the comprehensive skills and insights required for effective psychiatric care. Integrating OSVEs and role-play simulations in psychiatric nursing education offers a multifaceted approach that significantly enhances students' readiness for clinical practice. Participants emphasized that combining these simulation methods equips them with the practical skills, knowledge, and confidence necessary to provide high-quality care to patients with mental health concerns.</p><p>One participant highlighted, &#x0201c;<italic>The integration of simulation methods has significantly enhanced my preparedness to handle real-world situations in psychiatric nursing. These experiences have not only provided me with practical skills and knowledge but have also instilled confidence in my ability to deliver high-quality care to patients with mental health concerns</italic>."</p><p>This finding is consistent with Cort&#x000e9;s-Rodr&#x000ed;guez <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], who suggested that combining different simulation methods can bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical applications, enhancing clinical competence and confidence. Participants noted that using both OSVEs and role-play simulations helped them understand psychiatric illnesses better.</p><p>One student shared, "<italic>The first role-play was challenging because it was my first encounter with the patient. The video helped me grasp the symptoms and management strategies, making the role-play more meaningful</italic>."</p><p>Mitra and Fluyau [<xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] support this idea, stating that integrating visual learning tools with interactive simulations deepens students' understanding of psychiatric symptoms and response strategies. The combination of video simulations and role-play was found to reinforce learning experiences.</p><p>A participant mentioned, "<italic>By combining these methods, I can benefit from visual learning through video simulations and engage in practical scenarios through role-play with simulated patients. This dual approach allows me to apply theoretical knowledge in realistic situations, enhancing my understanding of psychiatric nursing concepts</italic>."</p><p>Qu <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] also agree, stating that a dual-method approach caters to different learning styles, improving cognitive retention and application of knowledge in clinical settings. However, Gkintoni <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] caution that combining different simulation methods may overwhelm some students, suggesting a phased integration approach to ensure thorough understanding before incorporating multiple methods.</p><p>Although the research was conducted in Saudi Arabia and the population's mother tongue is Arabic, the fundamental skills addressed, including therapeutic communication and empathy, have universal significance. The scenarios can be adjusted to incorporate local cultural subtleties and patient characteristics to implement this approach in different environments. The global applicability of this technique can be further improved by rendering OSVE materials in local languages and ensuring that they align with regional linguistic and societal standards [<xref rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].</p><p>Using OSVE and role-play as pedagogical tools provides a robust framework for bridging theory and practice in psychiatric nursing education. OSVE, with its pre-recorded or instructor-created video scenarios, allowed students to explore diagnostic features of psychiatric disorders in a structured and reflective manner. The guided questions following each scenario&#x02014;focused on symptoms, nursing diagnoses, and mental status examinations&#x02014;ensured that students developed critical assessment skills while connecting theoretical concepts with clinical realities. The introduction of a variety of diagnostic scenarios, encompassing different stages of psychiatric disorders, significantly deepened students' comprehension of symptomatology and nursing interventions.</p><p>Furthermore, the role-play sessions complemented the observational learning in OSVE by providing an interactive environment for students to practice and refine essential skills such as therapeutic communication and crisis management. Role-play activities enhanced the OSVE experience by allowing students to actively practice therapeutic communication and navigate intricate psychiatric symptoms. Using structured rubrics guarantees that evaluations are objective and consistent with course competencies. Instructors are crucial in supervising OSVE and role-play sessions, ensuring scenario standardization and offering constructive feedback to enhance skills.</p><p>These pedagogical approaches equip students to manage complex psychiatric cases and consider cultural and clinical diversity, rendering the outcomes applicable across various educational and healthcare environments. Future investigations could focus on integrating personality assessments of participants to mitigate subjectivity in response evaluations and yield more profound insights into the educational experience.</p><p>In conclusion, integrating OSVEs and role-play simulations offers a robust framework for psychiatric nursing education, providing students with a deeper understanding and practical skills for clinical practice. Careful implementation and phased integration can prevent cognitive overload, allowing students to benefit fully from the combined approach. These insights emphasize the essential role of simulations in preparing nursing students for psychiatric care challenges and nurturing empathetic, confident, and effective healthcare providers. They also suggest a pathway for developing educational tools that cater to students' diverse linguistic backgrounds, enhancing their learning experiences and competencies in psychiatric nursing.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="S5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Integrating role-play and OSVEs in psychiatric nursing education offers a comprehensive and multifaceted approach to learning.
