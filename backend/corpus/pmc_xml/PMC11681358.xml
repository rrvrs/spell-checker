Given its often-paroxysmal nature, screening at a single time point, using a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) or a Holter monitor, has limited benefit. The AliveCor KardiaMobile device is a validated ECG recorder that can be used for patient-directed arrhythmia diagnosis and symptom&#x02013;rhythm correlation. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether using the KardiaMobile device could reduce the time-to-diagnosis, for AF as well as other arrhythmias. We hypothesized that providing patients with a KardiaMobile device during their waiting period for specialist care could reduce the length of time that passes before ECG detection of arrhythmia.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either standard monitoring (ECG and a Holter monitor) or enhanced monitoring (ECG, a Holter monitor, and a KardiaMobile device). Patients were instructed to upload ECG recordings if they had cardiac symptoms, so that symptom&#x02013;rhythm correlation could be achieved. The primary outcome was the time-to-diagnosis for AF. The secondary endpoint was the time-to-diagnosis for any arrhythmias.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>From October 2018 to October 2022, a total of 69 patients were enrolled, and they were followed up to 12 months. Overall, 6 of the 7 patients diagnosed with AF were in the enhanced-monitoring group (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;= 0.106).

Participants were then recruited, based on either the referral from a physician in the community or assessment by coordinators based at the clinic. In cases of physician referral, patients referred for palpitations or other symptoms of a potential arrhythmia also were asked about participating in the trial. If they were interested, their information was given to the coordinators, who then provided the potential participants with additional information. Coordinators also screened incoming patients who had not yet seen a cardiologist but who had received a referral to be provided with a Holter monitor, for symptoms corresponding to a potential arrhythmia. In some cases, cardiologists at the clinic referred patients to the study after completing a consultation that led to a diagnosis that could not have been obtained via other methods. From this process, a total of 381 patients were screened and assessed for eligibility. Participants who were interested and met the eligibility criteria then were sent requests to provide informed consent, and an appointment was arranged prior to their receipt of a Holter monitor. Although the study was powered for recruitment of 222 patients, achievement of this goal was hampered by a lack of continued funding for the study; as a result, only 72 patients were recruited.</p></sec><sec id="sec1.3"><title>Intervention</title><p id="p0030">Patients were randomized to receive either standard monitoring, which included use of a 12-lead ECG and a 24-hour Holter monitor, or enhanced monitoring, which included use of a 12-lead ECG, a 24-hour Holter monitor, and a KardiaMobile device. Randomization occurred in a 1:1 fashion, into either the standard-monitoring group or the enhanced-monitoring group, using a computer-generated program. Block randomization between the 2 arms was performed, using the online tool (&#x0201c;Create a blocked randomisation list&#x0201d; (Sealed Envelope) in blocks of 6. After a patient agreed to be randomized, their randomization was revealed via the software program, and the course of the next 6 months of their involvement in the trial was outlined for them. Patients who were randomized to the enhanced-monitoring group were provided with a KardiaMobile device, and an Android tablet (Samsung, San Jose, CA) if they did not have a compatible smartphone.</p></sec><sec id="sec1.4"><title>KardiaMobile device and data collection</title><p id="p0035">The KardiaMobile device used in the study is a small ECG device (dimensions: 8.2 x 3.2 x 0.35 cm; weight: 18 g) with which a user can collect diagnostic data by placing 2 fingers from each hand on the electrodes of the device. The KardiaMobile devices used in this study can connect with mobile devices, such as phones and tablets, through a wireless communication method, using ultrasonic audio; newer KardiaMobile devices utilize a Bluetooth connection. For data-collection purposes, devices were set to 30-second intervals allowing for a single-lead ECG to be transmitted from patient&#x02019;s phones directly to the institutional database. Patients were educated on how to use the KardiaMobile app on their mobile device and upload ECG recordings to the institutional database. Patients were provided with a deidentified e-mail address and Kardia account, allowing them to upload recordings via their patient identification number, with no personal information being attached to their uploaded recordings. Patients were told to take ECG recordings if they had any cardiac symptoms, so that symptom&#x02013;rhythm correlation could be achieved. The ECG recording is collected and analyzed on the smartphone, via the KardiaMobile algorithm, and it provides an initial classification of sinus rhythm, and an indication of possible AF, unclassified or unreadable. Upon receipt, the KardiaMobile ECG recordings were stored on a password-protected server, and printed for analysis. For all study patients, any recordings that were uploaded to the study team were further analyzed by a physician, regardless of the automated KardiaMobile device interpretation. Only physician-adjudicated KardiaMobile data were used in the data analysis. After analysis, KardiaMobile ECG recordings were scanned to the study team&#x02019;s server and put into the patient&#x02019;s chart, via the clinic&#x02019;s electronic medical record system.</p></sec><sec id="sec1.5"><title>Follow-up assessment</title><p id="p0040">Patients in both study arms received follow-up assessment by the study team, either to 12 months or until an arrhythmia was detected. If an arrhythmia was detected, patients received an expedited cardiology consultation. At the end of the study period, patients were evaluated again, and their chart was reviewed to see if they had received a new diagnosis during their involvement in the trial. Patients in the enhanced-monitoring arm were instructed to return their KardiaMobile device if they had not received a diagnosis during their involvement in the study. Determination of the duration of the remainder of the follow-up period, and decisions to initiate use of any relevant medication, was left to the discretion of the consulting cardiologist. Although patients received follow-up assessment for up to 12 months, the original trial design stipulated that patients would receive follow-up assessment for up to 6 months. This provision was modified during the trial, as some patients mentioned, at their 6-month follow-up assessment, that they had an upcoming Holter monitor reading or had not been taking readings regularly (for those in the enhanced-monitoring arm). For this reason, the follow-up period was extended to include up to 12 months of assessment, and it included a telephone and chart review. With use of this method, patients were not lost to follow-up.</p></sec><sec id="sec1.6"><title>Endpoints</title><p id="p0045">The primary endpoint of this study was the detection of AF, on a 12-lead ECG, a Holter monitor, or a KardiaMobile device.

Continuous variables were defined using the median and interquartile range. Binary and categorical variables were summarized using percentages. Statistical analyses were conducted using Prism (GraphPad Software, Boson, MA), and a significance level of 0.050 (&#x003b1;) was used to compare group characteristics, via Fisher&#x02019;s exact test, Kaplan&#x02013;Meier analysis, and the log-rank test.

Three participants were excluded from the final data analysis. For 2 of these patients, upon being randomized to receive the standard of care, they obtained a KardiaMobile device, outside the context of the study, and requested that they be allowed to send in transmissions of recordings. These patients eventually received a diagnosis through the study, but given that they were randomized to receive the standard of care but then bypassed study protocol and purchased a KardiaMobile device, they were excluded. The last patient was part of the enhanced-monitoring arm and was excluded, owing to previously having received a diagnosis of an arrhythmia, a point that was missed at the time of screening, owing to miscommunication with the patient.

For 5 of the 6 patients who received an AF diagnosis in the enhanced-monitoring arm, anticoagulation therapy was started within 2 weeks.

No patients were diagnosed with SVT in the standard-monitoring group (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;= 0.493). Symptomatic premature ventricular contractions and premature atrial contractions were diagnosed in 8 patients in the standard-monitoring group, and 11 patients in the enhanced-monitoring group (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;= 0.592).

We suspect this lack of significance is a result of the study being underpowered to detect such a difference&#x02014;our original power calculations suggested the need to recruit 222 patients, but we were unable to do so because of a lack of funding.</p><p id="p0080">The secondary outcome was time-to-diagnosis of any symptomatic arrhythmia. Here, we showed a significant improvement in time-to-diagnosis of any arrhythmia in patients who were randomized to the enhanced-monitoring arm, using Kaplan&#x02013;Meier analysis. This improvement resulted in more patients being given a definitive diagnosis in the enhanced-monitoring arm of the study (22, vs 11 patients using standard monitoring).</p><p id="p0085">In one instance, a patient was diagnosed with highly symptomatic SVT, and within 2 weeks underwent an SVT ablation after receiving expedited consultation. This example indicates that use of the KardiaMobile device during the waiting period to see a cardiologist may help in triaging patients, which could have a knock-on effect on healthcare utilization (eg, decreasing the number of emergency-room visits). In the enhanced-monitoring group, patients diagnosed with AF received rapid initation of anticoagulation therapy (on average, at 2 weeks after diagnosis), suggesting that use of the KardiaMobile device, during the waiting period for specialist care, could reduce the incidence of complications of AF, such as stroke.</p><p id="p0090">We also provide some evidence that Holter monitoring itself may not have great diagnostic utility prior to consultation with a cardiologist. The fact that most patients given a diagnosis in this arm received it either solely from the KardiaMobile device or from both the KardiaMobile device and the Holter monitor<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> provides support for utilizing the KardiaMobile device instead of a Holter monitor in certain circumstances. Rethinking regarding when a Holter monitor is utilized, and its replacement with a KardiaMobile device, may reduce not only the time-to-diagnosis but also the financial burden on the healthcare system, should such usage be financially efficient. Holter monitors often demonstrate a low diagnostic yield, and patients who are unable to receive a diagnosis are likely to seek out further healthcare services, either through emergency-room visits or future use of Holter monitors.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> Given that Holter monitoring has several known limitations, including the inaccessibility of the technology and the short duration of monitoring, which may be inadequate for patients with intermittent palpitations or symptoms, an alternative method for obtaining a diagnosis is desirable.</p><p id="p0095">This study certainly suggests that healthcare spending could be better allocated, to provide patients with ambulatory ECG monitors, such as the KardiaMobile device, instead of paying clinics to provide Holter monitoring, in some circumstances. In our jurisdiction (British Columbia, Canada), the cost of Holter monitoring is reimbursed at approximately $140 CAD, including scanning and reading, whereas the costs of KardiaMobile devices and interpretations of their tracings are not reimbursed. In addition, although the KardiaMobile-device automated interpretation algorithm has a high level of specificity (97%) and a reasonable level of sensitivity (88%) for AF, it is not designed to give suggestions regarding diagnosis of other arrhythmias.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> All KardiaMobile tracings for this study were adjudicated individually by a physician. In relation to decision-making regarding use of anticoagulation therapy, automated algorithms are not yet considered reliable enough, per guidelines and consensus statements, to make a diagnosis of AF. In addition, the diagnoses for the 13 patients with non-AF arrhythmias would not have been classified correctly by the automated algorithm. This finding underscores the importance of having supporting physician interpretation of these tracings. The current billing model may require a reassessment, given the diagnostic utility shown by this study and others utilizing this type of technology.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref></p><p id="p0100">Another point worthy of note is that provision of the KardiaMobile device may be especially useful in healthcare systems such as ours that have prolonged waiting periods for specialist care. In fact, this type of provision of diagnostic equipment imbues the waiting period with diagnostic utility, as opposed to it being wasted time. Empowering patients to help collect data leading to their diagnosis, during the waiting period, also is likely to reduce patient frustration with the length of the waiting period. The average time-to-diagnosis in the enhanced-monitoring arm was 64 days (for the 22 patients who received a diagnosis), with patients often being seen shortly after a diagnosis was made. This trajectory helps in managing resources and triage appropriately in an under-resourced system, such as the Canadian healthcare system.</p><p id="p0105">Even though we meant to utilize an intention-to-treat analysis, our final analysis excluded those patients who purchased a KardiaMobile device in response to being randomized to what they felt was the &#x0201c;wrong&#x0201d; arm (that is, the standard-monitoring arm). This process affected only 2 patients. Due to this exclusion, we utilized a modified intention-to-treat analysis. We acknowledge that this exclusion is an important limitation of our analysis, and alternative ways could have been used to deal with this situation.</p><p id="p0110">Although the shortened time-to-diagnosis with the enhanced monitoring shows promise for this technology, we do not have evidence that this reduction is associated with improved patient outcomes. Within the scale of this study, however, we could not expect to show improved clinical outcomes, such as in stroke rate (which may decrease with more timely diagnosis of AF), as such studies usually require thousands of patients, and even then, often have negative outcomes.<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> Instead, this study focuses more on how to use the inevitable waiting period to see a specialist most productively, particularly in the context of strained, publicly funded, healthcare systems.</p><p id="p0115">Additionally, although the results of the enhanced-monitoring arm suggest that it is superior to Holter monitoring, this study was designed specifically for those with undiagnosed symptomatic palpitations; therefore, the shortened time-to-diagnosis applies to only those with symptomatic arrhythmias. Patients with asymptomatic arrhythmias, or prevalent arrhythmias (ie, persistent AF), may have other indications for a Holter monitor for which the KardiaMobile device is not useful. In addition, the KardiaMobile device proves most useful in the early detection of arrhythmias, prior to a formal diagnosis being made. Once a diagnosis is confirmed, Holter monitoring may provide comprehensive details of the arrhythmia, allowing for strategies to be developed for adequate rate or rhythm control; the KardiaMobile device has inferior performance in this regard.</p><p id="p0120">One limitation of this technology lies in its accessibility, given that a smartphone or tablet, and savviness in using this technology, is required to utilize a KardiaMobile device. This lack of access is more applicable for the elderly population, which may have the most to gain from early AF detection and receipt of appropriate anticoagulation therapy. A limiting resource is physician interpretation of these data, and the potential to overwhelm healthcare workers with copious amounts of data. Some patients enrolled in this study could send up to 10 tracings a day, and although the time to analyze a KardiaMobile-device ECG usually is only 10-20 seconds, this volume puts a burden on the interpreter and may not involve the most efficient use of resources. From a practical standpoint, if the automated algorithm utilized to diagnose arrhythmias is improved in the future, the need for regular physician interpretation would be circumvented, at least part of the time. Additionally, medical staff can be trained to triage the KardiaMobile-device ECGs and recognize the most important ECGs for analysis, allowing physician interpretation to be utilized only when it is needed to make a final diagnosis. Lastly, recruitment for the study was hampered by a lack of continued funding, because of which the process was terminated early. Future work may yield more insightful findings, if the necessary number of participants can be recruited.</p><sec id="sec3.1"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="p0125">This study shows that in patients with palpitations who are referred to cardiology services in jurisdictions in which a long waiting period is expected, the provision of a KardiaMobile device during the waiting period decreases the time-to-diagnosis for causes of palpitations. We also showed that conventional Holter monitoring has a very limited diagnostic yield in comparison. Although these findings are limited, due to early termination of the study, the use of the KardiaMobile device for monitoring during the waiting period certainly helped our clinic triage patients more appropriately.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list id="cebib0010"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Lloyd-Jones</surname><given-names>D.M.</given-names></name><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>T.J.</given-names></name><name><surname>Leip</surname><given-names>E.P.</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Lifetime risk for development of atrial fibrillation</article-title><source>Circulation</source><volume>110</volume><year>2004</year><fpage>1042</fpage><lpage>1046</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">15313941</pub-id>
