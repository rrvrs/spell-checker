And its molecular mechanism was studied by immunofluorescence (IF) assay, western blot (WB) assay, siRNA transfection, protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assay. Finally, the in vivo antitumor assessments of CS-6 on colorectal cancer was validated through an transplant colorectal cancer model.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>CS-6 treatment significantly inhibited CRC SW620 and DLD1 cell viability and colony formation <italic>in vitro</italic>. Furthermore, CS-6 treatment-induced DNA damage and cell cycle arrest in SW620 and DLD1 cells. The western blot assay revealed that CS-6 treatment upregulated p62 expression. Knockdown of p62 in this study significantly alleviated CS-6-induced DNA damage and the downregulation of cyclin expression in SW620 and DLD1 cells. Additionally, the results indicated increased expression of microtubuleassociated protein I/II light chain 3II (LC3II) and reduced binding between B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl2) and beclin-1, suggesting that CS-6 treatment activated early-stage autophagy in CRC cells. However, inhibition of latestage autophagy and autophagy-related protein 5 (ATG5) with chloroquine and si-ATG5, respectively, further indicated that CS-6-induced autophagy defects led to p62 accumulation, exacerbated cell proliferation inhibition, and aggravated DNA damage. Intraperitoneal injection with CS-6 inhibited tumor growth in nude mice with colorectal cancer, and promoted the protein expression of phosphorylated H2A histone family member X (&#x003b3;H2AX), p62, phosphorylated Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated kinase (p-ATM) and LC3 I/II.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study suggests that CS-6 may exert its anti-tumor effects in CRC by inducing autophagy defects, resulting in p62 accumulation and DNA damage <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>gamabufotalin (CS-6)</kwd><kwd>colorectal cancer (CRC)</kwd><kwd>DNA damage</kwd><kwd>p62</kwd><kwd>autophagy</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001"><institution-wrap><institution>National Outstanding Youth Science Fund Project of National Natural Science Foundation of China

Common treatments for CRC encompass surgery, radiation therapy, targeted therapy, and chemotherapy (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Fan et al., 2021</xref>). In recent years, immunotherapies such as immune checkpoint inhibitors (e.g., PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors) and adoptive cell therapies (e.g., CAR-T) have emerged as promising strategies, particularly for microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair-deficient (dMMR) CRC subtypes. These therapies enhance anti-tumor immune responses by overcoming immune evasion mechanisms, offering durable clinical benefits in select patient populations. Additionally, alternative therapies, including natural products and Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)-derived compounds, are being explored for their potential to synergize with conventional treatments while minimizing toxicity (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Moraz&#x000e1;n-Fern&#x000e1;ndez et al., 2022</xref>; <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Zhu et al., 2024</xref>). Despite recent advancements in treating primary and metastatic CRC, the projected prognosis and mortality rates for 2023 do not indicate significant improvements in cure rates or the long-term survival of CRC patients (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Siegel et al., 2023</xref>). Furthermore, chemotherapy and radiotherapy medications can lead to various adverse side effects, including nervous system abnormalities (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Godlewski and Kmiec, 2020</xref>), gastrointestinal reactions (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Keum and Giovannucci, 2019</xref>), and myelosuppression (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2023</xref>), negatively impacting the quality of life of patients. An urgent requirement exists for the development of non-toxic, safe, and efficacious alternative drugs to treat colorectal cancer (CRC).</p><p>Long-lasting mutations occurring during DNA replication can cause DNA damage, influencing the genetic makeup of an individual (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Nastasi et al., 2020</xref>). Additionally, the failure to promptly repair DNA damage can result in cell death (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Ciechomska, 2018</xref>). Research has shown that uncontrolled mutations and disruptions in genomic stability may lead to tumor heterogeneity and polymorphism, potentially activating anti-tumor immune responses (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Gillman et al., 2021</xref>). This includes the mutation of key genes within tumor cells, stalling of the replication fork, and the induction of autophagy and apoptosis (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Sarmah et al., 2021</xref>). Autophagy and DNA damage repair are not two distinct processes in tumorigenesis, but rather perform many, overlapping, and complimentary activities. When damaged DNA cannot be repaired, overactive autophagy prevents tumor growth by inhibiting cell proliferation and death (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2023</xref>). Autophagy is a highly conserved physiological process in eukaryotic cells. It involves the engulfing of faulty proteins, damaged organelles, or other cytoplasmic components by a bilayer autophagosome, which subsequently combines with a lysosome to form an autophagolysosome, resulting in the degradation of its contents. However, excessive autophagy can lead to cell apoptosis and aging, ultimately inhibiting tumor formation (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2015</xref>). P62, a stress-responsive protein, exerts a regulatory role in several pathways linked to cancer development (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Tao et al., 2020</xref>). Moreover, p62 serves as a key regulator in several cancer types, such as breast cancer (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Qi et al., 2022</xref>) and liver cancer (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Duran et al., 2016</xref>), playing a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of various diseases. Furthermore, p62 exhibits dynamic associations with various pathways in case of severe DNA damage, associating with several DNA damage repair pathways, including homologous recombination repair, non-homologous recombination repair, and DNA damage response (DDR) pathways, activate autophagy to prevent tumor growth (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Filomeni et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Lyu et al., 2021</xref>) DNA damage foci and regulates DNA repair (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2022</xref>). Positioned as an adaptable protein between the autophagosome and its substrate, p62 is selectively wrapped into the autophagosome, acting as a bridge between microtubule-associated proteins I/II light chain 3II, commonly known as LC3, the protein that plays a significant role in cellular processes, particularly in autophagy and polyubiquitination proteins (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Kageyama et al., 2021</xref>). Subsequently, it undergoes degradation by proteolytic enzymes within the autophagolysosome.</p><p>Animals, plants, and microorganisms serve as abundant sources of natural products (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Naeem et al., 2022</xref>; <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Si et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2012</xref>). Naturally-derived compounds possess complex structures and a wide array of pharmacological activities, contributing significantly to the development of numerous chemotherapeutic drugs, such as vincristine (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Lien et al., 2021</xref>) and taxol (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Yang and Horwitz, 2017</xref>). Several animal-derived substances, including Cinobufagin (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Xiong et al., 2019</xref>) and Lytta vesicatoria (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Rauh et al., 2007</xref>), have exhibited potential anti-tumor properties. Among them, Gamabufotalin (CS-6) is a bufodienolactone comprising 1.76%&#x02013;4.97% of toad venom, a traditional Chinese medicine derived from dried toad skin and parotid venom (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Rauh et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Asrorov et al., 2023</xref>). Studies have unveiled the efficacy of CS-6 against various malignant tumors, including glioblastoma (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Yuan et al., 2019</xref>), non-small cell lung cancer (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Hou et al., 1997</xref>), and breast cancer (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Forde and Ettinger, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, the effects and underlying mechanisms of CS-6 on CRC are yet to be fully elucidated. There are currently studies reporting that the accumulation of p62 can cause autophagic flow blockage, thereby exacerbating DNA damage, but there are no reports on the mechanism of action of related drugs. Our research findings indicate that CS-6 concurrently induces DNA damage and p62 accumulation in CRC cells, thus triggering autophagy defect inducing cell death to mediate its anti-tumor activity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>2 Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>2.1 Cell culture and drug therapy</title><p>The human colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines, SW620 (ECACC identifier: 87051203) and DLD1 (ECACC identifier: 90102540) were obtained from the European Collection of Authenticated Cell Cultures (ECACC). These cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco&#x02019;s modified Eagle&#x02019;s medium (DMEM) from Sigma-Aldrich, USA, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco, USA) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Solarbio, Beijing, China). Cells were maintained in a humidified environment at 37&#x000b0;C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. The experimental compound, CS-6, was supplied by Shandong Luye Pharma LTD (Yantai, Shandong, China). CS-6 for experiments was prepared by dissolving it in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) obtained from MedChemExpress, USA. In some experiments aimed at inhibiting autophagic flux, cells were treated with 10&#x000a0;&#x000b5;M chloroquine (CQ) sourced from MedChemExpress, USA, for a duration of 24&#x000a0;h.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>2.2 Cell viability assay</title><p>To evaluate the short-term impact of CS-6 on cell growth, a Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) detection assay was executed (MedChemExpress). In this assay, cell suspensions were meticulously distributed into individual wells of a 96-well plate, with each well receiving 10&#x000a0;&#x003bc;L of the suspension. Subsequently, the plates were placed inside an incubator set to maintain a temperature of 37&#x000b0;C in an atmosphere containing 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Following cell incubation, 5&#x000a0;&#x000b5;L of the CCK solution was added to each well (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Asrorov et al., 2023</xref>), following standard protocols. The plates were once again incubated under the same conditions (37&#x000b0;C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>) for a duration of 1&#x02013;4&#x000a0;h. Finally, the absorbance at 450&#x000a0;nm was measured using an enzymatic marker, thereby enabling the assessment of cell growth in response to CS-6 treatment.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>2.3 Colony formation assay (CFA)</title><p>SW620 and DLD1 cells were initially seeded in 6-well plates at a density of 500 cells per well and subjected to culturing for 24&#x000a0;h. Once adherent, the cells underwent exposure to various concentrations of CS-6 (5, 10, 20, 40, 80, 160, 320, and 640&#x000a0;nM) for an additional 24&#x000a0;h, while untreated cells served as the Control group. Following this 24-h treatment period, the cells were subjected to incubation for an additional 12&#x000a0;days, during which colonies formed from both the treated and untreated cells. The assessment of these colonies involved initial fixation using a 4% paraformaldehyde solution (Beyotime, Shanghai) for 15 (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Teng et al., 2016</xref>), minutes, followed by washing with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Subsequently, the colonies were stained with a 0.1% crystal violet (Solarbio, Beijing, China) solution for 10&#x000a0;min. Lastly, the colonies were observed and photographed using an inverted microscope (Leica DMI3000B, Leica Microsystems CMS GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany), and the number of colonies with a diameter exceeding 0.5&#x000a0;mm was counted for further analysis. The number of colonies was manually counted using ImageJ.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>2.4 Cell cycle analysis</title><p>The process involved in preparing the cells for analysis is as follows: Firstly, the digested cells (Thermo Fisher, trypsin; catalog number 25200056) were centrifuged at 900&#x000a0;rpm for 3&#x000a0;min.

Meanwhile, the results of tumor volume changes indicate a significant statistical difference starting from the ninth day of administration. Considering whether the administered dose of CS-6 was toxic to mice <italic>in vivo</italic>, we also evaluated its effect on the body weight and internal organs of mice. We found that CS-6 treatment had no effect on the body weight of the mice (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8c</xref>). In particular, the relevant tests on the vital organs (liver and kidney) of the mice also showed no visible difference between the model and the administered groups, indicating that treatment with CS-6 at this dosage is nontoxic (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8d</xref>).

When DNA damage remains unaddressed, it can trigger programmed cell death mechanisms like apoptosis, autophagy, and necrosis. The role of autophagy in DNA damage includes the following aspects: autophagy reduces the spread of DNA damage by encapsulating and degrading damaged DNA fragments or abnormal proteins. This mechanism has been proven to maintain genomic stability and promote cancer cell survival in the treatment of colorectal cancer. In addition, autophagosomes can isolate damaged mitochondria and reduce DNA damage caused by mitochondrial dysfunction (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Hewitt et al., 2016</xref>). In addition, autophagy enhances the cell&#x02019;s ability to repair DNA damage by regulating the expression and activity of DNA repair enzymes such as DNA polymerase. Autophagy degradation products (such as amino acids and nucleotides) can provide essential materials for DNA repair and support the repair process by releasing energy (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Fern&#x000e1;ndez et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Nishida et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, the function of DDR pathway is a critical defense mechanism, identifying DNA damage and initializing DNA repair processes to preserve genomic integrity.</p><p>As can be seen from <xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>, we found that CS-6 could inhibit the tumor volume of colorectal carcinoma in nude mice without significant toxic effects, and the protein expression levels of &#x003b3;H2AX and p62 were also elevated <italic>in vivo</italic> after CS-6 treatment. To elucidate the mechanisms underlying the effects of CS-6 in CRC cells, a proteomics analysis was executed, suggesting a significant increase in p62 levels in CS-6-treated CRC cells. p62 is a stress-responsive protein that modulates the autophagic degradation process and nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. During the process of autophagy, p62 is selectively engulfed into autophagosomes and subsequently degraded by proteolytic enzymes, resulting in the reduced level of p62. Therefore, p62 level are inversely correlated with autophagic activity. Previous study found that nuclear targeting of p62 is required for increased DNA damage and growth inhibition mediated by RNF4 silencing (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Nishida et al., 2009</xref>). Our findings indicated that CS-6 could activate autophagy in CRC cells by disrupting the BECN1/BcL2 complex. However, the accumulation of p62 in CRC cells suggested that CS-6 treatment disrupted the autophagic flux in CRC cells (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). Studies have shown that p62 has been linked to DNA DSB repair. Defects in autophagy following DNA damage are associated with histone H2A ubiquitination. The cytoplasmic accumulation of p62 in autophagy-deficient cells impedes the recruitment of DNA repair proteins, including BRCA1, RAP 80, and Rad 51, to the DNA DSB binding sites, thus hindering DNA repair and exacerbating DNA damage (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Lv et al., 2022</xref>). Our results demonstrated that the combined treatment of CS-6 with CQ not only synergistically inhibited autophagic flux but also intensified DNA damage in CRC cells. Furthermore, the knockdown of ATG5, an autophagy-related protein, reduced DNA damage in CRC cells. These outcomes suggest that CQ amplifies DNA damage by promoting p62 accumulation, blocking late-stage autophagy exacerbates CS-6-induced DNA damage, and blocking autophagy suppresses CS-6-induced DNA damage. Consequently, CS-6-induced p62 accumulation can lead to severe DNA damage that remains unrepaired, further escalating DNA damage.</p><p>CS-6, the primary steroidal compound found in Chansu, exhibits substantial anti-tumor activity with minimal toxicity and side effects. It inhibits cell proliferation, induces apoptosis, and regulates immune responses in various cancer types (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Komatsu et al., 2007</xref>). Previous research has unveiled several roles of CS-6 in different cancers, including its inhibits IKK&#x003b2; phosphorylation by targeting ATP binding sites, thereby inhibiting NF-&#x003ba;B binding and p300 recruitment of COX-2 promoters, thereby strongly inhibiting COX-2 expression in lung cancer (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Lan et al., 2020</xref>). Its potential in glioblastoma treatment in combination with other drugs (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Yu et al., 2014</xref>). CS-6 could inhibited osteosarcoma cells viability and tumorigenesis capability by blocking the TGF-&#x003b2;PI3K/AKT signaling pathway (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Yuan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Ma et al., 2020</xref>), and its capacity to degrade c-Myc in multiple myeloma cells (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2017</xref>). However, studies investigating the underlying anti-cancer effects and mechanisms of CS-6 in CRC have been lacking. Our study demonstrates that CS-6 exerts a potent anti-tumor effect on SW620 and DLD1 cells by inducing DNA damage, causing autophagy defects, promoting p62 accumulation, and impeding the repair of DNA, thereby exacerbating DNA damage (<xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref>). In conclusion, our findings suggest that CS-6 holds significant anti-cancer potential in treating CRC and may serve as a promising therapeutic agent for managing this condition.</p><fig position="float" id="F9"><label>FIGURE 9</label><caption><p>Schematic representation of the anti-tumor effect of CS-6 in colorectal cancer.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fphar-16-1568339-g009" position="float"/></fig></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are grateful to the Medical Research Centre of Binzhou Medical University for providing large-scale instrumentation and equipment support.</p></ack><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s5"><title>Data availability statement</title><p>The datasets generated during and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.</p></sec><sec sec-type="ethics-statement" id="s6"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>Ethical approval was not required for the studies on humans in accordance with the local legislation and institutional requirements because only commercially available established cell lines were used.
