In &#x02018;Anaheim&#x02019; pepper plants PepGMV-Mo strain (Mo) causes systemic yellow foliar mosaic symptoms, while PepGMV-D strain (D) causes distortion of 1st&#x02013;6th expanding leaves, and asymptomatic infection of subsequently developing leaves, like other known &#x02018;recovery&#x02019; phenotypes. Infections established with DNA-A Mo and D components expressing red-shifted green fluorescent protein in place of coat protein and in situ hybridization, showed PepGMV-Mo localized to phloem and mesophyll cells, while -D was mesophyll restricted. Alignment of PepGMV-Mo and -D DNA-B components revealed three indels upstream of the BC1 gene that encodes the movement protein (MP). To determine if this non-coding region (*BC1) D-strain MP putative promoter contributed to &#x02018;recovery&#x02019;, plants were inoculated with chimeric DNA-B Mo/D components harboring reciprocally exchanged *BC1, and wild-type DNA-A Mo and D components. Symptoms were reminiscent but not identical to wild-type -Mo or -D infection, respectively, suggesting &#x02018;recovery&#x02019; cannot be attributed solely to the *BC1. Both BC1 and D*BC1 were targeted by post-transcriptional gene silencing; however, &#x02018;recovered&#x02019; leaves accumulated fewer transcripts and 21&#x02013;24 nt vsiRNAs. Thus, inefficient in planta movement of PepGMV-D is associated with a non-pepper-adapted &#x02018;defective&#x02019; BC1 that facilitates hyper-efficient PTGS, leading to BC1 transcript degradation that in turn limits virus spread, thereby recapitulating disease &#x02018;tolerance&#x02019;.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>begomovirus</kwd><kwd>host-plant resistance</kwd><kwd>post-transcriptional gene silencing</kwd><kwd>recovery phenotype</kwd><kwd>tissue tropism</kwd><kwd>transcriptional gene silencing</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>USDA Hatch project</funding-source></award-group><funding-statement>This research was funded as a component of a USDA Hatch project awarded to J.K.B.</funding-statement></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-viruses-17-00268"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Begomoviruses (genus, <italic toggle="yes">Begomovirus</italic>; family, <italic toggle="yes">Geminiviridae</italic>) [<xref rid="B1-viruses-17-00268" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] have a small, circular, single-stranded (ss) DNA genome, and infect many cultivated and uncultivated plant species (eudicots) in the tropics and subtropics. They are transmitted by the whitefly vector <italic toggle="yes">Bemisia tabaci</italic> (Genn.) cryptic species group [<xref rid="B2-viruses-17-00268" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-viruses-17-00268" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Bipartite begomoviruses have two genome components, referred to as the DNA-A and DNA-B components, respectively. The DNA-A component has one open reading frame in the sense orientation that encodes the coat protein gene (<italic toggle="yes">AV1</italic> or <italic toggle="yes">CP</italic>) and four overlapping open reading frames (ORFs) on the complementary sense DNA (<italic toggle="yes">AC1</italic> or <italic toggle="yes">Rep</italic>; <italic toggle="yes">AC2</italic> or <italic toggle="yes">Trap</italic>; <italic toggle="yes">AC3</italic> or <italic toggle="yes">REn</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">AC4</italic>) that encode proteins involved in replication of the viral genome, regulation of viral gene expression, and suppression of plant host defense pathways [<xref rid="B4-viruses-17-00268" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-viruses-17-00268" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-viruses-17-00268" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The DNA-B component encodes two ORFs, one on the viral (<italic toggle="yes">BV1</italic>) and complementary (<italic toggle="yes">BC1</italic>) sense strands, respectively [<xref rid="B7-viruses-17-00268" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-viruses-17-00268" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The BC1 or MP is required for viral DNA movement between the nucleus and cytoplasm [<xref rid="B9-viruses-17-00268" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-viruses-17-00268" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], while specific interactions between the BC1/MP and BV1/NSP mediate cell-to-cell movement [<xref rid="B10-viruses-17-00268" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-viruses-17-00268" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-viruses-17-00268" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-viruses-17-00268" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-viruses-17-00268" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-viruses-17-00268" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In addition, the BC1/MP interacts with a nuclear encoded 70 kDa chaperone at the cell periphery to mediate intercellular movement and chloroplast co-localization [<xref rid="B16-viruses-17-00268" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-viruses-17-00268" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>The bipartite <italic toggle="yes">Pepper golden mosaic virus</italic> (PepGMV) comprises a complex of three or more strains that infect pepper and tomato crops in Central America, Mexico, and the southwestern US, including Arizona and Texas [<xref rid="B18-viruses-17-00268" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-viruses-17-00268" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-viruses-17-00268" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-viruses-17-00268" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-viruses-17-00268" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The DNA-A and DNA-B component nucleotide sequences have been determined from infectious clones of PepGMV-Serrano (PepGMV-Ser), PepGMV-Mosaic (PepGMV-Mo), and PepGMV-Distortion (PepGMV-D), and the shared pairwise sequence identities among the three PepGMV components ranges from 91 to 96% for DNA-A and from 84 to 99% for DNA-B [<xref rid="B23-viruses-17-00268" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Anaheim pepper plants infected with PepGMV-Mo and PepGMV-Ser develop yellow&#x02013;green foliar mosaic and golden foliar mosaic symptoms, respectively, and both are transmissible by the whitefly vector. Symptoms associated with PepGMV-D consist of a mild foliar mosaic and distortion that develop on the inoculated and subsequently developing 4&#x02013;6 leaves, while subsequently developing leaves are symptom-free, and consistent with other previously reported symptom &#x02018;recovery&#x02019; phenotypes [<xref rid="B24-viruses-17-00268" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Although PepGMV-D viral DNA is detectable post-inoculation (PI) in the newly developing leaves by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification, the virus is not transmissible by the whitefly vector, except when in mixed infection with PepGMV-Mo. In contrast, PepGMV-Mo does not require PepGMV-D to infect pepper [<xref rid="B23-viruses-17-00268" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Infectivity studies with reciprocally reassorted DNA-A and &#x02013;B genomic components, e.g., heterologous DNA-A and -B components of PepGMV-Mo, PepGMV-Ser, and -D strains have shown that all wild-type and genomically reassorted combinations of the PepGMV DNA-A and DNA-B components are infectious in pepper, and that pepper plants infected when inoculated with the PepGMV-D cognate components or with heterologous combinations with the B component of -D strain, exhibit a &#x02018;recovery&#x02019; phenotype [<xref rid="B23-viruses-17-00268" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>Under natural conditions, other begomovirus&#x02013;host plant combinations are known to exhibit &#x02018;recovery&#x02019; from disease symptoms, a response that is manifest as the remission of symptoms or dramatically reduced symptom severity [<xref rid="B25-viruses-17-00268" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-viruses-17-00268" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27-viruses-17-00268" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Symptom recovery from a previously symptomatic infection has been associated with reduced virus accumulation resulting from gene silencing due either to post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) and/or transcriptional gene silencing (TGS) plant host defense mechanisms [<xref rid="B5-viruses-17-00268" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B28-viruses-17-00268" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B29-viruses-17-00268" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The intensity of viral-induced post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) can vary with different virus&#x02013;host plant combinations [<xref rid="B30-viruses-17-00268" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In the PepGMV study system, infected plants exhibiting &#x02018;recovery&#x02019; have also been associated with viral small interfering RNAs (vsiRNAs) accumulation in symptomatic and &#x02018;recovered&#x02019; pepper leaves [<xref rid="B31-viruses-17-00268" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B32-viruses-17-00268" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Further, silencing of PepGMV in infected pepper plants was shown to involve both post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) and transcriptional gene silencing (TGS), acting together with silencing directed toward PepGMV coding and non-coding regions of the genome [<xref rid="B32-viruses-17-00268" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The role of siRNAs in the plant growth and development is well documented, as is the role of vsiRNAs in the establishment of tolerance to virus infection, or a response considered to represent a state between full-blown disease or susceptibility, and resistance [<xref rid="B33-viruses-17-00268" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B34-viruses-17-00268" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Such host-virus interactions can readily lead to the accumulation of significant virus loads while resulting in minimal effects on plant growth, reproduction, and yield. In at least some instances, these effects have been attributed to reprogramming of gene expression and basal defense responses [<xref rid="B33-viruses-17-00268" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B35-viruses-17-00268" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="B36-viruses-17-00268" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Thus, understanding the specific mechanisms involved in establishing a state of tolerance is expected to be instrumental in guiding the development of virus-resistant crops [<xref rid="B34-viruses-17-00268" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="B37-viruses-17-00268" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p><p>For certain begomovirus&#x02013;host combinations, &#x02018;tissue tropisms&#x02019; have been shown to involve phloem-restricted or phloem- and/or mesophyll-restricted invasion, where identified <italic toggle="yes">cis</italic>-acting viral element(s) located upstream of the BV1-coding region, and <italic toggle="yes">trans</italic>-acting functions contributed by viral AC2 itself, are involved in transcriptional regulation, including for TGMV [<xref rid="B38-viruses-17-00268" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] and <italic toggle="yes">Cabbage leaf curl virus</italic> [<xref rid="B39-viruses-17-00268" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] the regulation of NSP expression. Based on evidence that NSP&#x02014;and virus coat protein (CP)&#x02014;interact with cellular proteins [<xref rid="B40-viruses-17-00268" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="B41-viruses-17-00268" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="B42-viruses-17-00268" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], it has been proposed that AC2 binds dsDNA and that host factors act through a 50-nucleotide (nt) viral element to drive BV1 expression that in turn mediates viral movement [<xref rid="B43-viruses-17-00268" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Also, for certain bipartite begomoviruses, AC2 is essential for CP expression, by activation in mesophyll cells and de-repression of expression in vascular tissues [<xref rid="B38-viruses-17-00268" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="B42-viruses-17-00268" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="B44-viruses-17-00268" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Further, a bipartite 108 base pair (bp) regulatory element was shown to be essential for AC2-mediated activation of the BV1 promoter, indicating that AC2-mediated activation is a common regulatory circuit used by bipartite begomoviruses [<xref rid="B45-viruses-17-00268" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. In general, long-distance movement and invasion of plant viruses adheres to the route used for photo-assimilate translocation [<xref rid="B10-viruses-17-00268" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-viruses-17-00268" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-viruses-17-00268" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-viruses-17-00268" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-viruses-17-00268" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Typically, viruses move through cellular barriers including the bundle sheath, vascular parenchyma, and companion cells and then are loaded into the distal sieve elements. Distal sieve elements unload viruses into companion cells and inversely cell to cell into bundle sheath and mesophyll cells.</p><p>Among the different PepGMV strains, analysis of the DNA-B component sequences revealed nucleotide polymorphisms that resulted in predicted amino acid changes within the non-coding region, located approximately 300-nt upstream from the start codon of the BC1 ORF [<xref rid="B23-viruses-17-00268" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Hereafter, this non-coding region of the MP is referred to as the *BC1 region. Although all four PepGMV strains are capable of infecting &#x02018;Roma&#x02019; tomato, only the PepGMV-D strain does not cause full-blown, persistent symptoms in &#x02018;Anaheim&#x02019; pepper, which suggests that it is poorly adapted to pepper. This probably explains why it has only been found in co-infection with another PepGMV strain, e.g., Mo strain [<xref rid="B23-viruses-17-00268" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Differences in the MP-putative promoter region sequences led to the hypothesis that differential BC1 expression might be associated with impeded cell-to-cell movement of viral DNA and that the BC1 non-coding region, upstream of the region encoding the viral MP required for cell-to-cell movement and NSP-coordinated functions, could be associated with the characteristically distinct symptom phenotypes that develop in &#x02018;Anaheim&#x02019; pepper plants systemically infected with PepGMV-Mo and -D, respectively. The objective of this study was to probe the suspect role of the *BC1 non-coding region of PepGMV-Mo and -D strains in tissue tropism and the induction of PTGS/TGS that are herein hypothesized to lead to &#x02018;host recovery&#x02019;, exemplified by the susceptible and tolerant phenotypes observed in &#x02018;Anaheim&#x02019; pepper plants infected with the Mo and D strains of PePGMV, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-viruses-17-00268"><title>2.

Localization of the PepGMV Viral Genome in Pepper Seedlings</title><p>When wild-type PepGMV-Mo and -D strains were localized in pepper leaves using GFP expression (as coat protein replacements and DNA-A components) and tracked using confocal imaging to monitor viral movement, the GFP fluorescence revealed a robust signal indicating PepGMV-Mo presence, while an extremely faint signal was observed in PepGMV-D-infected plants, respectively. For the PepGMV-Mo-infected pepper seedlings fluorescence was visible in symptomatic tissues of both the inoculated and newly expanding (post-inoculation) leaves, and viral presence was documented in the phloem-adjacent cells and tissues (<xref rid="viruses-17-00268-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>A&#x02013;D) and in roots (<xref rid="viruses-17-00268-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>E). In contrast, the mock-inoculated pepper seedlings showed no fluorescence indicating absence of virus (<xref rid="viruses-17-00268-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>F).</p><p>Alternatively, the faint PepGMV-D GFP-associated fluorescence was observed primarily in phloem of symptomatic pepper leaves (<xref rid="viruses-17-00268-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>G), and signal was barely discernable or not detectable at all in leaves that either exhibited mild symptoms or were asymptomatic (<xref rid="viruses-17-00268-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>H,I). Also, fluorescence was observed in the inoculated leaves (<xref rid="viruses-17-00268-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>J) and in pepper plant roots, indicative of virus presence (<xref rid="viruses-17-00268-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>K).</p><p>The extent of virus localization was further analyzed in situ hybridization experiments with leaves detached from pepper plants inoculated as described above. The in situ hybridization results were highly consistent with the observations observed by confocal imaging, confirming that PepGMV-Mo was localized to the phloem and adjacent cells and tissues in symptomatic leaves (<xref rid="viruses-17-00268-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>A), whereas PepGMV-D appeared to have been capable of movement at least to some extent, into the recovered leaf (<xref rid="viruses-17-00268-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>I). Even so, the fluorescent signal was relatively weak, and movement appeared possibly to involve cells adjacent to the phloem, instead of the phloem itself (<xref rid="viruses-17-00268-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>B), suggesting phloem-loading may have been impaired. Thus, although both strains were able to move into the newly developed leaves, there was a striking difference in the intensity of the fluorescence and the hybridization signals, respectively, suggesting lower accumulation of PepGMV-D in leaves, compared to the more robust accumulation of PepGMV-Mo. These results indicated that PepGMV-Mo systemic (long-distance) movement occurred by way of the &#x02018;anticipated&#x02019; route of phloem assimilate translocation, or through phloem and the adjacent cells, whereas the movement-defective PepGMV-D spread was detectable in only the adjacent cells in &#x02018;recovered&#x02019; leaves. These observations may in part explain why PepGMV-D can be detected by PCR amplification in the asymptomatic &#x02018;recovered&#x02019; leaves, while at the same time, it is not whitefly transmissible [<xref rid="B22-viruses-17-00268" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. A hypothesis relevant to the latter observation is that PepGMV-D DNA does not efficiently access the terminally differentiated cells, the site in the plant host where replication is expected to occur. If so, replication occurs at extremely low levels, in turn, leading to reduced translation of viral proteins, in this scenario, the coat protein, which is essential for ssDNA encapsidation and virion production. Another possibility could be that replication, translation, and virion assembly occur, but that virion accumulation is so minimal that ingestion of virions by the whitefly vector is below the threshold required for vector-mediated acquisition, precluding virus transmission. Either hypothesis can explain another key observation that PepGMV-D is only transmitted by the whitefly when it occurs in mixed infection with PepGMV-Mo or other competent strains of PepGMV, effectively, rescuing the movement-impaired PepGMV-D strain, to effect vector-mediated transmission between &#x02018;Anaheim&#x02019; pepper plants. Such an impediment has not been observed for PepGMV-D infections of tomato plants, in which the D-strain is capable of causing full-blown systemic infection and is whitefly transmissible on its own, potentially indicative of the involvement of pepper-specific factor(s) that confer or are associated with &#x02018;tolerance&#x02019; in &#x02018;Anaheim&#x02019; pepper to PepGMV-D, and that when identified, will be of great interest.</p><p>Finally, the inability of PepGMV-D to incite full-blown systemic infection in tomato but not in pepper, suggests that PepGMV-D likely evolved initially as a tomato-infecting begomovirus, and post-emergence in pepper crops has undergone only the first steps required to complete the successful &#x02018;host shift&#x02019; to pepper. This unique study system offers an opportunity to probe mechanisms in play, in this &#x02018;host-shift&#x02019; scenario, with a plant host species/cultivar that is tolerant to PepGMV-D infection. This is despite its&#x02019; susceptibility to the other known PepGMV strains, which are apparently well adapted to &#x02018;Anaheim&#x02019; pepper, and have not acquired detrimental mutations in the DNA-B component upstream putative promoter region, as documented for PepGMV-D.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot4-viruses-17-00268"><title>3.4.

Finally, the siRNA&#x02013;host profiles showed that all &#x02018;recovered&#x02019; PepGMV-D pepper plants had signatures of both TGS and PTGS silencing.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec4-viruses-17-00268"><title>4. Discussion</title><p>PepGMV emerged as a begomoviral pathogen of tomato and/or pepper crops in Mexico and the southern U.S. during the mid-1990s. Multiple PepGMV strains were identified nearly simultaneously that shared high nucleotide sequence identity and yet caused different symptom in &#x02018;Anaheim&#x02019; pepper plants, compared to the indistinguishable leaf curling symptoms in infected tomato plants. The PepGMV-Mo was found to cause bright golden foliar mosaic symptoms in &#x02018;Anaheim&#x02019; pepper. In contrast, PepGMV-D, following its establishment in pepper plants by mechanical inoculation from an apparently mixed infection with PepGMV-Mo, was found to cause initial mild foliar mosaic symptoms, followed by progressively mild leaf &#x02018;distortion&#x02019;, and ultimately &#x02018;recovery&#x02019; of plants, manifest as the absence of symptoms in the newest expanding leaves 12&#x02013;14 days post-inoculation [<xref rid="B26-viruses-17-00268" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The genome of these closely related PepGMV strains, like other bipartite begomoviruses, encode two genomic components, referred to as DNA-A and DNA-B. All reciprocal combinations of the cloned infectious DNA-A and DNA-B components are capable of systemically infecting &#x02018;Anaheim&#x02019; pepper plants, and the respective divergent DNA-B components have been associated with strain-specific symptom phenotypes [<xref rid="B23-viruses-17-00268" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>In this study, &#x02018;Anaheim&#x02019; pepper plants inoculated with the wild-type PepGMV-D or PepGMV-Mo DNA-A and &#x02013;B components, respectively, when localized in planta by GFP-confocal microscopy and in situ hybridization, showed distinctively different patterns of association or capacity for &#x02018;movement&#x02019; in the vascular tissues of pepper plants. Specifically, movement of PepGMV-D was impaired in the vasculature of the inoculated and subsequently developing leaves, with virus restricted to the mesophyll cells, while PepGMV-Mo was observed in both mesophyll and phloem cells (<xref rid="viruses-17-00268-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref> and <xref rid="viruses-17-00268-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). This is consistent with the previously described symptom remission in pepper plants that resulted in a symptom phenotype reminiscent of disease &#x02018;tolerance&#x02019; observed for PepGMV-D-infected plants, and less-than-wild-type (Mo) accumulation of -D strain in pepper leaves that develop after the initial infection in inoculated and approximately the first six expanding leaves, post-inoculation. In contrast, PepGMV-Mo was highly mobile in leaves and capable of full-blown, systemic infection of pepper plants which developed characteristic golden mosaic symptoms in all leaves of infected plants and was reminiscent of symptoms observed in field-infected pepper plants. Southern blot analysis of infected leaf tissue revealed significantly lower DNA accumulation in PepGMV-D &#x02018;recovered&#x02019; leaf tissue, compared to all other leaf positions tested. In contrast, all leaves of pepper plants inoculated with PepGMV-Mo accumulated &#x02018;wild-type&#x02019; or stable levels of detectable virus DNA and showed no discernable changes in -Mo accumulation. These results are consistent with the results of previous studies that reported a positive correlation between viral DNA accumulation and symptom severity [<xref rid="B25-viruses-17-00268" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B30-viruses-17-00268" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B31-viruses-17-00268" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B55-viruses-17-00268" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. The results presented here further support the hypothesis that impaired viral movement in phloem of &#x02018;Anaheim&#x02019; pepper plants lead to gradually reduced viral DNA accumulation in leaves that develop above the point of PepGMV-D inoculation, leading to &#x02018;recovery&#x02019; or a tolerant phenotype in infected pepper plants. For bipartite begomoviruses, the BC1 and BV1 genes are responsible for intra- and intercellular movement of viral DNA, respectively [<xref rid="B10-viruses-17-00268" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], and both are encoded on the DNA-B component, and therefore, one or both could feasibly contribute to the strain-specific differences in symptom phenotype previously reported in &#x02018;Anaheim&#x02019; pepper plants infected with the PepGMV-Mo and -D strains [<xref rid="B19-viruses-17-00268" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B23-viruses-17-00268" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>The BC1 gene, or movement protein (MP), mediates virus cell-to-cell movement and long-distance movement through cooperative interaction with the nuclear shuttle protein BV1 [<xref rid="B17-viruses-17-00268" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The BC1 protein has been previously associated with distinct symptom phenotypes in virus-plant interactions [<xref rid="B56-viruses-17-00268" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Northern blot analysis showed higher levels of BC1 transcripts in leaves that developed post-PepGMV-Mo inoculation compared to those that developed post-PepGMV-D inoculation (<xref rid="viruses-17-00268-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>A), indicating that the -Mo BC1 protein is fully viable and capable of wild-type, cell-to-cell movement in &#x02018;Anaheim&#x02019; pepper plants. Sequence alignments of PepGMV-Mo and -D BC1 coding regions revealed no apparent, predicted differences that could be attributable to differences such as those observed in cell-to-cell movement by either MP or to differential viral loads reported in infected pepper plants. However, inspection of the sequences upstream of -Mo and -D BC1 coding regions revealed a divergent region of ~300 nt in length located 5&#x02032;-prime of the BC1 coding region. In other begomoviruses, coding regions and/or non-coding sequences upstream of the BV1 gene or BC1 gene identified as promoter regions, have been associated with specific symptom phenotypes and tissue tropisms [<xref rid="B39-viruses-17-00268" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="B57-viruses-17-00268" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. These observations provide support for the involvement of putative promoter regions of less-well-studied begomoviruses in the development of distinct phenotypes, such as those observed in PepGMV-Mo- and PepGMV-D-infected &#x02018;Anaheim&#x02019; pepper plants. The reciprocal exchange of the putative promoter regions (<xref rid="viruses-17-00268-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>) showed that strain-specific symptoms were reproducible for plants inoculated with chimeric virus harboring a 300 nt fragment of the putative MP promoter (*BC1). Mild symptoms, followed by &#x02018;host recovery&#x02019;, or a disease-tolerant phenotype, were observed in pepper plants inoculated with the -Mo chimera harboring the -D strain promoter, while plants inoculated with -D strain BC1 harboring the -Mo promoter, developed persistent golden mosaic symptoms and showed no evidence of tolerance to infection by the PepGMV-Mo strain (<xref rid="viruses-17-00268-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>Geminiviruses are known to be capable of inducing and suppressing plant host post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) [<xref rid="B28-viruses-17-00268" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B58-viruses-17-00268" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. In this and previously published studies designed to investigate PepGMV-&#x02018;Anaheim&#x02019; pepper interactions, both viral coding and non-coding regions of PepGMV harbor small RNA targets. The BC1 gene and its non-coding upstream (putative) promoter region have been shown to be highly targeted for degradation, leading to an accumulation of homologous small RNAs [<xref rid="B32-viruses-17-00268" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Irrespective of PepGMV strain or chimeric virus, the BC1 gene is silenced by homologous small RNAs, which would be expected to result in fewer MP transcripts and therefore less viral MP. In this scenario, abated cell-to-cell viral movement and systemic infection appear to be likely. This hypothesis is supported by previous studies of pepper host-PepGMV interactions, albeit involving heterologous (non-cognate) viral components [<xref rid="B21-viruses-17-00268" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], which have demonstrated that viral-derived siRNAs accumulated to different levels in symptomatic and &#x02018;recovered&#x02019; leaves [<xref rid="B31-viruses-17-00268" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B32-viruses-17-00268" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Similar but different results are reported here for the homologous, cognate components as well as chimeric-MP constructs of PepGMV-Mo and PepGMV-D (<xref rid="viruses-17-00268-f007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). Experiments further showed that although &#x02018;Anaheim&#x02019; pepper plants inoculated with the respective wild-type DNA-A and chimeric DNA-B component, exhibited symptoms similar to but did not identically phenocopy wild-type symptoms, suggestive of greater than anticipated complexity in PepGMV-Mo and -D MP promoter region&#x02013;host interactions.</p><p>The availability of the &#x02018;Anaheim&#x02019; pepper-PepGMV study system to investigate contrasting susceptibility-tolerance phenotypes has advanced knowledge about this pathosystem and has demonstrated that recovery, and therefore disease tolerance, to PepGMV-D strain is associated in part with the differential accumulation of small RNAs via PTGS of PepGMV-Mo and -D BC1 sequences. Specifically, wild-type -Mo and -D strains and reciprocally exchanged BC1 promoter/ORF chimeras were differentially targeted by the host gene silencing pathway. And inoculation of &#x02018;Anaheim&#x02019; pepper plants with cognate and chimeric-cognate PepGMV components yielded wild-type and similar &#x02018;recovery&#x02019; phenotype symptoms, respectively. Collectively, these observations are consistent with the robust targeting of BC1 transcripts by both the PTGS and TGS host plant gene silencing pathway, respectively. Finally, the reduced accumulation of -D MP compared to -Mo MP transcripts that resulted from the differential host gene silencing is posited to lead to restricted cell-to-cell and systemic movement of the -D strain in &#x02018;Anaheim&#x02019; pepper plants, increasing the susceptibility of the MP gene to silencing, and in turn, to less efficient replication over time due to its&#x02019; inability to access uninfected plant cells, compared to the unimpeded PepGMV-Mo host interactions.</p><p>Finally, these observations implicate potentially complex interactions involving the putative promoter region of the PepGMV-D MP which appears to be defective for competent interaction(s) with one or more putative transcription factors in &#x02018;Anaheim&#x02019; pepper plants, potentially revealing a &#x02018;hot spot&#x02019; to guide host transcription factor modification of pepper by gene editing, for example, to yield broad resistance to multiple pepper-infecting begomoviruses. Although still speculative, potentially, the binding of &#x02018;Anaheim&#x02019;-pepper-specific transcription factors to strain-specific, begomoviral <italic toggle="yes">cis</italic>-acting elements would be expected to differentially influence RNA polymerase II activity and its binding to sequences near the transcription start site required to initiate mRNA synthesis [<xref rid="B33-viruses-17-00268" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B35-viruses-17-00268" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="B36-viruses-17-00268" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="B59-viruses-17-00268" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>,<xref rid="B60-viruses-17-00268" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Studies to investigate the prospective differences in putative transcription factor(s) and their interactions with wild-type -Mo and mutant -D virus promoter regions in differentially susceptible host combinations tomato (susceptible: susceptible) and &#x02018;Anaheim&#x02019; pepper (susceptible: recovery) are expected to advance the understanding of how plant hosts respond differentially, with reference to the co-evolution of the ongoing &#x02018;arms race&#x02019; between host plant defenses and begomoviral invasion.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors acknowledge A.M.
