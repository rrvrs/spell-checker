However, its development in terms of implementation policy and practice has remained challenging for all stakeholders.

Consequently, one argument which is beginning to build is the need to focus on the idea of social recovery, a relatively new concept.

A key contributor to the expansion beyond this idea dates to a study in 1967 by the World Health Organisation (WHO) [<xref rid="pone.0324249.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Focusing on schizophrenia, the longitudinal findings highlighted a range of variations in outcomes for those living with mental illness. In other words, the focus of recovery was on the reduction of clinical symptoms and deficits which were impacting on the daily functioning of individuals. More specifically, only 25&#x02013;65% of participants experienced partial to full recovery [<xref rid="pone.0324249.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Consequently, it was one of the first studies to highlight the need to focus beyond medication when viewing an individual&#x02019;s recovery from mental illness. It was also one of the first indications that the biomedical paradigms efficacy was falling short of the desired outcomes in mental health.</p><p>A significant response to such findings was seen in the rise of the social movement of disaffected users of services in the 1980s [<xref rid="pone.0324249.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In 1988, Deegan [<xref rid="pone.0324249.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] provided an insight into her own recovery process, claiming that recovery could be built through constructing a new identity and sense of self [<xref rid="pone.0324249.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324249.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Individuals such as Deegan believed that recovery should be about overcoming the outcomes associated with being identified as a &#x02018;psychiatric patient&#x02019; [<xref rid="pone.0324249.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324249.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324249.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In other words, recovery should be about constructing an identity which was beyond their mental health diagnoses and the impact of this label on everyday life. Consequently, the concept of personal recovery was introduced to mental health discourse:</p><disp-quote><p>
<italic toggle="yes">&#x0201c;It is a way of living a satisfying, hopeful and contributing life, even with limitations caused by illness&#x0201d;</italic>
</p><p>[<xref rid="pone.0324249.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, p15]</p></disp-quote><p>Recovery has been conceptualised as an individualised journey taken by someone who is experiencing mental health challenges. It is subjective and unique, experienced by the individual [<xref rid="pone.0324249.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324249.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324249.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In response to the biomedical perspective, personal recovery provided a broader and more inclusive conceptualisation of what recovery should be for those using and providing services [<xref rid="pone.0324249.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. It provided the potential for hope and empowerment for those receiving services that they could live an independent and fulfilling life regardless of their diagnosis [<xref rid="pone.0324249.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324249.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324249.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. This interpretation of recovery became central to mental health services in the westernised world [<xref rid="pone.0324249.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324249.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324249.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>In terms of reflecting on the developments associated with recovery in mental health, there are multiple competing perspectives [<xref rid="pone.0324249.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324249.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324249.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Recovery is possible with or without a biomedical focus. It can involve becoming an employee, commencing an educational course, or being able to live independently. However, the key concern is whether recovery-orientated services have implemented the ethos of personal recovery into practice. Change is still necessary [<xref rid="pone.0324249.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324249.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0324249.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><sec id="sec002"><title>The evidence base for personal recovery</title><p>In response to these developments associated with conceptualising recovery, there has been a focus on developing the knowledge and evidence-base surrounding personal recovery [<xref rid="pone.0324249.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324249.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324249.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. A systematic review, combined with a modified narrative synthesis was undertaken in 2011 sought to identify the key themes necessary for promoting positive outcomes for personal recovery [<xref rid="pone.0324249.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. This led to the creation of the CHIME framework, <bold>C</bold>onnection, <bold>H</bold>ope, <bold>I</bold>dentity, <bold>M</bold>eaningful Role and <bold>E</bold>mpowerment [<xref rid="pone.0324249.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. There were 1100 papers considered and reviewed, with these five themes being central to a positive outcome for each individual on their recovery journey.</p><p>Although there have been important developments regarding building the evidence base for personal recovery, its translation into practice has remained inconsistent [<xref rid="pone.0324249.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324249.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324249.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324249.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0324249.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. One argument has been the lack of understanding of the recovery principles associated with a recovery-orientated approach [<xref rid="pone.0324249.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. A further reason claimed in the literature [<xref rid="pone.0324249.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] is the lack of resources and capacity in services to support partnerships between service users, families/carers, and service providers. A reoccurring argument seen in the literature for these barriers is the biomedical model&#x02019;s dominance within service culture [<xref rid="pone.0324249.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324249.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324249.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324249.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Neoliberalism and recovery</title><p>The need for governments to ensure cost effectiveness has also contributed to the reality of recovery-orientated services [<xref rid="pone.0324249.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The focus on the economic case for personal recovery supports a core argument within the literature regarding the impact of neoliberalism [<xref rid="pone.0324249.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0324249.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In the late twentieth century there has been a shift towards economic and political focus in the western world on &#x0201c;deregulation, efficiency and profit-making&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pone.0324249.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, p277]. Focusing on the philosophy of neoliberalism, it claims that market capitalism can lead to people being liberated from state control through <italic toggle="yes">&#x0201c;devolved power, individual responsibility and choice&#x0201d;</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0324249.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, p75].</p><p>A paradox has developed in relation to personal recovery [<xref rid="pone.0324249.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324249.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. This is seen in the promised individual freedoms attached to personal recovery being constrained in a system which offers unattainable ideas in relation to <italic toggle="yes">&#x0201c;free and rationale choice&#x0201d;</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0324249.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, p76]. Essentially, neoliberal agendas have contributed to recovery shifting towards individual responsibility and choice [<xref rid="pone.0324249.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324249.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0324249.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Subsequently, once an individual enters society, they are faced with many barriers to achieving fulfilment in their lives. These include housing, employment and poverty [<xref rid="pone.0324249.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324249.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324249.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Social and personal recovery</title><p>Social recovery has not received the same level of coverage or attention as personal recovery [<xref rid="pone.0324249.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324249.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324249.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. One reason for this is the overlap and misinterpreted understanding of social recovery when discussed alongside personal recovery [<xref rid="pone.0324249.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324249.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. There is also growing realisation that there is a need for more of a focus and understanding of the social factors which contribute to a positive recovery journey [<xref rid="pone.0324249.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324249.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324249.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In 2006, a paper explored the need for an understanding of &#x0201c;recovery in a social context&#x0201d; with a recognition that interpersonal and social processes are key considerations when mapping an individual&#x02019;s recovery journey [<xref rid="pone.0324249.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, p63].</p><p>In 2018, the first paper was published which argued for the place of social recovery when seeking to achieve positive outcomes in relation to personal recovery [<xref rid="pone.0324249.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Social recovery focuses on the collective culture within our society, identifying an individual&#x02019;s opportunity for connectedness and social capital. Social capital includes recovery capital. In terms of outcomes in relation to social recovery, an individual being an active and participating member of society, otherwise known as active citizenship, with a sense of belonging, are core tenets of this perspective [<xref rid="pone.0324249.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324249.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>Some parallels between social and personal recovery have led to the former being often overlooked [<xref rid="pone.0324249.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324249.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324249.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Social recovery is focused on the interactions people experience with their social world on their personal recovery journey. Subsequently, it also takes into consideration the interdependence of the relationships built within these everyday interactions [<xref rid="pone.0324249.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324249.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. It is in these relationships that opportunities for connectedness, social, and recovery capital can take place.

The review posed the question, &#x0201c;what are service users&#x02019; views on the recovery concept within mental health services?&#x0201d;. The focus of the review was to see if there had been a shift in service user&#x02019;s views of recovery since Deegan [<xref rid="pone.0324249.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and Anthony [<xref rid="pone.0324249.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] in the late twentieth century. A systematic, six-step approach was taken to the critical literature review [<xref rid="pone.0324249.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. This approach is a strategy which considers some important aspects of systematic approaches, but also includes elements of more traditional narrative reviews [<xref rid="pone.0324249.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].

This will include identifying lead papers which will be found through the process of selecting the most referenced paper from each study&#x02019;s reference list.</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>Stage 5: Collating, summarising and reporting results</title><p>A narrative report, underpinned by thematic analysis approaches will be used to report the results of this proposed scoping review [<xref rid="pone.0324249.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324249.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. In line with this type of review, no data synthesis will take place. Consequently, the focus will be on breadth of the evidence base for or against social recovery, rather than focus on issues of rigor, validity, and study quality [<xref rid="pone.0324249.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The authors will all participate in the collating, summarising, and reporting of the results. In terms of the searching process, the authors will first search each database individually, then there will be a joint search undertaken to cross-examine the results. If there are any disagreements between authors regarding the results, PRISMA&#x02019;s extension for scoping reviews (PRISMA-ScR) will be used to refocus the group and overcome such issues if they present during the process. Finally, the reviewers will seek to explore and capture the gaps evident within the literature relating to the concept of social recovery. The authors estimate that the review will be completed by January 2026.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>Ethics &#x00026; dissemination</title><p>This study is a scoping review. Consequently, it is not necessary to have ethical approval. The protocol will be stored on OSF Registries, where it will be freely accessible to anyone interested in this research. The results of the protocol will be used in peer-reviewed publications.</p></sec><sec id="sec014"><title>Patient &#x00026; public involvement</title><p>For this scoping review, there was no involvement from patients and/or public in the review process. However, one of the authors does have lived experience of services, which they will utilise when undertaking and completing the scoping review process. Furthermore, the authorship plan to share the initial findings with key perspectives within the lived experience field of research and practice. This will support the authorship in making sure the results of the review is informed and shaped by lived experience involvement beyond the authorship.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec015"><title>Discussion</title><p>Mental health recovery is a concept with many competing agendas in relation to how it should be understood, researched, and applied in practice [<xref rid="pone.0324249.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324249.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324249.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Personal recovery&#x02019;s ethos and value has been eroded away by a neoliberal political agenda seen across the westernised world [<xref rid="pone.0324249.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0324249.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The responsibility of recovery is viewed as that of those receiving services for their mental health [<xref rid="pone.0324249.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The continued focus on the individual, rather than the social structures influencing agency (government policy) to provide the appropriate conditions for recovery has remained a subordinated debate in current mental health discourse.</p><p>This scoping review seeks to explore the evidence-base of social recovery. This position on recovery seeks to focus beyond the individual, considering the social circumstances and processes necessary for successful recovery [<xref rid="pone.0324249.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. By identifying and exploring the evidence base, this can help inform all stakeholders on how social recovery could be implemented and integrated in service delivery. This has the potential to contribute to a new episteme regarding the concept of recovery.</p><p>This is possibly a strength of the overall review in terms of highlighting a gap in the mental health literature regarding recovery. Also, there are three authors of this review, resulting in an increased level of rigor in terms of devising, collating, analysing, and reporting the breath of evidence for social recovery. In terms of the limitations, all three authors have a pro-social recovery orientation due to their professional backgrounds, two are social workers, and the other, a peer support worker. To mitigate against this, the authors have and will take this into consideration when completing each stage of the scoping review. Another potential limitation of the study methodology is that inclusion and exclusion criteria may lead to relevant studies being omitted if for example, they do not include &#x02018;social recovery&#x02019; in their abstract or title. However, the authors will review the reference lists of papers to mitigate against this risk to this scoping review. Finally, given that social recovery is still a relatively new concept, the conclusions drawn from the review may not provide generalisations for the authors to make regarding the evidence-base for social recovery.</p><sec id="sec016"><title>Strengths and limitations of proposed review</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>This is a scoping review, therefore no quality assessment of the studies selected will be undertaken.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The scoping review planned will be comprehensive, including peer-reviewed and grey literature.</p></list-item><list-item><p>There are three researchers involved in this review.
