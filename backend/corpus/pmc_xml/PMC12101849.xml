</self-uri><abstract><p>The escalating obesity epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa is a pressing regional concern. Despite this, there is scarce evidence of effective strategies to halt its upward trend in the region. We have, therefore, synthesised evidence on effective interventions to prevent and manage obesity in sub-Saharan Africa. We searched Scopus, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library, Web of Science and Medline for pertinent studies for this review. Studies were eligible if they focused on a sub-Saharan African country and assessed obesity/overweight with objective outcome measures. We examined their methodological quality with the Joanna Briggs Institute and the National Institutes of Health appraisal checklists. Publication bias was assessed with funnel plots. A meta-analysis with a random-effects model was fitted to explore the pooled effect of identified obesity interventions on anthropometric obesity measures. The heterogeneity of the studies was assessed using the I-square statistic. Our search yielded seven eligible studies for this review. Their quality ranged from moderate to high. The interventions identified included aerobic and resistance exercises, micronutrient supplementation and physical education. The meta-analysis revealed that aerobic and resistance training could significantly reduce obesity by approximately 34% (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.04; 95%CI&#x02009;=&#x02009;-0.67 &#x02013; -0.02). However, they do not significantly reduce waist circumference (Effect size&#x02009;=&#x02009;-1.14; 95%CI&#x02009;=&#x02009;-0.67&#x02013;0.55; p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.19). Aerobic and resistance training exercises could be embedded in physical activity interventions to prevent and manage overweight and obesity in sub-Saharan Africa.

Since 1980, the obesity epidemic has increased exponentially, affecting about one-third of the world&#x02019;s population [<xref rid="pone.0323717.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. More worrying is the growing burden of obesity in Low-Income Countries (LICs), including countries in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), which used to experience a relatively lower prevalence of obesity [<xref rid="pone.0323717.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0323717.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], with the rates increasing in all ages and sexes [<xref rid="pone.0323717.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323717.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], and more prevalent in urban populations [<xref rid="pone.0323717.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323717.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. For example, a study on the epidemiology of overweight and obesity in SSA showed that the prevalence of overweight in the region increased by more than 14%, from 6.4% in 1990 to 21% in 2015. In addition to the increasing trend, the obesity epidemic has also contributed to health disparities in SSA, with most health facilities and resource-deprived countries experiencing the brunt of the condition [<xref rid="pone.0323717.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The rising levels of overweight and obesity in SSA are likely to exacerbate the burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) like Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and diabetes if effective strategies/interventions are not taken to mitigate the burden, given that they are risk factors for these NCDs [<xref rid="pone.0323717.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Interventions to address obesity vary widely, with different approaches focusing on lifestyle changes, such as dietary changes and physical activity engagements [<xref rid="pone.0323717.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However, the effectiveness of these interventions sometimes differs by population, given inherent characteristics such as socioeconomic diversities [<xref rid="pone.0323717.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. For example, a systematic review of obesity studies from Europe and the USA showed that combined diet and physical activity interventions do not influence the BMI of school-aged children [<xref rid="pone.0323717.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], but a similar study with a similar study population in China found reverse results [<xref rid="pone.0323717.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. This variation in findings demonstrates how the outcomes of similar interventions could differ for similar populations from different socioeconomic contexts, suggesting the need for context-informed obesity interventions to address the global obesity menace.</p><p>Sub-Saharan countries have similar socioeconomic characteristics; therefore, synthesised evidence of obesity interventions from the region could have broader implications [<xref rid="pone.0323717.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Current data on obesity interventions in SSA are mainly from primary studies [<xref rid="pone.0323717.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0323717.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], demonstrating literature scarcity on pooled evidence on effective obesity interventions [<xref rid="pone.0323717.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0323717.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] that could drive comprehensive obesity prevention and management strategies in SSA. Our study, therefore, addressed this gap by synthesizing the evidence on interventions to address obesity in SSA effectively. It specifically analysed obesity as the outcome, assessed with outcome measures like Body Mass Index (BMI), Waist Circumference (WC), and percentage (%) body fat.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><p>This review was guided by the PRISMA checklist (<xref rid="pone.0323717.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>) for reporting systematic reviews and meta-analyses.

It explored these interventions at all levels of engagement, including trial obesity/overweight interventions for large- or small-scale targeted populations and nationally or population/community-level obesity/overweight interventions. Accordingly, self-reported obesity interventions were excluded, given their tendencies to introduce biased findings as their authenticity may be unascertained/unconfirmed. Additionally, studies on clinical or surgical management of obesity were excluded as the review focused on public health interventions at a wider population level.</p><p>Comparator: No interventions or any measure of sedentary behaviour (e.g., no engagements in defined physical activities for a specified period) or dietary behaviours (e.g., any defined poor dietary habits, such as intake of highly caloric or sugar-sweetened foods for any measured period, like weekly, daily etc.</p><p>Outcomes: Outcomes included weight status, measured with objective obesity/overweight outcome measures, such as anthropometric and adiposity measures (e.g., BMI, WC and percentage body fat (% body fat)).

Authors or their relevant parent publications were contacted for any required data item that was missing in their studies.</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Risk of bias and quality assessment</title><p>We appraised the methodological quality of the included studies using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) appraisal checklists. The choice of these checklists was informed by a recent review examining the quality of quality appraisal tools [<xref rid="pone.0323717.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. We used specific JBI tools to appraise the quality of the RCTs and quasi-experimental studies, and the NIH tool for the quality assessment of the pre-test and post-test designs. On the JBI tool for the RCTs, studies that met&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;11 items on the tool were rated &#x02018;high quality&#x02019;, those meeting &#x02264;5 were rated &#x02018;low quality&#x02019;, and those from 6 to 10 were rated moderate quality. For the quasi-experimental study, studies with yes responses to &#x02265;7 items on the JBI tool were rated as &#x02018;high quality&#x02019;. Those &#x02264;4 were &#x02018;low quality&#x02019;, and those from 5 to 6 as &#x02018;moderate quality&#x02019;. On the NIH, studies with yes scores &#x02265;10 were &#x02018;high quality&#x02019;, those with &#x02264;5 were &#x02018;poor quality&#x02019;, and those from 6 to 9 were &#x02018;moderate quality&#x02019;. The risk of bias of the RCTs was assessed with the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomised trials (RoB 2), and that of the non-randomised studies was assessed with the Risk Of Bias In Non-randomised studies &#x02013; of Interventions, Version 2 (ROBINS-I V2) tool. For both tools, studies that recorded low risk in all domains of the tools were rated &#x02018;low risk of bias&#x02019;, those with some concerns in some of the domains were rated &#x02018;moderate risk of bias&#x02019;, while those with significant methodological problems, as observed in many of the domains were rated &#x02018;serious risk of bias&#x02019;.

After the narrative synthesis, a meta-analysis was conducted using SPSS version 26 to examine the pooled effect of the obesity interventions on weight status. We also conducted a sub-group analysis to examine the influence of interventions per defined obesity outcome measures. A random-effects model was fitted to estimate the range of effect sizes, given the possible variation in the treatment effects of the studies due to potential differences in their intervention and outcomes circumstances [<xref rid="pone.0323717.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323717.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].

The study population included school-aged children, college/university students and employees, corporate participants and church attendees. The total number of participants was 1,911, and more than half were female participants (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;1,101; 57.6%). Some of the female participants (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;160) were described as having obesity and another 40 had sedentary lifestyles.

The exercises were aerobics, with some studies describing it as walking and cycling exercises, and combined aerobic and resistance training exercises. The exercise interventions were delivered weekly, each lasting from 30 minutes to an hour. The duration of interventions ranged from six weeks to three years, with most of the studies having twelve weeks duration. None of the studies ended before the stipulated study duration. Interventions&#x02019; follow-up assessments were done at the end of the program, except for two studies that reported nine months and mid-program (duration not specified) follow-up assessments.

The publication bias is also shown in <xref rid="pone.0323717.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>. The methodological quality ranged from moderate to high across the used appraisal tools. The common methodological concerns in the RCTs were uncertainty on whether the participants were blind to their assigned groups (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;3), uncertainty (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;2) and no (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;2) blindness of the outcome assessors to participants group assignments, and no (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;1) and uncertainty (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;1) on whether those delivering the treatment were blind to treatment assignment. For the pre-test-post-test designs, there were concerns associated with unreported statistical power (external validity), unblinded outcome assessors to participants&#x02019; intervention&#x02019;s allocation, limited confidence in the accuracy of the measured outcomes, loss to follow-up (attrition) and not accounting for the loss-to-follow-up participants in the analysis. There was no identified methodological concern in the included quasi-experimental study. The studies recorded a low risk of bias on the RoB 2 and the ROBINS-I V2 tools, and there was also no publication bias as the funnel plot was symmetrical.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="pone.0323717.t002"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0323717.t002</object-id><label>Table 2</label><caption><title>Quality assessment results of the RCT studies using the JBI tool.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="pone.0323717.t002" id="pone.0323717.t002g" position="float"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="2">Criteria</th><th align="left" colspan="4" rowspan="1">Studies</th></tr><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Gradidge &#x00026; Golele (2018)</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Long et al (2022)</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Nono Nankam et al.

We identified and included seven relevant studies after a comprehensive literature search using multiple databases such as Cochrane Library, Web of Science and PsycINFO. All the relevant studies were from South Africa, highlighting a literature scarcity on effectiveness of obesity interventions studies from other SSA countries and demonstrating the need for such studies to ensure representative evidence on the research area in SSA. Notwithstanding, it is possible that obesity intervention studies from other SSA countries are contained in databases that are different from those included in this review.</p><p>We found out from the meta-analysis that aerobic and resistance training exercises could significantly reduce overweight/obesity by more than 30%. This finding was consistent with similar meta-analyses in the literature, which showed that aerobic and resistance exercises could reduce BMI, fat mass and %body fat among children and adolescents with overweight/obesity [<xref rid="pone.0323717.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323717.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Other meta-analyses demonstrate that aerobic exercises are central for exercise interventions aimed at reducing adiposity among the adult populations [<xref rid="pone.0323717.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]; however, combining it with resistance training could significantly optimise the impact of the exercise intervention [<xref rid="pone.0323717.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Accordingly, future exercise intervention prescriptions to address obesity in SSA could explore combined aerobic and resistance training, as this review and evidence from the literature support their effectiveness. We could not compare our findings to similar meta-analyses from SSA to generalise and draw a more reliable conclusion about the efficacy of combined aerobic and resistance training exercises to address obesity in SSA because of the scarcity of such evidence synthesis in the defined study area. However, our finding was confirmed in a comparable narrative review, which reported that physical activity interventions could prevent childhood obesity in Africa [<xref rid="pone.0323717.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].</p><p>We did not find any significant influence of the aerobic and resistance training on WC anthropometric measure. We could not also attribute the identified reduction in WC in the meta-analysis to the effect of the exercise intervention, given the inclusion of zero in the confidence interval. This attribution limitation could perhaps be stemming from the high heterogeneity among the studies included in that sub-group analysis, which varied in terms of participant demographics, intervention duration, and outcome measures, limiting this study from concluding on the effectiveness of aerobic and resistance training on WC [<xref rid="pone.0323717.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. However, given the documented evidence from similar meta-analysis in the literature, aerobic and resistance exercise could be explored by clinicians and policymakers as mitigating interventions to address overweight and obesity in SSA [<xref rid="pone.0323717.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323717.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. We could not also conclude on the effectiveness of the other identified obesity mitigating interventions: micronutrient supplementation and physical education because of their limited data in this review. More primary studies on these interventions in SSA may be necessary to provide synthesised evidence on their effectiveness in preventing and managing overweight/obesity in SSA.</p><p>Our study addressed the scarcity of research on effective interventions to manage obesity in SSA. Our findings, therefore, provide additional knowledge to direct intervention decisions to curb the obesity epidemic in the region. We did not identify publication bias, and the methodological quality of the included studies was moderate to high, potentially influencing the quality of this review. However, we are limited in generalising the implications of our findings to all countries in SSA, given that the included studies were all from South Africa. This limitation was, however, due to the observed unavailability of such studies from the other SSA countries in the current literature, emphasising the urgent research need for these studies in these countries. There were also high variations in the studies included in the sub-group analyses on WC, limiting conclusions on the effect of the interventions on WC. Further, the review focused on only public health interventions, excluding surgical and clinical interventions. This exclusion limits the scope of the review and the inferences of the findings for clinical/surgical obesity management. In using SPSS for the meta-analysis, we acknowledge that it may employ slightly different default estimation techniques from other software like STATA, which could lead to minor variations in results. However, we ensured that our methods aligned with established meta-analysis practices to allow replication of our findings.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec017"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Aerobic and resistance training exercises are correlated with reductions in overweight and obesity anthropometric measures. Combining these interventions in an exercise program could maximise their benefits in preventing and managing obesity. Therefore, health practitioners in SSA could explore the combination of these interventions in obesity management strategies. It is recommended that countries in SSA conduct country-specific research on effective obesity interventions to contribute to collaborative efforts at managing the obesity epidemic in the region.</p></sec><sec id="sec018" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material id="pone.0323717.s001" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>PRISMA checklist.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0323717.s001.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pone.0323717.s002" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>Databases search outcomes.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0323717.s002.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pone.0323717.s003" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S3 Table</label><caption><title>List of all identified studies from the literature search.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0323717.s003.xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pone.0323717.s004" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S4 Table</label><caption><title>Data extraction table.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0323717.s004.xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pone.0323717.s005" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S5 Table</label><caption><title>Risk of bias assessment results.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0323717.s005.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We acknowledge Isaac Owusu and Brunel University London for supporting this work.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0323717.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Farpour-Lambert</surname><given-names>NJ</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Baker</surname><given-names>JL</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Hassapidou</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Holm</surname><given-names>JC</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Nowicka</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name>, <name><surname>O&#x02019;Malley</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name>, <etal>et al</etal>. <article-title>Childhood obesity is a chronic disease demanding specific health care--a position statement from the childhood obesity task force (COTF) of the European Association for the Study of Obesity (EASO)</article-title>. <source>Obes Facts</source>. <year>2015</year>;<volume>8</volume>(<issue>5</issue>):<fpage>342</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>9</lpage>. <comment>doi: </comment><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1159/000441483</pub-id>
