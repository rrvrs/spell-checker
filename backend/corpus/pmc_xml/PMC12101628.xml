Destruction of epithelial tissue and proliferation of interstitial tissue are typical pathological features of IC/BPS, in which epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) may play an important role. Both the increased urination frequency observed in mice with acute cystitis induced by cyclophosphamide (CYP) and the disruption of the anti-leakage barrier in urothelial cells induced by LPS are associated with the occurrence of EMT. The expression of heparanase 1 (HPSE) and syndecan-2 (SDC-2) is up-regulated in the bladder mucosa of patients with IC, and both of them can promote the development of EMT. Improvement of lower urinary tract symptoms and restoration of the uroepithelial cell anti-leakage barrier in mice with CYP-induced cystitis after treatment with the HPSE inhibitor OGT2115 and inhibited the development of EMT. We then verified that HPSE binds to SDC-2 and that SDC-2 is a key intermediate protein in the pro-EMT role of HPSE, and that EMT was inhibited by knockdown of SDC-2. SDC-2 exerts its biological function by inhibiting the ubiquitinated degradation of TGF-&#x003b2;R1. Here we identified a novel mechanism by which the HPSE/ SDC-2 axis promotes EMT development and thus causes epithelial dysfunction and altered voiding behavior, providing a new direction for the treatment of IC/BPS.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>the National Natural Science Foundation of China </institution>

The prevalence of IC/BPS ranges from approximately 2.7% to 6.5%, with women being affected at a rate ten times higher than men [<xref rid="pone.0321730.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0321730.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The global prevalence of IC/BPS is approximately 300 per 100,000 women, with the prevalence among men being about 10%-20% of that in women [<xref rid="pone.0321730.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. When considering only the presence of symptoms suggestive of IC/BPS, the incidence rates for both men and women may increase by more than 10 times [<xref rid="pone.0321730.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Given the complexity and non-specificity of the clinical signs and symptoms of IC/BPS, and the lack of uniform diagnostic criteria in all regions of the world, the incidence of IC/BPS may be underestimated [<xref rid="pone.0321730.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Currently, the treatment of IC/BPS mainly focuses on controlling pain and relieving symptoms, and there is no effective and long-lasting treatment, which leads to uncertainty in the prognosis of IC/BPS.</p><p>In recent years, the function of the uroepithelium in IC/BPS has been gradually emphasized [<xref rid="pone.0321730.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0321730.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The role of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a standard epithelial pathological change in IC/BPS, has still not been clearly articulated [<xref rid="pone.0321730.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. EMT refers to transforming epithelial cells into cells with a mesenchymal phenotype through a specific program [<xref rid="pone.0321730.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. During this process, epithelial cells exhibit morphological and functional changes, including loss of cell polarity, cytoskeletal alterations, etc [<xref rid="pone.0321730.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. EMT plays a crucial role in developmental processes and is involved in tissue healing, organ fibrosis, and other processes [<xref rid="pone.0321730.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. These biological processes are associated with epithelial dysfunction in IC/BPS and inhibition of EMT occurring in IC/BPS patients may be a new idea for treating IC/BPS [<xref rid="pone.0321730.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0321730.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0321730.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>We have found that heparanase and syndecan-2 (SDC-2) were significantly up-regulated in tissues from IC/BPS patients. Heparanase is an endogenous &#x003b2;-D-glucuronidase widely found in the extracellular matrix of various tissues and organs [<xref rid="pone.0321730.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. heparanase cleaves the side chain of heparin sulfate and is involved in the degradation and remodeling of the extracellular matrix (ECM), including the release of growth factors such as fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) [<xref rid="pone.0321730.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. There are two forms of heparanase: heparanase-1 (HPSE) and heparanase-2, with heparanase-1 exerting the primary biological functions, which our study focused on. Several studies have shown that HPSE can promote EMT in bronchial epithelial cells, and renal tubular epithelial cells [<xref rid="pone.0321730.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0321730.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The multiligand proteoglycan SDC, a family of cell-surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HPSG) members, of which four have been identified (SDC-1 to 4), plays an essential function in cell adhesion [<xref rid="pone.0321730.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0321730.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. SDC-2 can promote EMT in colorectal cancer cells, which results in epithelial cells losing cell polarity and their connection to the basement membrane, thereby promoting tumor metastasis and invasion [<xref rid="pone.0321730.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0321730.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. We therefore hypothesized that the HPSE/SDC-2 axis promotes EMT in IC/BPS and aggravates bladder dysfunction. Inhibition of the HPSE/SDC-2 axis restores EMT-induced epithelial dysfunction.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Mice</title><p>The experimental animals used in this study were provided by the Animal Center of Nanjing Medical University, weighing 18-20&#x02009;g, 8-10 weeks old, female C57BL/6J mice.

Additionally, we conducted a Western blot (WB) assay to semi-quantitatively analyze EMT-related proteins as a measure of EMT progression. Following intraperitoneal injection, cyclophosphamide (CYP) is metabolized in the kidney into acrolein, a toxic compound to urothelial cells. This process induces urothelial injury and inflammation, ultimately triggering EMT. Mice in the cyclophosphamide (CYP) group had smaller and more urine spots on the filter paper, suggesting that the frequency of urination was significantly increased and the urine volume was reduced (<xref rid="pone.0321730.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). Western blot (WB) results showed that the expression of the epithelial marker E-cadherin was decreased and the expression of the mesenchymal markers N-cadherin and Vimentin was increased (<xref rid="pone.0321730.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0321730.g001" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>).

When TGF-&#x003b2;1 binds to its receptor, TGF&#x003b2;R1, it can phosphorylate the downstream protein SMAD2. Phosphorylated SMAD2 can bind to SMAD4 and enter the nucleus, activating the signaling pathway through the canonical pathway. We found that it was significantly activated in the LPS intervention group and inhibited after knockdown of SDC-2 (<xref rid="pone.0321730.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6D</xref>). Then we exogenously added TGF-&#x003b2;1 as a pathway activator, and we found that the activation of the pathway by TGF-&#x003b2;1 disappeared after SDC-2 knockdown (<xref rid="pone.0321730.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6E</xref>). And the activating effect of TGF-&#x003b2;1 was further enhanced after overexpression of SDC-2 (<xref rid="pone.0321730.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6F</xref>). The above results show that even with exogenous addition of TGF-&#x003b2;1, the TGF&#x003b2;signaling pathway cannot be significantly activated after knocking down SDC-2, while the activation effect of TGF-&#x003b2;1 is significantly enhanced after overexpressing SDC-2. This result suggests that the activating effect of SDC-2 on the TGF-&#x003b2;pathway is not through the promotion of TGF-&#x003b2;1 secretion, but may exert its biological function through its receptor. Ubiquitination is one of the pathways that promote protein degradation, and we examined the level of ubiquitination of TGF-&#x003b2;receptor 1 (TGF-&#x003b2;R1) under knockdown and overexpression of SDC-2. The results showed that the ubiquitination level of TGF-&#x003b2;R1 increased after knockdown of SDC-2, and the ubiquitination level of TGF-&#x003b2;R1 decreased after overexpression of SDC-2 (<xref rid="pone.0321730.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6G</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0321730.g006" ref-type="fig">6H</xref>). Taken together, we can conclude that SDC-2 can inhibit TGF-&#x003b2;R1 ubiquitination degradation thereby activating the TGF-&#x003b2;pathway.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec022"><title>Discussion</title><p>IC/BPS is a chronic aseptic bladder inflammation characterized by symptoms of urinary frequency, urgency, pelvic and bladder pain, and poor outcome, which is a major clinical challenge [<xref rid="pone.0321730.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0321730.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The pathogenesis of IC/BPS is currently unclear, while recent studies have suggested that epithelial dysfunction and bladder fibrosis due to EMT may be the initial lesion of IC/BPS.</p><p>The bladder surface is covered with a cellular barrier composed of umbrella, intermediate, and basal cells. This prevents urine and toxic substances from leaking into the submucosa and causing tissue inflammation [<xref rid="pone.0321730.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0321730.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. EMT can be oncogenic in tumors, disrupt epithelial function, and promote tissue fibrosis in non-neoplastic diseases [<xref rid="pone.0321730.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. EMT disrupts this cellular barrier, which triggers chronic inflammation of the subepithelial bladder, leading to bladder dysfunction [<xref rid="pone.0321730.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0321730.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. We observed a positive correlation between the number of micturitions and the occurrence of EMT by intraperitoneal injection in a mouse model of CYP-induced cystitis. We induced EMT in Sv-huc-1 using LPS in vitro and found that epithelial cell barrier leakage was positively correlated with EMT.</p><p>HPSE and its downstream protein SDC-2 can each promote EMT. HPSE was found to promote the expression of the pro-fibrotic factors transforming growth factor and fundamental fibroblast growth, promoting EMT. In contrast, SDC-2 was found to promote EMT via the MAPK pathway and other pathways in tumor cells to exert oncogenic effects [<xref rid="pone.0321730.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0321730.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Although both HPSE and SDC-2 can each play a role in promoting EMT, it is not clear whether they have a synergistic effect. We first found that HPSE and SDC-2 were significantly up-regulated in IC/BPS patients and then found that inhibition of HPSE using OGT2115 resulted in the alleviation of lower urinary tract symptoms in CYP-induced cystitis mice and restored LPS-induced disruption of the leakage barrier of epithelial cells. EMT occurring in CYP and LPS-induced EMT was inhibited after OGT2115 treatment. To further investigate the relationship between SDC-2 and HPSE, we found that HPSE was highly co-localized and had a binding relationship with SDC-2 through IP and multiplex immunofluorescence experiments. The biological function exerted by HPSE disappeared, and EMT was inhibited after the knockdown of SDC-2, suggesting that SDC-2 is a key intermediate protein in causing EMT after HPSE activation. By constructing a truncated body we verified that HPSE binds to the D1 structural domain of SDC-2. The TGF&#x003b2;pathway is a downstream pathway of HPSE and is able to promote EMT.SDC-2 is able to inhibit the ubiquitinated degradation of TGF-&#x003b2;R1 thereby activating the TGF-&#x003b2;pathway, a newly identified pathway of action of HPSE.</p><p>This study elucidated the correlation between EMT and urination in vivo. The correlation between EMT and epithelial anti-leakage function in vitro was proved, which provided a new pathophysiologic mechanism for IC/BPS. Then, we identified SDC-2, an essential intermediate protein of HPSE to promote EMT, and confirmed the binding relationship between HPSE and SDC-2 using immunoprecipitation and multiplex immunofluorescence. SDC-2 exerts its biological function by inhibiting ubiquitinated degradation of TGF-&#x003b2;R1.In summary, the present study suggests that inhibition of the HPSE/SDC-2 axis can improve the EMT occurring in IC/BPS, which may be a new target for treating IC/BPS.</p></sec><sec id="sec023" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material id="pone.0321730.s001" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Knockdown of SDC-2 inhibits EMT activated by overexpression of HPSE</title><p>A: WB validation of transfection of His-HPSE.

After careful consideration, we feel that it has merit but does not fully meet PLOS ONE&#x02019;s publication criteria as it currently stands. Therefore, we invite you to submit a revised version of the manuscript that addresses the points raised during the review process.</p><p>As stated in the reviews, you should improve the introduction section and clarify the hypothesis. Additional experiments in deciphering the mechanism should be proposed as well as other markers to characterize the EMT (like TGF-beta). Also, the&#x000a0;Results section needs to be better organized as suggested by one of the reviewers.</p><p>Please submit your revised manuscript by Dec 28 2024 11:59PM. If you will need more time than this to complete your revisions, please reply to this message or contact the journal office at&#x000a0;<email>plosone@plos.org</email>. When you're ready to submit your revision, log on to <ext-link xlink:href="https://www.editorialmanager.com/pone/" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.editorialmanager.com/pone/</ext-link> and select the 'Submissions Needing Revision' folder to locate your manuscript file.</p><p>Please include the following items when submitting your revised manuscript:<!--</div>--></p><p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>A rebuttal letter that responds to each point raised by the academic editor and reviewer(s). You should upload this letter as a separate file labeled 'Response to Reviewers'.</p></list-item><list-item><p>A marked-up copy of your manuscript that highlights changes made to the original version. You should upload this as a separate file labeled 'Revised Manuscript with Track Changes'.</p></list-item><list-item><p>An unmarked version of your revised paper without tracked changes. You should upload this as a separate file labeled 'Manuscript'.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>If you would like to make changes to your financial disclosure, please include your updated statement in your cover letter. Guidelines for resubmitting your figure files are available below the reviewer comments at the end of this letter.</p><p>If applicable, we recommend that you deposit your laboratory protocols in protocols.io to enhance the reproducibility of your results. Protocols.io assigns your protocol its own identifier (DOI) so that it can be cited independently in the future.

In vivo and in vitro experiments were conducted to test the small molecule OGT2115, which was confirmed to inhibit the EMT process. The in vitro studies indicate the potential involvement of HPSE and SDC-2 in the development of EMT and suggest that their inhibition may facilitate the restoration of a favorable phenotype. The authors conclude that OGT2215, an HPSE inhibitor, may represent a promising therapeutic molecule for IC/PBS.</p><p>I have a few comments/suggestions to improve and strengthen the study:</p><p>&#x02022; The authors used OGT2115, a HPSE-1 inhibitor, to unveil HPSE-1 role on EMT. The choice of 5 &#x000b5;M as an optimal drug concentration was based solely on EMT phenotypic changes (decrease of E-cadherin and increase of Vimentin at protein level). However, Western blots of Fig 4A-B do not show a strong inhibition of HPSE-1 expression at this concentration. What is the IC50 of OGT2115 on HPSE-1 expression?</p><p>&#x02022; It is important to perform cytotoxicity assays of OGT2115 to confirm the non-cytotoxic effect of the drug.</p><p>&#x02022; Title and conclusion of the 3.4 paragraph are not very clear.

Similarly, the authors performed RNAi experiments with only SDC-2 RNAi. It would be interesting to genetically modulate HPSE expression (by siRNA), deplete both SDC-2/HPSE and finally rescue their expression, to confirm that both proteins are essential.</p><p>&#x02022; In their study, the authors analyzed GSE57560 dataset and described an upregulation for SDC-2 but also for SDC-1 and -4. However, they did not go further with these receptors because there are not significant changes in mice. Can the authors discuss more on that aspect? What is the difference between human and mice for SDC expression?</p><p>&#x02022; As they use human cell lines, it could be interesting to perform some experiments in vitro on SDC-1 and -4. Do they interact with HPSE? Are they involved in EMT process? Can they partially replace SDC-2 when SDC-2 is knockdown?</p><p>&#x02022; Finally, they only used phenotypic markers to describe the EMT process (E-cadherin as epithelial marker and Vimentin for mesenchymal marker), but they did not control cytokine expression, already described in the literature to be involved in this process (e.g. TGF-&#x003b2;). In the discussion part, the authors suggest that HPSE can activate TGF-&#x003b2; (without citation). Regarding these informations, it could be interesting to add a TGF-&#x003b2; inhibitor to confirm the EMT induction is TFG-&#x003b2; -dependent.</p><p>Reviewer #2:&#x000a0;The manuscript investigates the role of HPSE (heparanase) and SDC-2 in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) within the context of interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS), proposing that the inhibition of the HPSE/SDC-2 axis could mitigate EMT-related epithelial dysfunction. While the study presents intriguing data and utilizes multiple methodologies (in vivo, in vitro), there are critical areas where improvements are necessary :</p><p>in the introduction section :</p><p>&#x02022; It might be helpful to add specific epidemiological data on IC/BPS, like prevalence or challenges in diagnosis. Including a bit more detail on current treatments and their limitations could help to show why targeting EMT and HPSE/SDC-2 might offer something new in terms of therapy.</p><p>&#x02022; Adding a few lines on the functions of HPSE and SDC-2, especially their roles in extracellular matrix remodeling and EMT, might help readers unfamiliar with these molecules to understand why they matter in IC/BPS</p><p>&#x02022; The hypothesis is implicit rather than clearly stated. While the introduction discusses the potential involvement of HPSE and SDC-2 in EMT in IC/BPS, it lacks an explicit hypothesis that clearly directs the study's objectives. e.g., &#x0201c;We hypothesize that the HPSE/SDC-2 axis promotes EMT in IC/BPS and that its inhibition can ameliorate EMT-associated epithelial dysfunction.&#x0201d;.</p><p>&#x02022; You should add a few more references specifically for EMT in bladder disease could strengthen your argument. For exemple, citing related literature on EMT in non-cancerous inflammatory conditions would more enhance the study&#x02019;s novelty.</p><p>Methodology and results</p><p>&#x02022; The Results section should be restructured for clarity and logical flow. Each sub-section should begin with a brief statement of specific objectives, followed by a concise summary of the methods used.</p><p>&#x02022; Also, there is sometimes disorganized presentation of findings, for exemple, the abrupt presentation of EMT in bladder tissues, before first confirming cystitis validation, disrupts the logical progression of the results. This sequence should ideally be reversed to establish the model before discussing EMT induction.</p><p>&#x02022; Although the manuscript discusses the HPSE/SDC-2 axis's role in EMT, the mechanistic insights are somewhat superficial. The focus is heavily on EMT marker changes without adequately addressing the epithelial cells&#x02019; functional outcome, specifically related to cystitis. More extensive exploration on downstream signaling pathways related to HPSE and SDC-2 in EMT, perhaps involving other known mediators, could strengthen the paper&#x02019;s mechanistic foundation and relevance for IC/BPS treatment.</p><p>&#x02022; Along the same lines, ambiguity in experimental setup and the methodology lacks clarity in certain areas. For example, in Results section 3.1, paragraph two, you indicate an intention to study the relationship between EMT and cellular function in vitro, using an experiment based on LPS treatment (presumably involving LPS injection in mice, though this is not explicitly stated). However, it is unclear how this approach directly addresses the research question. Later, a conclusion is drawn that LPS induces EMT, but this does not fully address the specific question of epithelial cell function, leaving the connection insufficiently demonstrated.</p><p>&#x02022; The figures predominantly show a reduction in epithelial marker expression, accompanied by an increase in mesenchymal markers, which suggests EMT induction. However, additional clarification would strengthen this interpretation.</p><p>&#x02022; Much of the data relies on pharmacological inhibition of HPSE via OGT2115, but no complementary genetic knockdown model (e.g., siRNA against HPSE).</p><p>&#x02022; Specific details are missing, such as the number of mice used for each experiment and the control conditions, including necessary controls for siRNA (e.g., Si-scramble control for SDC-2 knockdown). The absence of these details weakens the methodological rigor</p><p>&#x02022; Additionally, there is a lack of precision in terms of the number of mice used in each experiment. On page 5, Section 2.12, the statistical methods section mentions standard deviations and ANOVA tests but lacks detailed information on sample sizes for each experiment. This makes it challenging to assess the robustness of the findings. Please address these issues to enhance the rigor of your research and provide more details on group sizes, randomization, also blinding methods, particularly regarding pain and urodynamic assessments</p><p>&#x02022; Several figures, including 2A-B, lack clarity and are sometimes unreadable, which diminishes the impact and interpretability of the results. High-resolution images should be provided to ensure that all figure details are visible. Furthermore, the contrast and clarity of fluorescence or histological images should be improved to enhance figure readability.</p><p>**********</p><p><!--<font color="black">-->6.

</p><p>Dear Editors and Reviewers:</p><p>Thank you for your letter and for the reviewers&#x02019; comments concerning our manuscript entitled &#x0201c;Inhibition of HPSE/SDC-2 axis-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition for treating IC/BPS&#x0201d; (ID: PONE-D-24-45975). Those comments are all valuable and helpful for revising and improving our paper, as well as the important guiding significance to our research. We have studied the comments carefully and have made corrections, which we hope to meet with approval.</p><p>The revisions in the manuscript are in red fonts, and responses to the reviewers' comments are in blue fonts.</p><p>Reviewer #1: In their study, Chen et al. describe the involvement of the HPSE/SDC-2 axis in the development of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) and propose a new therapeutic target for this pathology. In vivo and in vitro experiments were conducted to test the small molecule OGT2115, which was confirmed to inhibit the EMT process. The in vitro studies indicate the potential involvement of HPSE and SDC-2 in the development of EMT and suggest that their inhibition may facilitate the restoration of a favorable phenotype. The authors conclude that OGT2215, an HPSE inhibitor, may represent a promising therapeutic molecule for IC/PBS.</p><p>I have a few comments/suggestions to improve and strengthen the study:</p><p>&#x02022; The authors used OGT2115, a HPSE-1 inhibitor, to unveil HPSE-1 role on EMT. The choice of 5 &#x000b5;M as an optimal drug concentration was based solely on EMT phenotypic changes (decrease of E-cadherin and increase of Vimentin at protein level). However, Western blots of Fig 4A-B do not show a strong inhibition of HPSE-1 expression at this concentration. What is the IC50 of OGT2115 on HPSE-1 expression?</p><p>Response to comment: Thanks for the comments. OGT2115 (HY-100898, MCE) is a reliable HPSE-1 inhibitor, and its product description indicates that it has an IC50 of 0.4 &#x003bc;M for HPSE-1 inhibition and an IC50 of 1&#x003bc;M for antiangiogenicity. Our reading of the literature has revealed that most of the intervening concentrations of OGT2115 used at in vitro levels are 1 &#x003bc;M ( PMID: 32608014, PMID: 31327483). However, in our pre-experiment results, we found that OGT2115 did not significantly improve the EMT occurring in Sv-huc-1 when intervened at 1 &#x003bc;M, which may be due to the difference in cell lines, different cell culture conditions, etc. Therefore, we set up 0,1.25, 2.5, 5, 10 and 20&#x003bc;M concentration gradients to explore the optimal action concentration of OGT2115 for EMT improvement. According to the purpose of our study, i.e., the ameliorating effect of OGT2115 on EMT, we chose an intervention concentration of 5&#x003bc;M and verified the inhibitory effect of OGT2115 on the HPSE/SDC-2 axis at this concentration in Figure 4C. The reviewer's suggestion was very inspiring, and we will plot IC50 curves directly against the drug's target of action in future studies.</p><p>&#x02022; It is important to perform cytotoxicity assays of OGT2115 to confirm the non-cytotoxic effect of the drug.</p><p>Response to comment: Thanks for the comments. We determined the cytotoxicity of OGT2115 using the CCK-8 assay. The results showed that for Sv-huc-1, the IC50 of OGT2115 was 36.26 &#x003bc;M. 5 &#x003bc;M is a safe intervention concentration that does not significantly inhibit cell viability.</p><p>&#x02022; Title and conclusion of the 3.4 paragraph are not very clear. Is there an improvement or an inhibition of the EMT process under OGT2215 treatment? Clarify your message.</p><p>Response to comment: Thanks for the comments, and we have described this result more clearly.</p><p>&#x02022; The authors focused on the HPSE/SDC-2 axis implication by modulating HPSE (through OGT2115) but to strengthen and confirm their observations, the use of SDC-2 inhibitors could be interesting. Similarly, the authors performed RNAi experiments with only SDC-2 RNAi. It would be interesting to genetically modulate HPSE expression (by siRNA), deplete both SDC-2/HPSE and finally rescue their expression, to confirm that both proteins are essential.</p><p>Response to comment: Thanks for the comments. We searched for SDC-2 inhibitors in the preliminary stage but did not find any product in sale. We refined the overexpression of HPSE and the related response experiments according to the reviewers' suggestions. The experimental results are elaborated as follows:</p><p>&#x0201c;We overexpressed HPSE and validated it using WB (Figure S1A). Overexpression of HPSE promoted EMT progression, epithelial dysfunction, and increased fluorescence leakage occurred (Figure S1B-D). We knocked down SDC-2 based on overexpression of HPSE (Figure S1E). The EMT-promoting effect exerted by overexpression of HPSE was counteracted by SDC-2 knockdown (Figure S1E-F). The epithelial function was restored and fluorescence leakage was reduced after the SDC-2 knockdown (Figure S1G). Combined with the previous results, it can be concluded that HPSE binding to SDC-2 caused downstream EMT development and epithelial dysfunction, with SDC-2 playing a key role.&#x0201d;</p><p>&#x02022; In their study, the authors analyzed GSE57560 dataset and described an upregulation for SDC-2 but also for SDC-1 and -4. However, they did not go further with these receptors because there are not significant changes in mice. Can the authors discuss more on that aspect? What is the difference between human and mice for SDC expression?</p><p>Response to comment: Thanks for the comments. Mice are able to mimic human pathophysio -logical processes to some extent, but the distribution and function of some proteins such as the SDC family in the bladder are not identical. We analyzed human bladder tissue high-throughput sequencing data and found that the HPSE/SDC axis may play a role in the disease process. From the experimental results, human bladder tissues SDC1, SDC4 were also significantly elevated and had higher expression during the disease process of IC. We found low and no significant difference in SDC1, and SDC4 expression in the mouse model.</p><p>We observed the correlation between EMT and urination in mice from a mouse model. The role of EMT on phenotype was verified from the perspective of altered urinary habits. This part of the experimental results of altered urination habits provided by the mouse model is not available in human cell lines, so we will choose SDC-2, which is expressed differently and significantly in mice, for subsequent studies. We look forward to observing the role of the HPSE/SDC-2 axis in the altered urinary behavior of mice in inflammatory states by treating the mice again accordingly, provided that the in vitro levels are verified exactly.</p><p>&#x02022; As they use human cell lines, it could be interesting to perform some experiments in vitro on SDC-1 and -4. Do they interact with HPSE? Are they involved in EMT process? Can they partially replace SDC-2 when SDC-2 is knockdown?</p><p>Response to comment: Thanks for the comments. As stated above we chose SDC-2 for subsequent experiments, and EMT was significantly suppressed and restored to near-normal levels when we treated SDC-2 with knockdown (Figure 5D-F). This result suggests that SDC-2 is a key intermediate protein for HPSE to play a role in promoting EMT and is consistent with the results of the mouse model. We strongly agree with the reviewer's suggestion to refine the alternative roles of other proteins of the SDC family in the SDC-2 knockdown state, and we will further refine this part of the relevant content in subsequent studies.</p><p>&#x02022; Finally, they only used phenotypic markers to describe the EMT process (E-cadherin as epithelial marker and Vimentin for mesenchymal marker), but they did not control cytokine expression, already described in the literature to be involved in this process (e.g. TGF-&#x003b2;). In the discussion part, the authors suggest that HPSE can activate TGF-&#x003b2; (without citation). Regarding these informations, it could be interesting to add a TGF-&#x003b2; inhibitor to confirm the EMT induction is TFG-&#x003b2; -dependent.</p><p>Response to comment: Thanks for the comments. We subsequently refined the downstream mechanistic studies that SDC-2 is able to activate the TGF-&#x003b2; pathway by binding to SMAD7 and reducing TGF&#x003b2;R1 ubiquitination degradation. This part has been added to the manuscript:</p><p>&#x0201c;The TGF-&#x003b2; pathway is an important pathway for promoting EMT and a downstream signaling pathway for HPSE. We found that it was significantly activated in the LPS intervention group and inhibited after the knockdown of SDC-2 (Figure 6D). Then we exogenously added TGF-&#x003b2;1 as a pathway activator, and we found that the activation of the pathway by TGF-&#x003b2;1 disappeared after SDC-2 knockdown (Figure 6E). The activating effect of TGF-&#x003b2;1 was further enhanced after overexpression of SDC-2 (Figure 6F). This result suggests that the activating effect of SDC-2 on the TGF-&#x003b2; pathway is not through the promotion of TGF-&#x003b2;1 secretion, but may exert its biological function through its receptor. Ubiquitination is one of the pathways that promote protein degradation, and we examined the level of ubiquitination of TGF-&#x003b2;R1 under knockdown and overexpression of SDC-2. The results showed that the ubiquitination level of TGF-&#x003b2;R1 increased after the knockdown of SDC-2, and the ubiquitination level of TGF-&#x003b2;R1 decreased after the overexpression of SDC-2 (Figure 6G-H). Taken together, we can conclude that SDC-2 can inhibit TGF-&#x003b2;1 ubiquitination degradation thereby activating the TGF-&#x003b2; pathway.&#x0201d;</p><p>Reviewer #2: The manuscript investigates the role of HPSE (heparanase) and SDC-2 in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) within the context of interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS), proposing that the inhibition of the HPSE/SDC-2 axis could mitigate EMT-related epithelial dysfunction.

Our functional verification of the epithelial cells was mainly done by the epithelial permeability assay, which is the measurement of their anti-leakage function to fluorescent reagents 24h after cell passaging.

This result suggests that the activating effect of SDC-2 on the TGF-&#x003b2; pathway is not through the promotion of TGF-&#x003b2;1 secretion, but may exert its biological function through its receptor. Ubiquitination is one of the pathways that promote protein degradation, and we examined the level of ubiquitination of TGF-&#x003b2;R1 under knockdown and overexpression of SDC-2. The results showed that the ubiquitination level of TGF-&#x003b2;R1 increased after the knockdown of SDC-2, and the ubiquitination level of TGF-&#x003b2;R1 decreased after the overexpression of SDC-2 (Figure 6G-H). Taken together, we can conclude that SDC-2 can inhibit TGF-&#x003b2;1 ubiquitination degradation thereby activating the TGF-&#x003b2; pathway.&#x0201d;</p><p>&#x02022; Along the same lines, ambiguity in experimental setup and the methodology lacks clarity in certain areas. For example, in Results section 3.1, paragraph two, you indicate an intention to study the relationship between EMT and cellular function in vitro, using an experiment based on LPS treatment (presumably involving LPS injection in mice, though this is not explicitly stated). However, it is unclear how this approach directly addresses the research question. Later, a conclusion is drawn that LPS induces EMT, but this does not fully address the specific question of epithelial cell function, leaving the connection insufficiently demonstrated.</p><p>Response to comment: Thanks for the comments. We apologize for the misunderstanding caused by the unclear narrative. The second paragraph of Result 3.1 was validated using human-derived Sv-huc-1 at the in vitro level. We plotted the correlation curve using the WB relative protein expression of the EMT indicator as the horizontal coordinate and the fluorescence intensity at which leakage occurs as the vertical coordinate.</p><p>&#x02022; The figures predominantly show a reduction in epithelial marker expression, accompanied by an increase in mesenchymal markers, which suggests EMT induction. However, additional clarification would strengthen this interpretation.</p><p>Response to comment: Thanks for the comments. The current confirmation of EMT in non-tumorigenic diseases mainly rests on functional validation, so we first validated the effect of EMT on urination in mice and the effect of EMT on the barrier function of epithelial cells in Figure 1. In the subsequent validation process we also validated the progression of EMT by altered urination in mice (Figure 2D-I), and epithelial cell anti-leakage function (Figure 4I, Figure 5I).</p><p>&#x02022; Much of the data relies on pharmacological inhibition of HPSE via OGT2115, but no complementary genetic knockdown model (e.g., siRNA against H</p><supplementary-material id="pone.0321730.s003" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>Attachment</label><caption><p>Submitted filename: <named-content content-type="submitted-filename">Response to Reviewers.docx</named-content></p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0321730.s003.docx"/></supplementary-material></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="aggregated-review-documents" id="pone.0321730.r004" specific-use="decision-letter"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0321730.r004</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision Letter 1</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Grigorov</surname><given-names>Boyan</given-names></name><role>Academic Editor</role></contrib></contrib-group><permissions><copyright-statement>&#x000a9; 2025 Boyan Grigorov</copyright-statement><copyright-year>2025</copyright-year><copyright-holder>Boyan Grigorov</copyright-holder><license><ali:license_ref xmlns:ali="http://www.niso.org/schemas/ali/1.0/" specific-use="textmining" content-type="ccbylicense">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</ali:license_ref><license-p>This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution License</ext-link>, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.</license-p></license></permissions><related-article ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.1371/journal.pone.0321730" id="rel-obj004" related-article-type="reviewed-article"/><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>Submission Version</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></front-stub><body><p>

</p><p>Dear Editors and Reviewers:</p><p>Thank you for your letter and for the reviewers&#x02019; comments concerning our manuscript entitled &#x0201c;Inhibition of HPSE/SDC-2 axis-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition for treating IC/BPS&#x0201d; (ID: PONE-D-24-45975). Those comments are all valuable and helpful for revising and improving our paper, as well as the important guiding significance to our research. We have studied the comments carefully and have made corrections, which we hope to meet with approval.</p><p>The revisions in the manuscript are in red fonts, and responses to the reviewers' comments are in blue fonts.</p><p>Reviewer #1: Thank you for considering my previous comments. However, there are still several issues that need to be addressed:</p><p>Introduction Section:</p><p>&#x02022; You added some epidemiological data as requested by Reviewer #2, but it would be helpful to provide more specific details, particularly regarding prevalence data (e.g., breakdown by gender, age, and geographical region).</p><p>Response to comment: Thanks for the comments. We have added epidemiological data as follows:</p><p>&#x0201c;The prevalence of IC/BPS ranges from approximately 2.7% to 6.5%, with women being affected at a rate ten times higher than men. The global prevalence of IC/BPS is approximately 300 per 100,000 women, with the prevalence among men being about 10%-20% of that in women. When considering only the presence of symptoms suggestive of IC/BPS, the incidence rates for both men and women may increase by more than 10 times.&#x0201d;</p><p>&#x02022; To ensure clarity for unfamiliar readers, please specify that the study focuses on HPSE-1 (the enzymatically active form), rather than HPSE-2.</p><p>Response to comment: Thanks for the comments. We have specified that our study focused on HPSE-1 as follows:</p><p>&#x0201c;There are two forms of heparinase: heparinase-1 (HPSE) and heparinase-2, with heparinase-1 exerting the primary biological functions, which our study focused on.&#x0201d;</p><p>Results Section:</p><p>&#x02022; Abbreviations are missing in some areas. It would be beneficial to define them in the results section for easier readability (e.g., CYP mice are described in the Materials and Methods section but could be redefined at the beginning of the paragraph).

We have added this section as follows:</p><p>&#x0201c;The interstitial cystitis dataset GSE57560 was downloaded from the GEO public database, containing 12 interstitial cystitis and 4 control bladder biopsy tissues from humans.&#x0201d;</p><p>&#x02022; For Figures E and F, it would be helpful to add more detailed legends to aid in the interpretation of the data.</p><p>Response to comment: Thanks for the comments. We have added this section as follows:</p><p>&#x0201c;E: Fixed volumes (5, 10, 20, 50, 100 &#x003bc;l) of mouse urine were dropped onto filter paper for experimental use. ImageJ was used to calculate the area, and an area-volume standard curve was plotted, resulting in the formula: Volume = Area * 12.674. F: Based on the area of mouse urine spots, quantitative analysis was conducted on the frequency of urination, average urine volume, and total urine volume in mice (n=5).&#x0201d;</p><p>Section 3.3:</p><p>&#x02022; Figure 3A demonstrates a downregulation of HPSE under OGT2115 treatment, not inhibition. Please use the correct terminology.</p><p>Response to comment: Thanks for the comments. We have corrected the following in the original text:</p><p>&#x0201c;At the in vivo level by WB assay, OGT2115 was shown to down-regulate the expression of HPSE and SDC-2 (Fig 3A).&#x0201d;</p><p>&#x02022; It may be useful to compare the condition with OGT2115 to control samples to determine whether there is a full rescue of the epithelial phenotype with the treatment (Figures 3B-C and 3E-G).</p><p>Response to comment: Thanks for the comments. We have added this section.</p><p>Section 3.4:</p><p>&#x02022; OGT2115 is used to inhibit HPSE in vitro. Cytotoxicity assays should be included in this section (or in supplementary data), and the controls need to be clearly specified. Was OGT2115 resuspended in PBS or DMSO? How were the CCK-8 assay results normalized? Is cytotoxicity caused by DMSO or by OGT2115 itself? Furthermore, in the authors' responses to previous requests, their graph did not display the data for 50% cell mortality. Did they extrapolate this data (e.g., 36.26 &#x000b5;M determined as the dose for 50% cell death)? Greater rigor is needed in this experiment.</p><p>Response to comment: Thanks for the comments. We did not validate the cytotoxicity of OGT2115 at higher concentrations since the highest concentration of OGT2115 we used was 20 &#x003bc;M. We plotted fitting curves and extrapolated IC50 values based on the available data. We have added this section as follows:</p><p>&#x0201c;Initially, we used the CCK8 method to measure the cytotoxicity of OGT2115, with the control group receiving DMSO as the solvent. After CCK8 incubation, we measured the OD values, subtracted the blank well value (only culture medium added) from each well, and divided by the control group to obtain the percentage of live cells. After importing the data into Prism, we plotted a fitted curve using the logarithm of concentration as the x-axis and cell survival rate as the y-axis. From this, we calculated an IC50 value of 36.26 &#x003bc;M (Figure 4A).&#x0201d;</p><p>&#x02022; In this section, HPSE activity is modulated through pharmacological inhibition, but to strengthen the results, HPSE knockdown experiments should complement these findings (as requested by both Reviewer #1 and Reviewer #2). HPSE knockdown has been proposed as a method to confirm OGT2115's effects and exclude potential off-target effects. However, the HPSE overexpression experiments already conducted are useful and strengthen the results.</p><p>Response to comment: We thank the reviewers for their acknowledgement of our experimental protocol. Since an inhibitor of HPSE was used in the experiment, we considered overexpression of HPSE in the subsequent validation to better illustrate the reliability of the conclusions.</p><p>Section 3.6:</p><p>&#x02022; Thank you for incorporating our comments to investigate a potential mechanism by exploring the TGF-&#x003b2; pathway.</p><p>&#x02022; The first paragraph could be better integrated into the previous one discussing the role of SDC-2 and its interaction with HPSE for more coherence.</p><p>Response to comment: Thanks for the comments. We have added this section as follows:</p><p>&#x0201c;The above experiments demonstrate that SDC-2 is a downstream protein that binds to HPSE, but the specific binding site remains unclear. Therefore, based on the HS chain region of SDC-2, we designed truncations (Fig 6A).&#x0201d;</p><p>&#x02022; For readers who may be unfamiliar with the TGF-&#x003b2; pathway, it would be helpful to briefly describe it and explain the rationale behind studying Smad2.</p><p>Response to comment: Thanks for the comments. We have added this section as follows:</p><p>&#x0201c;Transforming growth factor-&#x003b2; (TGF-&#x003b2;) is a profound factor that promotes fibrosis and EMT, and it is also a downstream signaling pathway of HPSE. When TGF-&#x003b2;1 binds to its receptor, TGF&#x003b2;R1, it can phosphorylate the downstream protein SMAD2. Phosphorylated SMAD2 can bind to SMAD4 and enter the nucleus, activating the signaling pathway through the canonical pathway.&#x0201d;</p><p>&#x02022; The sentence, "This result suggests that the activating effect of SDC-2 on the TGF-&#x003b2; pathway is not through the promotion of TGF-&#x003b2;1 secretion, but may exert its biological function through its receptor," would benefit from further clarification. Please explain the underlying hypothesis more explicitly.</p><p>Response to comment: Thanks for the comments.

</p><p>Dear Editors and Reviewers:</p><p>Thank you for your letter and for the reviewers&#x02019; comments concerning our manuscript entitled &#x0201c;Inhibition of HPSE/SDC-2 axis-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition for treating IC/BPS&#x0201d; (ID: PONE-D-24-45975). Those comments are all valuable and helpful for revising and improving our paper, as well as the important guiding significance to our research. We have studied the comments carefully and have made corrections, which we hope to meet with approval.</p><p>The revisions in the manuscript are in red fonts, and responses to the reviewers' comments are in blue fonts.</p><p>Reviewer #1: Thank you for taking my previous comments into consideration. The reading and comprehension are improving, but there are still a few mistakes or misunderstandings that need to be addressed.</p><p>- Please be careful: in the introduction section, you mention "heparinase" instead of "heparanase." This needs to be corrected.</p><p>Response to comment: Thanks for the comments. We have corrected this error in the introduction section.</p><p>- In section 3.1, I would recommend explaining the CYP group further (What does cyclophosphamide do in mice? Which phenotype does it induce?), similar to the explanation already provided for LPS treatment on Sv-huc-1 cells.</p><p>Response to comment: Thanks for the comments. We have added the biological functions performed by CYP in the original text, which are described as follows:</p><p>&#x0201c;Following intraperitoneal injection, cyclophosphamide (CYP) is metabolized in the kidney into acrolein, a toxic compound to urothelial cells. This process induces urothelial injury and inflammation, ultimately triggering EMT.&#x0201d;</p><p>- Be cautious, as some information is repeated within the same paragraph (e.g., "We added LPS stimulation to construct a cellular EMT model" and "We constructed an EMT model of urothelial cells by stimulating them continuously with LPS for 24 hours in the culture medium"). Avoid such repetitions to improve readability.</p><p>Response to comment: Thanks for the comments. We have removed the repetitive language.</p><p>Reviewer #3: The study has its merits but more efforts need to be made for the presentation of the manuscript. In the abstract it is not clear what CYP-induced mean? What does the abbreviation mean? Cyclophosphamide? Cyclophilin?</p><p>Response to comment: Thanks for the comments. We have included the full name of cyclophosphamide (CYP) in the abstract section.</p><p>&#x0201c;Both the increased urination frequency observed in mice with acute cystitis induced by cyclophosphamide (CYP) and the disruption of the anti-leakage barrier in urothelial cells induced by LPS are associated with the occurrence of EMT.&#x0201d;</p><p>Be careful when writing heparanase, since I saw "heparinase" with "i" many times in the text. This is not the same enzyme. Replace where needed.</p><p>Response to comment: Thanks for the comments. We have rectified this mistake, and we thank the reviewer for pointing it out.</p><p>An effort should be made to present the results in a more comprehensive manner. For example, look at the first paragraph of the "Results" section: the authors should explain what is the objective/rationale of the experiment, why they do it (what is the expected outcome) and then to explain how (western blot and voiding spots).</p><p>Response to comment: Thanks for the comments. We have added an elaboration on the results in the first paragraph of the results section, stated as follows:</p><p>&#x0201c;To investigate the correlation between the frequency of urination in mice and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), we quantified the number of urinations by counting the urine spots on filter paper in the voiding spots experiment.&#x0201d;</p><p>&#x0201c;The epithelial permeability assay was employed to evaluate the barrier function of urothelial cells, where the fluorescent intensity of leakage is inversely proportional to the barrier function.&#x0201d;</p><p>In the "Results" section, the title of the following paragraph is not clear: &#x0201c;Inhibition of HPSE ameliorates cystogenesis in CYP-induced cystitis mice EMT&#x0201d;. Also, explain why you check E-cadherin, N-cadherin, vimentin&#x02026;</p><p>Response to comment: Thanks for the comments. E-cadherin, N-cadherin, and Vimentin are three EMT-related proteins that are widely used and validated in EMT-related studies. During our literature review, we found that previous studies on IC/BPS and EMT had adopted these three proteins, which were verified to be expressed in urothelial cells (PMID: 34368980, PMID: 34984178). Therefore, we conducted our research using E-cadherin, N-cadherin, and Vimentin.</p><supplementary-material id="pone.0321730.s005" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>Attachment</label><caption><p>Submitted filename: <named-content content-type="submitted-filename">Response_to_Reviewers_auresp_3.docx</named-content></p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0321730.s005.docx"/></supplementary-material></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="editor-report" id="pone.0321730.r008" specific-use="decision-letter"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0321730.r008</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision Letter 3</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Grigorov</surname><given-names>Boyan</given-names></name><role>Academic Editor</role></contrib></contrib-group><permissions><copyright-statement>&#x000a9; 2025 Boyan Grigorov</copyright-statement><copyright-year>2025</copyright-year><copyright-holder>Boyan Grigorov</copyright-holder><license><ali:license_ref xmlns:ali="http://www.niso.org/schemas/ali/1.0/" specific-use="textmining" content-type="ccbylicense">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</ali:license_ref><license-p>This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution License</ext-link>, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.</license-p></license></permissions><related-article ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.1371/journal.pone.0321730" id="rel-obj008" related-article-type="reviewed-article"/><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>Submission Version</meta-name><meta-value>3</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></front-stub><body><p>
