<bold>Background:</bold> Vaccination is the best way to protect newborns and mothers against tetanus. The number of doses of Td vaccine recommended by the Expanded Program of Immunization is based on documented protective immune response. During this decade, the Foumban Health District (FHD) was the seat of an epidemic despite the satisfactory administrative immunization coverage. This study was conducted in 2019 in the FHD to assess tetanus vaccine coverage among mothers for their last pregnancy and the cumulative number of vaccine doses administered to the mothers.</p><p>
<bold>Method:</bold> This was a descriptive cross-sectional study conducted in the FHD in 2019. Mothers living in the district with at least one child younger than five years were included and were selected by random stratified cluster sampling. Trained surveyors used a face-to-face questionnaire, data extraction grid and data-tracking grid to review and collect data from antenatal care booklets, vaccination cards and the women&#x02019;s own reports of immunization. The immunization coverage per vaccine dose and vaccination completeness rate were estimated.</p><p>
<bold>Results:</bold> From 621 women visited, 602 (96.9%) responded. A total of 176/511 women (34.4%) had evidence of vaccination. For the last pregnancy, the two-dose immunization proportion was 21.7% (111/511) for documented coverage and 47.6% (243/511) for undocumented coverage. 306/570 women (53.7%) had received more than the recommended five doses necessary for lifetime protection. The recruitment, two and five doses completeness rates were 99.9% (569/570), 95.8% (546/570) and 65.3% (372/570), respectively.</p><p>
<bold>Conclusion:</bold> More than half of mothers received more doses of tetanus toxoid vaccine than necessary in FHD. This increased the resources needed and the cost of vaccination. Health personnel should be trained and supervised to assess pregnant women&#x02019;s vaccination status before planning the number of vaccine doses to be administered during pregnancy.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>Cameroon</kwd><kwd>child</kwd><kwd>mother</kwd><kwd>tetanus</kwd><kwd>vaccination</kwd><kwd>EPI</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund-1" xlink:href="http://www.gatesfoundation.org"><funding-source>Gates Foundation</funding-source><award-id>OPP1190786</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation [OPP1190786]. </funding-statement><funding-statement>

<italic toggle="yes">Clostridium tetani</italic> bacteria. In maternal tetanus, considered as tetanus during pregnancy or within six weeks of the end of pregnancy, infection can occurs after abortion, miscarriage, or unhygienic delivery practices
<sup>
<xref rid="ref-1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>

<sup>
<xref rid="ref-4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>

<xref rid="ref-2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>

</sup>. In addition, unlike a second dose of tetanus vaccine (Td2+), protection at birth (PAB) is effective when the mother has previously received protective doses for the last pregnancy, and when the mother received one dose without documentation of previous doses received. According to the immunization schedule for pregnant women and the fact that women can start vaccination against tetanus before or during their first pregnancy, the tetanus immunization coverage evaluation cannot inform on the estimated total dose of vaccine received by a woman.</p><p>The aim of this study was to assess tetanus vaccine coverage in the Foumban Health District (FHD) among mothers in terms of the number of recommended protective doses for the latest pregnancy and for the cumulative number of vaccine doses administered.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Ethical statement</title><p>This study was implemented following national and international regulations in research participant&#x02019;s protection. All heads of household were informed and their permission obtained before meeting eligible participants. All participants were informed about the study via the information sheet and their written consent for participation and publication of the collected data was obtained before collecting their data. The information contained in their antenatal care (ANC) booklet was kept confidential and only data needed for the study were collected. We obtained ethical clearance from the National Ethical Committee for Human Health Research (N&#x000b0; 2019/05/20/CE/CNERSH/SP of May 6, 2019) and an administrative authorization letter from the FHD Medical Officer (N&#x000b0; 247/L/MINSANTE/SG/DRO/DS/FBAN of November 22, 2018).</p></sec><sec><title>Study design</title><p>This was a descriptive community-based cross-sectional survey conducted among former parturient women of the FHD in 2019.

It has a surface area of 1,734 km&#x000b2;. The FHD is made up of 22 health areas with a total population of 235,828 inhabitants in 2018
<sup>
<xref rid="ref-11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>

<sup>
<xref rid="ref-12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
</sup>, a design effect due to cluster sampling of two and response rate of 94.4% from DHS 2011.</p></sec><sec><title>Sampling procedure</title><p>The estimated sample size was assigned to 10 health areas (HA) selected from the 22 HA of the FHD by a stratified random sampling process. At the HA level, 62 quarters were selected using a systematic sampling method. The number of clusters per HA was proportional to the total population of the HA and 10 mothers were included per quarter. The listing of all localities was done in alphabetical order with the cumulative population frequency. The sample interval in each HA was determined by dividing the total population of the area by the allocated number of clusters. In each village/quarter, one direction or street was randomly selected from the center. We included the first household on the right and another one after, skipping two households. We further chose the participant in the selected households. If there were two or more mothers in a household, we randomly chose one, and if there were no eligible woman, the next household was included in the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Data collection instrument</title><p> The data collection tools were developed by the study team and pre-tested among 14 women in the community for fluency, acceptance by participants and precision. Following pre-testing, the questionnaire was divided into a questionnaire, a data extraction grid and a data tracking grid and some questions were adapted or removed to make questions more pertinent and reduce the time taken to administer the questionnaire (from ~30 minutes to ~10 minutes). The questionnaire (see

<sup>
<xref rid="ref-13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>

Surveyors were male and female community health workers with at least three years of experience. Before beginning, the aim of the study was explained in the information sheet and written informed consent was obtained. Interviews were 5&#x02013;10 minutes in duration. Data collected included: age; education level; marital status; profession; parity; knowledge of tetanus vaccine; availability of ANC booklet and immunization card; and doses of tetanus toxoid vaccine received since their first pregnancy, during their last pregnancy and during their last three pregnancies, with earlier pregnancies not considered to reduce the possibility of memory bias. The information sources were recall and evidence of vaccination (Td cards and ANC booklets).</p></sec><sec><title>Bias</title><p>There was a high probability of recall bias as data were collected using a questionnaire. We cannot be certain of the respondent statements, as some may not have a good memory of vaccination from many years ago or some could for some reason hide or deform some answers. The research team could not overcome this weakness as it cannot be avoided when data are collected using questionnaires. Nevertheless, some key variables were collected from vaccination cards filled out by health personnel and we believe these have less risk of being affected by information bias.</p></sec><sec><title>Data analysis</title><p>We assessed the survey coverage and response rate per cluster to mitigate the risk of selection bias. Data were analyzed by estimating the proportion of mothers with each dose of tetanus vaccine received, the proportion of documented immunization coverage, undocumented immunization coverage and stratification by education level. Attempting to infer results to the general population, proportions were estimated with 95% confidence intervals. Data were entered and analyzed using Epi Info version 7.2.2.6

Taking into account the total number of tetanus vaccine doses received during all pregnancies by each woman, the first contact, two and five doses completeness rate was 99.9%, 95.8% and 65.3%, respectively. Over half (53.3%) of participants had received more than five tetanus vaccine doses.</p><p>To protect the child from tetanus, it is recommended that a minimum of two doses of this vaccine be administered to each woman before the end of pregnancy
<sup>
<xref rid="ref-9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>
</sup>. Routinely, the estimation of two-dose vaccination coverage is done by calculating the proportion of women who received the vaccine in the antenatal consultation follow-up register
<sup>
<xref rid="ref-19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>
</sup>. However, since not all women attend antenatal consultations, the community-based survey is more suitable for this estimation. The best source of data for this estimation is the vaccination card or ANC booklet. The present study shows a significant difference between documented and declared vaccination coverage and highlights the need to identify and respond to the reasons for this difference and to decide on the data sources to be used to monitor vaccination coverage
<sup>
<xref rid="ref-20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>
</sup>. In the present paper, we considered and discussed vaccination coverage, taking into account the vaccination card and the mother's declarations. This approach is supported by the argument that the survey was done less than five years after the last pregnancy, with good chances that mothers remember their vaccination status.</p><p>The two-dose immunization coverage from immunization cards and declarations indicates that three out of 10 babies are born unprotected against tetanus. The fact that a significant proportion of newborns are unprotected against tetanus is concerning for our national elimination status. This could be explained by limits in the supply of vaccination
<sup>
<xref rid="ref-21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>
</sup>, the limited access of pregnant women to organized vaccination sessions or the fact that the estimate of vaccination coverage fails to include vaccine doses administered during previous pregnancies. Taking into account the fact that in most health facilities, ANC and vaccination against tetanus are integrated
<sup>
<xref rid="ref-22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>
</sup>, noted in the ANC booklet and given to the pregnant woman, and that these women change their booklet from one pregnancy to the next, we opted in this study to estimate the cumulative vaccination coverage of the mother taking into account all vaccine doses administered in previous pregnancies.</p><p>The tetanus immunization schedule during pregnancy in Cameroon is based on the WHO recommendations
<sup>
<xref rid="ref-18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>
</sup>. This schedule recommends administering at least two doses at least four weeks apart, the last of which must be administered at least two weeks before delivery; the three booster doses administered with an interval of at least six, 12 and 24 months after the second dose, which provide five, 10 and all childbearing age years protection, respectively
<sup>
<xref rid="ref-10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>
</sup>.</p><p>Our results showed that 65.3% of mothers had completed five doses of the tetanus vaccine and that 53.7% had received more than the five maximum recommended doses for lifetime protection
<sup>
<xref rid="ref-24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>
</sup>. Without evidence of an existent study, this is the first study that assesses the cumulative administered vaccine to this targeted population. The present study did not investigate reasons for this situation. From our experience in observing and supervising vaccination sessions, it can result from some weaknesses in planning, delivering and monitoring tetanus toxoid vaccination in pregnancy. These may include the fact that: 1) in practice, the denominator recommended by the Expanded Program on Immunization to monitor the coverage of tetanus toxoid vaccine is the estimated number of pregnant women (assuming all of them have not been previously vaccinated)
<sup>
<xref rid="ref-19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>
</sup>; 2) the evaluation of vaccination status is not conducted before planning the number of vaccine doses to be administered in each pregnancy and; 3) ANC booklets also serve as vaccination cards and are renewed with each pregnancy. No study has shown any danger administering more doses of tetanus vaccines than necessary to pregnant women. However, there is no doubt that this situation increases the cost of vaccination, as shown in previous studies
<sup>
<xref rid="ref-21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>
</sup>, in terms of the number of vaccine doses to be purchased and human resources needed to organize vaccination sessions and also leads to underestimates of the performance of the Expanded Program on Immunization.</p><sec><title>Limitations and strengths of the study</title><p>The estimated coverage of vaccination during the last pregnancy and cumulative number of doses from all pregnancies was expected to be based on data collected from the Td card or ANC booklet; however, only a third of the participants had evidence of vaccination. We had to collect this data using a tracking tool to assess the vaccination status of women that had no evidence of vaccination. Using two data sources to estimate this coverage can lead to information bias that may question the validity of our results. This is a difficulty encountered in almost all of the vaccination coverage surveys that we tried to solve by using a vaccine status-tracking grid. The limitations of the current study have lead our team to launch two other studies: a study to document and respond to reasons for the unavailability of evidence of vaccination and a study to test tools that allow with certain reliability to determine the vaccination status of women who have no evidence of vaccination.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The present study indicates that more than half of the participants received more doses of vaccines than recommended for adequate protection against tetanus of the mother and the child during the mother's childbearing years. This increases the need for resources and the cost of vaccination. This study also showed that the vaccine coverage and the level of protection of this vaccine in pregnant women are underestimated if estimates do not take into account the cumulative number of doses of vaccine received by the mother before and during previous pregnancies. To improve the situation, we recommend training health personnel to assess the vaccination status before planning the number of doses of vaccines to be administered to a pregnant woman. Moreover, the same document should be used for all antenatal consultations across pregnancies to allow a better assessment of the number of vaccine doses already administered. Scientists should identify and respond to the reasons for the unavailability of evidence of vaccination and test vaccine status tracking tools in women who have no source of verification of vaccine status.</p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><sec><title>Underlying data</title><p>Figshare: Tetanus vaccine coverage in recommended and more than recommended doses among mothers in a West Cameroon Health District: MetaData.

Overall, the aim of this study was to assess tetanus vaccine coverage in FHD among mothers, specifically evaluating the number of doses received during last pregnancy and the cumulative number of vaccine doses administered. Besides being a descriptive study on maternal tetanus vaccine uptake, it is not clear what this aim attempts to add to the scientific literature on this topic. The abstract mentions that FHD was &#x0201c;the seat of an epidemic despite the satisfactory administrative immunization coverage&#x0201d; but this point is not expanded upon anywhere else in the manuscript to aid in justifying the purpose of this study. The authors conclude that more than half of mothers received more Td doses than recommended and that this increased the resources needed and cost of vaccination; however, resource allocation and cost to administer the vaccine was not evaluated as part of this study to justify such a conclusion. It is recommended that this manuscript be reframed to explain why this study was warranted and present results that best support their conclusions and answers the study aim.</p><p> According to
<ext-link xlink:href="https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/329882/9789241515610-eng.pdf?sequence=1" ext-link-type="uri">WHO guidance on sustaining MNTE</ext-link>&#x000a0;(Page 44), tetanus vaccination status should be verified by card or history during the first ANC visit. If card and/or history confirm that the pregnant woman is fully protected against tetanus (i.e. has received 6 TTCV doses in childhood/adolescence, or 5 doses if first vaccinated after 1 year of age/during adolescence/adulthood, including during previous pregnancies), then no further vaccination is needed.&#x000a0;In this case, it is very important to record the pregnant woman as &#x0201c;fully vaccinated with TTCV&#x0201d; on ANC card and in the immunization register, even though she did not receive any TTCV doses in the current pregnancy. This point should be included in the discussion section as it highlights a potential opportunity to rectify the experience of mothers&#x000a0;receiving more than the recommended number of Td doses.</p><p> Below are my comments by section for consideration:</p><p> Introduction
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The authors state that Cameroon&#x02019;s tetanus immunization coverage was 87% at the end of 2017 but it is not clear if this is Td2+ coverage or PAB coverage. In review of the Td2+ and PAB data available on WHO&#x02019;s website, Td2+ coverage was 69% and 63% in 2017 and 2018, respectively and PAB coverage was 85% in both 2017 and 2018. However, I suggest that the authors clarify which coverage estimate is presented here and cite an appropriate data source.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The final paragraph of the introduction could be expanded to not only mention the aim of the study but to justify why this study is warranted.</p></list-item></list> Results
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Authors do not explain how the results go from 602 respondents to a denominator of 511. The 2
<sup>nd</sup> paragraph states that 176/511 reportedly had ANC booklets or immunization cards and 111/511 had documented Td2+ immunization coverage. Does this mean the other 400 did not have documentation? It may be better to say 176/511 had ANC booklets or immunization cards and of those 111/176 had Td2+ documentation.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The authors go on to mention 243/511 had &#x0201c;undocumented immunization coverage&#x0201d; but does not define this term. Does this mean that 243 participants recalled receiving Td vaccine but did not have a record of such vaccination in their ANC booklet or immunization card? As asked above, does this 243 include part of the 400 that did not have documentation? What about the rest?</p></list-item><list-item><p>Revise the first sentence under &#x0201c;cumulative and completeness vaccination coverage&#x0201d; as it is unclear the way it is currently written.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Would suggest include results on cost of vaccination and resource allocation (if measured) given the conclusions specifically mention that providing more than the recommended number of doses led to increases in cost and resources.</p></list-item></list> Discussion
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The 2
<sup>nd</sup> paragraph in the discussion mentions &#x0201c;the present study shows a significant difference between documented and declared vaccination coverage&#x0201d; but the results do not reference a test of significance. Please include first in the results before mentioning in the discussion.</p></list-item><list-item><p>When discussing the proportion of babies unprotected against tetanus at birth, the authors mention that reasons for this could be &#x0201c;limits in the supply of vaccination, limited access of pregnant women to organize vaccination sessions or the fact that the estimate of vaccination coverage fails to include vaccine doses administered during previous pregnancies&#x0201d;. Were these asked about in the questionnaire? If so, these data should be presented in the results first before offered as a potential justification for the 3 out of 10 infants unprotected at birth against tetanus.</p></list-item><list-item><p>&#x0201c;53.7% had received more than five maximum recommended doses for lifetime protection&#x0201d; it would be helpful if the average and range were presented for the group of women who received more than the recommended amount in the results.</p></list-item><list-item><p>In the second to last paragraph, the authors write &#x0201c;However, there is no doubt that this situation increases the cost of vaccination&#x0201d; but data on cost were not presented in the results. It is suggested that the authors provide data (if assessed) on cost to justify this conclusion.</p></list-item><list-item><p>In the limitation section, the authors mention that they tried to resolve the issue of 2 data sources by using a vaccine status-tracking grid. It would be helpful if the authors could expand on how a vaccine status tracking grid aided in resolving this issue.</p></list-item></list> Conclusion
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>&#x0201c;This increases the need for resources and the cost of vaccination&#x0201d; Not sure this conclusion can be made given that this was not formally assessed as part of this study.</p></list-item><list-item><p>With the final sentence in the conclusion section, the authors note that they are doing exactly what they suggest &#x0201c;scientists should&#x0201d; do (they mention this in the limitation section) so not sure if this final sentence is needed in the conclusion section.</p></list-item></list> Tables
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Table 1: would seem more appropriate to include &#x0201c;none&#x0201d; as an education level rather than &#x0201c;illiterate&#x0201d;. This suggested revision applies to all tables that include the word &#x0201c;illiterate&#x0201d;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Table 2: The subtotal % for the section &#x02018;immunization status from Td card or ANC booklet&#x02019; for secondary education includes an extra decimal point (written as 39..3).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Table 2 &#x00026; 3: it is not clear if the proportions in the cells are row or column percents as they do not add up to 100 when reviewed by row or column. Please revise so it reflects either a row or column percent.</p></list-item></list>

While the main results will likely stand, i.e., excess TTCV vaccination for some women and not enough vaccination for others, more clarifications are needed to fully evaluate the findings.</p><p>
<bold>My main suggestions are:</bold>
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Consider properly reviewing the existing literature to put the findings into context, notably the most updated WHO Recommendations synthesized in the 2017 Tetanus vaccine Position paper:

What is the recommended schedule? How many booster doses are recommended? Which vaccine is used, TT or Td (and since when, if Td)?</p></list-item><list-item><p>Describe better the survey methods used. The study reported used a method of quota sampling no longer endorsed by the World Health Organization (WHO), see:

<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Why did the authors chose this methodology rather than probability sampling?</p></list-item><list-item><p>Why were women who gave birth, but with stillbirths and infants who died, excluded? (against current WHO recommendations &#x02013; see Survey Manual in link provided above).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Provide more information about the survey implementing teams and analysis.&#x000a0;Where can the reader find the database and analytical code?</p></list-item><list-item><p>Mention that this method assumes self-weighting and that the uncertainty estimates (95% Confidence intervals in this case), thus, are difficult to interpret. Also unclear how the sampling design was handled in the analysis</p></list-item></list>
</p></list-item><list-item><p>With all these, the limitations section must be expanded to also discuss selection bias (non-probability sampling, unclear revisit procedures, who selected households and documentation of HHs approached vs. surveyed) and ascertainment bias linked not only to long recall period, limited availability of written records, but also to who asks and how questions are asked to ascertain vaccination status.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Tell us how the findings of the&#x000a0;survey results are going to be used to change policy and/or practices in Cameroon.</p></list-item></list>

<italic toggle="yes">not</italic>&#x000a0;a blanket recommendation. It only applies in certain circumstances. In fact, the 2017 WHO Position Paper on Tetanus Vaccines states: &#x0201c;Women who have documented evidence that they received all of the doses needed for full protection, i.e. either 6 TTCV doses in childhood or 5 doses if first vaccinated during adolescence/adulthood, should not be further vaccinated during pregnancy in order to avoid the risk of increased local reactions.&#x0201d;</p></list-item><list-item><p>It is unclear to me why the proportions presented use 511 (the number of women with some evidence of vaccination) as the denominator. We read that the number of eligible women included was 602, and this should be the denominator to calculate proportion vaccinated, as done in most household surveys. Thus, what happened to the other 91 women [602-511]?</p></list-item><list-item><p>I also don&#x02019;t understand this statement &#x0201c;The recruitment, two and five doses completeness rates were 99.9% (569/570), 95.8% (546/570) and 65.3% (372/570), respectively&#x0201d; &#x02013; why 570 as denominator? What does it mean by &#x0201c;the recruitment?</p></list-item></list>

There is also a risk of administering excess TT when pre-existing tetanus antibody levels are already high, which can result in increased local reaction rates.&#x0201d; &#x02013; You can look at the accompanying documentation of the Position Paper to look for primary research so you can cite papers about increases in adverse events, notably local reactions.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Expand the limitation section to account for potential biases related to the sampling procedures used.</p></list-item></list>

<bold>assess tetanus vaccine coverage among mothers for their last pregnancy</bold> and the cumulative number of vaccine doses administered to the mothers. It was conducted during 2019 in Foumban Health District (FHD). FHD is located in the west region of Cameroon, bordered by four other health districts of the same region and by the North West Region in the North. It is made up of 22 health areas with a total population of 235,828 inhabitants in 2018.</p><p>
<bold>Methods</bold>
</p><p> To attain the objective, the authors conducted a descriptive community-based cross-sectional survey conducted among former parturient women. A cluster randomized sampling design was used to select participants.</p><p> The sample size was computed using a confidence interval of 95% and precision of 5% and assuming the immunization coverage in the Cameroon general population to be 73.9% from a previous demographic health survey (DHS 2011)
<sup>. </sup>A design effect due to cluster sampling of two was considered together with a response rate of 94.4% (from DHS 2011).</p><p> The target population was women of childbearing age with at least one child aged 0&#x02013;59 months living in FHD for at least three months. Those absent from selected households for two visits in a week were not included.</p><p> The estimated sample size was 620 women.</p><p> In Data analysis the authors referred that in attempting to infer results to the general population, proportions were estimated with 95% confidence intervals.</p><p>
<bold>Comment 1</bold>
</p><p> The authors want to infer which results?</p><p> In the main objective and in sample size calculation it is mentioned that the primary outcome is tetanus vaccine coverage among mothers for their last pregnancy. And only for this outcome, it will be possible to infer something to the population. Must be clarified.</p><p>
<bold>Results</bold>
</p><p> Tables 1, 2 and 3</p><p>
<bold>Comment 2</bold>
</p><p> The number of women with Higher education is so low (n=6) that I wonder if the result has real meaning; also there are no women with age of first pregnancy &#x0003e;35 years; does it make sense to have a line of zeros?</p><p>
<bold>Comment 3</bold>
</p><p> I can&#x02019;t see why the CI95% are presented together with socio-demographic characteristics. It should be presented together with the main outcome, but the sample was not chosen to be representative of the socioeconomic level. I am not sure of the added value of this information</p><p>
<bold>Discussion</bold>
</p><p>
<bold>Comment 4</bold>
</p><p> In my opinion, if the authors want to infer something to the population we need to know more about the target population. Some statistics at the population level would be very useful to compare with the results from this study. For example: what are the sociodemographic characteristics of women of childbearing age with at least one child aged 0&#x02013;59 months living in FHD? (namely age, level of education, profession and marital status). &#x000a0;It&#x02019;s important to compare the sample used in this study with the population characteristics to evaluate the extent to which it is representative or not. If not there will be a possible bias, namely in disaggregated data that should also be mentioned.</p><p>Is the work clearly and accurately presented and does it cite the current literature?</p><p>Yes</p><p>If applicable, is the statistical analysis and its interpretation appropriate?</p><p>Partly</p><p>Are all the source data underlying the results available to ensure full reproducibility?</p><p>Yes</p><p>Is the study design appropriate and is the work technically sound?</p><p>Yes</p><p>Are the conclusions drawn adequately supported by the results?</p><p>Yes</p><p>Are sufficient details of methods and analysis provided to allow replication by others?</p><p>Partly</p><p>Reviewer Expertise:</p><p>Statistics, Public Health</p><p>I confirm that I have read this submission and believe that I have an appropriate level of expertise to confirm that it is of an acceptable scientific standard, however I have significant reservations, as outlined above.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reviewer-report" id="report29118"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.21956/gatesopenres.14270.r29118</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer response for version 1</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Bishwajt</surname><given-names>Ghose</given-names></name><xref rid="r29118a1" ref-type="aff">1</xref><role>Referee</role><contrib-id contrib-id-type="orcid">https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4461-3821</contrib-id></contrib><aff id="r29118a1">
