</xref> to the best of our knowledge, IED induced by barium esophagography has yet to be clearly described. Herein, we report a case of IED in which the wound process was evaluated over time from early onset by esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD).</p></sec><sec id="deo270081-sec-0020"><title>CASE REPORT</title><p>A 70&#x02010;year&#x02010;old man was referred due to computed tomography (CT) findings of irregular esophageal thickening. He had experienced symptoms of esophageal obstruction for 2 months. His medical history included hypertension and postoperative left kidney cancer. However, no other conditions, such as pemphigoid, that could contribute to esophageal fragility were identified. Additionally, he was also not taking antithrombotic medications or undergoing long&#x02010;term steroid therapy. EGD revealed that esophageal cancer extended from the upper thoracic to the mid&#x02010;thoracic esophagus, 26&#x02013;32&#x000a0;cm from the incisors (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="deo270081-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1a&#x02013;c</xref>). The endoscope was able to pass through the area of the esophageal cancer without difficulty, and a marking clip was placed on the oral side of the lesion. Iodine spraying revealed a poorly stained area 21&#x000a0;cm from the incisors, and a biopsy was performed. Pathological findings showed that the lesion was low&#x02010;grade squamous dysplasia and the biopsy included muscularis mucosa (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="deo270081-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>). No lymph node metastasis or distant metastasis was identified on contrast&#x02010;enhanced CT, leading to a diagnosis of cT3N0M0 stage II esophageal cancer. Surgical resection was selected as the treatment strategy, and barium esophagography was conducted immediately following the endoscopy in order to locate the esophageal cancer for preoperative evaluation. The esophagography showed temporary retention of barium in the upper thoracic esophagus due to compression by the tumor, and then flowed away. The patient vomited while ingesting barium for the third time.</p><fig position="float" fig-type="FIGURE" id="deo270081-fig-0001"><label>FIGURE 1</label><caption><p>(a) The esophageal cancer extended from the upper thoracic to the mid&#x02010;thoracic esophagus, 26&#x02013;32&#x000a0;cm from the incisors.

CT revealed an open dissection cavity with drained barium, forming a false lumen and a true lumen (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="deo270081-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3a,b</xref>).

Although surgical resection was considered, the patient's desire to preserve laryngeal function and the extension of the dissection to the cervical esophagus made this option challenging. Consequently, chemotherapy alone was chosen over chemoradiotherapy due to the risk of perforation from radiation. The patient received 5&#x02010;fluorouracil and cisplatin (FP). Two months later, EGD indicated a partial response (PR) with decreased tumor volume and no mucosal damage (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="deo270081-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). The dissection lumen and ulcer were thin but epithelialized, forming a mucosal bridge, and the esophageal wound had healed completely.

</xref> in 1957. This condition is related to esophageal injuries like Mallory&#x02010;Weiss syndrome, which causes esophageal mucosal lacerations, and Boerhaave syndrome, which results in transmural esophageal perforation. Based on the cause of occurrence, it can be classified as spontaneous or traumatic. The spontaneous type is caused by self&#x02010;damage due to increased intraesophageal pressure induced by vomiting<xref rid="deo270081-bib-0002" ref-type="bibr">,<sup>2</sup>
</xref> while the traumatic type is caused by mechanical damage due to endoscopic intervention<xref rid="deo270081-bib-0003" ref-type="bibr">

<sup>4</sup>
</xref> In addition, patients with a history of antithrombotic drug use, hematologic disease, or hemorrhagic tendencies such as dialysis, are more likely to develop this condition.<xref rid="deo270081-bib-0005" ref-type="bibr">

</xref>
</p><p>In the present case, neck&#x02010;chest pain developed after vomiting during the barium esophagography, suggesting that an increase in intraesophageal pressure was the trigger. The esophageal cancer was located in the upper thoracic esophagus at the level of the tracheal carina, which might have caused a stronger increase in internal pressure and vomiting reflex compared to a tumor in the lower thoracic or abdominal esophagus. In addition, before the barium esophagography, a marking clip was placed, and a biopsy for the poorly stained area was performed. Pathological findings revealed damage to the submucosal layer due to the biopsy scraping of the muscularis mucosae (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="deo270081-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>), and the entry site of the dissection cavity was located at 20&#x000a0;cm from the incisors, at the same level as the biopsy site (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="deo270081-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4c,d</xref>). Therefore, it is speculated that the biopsy cut was torn by vomiting, leading to barium filling the dissection cavity due to increased internal pressure. Retrospectively, the poorly stained area approximately 5&#x000a0;mm in diameter without pink&#x02010;color signs is more likely to represent low&#x02010;grade squamous dysplasia. If we had been aware of the risk of IED in advance, the biopsy might not have been performed.</p><p>CT and EGD are considered useful for diagnosing IED,<xref rid="deo270081-bib-0007" ref-type="bibr">

</xref> and we were able to evaluated the wound process of IED over time from early onset. In the case of IED caused by esophageal submucosal hematoma, CT typically reveals a hyperabsorption zone within the dissection cavity suspected of hematoma, but in this case, the dissection cavity was filled with barium. EGD revealed that pressure from the dissection cavity caused elevation and compression of the esophageal mucosa immediately after the disease onset. Over time, the mucous membrane ruptured and the dissection cavity opened further, leaving some mucosa intact and forming a false lumen and a true lumen within the esophagus, resulting in a double&#x02010;barrel esophagus. A comprehensive search was conducted on PubMed using the keywords &#x0201c;intramural, esophageal, and dissection&#x0201d; which identified a total of 48 cases of IED diagnosed between 2004 and 2024. Among these, a false lumen remained in 20 cases following IED.</p><p>Conservative treatment with fasting is the principal therapy for this disease and may include mucosal protective agents or antacid agents such as proton pump inhibitors.<xref rid="deo270081-bib-0009" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>9</sup>
</xref> The prognosis is relatively good, with esophageal ulcers covered by normal mucosa within 1&#x02013;2 months and stenosis rarely observed. However, long dissection cavity where food residue tends to accumulate may become infected and abscessed. In such cases, the septum forming the dissection cavity can be cut off and left open.<xref rid="deo270081-bib-0010" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>10</sup>
</xref> In the present case, however, since the wound healed without infection after the patient resumed eating, endoscopic treatment was not chosen. Furthermore, as the patient's condition was stable, chemotherapy was administered for esophageal cancer. Although there are no reports on treating esophageal cancer complicated by IED, we selected chemotherapy instead of chemoradiotherapy or surgery due to the risk of radiation perforation and preservation of laryngeal function. Chemotherapy did not cause mucosal injury and any other adverse events in the dissected cavity, achieving a PR.</p><p>In conclusion, we report a case of IED caused by vomiting during a barium esophagography following endoscopic biopsy in a patient with advanced esophageal cancer. This case suggests that, especially in patients with esophageal obstruction which can induce vomiting during esophagography, endoscopic biopsy could pose a risk of developing IED and should be carefully considered or potentially avoided.</p></sec><sec sec-type="COI-statement" id="deo270081-sec-0050"><title>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT</title><p>None.</p></sec><sec id="deo270081-sec-0060"><title>ETHICS STATEMENT</title><p>All procedures followed were performed in accordance with the ethical standards of the Declaration of Helsinki and its later amendments.</p></sec><sec id="deo270081-sec-0070"><title>PATIENT CONSENT STATEMENT</title><p>Informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report.</p></sec><sec id="deo270081-sec-0080"><title>CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION</title><p>N/A.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="deo270081-sec-0040"><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>We express our gratitude to the former and current staff of the Gastroenterology Department at Chutoen General Medical Center.</p></ack><ref-list id="deo270081-bibl-0001"><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="deo270081-bib-0001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal" id="deo270081-cite-0001">
