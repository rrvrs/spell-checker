These reactions are mediated particularly by catecholamines and prostaglandins. The PROSPER trial aimed to evaluate whether a perioperative drug repurposing with a non-selective betablocker (propranolol) and a COX-2 inhibitor (etodolac) is feasible and safe in the setting of pancreatic cancer surgery.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">Patients undergoing partial pancreatoduodenectomy for pancreatic cancer were randomized to perioperative treatment with propranolol and etodolac or placebo. Main safety endpoint was the rate of serious adverse events (SAE) and the main feasibility endpoint was adherence. Overall and disease-free survival (DFS) as well as recurrences were assessed as efficacy parameters and the trial was accompanied by a translational study.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">The trial was prematurely closed due to slow recruitment. 26 patients were randomized, but 6 never started trial medication. Finally, 9 patients received the trial medication and 11 patients placebo. There were 6 SAE in the treatment vs. 14 in the placebo group. Adherence was lower in the treatment group, but without statistically significance. Median DFS was 16.36&#x000a0;months (95%-CI 1.18 &#x02013; not reached) in verum vs. 11.25 (95%-CI 2.2 &#x02013; 17.25) in placebo group. The rate of distant recurrences was 11.1% in verum vs. 54.5% in placebo group.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par4">There were no safety concerns, but the trial intervention was not feasible given slow recruitment and limited adherence. However, the translational study and preliminary efficacy data revealed some promising findings, warranting further investigation.</p><p id="Par5"><bold>Registration:</bold> DRKS00014054.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Pancreatic cancer</kwd><kwd>Perioperative period</kwd><kwd>Inflammation</kwd><kwd>Betablockade</kwd><kwd>COX-2-inhibition</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/100016627</institution-id><institution>Anticancer Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>A56</award-id><award-id>A56</award-id><award-id>A56</award-id><award-id>A56</award-id><award-id>A56</award-id><award-id>A56</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Universit&#x000e4;tsklinikum Heidelberg (8914)</institution></funding-source></award-group><open-access><p>Open Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL.</p></open-access></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par6">Pancreatic cancer is a devastating disease and in contrast to many other cancer entities its incidence and mortality have constantly been rising in recent years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Despite improvements in multimodal therapy of pancreatic cancer, the overall prognosis is still dismal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Radical oncologic surgery remains the cornerstone of curatively-intended treatment of pancreatic cancer, however surgery is only possible in a subset of patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. But even among those patients undergoing surgery, the risk of local or distant recurrence is high. Although a median overall survival of 54 months can be reached with modern multimodal treatment concepts, the median disease-free survival is only 21.6 months caused by distant metastatic recurrence in most of the cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">There is evidence from preclinical and clinical studies that the perioperative period plays an important role in surgical treatment of cancer, which is currently not harnessed for cancer-directed therapy. This period spanning a few weeks from diagnosis (or end of neoadjuvant therapy) until the start of adjuvant therapy is characterized by psychological and physical stress and inflammatory responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. These reactions are mainly mediated by an excessive release of catecholamines and prostaglandins. The resulting physiological changes can create a protumorigenic or prometastatic environment, potentially facilitating cancer progression or recurrence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">A combined treatment with betablockers and cyclooxygenase inhibitors (COX-inhibitors) in terms of drug repurposing promises an easy and effective approach to mitigate these effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Beta-blockers, such as propranolol, inhibit the effects of catecholamines, and COX-inhibitors, like etodolac, reduce the inflammatory response mediated by prostaglandins. The aim of the current randomized, placebo-controlled phase II trial was to assess whether a perioperative combined treatment with propranolol and etodolac is safe and feasible in patients undergoing partial pancreatoduodenectomy for pancreatic cancer.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Trial design</title><p id="Par9">PROSPER was a randomized, patient and observer blinded, placebo-controlled, phase II trial, which was performed at the Department of General, Visceral and Transplantation Surgery of the University Hospital Heidelberg.</p><p id="Par10">All relevant trial documents including the protocol were approved by the independent ethics committee of the University of Heidelberg and the competent authority, i.e. the German Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices.

The list was generated by personnel not otherwise involved in the trial. The hospital&#x02019;s pharmacy manufactured consecutively numbered packages of trial medication of either verum or placebo according to the random list, which were delivered to the trial center in small batches on demand. If a new trial participant was included, the package with the lowest remaining number was handed over to the patient by an investigator or designated representative. Patients and trial staff including treating physicians/surgeons, outcome assessors, data collectors and data analysts were blinded to group assignment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Procedures</title><p id="Par14">In the experimental group, patients received propranolol 2&#x02009;&#x000d7; 20 mg/day for 10 days preoperatively, 2&#x02009;&#x000d7; 40 mg on the day of surgery and one week thereafter and 2&#x02009;&#x000d7; 20 mg/day during the second postoperative week.

In the control group, patients received placebo tablets/capsules of the same appearance, size and weight as propranolol and etodolac twice per day for a period of 25 days perioperatively starting 10 days before surgery. Partial pancreatoduodenectomy was performed according to local standards at the Department of General, Visceral and Transplantation Surgery of the University Hospital Heidelberg within a perioperative fast-track concept [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Follow up</title><p id="Par15">Thirteen trial visits were planned per patient including a screening visit, visits on the day before surgery, the day of surgery, postoperative days 1, 3, 5, 7, 14 (or day of discharge) and 30, as well as follow-up visits 3, 6, 12 and 24 months after surgery. A detailed trial schedule can be found in the published protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Outcomes</title><p id="Par16">Outcome parameters consisted of safety endpoints, feasibility endpoints, efficacy endpoints and biological endpoints. The main safety parameter was the rate of serious adverse events (SAE) and serious adverse reactions (SAR) within a period of 3&#x000a0;months postoperatively. Furthermore, 30- and 90-day mortality, pancreas-associated morbidity including postoperative pancreatic fistula [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], delayed gastric emptying [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and postpancreatectomy hemorrhage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] according to the respective ISGPS definitions, postoperative biliary leakage according to the ISGLS definition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and postoperative intra-abdominal fluid collection or abscess were assessed. The main feasibility parameter was adherence to study medication quantified by measuring the percentage of actually taken trial medication from planned trial medication. In order to evaluate the possibility of implementing the intervention into routine treatment, completion of adjuvant chemotherapy was assessed as an additional measure of feasibility. Overall and disease-free survival (OS and DFS) as well as rates of local and distant recurrence were gathered as efficacy endpoints. Biological endpoints consisted of full blood count, C-reactive protein (CRP), albumin, creatinine clearance, bilirubin, international normalized ratio (INR), aspartate and alanine aminotransferase (AST and ALT), cancer antigen 19&#x02013;9 (CA 19&#x02013;9) and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA).</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Translational part of the trial</title><p id="Par17">The trial was amended by a translational part aimed at gaining deeper insights into the biological effects of the intervention. Peripheral blood samples were collected at several points of time as outlined in the published protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Furthermore, a portal venous blood sample was taken during surgery to assess circulating tumor cells and a tissue biopsy of the tumor region as well as normal pancreatic tissue was taken from the resected specimen. The translational investigations included phenotyping of circulating immune cells by multicolor flow cytometry (fluorescence-activated cell sorting/FACS) analysis targeting specific immune cell populations (leucocytes, granulocytes, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), monocytes, lymphocytes, natural killer cells (NK-cells), B-cells, T-cells, CD4<sup>+</sup>T-cells, CD8<sup>+</sup>T-cells and natural killer T-cells (NKT-cells) with antibodies against CD3, CD4, CD8, CD14, CD16, CD20, CD25, CD45, and CD56 antigens as established by Oras et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Furthermore, serum samples were analyzed for interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels by commercial ELISA kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc) as IL-6 is a key cytokine mediating systemic inflammation and cancer progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p id="Par18">Immunohistochemistry was conducted on 4&#x000a0;&#x000b5;M-sectioned paraffin-embedded tumor tissues using standard protocol with following steps: I) antigen retrieval with a citrate buffer at pH =&#x02009;6, II) consequent blocking with peroxide and Universal Powerblock solutions, III) exposure to the primary antibodies (CD8, CD45, CD68) overnight at 4&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C, IV) washing and incubation with secondary antibodies and peroxide-diaminobenzidine(DAB)-based visualisation reagents from DAKO EnVision +&#x02009;System and V) counterstaining with haematoxylin and mounting of the slides. Whole-slide images were acquired with NanoZoomer 2.0 HT scan system (Hamamatsu, Hamamatsu City, Japan) and scanned at 20 &#x000d7;&#x02009;magnification. Quantification of immune cells was performed using a software-based image analysis system (HALO v3.5, Indica Labs, UK). The cell density in immune cell conglomerates was estimated as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Quantification algorithms were used individually for each distinctive staining protocol according to the intensity of DAB staining.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="Par19">Due to the exploratory nature of the trial, no formal sample size calculation was performed. Instead, the sample size was suggested by a panel of clinical and methodological experts at the investigators&#x02019; institution. A total of 80 patients (40 per group) was considered to be acceptable to assess safety and feasibility and to create first efficacy data for planning of a subsequent confirmatory trial. Thus, it was planned to randomize a total of 100 patients within the trial considering an estimated drop-out rate of 20%.</p><p id="Par20">Since this trial had to be stopped prematurely due to insufficient recruitment, all analyses within this trial were performed in an exploratory fashion on the safety set comprising all subjects who received trial treatment at least once. In the safety set, patients were grouped according to study treatment they received.</p><p id="Par21">The primary feasibility endpoint, i.e. adherence, was defined as relative amount of actual drug intake compared to planned drug intake. More precisely, the relative amount is the number of tablets/capsules taken divided by the planned number of tablets/capsules to be taken. If the planned number is lower than the taken number, the number planned is set to the taken one. Patients prematurely dropping out are included with 0 tablets/capsules for days thereafter. Patients were considered until death or premature closure of the trial or regular end. Sometimes a higher dose was administered than prescribed. To assess underdosing, prescribed was capped at administered, ignoring overdosing. Adherence was analyzed once descriptively and once using binomial regression with random effects.</p><p id="Par22">The rate of SAEs was used as the primary safety variable. It was analyzed using a Poisson regression model using the time under risk as an offset and treatment group as an explanatory variable. The number of SAE within the relevant time interval was used as dependent variable, i.e. time from treatment start till visit 10 or last contact. The offset was log (time interval in months). A Wald confidence interval was calculated. In addition, the number of SAEs and the number of patients with at least one SAE was analyzed.</p><p id="Par23">Overall survival since randomization and disease-free survival since surgery were analyzed using Kaplan&#x02013;Meier methods. The two patients who did not have a surgery were excluded from the analysis of disease-free survival.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Results</title><p id="Par24">This trial was prematurely closed due to feasibility reasons in terms of slow recruitment despite several adjustments of the trial design. A total of 1026 patients that presented to the outpatient clinic of the European Pancreatic Center at Heidelberg University Hospital between January 2019 and September 2020 were screened. Finally, 26 patients were randomized to perioperative treatment with propranolol +&#x02009;etodolac (<italic>n</italic> = 14) or placebo (<italic>n</italic> = 12). Six of them, five in the verum group and one in the placebo group, never started intake of trial medication.

Unfortunately, the trial was unable to fulfil its recruitment goals and had to be prematurely closed, despite several adjustments of the trial design. Thus, the key finding of this pilot trial is that the intervention was not feasible within the current trial setting, although there were no safety concerns regarding the intervention. However, some interesting findings can be obtained by the results of the efficacy and translational analyses.</p><p id="Par33">Looking at feasibility in more detail, there was insufficient recruitment on the one hand, but also a limited adherence to trial medication, particularly in the postoperative period, on the other hand. The main reasons for not recruiting potentially eligible patients were prior intake of betablockers, possible interactions with other medication or concerns by patients or the general practitioners regarding trial treatment. This limits the widespread application of the combination therapy with propranolol and etodolac substantially. In a retrospective analysis of the institutional pancreatic database at the University of Heidelberg, almost 30% of patients undergoing resection for pancreatic cancer received concurrent betablocker therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] corroborating this frequent reason for exclusion. Regarding the reduced adherence in the postoperative period, it might have been cumbersome for patients to take 2 capsules (propranolol or placebo) +&#x02009;2 tablets (etodolac or placebo) in the morning and in the evening in the early postoperative period after a partial pancreatoduodenectomy, since delayed gastric emptying is a frequent problem after partial pancreatoduodenectomy. This problem could be overcome by a single tablet preparation of verum and placebo in future trials, but currently there is no pharmaceutical company manufacturing this preparation to our knowledge. Furthermore, since the administration form was the same in the verum and placebo groups, this does not explain the relevant difference in adherence between both groups. Regarding the concerns that led to early termination of the trial medication intake or to not even starting it, an even closer communication with both, patients and their general practitioners, could have improved the feasibility and the compliance within this trial. Additionally, patients or patient representatives should most likely be involved already in the planning phase of a potential future trial to avoid such problems.</p><p id="Par34">Regarding safety of the trial intervention, there were no concerns in terms of the main safety endpoint as there were no SAR observed. Moreover, the number of SAE was actually higher in the placebo group compared to the verum group. Furthermore, there were no relevant differences in postoperative mortality with only one death until postoperative day 90. Considering postoperative pancreas-specific complications, it is worth mentioning that there were no cases of postoperative pancreatic fistula in the verum group. Due to the small sample size, this might have been just caused by chance. However, this might also be attributed to an unexpected effect of the trial treatment &#x02013; in particular the COX-2 inhibitor &#x02013; on pancreatic secretion and warrants further investigation. The underlying mechanisms could be similar to the ones of NSAIDs in the prevention of post-ERCP pancreatitis, which is even recommended by current guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Other pancreas-specific complications did not show notable differences.</p><p id="Par35">Considering the efficacy endpoints, interpretation needs to be very cautious, because of the limited sample size and the fact that not all patients had a pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma on final histology and the tumor stages differed substantially. However, one could even argue that the pathology results were to the disadvantage of the verum group, since there were even two non-malignant cases in the placebo group and one patient with previously undetected liver metastases that could not be curatively resected in the verum group. Both, median overall and disease-free survival were longer in the verum group, but probably the most notable difference was the difference in distant recurrences with 54.5% in the placebo group and 11.1% in the verum group. This is supportive to the underlying mechanistic rationale of the trial intervention that the protumorigenic/prometastatic effect caused by an excess release of catecholamines and prostaglandins in the perioperative period can be effectively inhibited by propranolol and etodolac. In a similar trial by Haldar et al., in 34 patients with colorectal cancer there was also a markedly reduction of recurrences in the treatment group with propranolol and etodolac (12.5%) compared to the placebo group (33.3%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. These findings further corroborate preclinical studies by the same group that the combined treatment with propranolol and etodolac may reduce metastases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Renz et al. also demonstrated the importance of catecholamines and beta-2-adrenergic signalling in PDAC in a preclinical study. Furthermore, they demonstrated in a cohort of 631 PDAC patients that the intake of a non-selective betablocker, such as propranolol, led to an improved overall survival compared to patients without betablocker therapy (40 vs. 23 months median overall survival) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p id="Par36">Regarding the translational part of the trial, not all investigations could be accomplished as planned, because of shortcomings in specimen sampling and quality. Furthermore, the results can only be interpreted very cautiously, due to the limited sample size. However, trial treatment seemed to cause a more rapid normalization of post-operative systemic inflammation in terms of faster normalization of IL-6 and mitigation of post-operative loss of immune effectors. Additionally, the quantification of immune cells in the tumor microenvironment was indicative of a modification of the local immune milieu towards increased peritumoral inflammation.</p><p id="Par37">Despite of the strengths of the PROSPER trial in terms of its randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design, there are some limitations, which need to be considered in the interpretation of the findings. First, the sample size remained far behind the planned goals and thus, all analyses could only be conducted in an exploratory fashion. Second, adherence to the trial intervention was limited, which might have influenced its therapeutic effect. Third, the patient cohort was heterogeneous regarding the underlying diseases and disease stages on final pathology. Fourth, only the combined treatment with propranolol and etodolac was compared to placebo and we did not assess the effect of each drug as a monotherapy. However, this decision was based on previous research on this topic demonstrating the best effect for the combined treatment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par38">In conclusion, although there were no safety concerns, a perioperative drug repurposing with propranolol and etodolac in the perioperative period surrounding partial pancreatoduodenectomy was not feasible within the current trial. Nonetheless, the exploratory results of the trial revealed some interesting findings, which merit further investigation in future projects. Apart from that, novel strategies for cancer-directed therapy in the perioperative period should be investigated in future trials.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher's Note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Authors contributions</title><p>FJH, CWM, MWB and MKD conceived and designed the trial, supervised trial conduct, participated in data analysis and interpretation, and prepared and wrote the report.
