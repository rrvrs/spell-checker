Early in the pandemic, discharges to SNFs decreased (from roughly 19% of Medicare hospital discharges in 2019 to about 14% in late 2020), while discharges home with home health care rose, making home health the dominant post-acute care setting by mid-2020.<sup><xref rid="qxaf056-B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="qxaf056-B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> These shifts were influenced by multiple factors, including infection concerns in congregate settings, workforce shortages, and changing patient and provider preferences. Although some rebound in SNF admissions for post-acute care has occurred, evidence suggests the pandemic accelerated a preexisting trend toward utilization of home-based care.<sup><xref rid="qxaf056-B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Importantly, while discharge dispositions to SNFs began to rebound by 2022, it remains unclear whether this recovery was uniform across all patient populations and payer types, particularly for high-risk individuals with complex chronic conditions who often require more intensive post-acute care services.<sup><xref rid="qxaf056-B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup></p><p>Even before the pandemic, Medicare post-acute care utilization was undergoing significant transformation due to payment policy changes. In October 2019, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) implemented the Patient-Driven Payment Model (PDPM) for SNFs, which shifted from therapy volume-based payments to a case-mix classification system based on patient characteristics.<sup><xref rid="qxaf056-B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> Similarly, in January 2020, CMS introduced the Patient-Driven Groupings Model (PDGM) for home health, replacing the previous episode-based payment approach with a patient needs-based system.<sup><xref rid="qxaf056-B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> These reforms created financial incentives that likely influenced discharge patterns. For instance, PDPM encouraged SNFs to admit more medically complex patients while shortening lengths of stay, while PDGM restructured home health payments based on patient characteristics rather than service volume.<sup><xref rid="qxaf056-B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> The timing of these payment reforms, implemented just before or during the early stages of the pandemic, creates an important backdrop for understanding the evolution of discharge disposition patterns during this period.</p><p>While prior research has explored overall COVID-19 effects on healthcare utilization and outcomes, less is known about how these trends differed between patients hospitalized with and without COVID or between traditional Medicare (TM) beneficiaries and Medicare Advantage (MA) enrollees. With over half of all Medicare beneficiaries being enrolled in MA,<sup><xref rid="qxaf056-B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> understanding differences in care patterns and outcomes between these payer types is increasingly important for Medicare policy development. Historical evidence indicates that MA enrollees typically receive less post-acute care overall, including fewer days in SNFs, lower use of inpatient rehabilitation facilities, and reduced home health care utilization, compared to TM beneficiaries, yet experience lower hospital readmission rates and higher rates of successful discharge to the community.<sup><xref rid="qxaf056-B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="qxaf056-B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Given these historical differences, MA plans, with their capitated payment structure, flexible benefit design and incentives to manage utilization, may have been able to respond differently than TM to pandemic-related challenges.<sup><xref rid="qxaf056-B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup></p><p>Additionally, most existing studies have focused on the acute phase of the pandemic (2020-2021), with limited investigation into how trends evolved as healthcare systems adapted and the pandemic waned.<sup><xref rid="qxaf056-B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Understanding these longer-term patterns is crucial for informing health system resilience and preparedness for future public health emergencies.</p><p>This study aims to address these knowledge gaps by examining trends in hospital length of stay, discharge disposition patterns, and mortality outcomes among Medicare beneficiaries with 5 common and high-risk conditions: dementia, diabetes, congestive heart failure (CHF), hip fracture, and stroke. Using Medicare claims data from 2018 to 2022, we examined how these outcomes differed by COVID-19 status and Medicare payer type, and how these patterns evolved throughout the pandemic period.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="qxaf056-s1"><title>Methods</title><sec id="qxaf056-s1.1"><title>Study population and data</title><p>We analyzed unique hospital discharges identified using the Medicare Provider Analysis and Review (MedPAR) file, between January 2018 and December 2022. MedPAR aggregates inpatient claims to the stay-level for 100% of Medicare beneficiaries who had an inpatient admission to an acute care, rehabilitation, or psychiatric hospital. Claims were linked to the Master Beneficiary Summary File (MBSF) using unique patient identifiers to obtain demographics, MA enrollment in a given month, Medicaid eligibility, and the date of death. We classified beneficiaries as MA enrollees if they were enrolled in an MA plan during the month of their hospital discharge. The study included beneficiaries Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 and older who were discharged with at least one of the following diagnoses documented during their hospitalization: Alzheimer's disease or related dementias, diabetes, CHF, hip fracture, or stroke. Diagnoses were identified from all 25 diagnosis fields in the MedPAR record of the index hospitalization using the enhanced Chronic Conditions Data Warehouse International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) code algorithms published in 2020.<sup><xref rid="qxaf056-B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> While all beneficiaries in the sample qualified for Medicare based on age, a small proportion (&#x0003c;2%) also qualified through end-stage renal disease entitlement. We excluded beneficiaries who had used inpatient services in the previous 6 months to focus on incident hospitalizations. COVID-19 status was determined using ICD-10 diagnosis codes documented in any of the 25 diagnosis fields in MedPAR during the index hospitalization. Following the approach used by CMS, we used codes U07.1 and B97.29 prior to the introduction of code U07.1 in April 2020, and U07.1 only from April 2020 onward.<sup><xref rid="qxaf056-B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> We defined the pandemic period as beginning in March 2020 during the first U.S. wave.</p></sec><sec id="qxaf056-s1.2"><title>Key measures</title><p>Our outcomes include hospital length of stay (days between the date of admission and discharge), discharge destination identified on the inpatient claim (home/self-care, skilled nursing facility, home health services, or inpatient rehabilitation facility), and 30-day all-cause mortality (assessed using MBSF death dates).</p></sec><sec id="qxaf056-s1.3"><title>Analytic approach</title><p>We estimated trends in monthly discharge dispositions using regression models to generate risk-adjusted probabilities of an outcome in each month, controlling for age, sex, race, dual eligibility status, Charlson Comorbidity Index computed from hospital diagnoses, the aforementioned comorbidity diagnoses, and hospital fixed effects. The models included interaction terms between month-year and payer type, and between month-year and COVID-19 status, allowing us to estimate differential trends by payer type and COVID-19 diagnosis. We used linear regression for hospital length of stay and logit models for binary outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="qxaf056-s1.4"><title>Limitations</title><p>Our results should be interpreted within the context of certain limitations. First, while we controlled for observable patient characteristics and hospital fixed effects, unobserved differences between MA and TM beneficiaries may influence our findings. Second, our analysis focused on beneficiaries with specific comorbidities, and results may not generalize to the broader Medicare population. Third, because our identification of comorbidities relies on Medicare claims data, it may be subject to coding differences between TM and MA. Given that MA plans have been shown to exhibit higher coding intensity, it is possible that some observed differences in comorbidity burden reflect differential coding rather than true clinical differences.<sup><xref rid="qxaf056-B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="qxaf056-B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> Fourth, our study relies on MedPAR data, which likely undercounts MA beneficiary hospitalizations because hospitals don't directly bill CMS for these stays. While we used MBSF enrollment data to classify MA status, the underlying sample may not fully represent all MA hospitalizations. This reporting bias varies by hospital characteristics and service types, and the extent of underreporting remains uncertain, as noted in MedPAC analyses.<sup><xref rid="qxaf056-B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> Finally, our data cannot fully capture the impact of important factors like vaccination status or specific therapeutic interventions that emerged during the pandemic.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="qxaf056-s2"><title>Results</title><p>From January 2018 to December 2022, we observed 20 991 657 hospital discharges of Medicare beneficiaries with dementia, diabetes, CHF, hip fracture, or stroke, including 1 123 615 discharges for patients with COVID (<xref rid="qxaf056-T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Patient characteristics and outcomes differed between the pre-pandemic and pandemic periods. Compared to all pre-pandemic patients, COVID patients were more likely to be dual-eligible (30% vs 23%) and have diabetes (64% vs 57%); and were less likely to have a stroke (4.6% vs 9.5%) or hip fracture (2.1% vs 6.4%), or be discharged home with self-care (34% vs 43%). COVID patients experienced longer hospital stays (mean, 8.7 vs 5.1 days), were more likely to require intensive care unit admission (40% vs 33%), and had nearly triple the 30-day mortality rate (27% vs 9.7%) than pre-pandemic patients. (<xref rid="qxaf056-T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Total discharge volume dropped during the initial wave of the pandemic, reaching a low of 238 000 discharges in April 2020 compared to typical monthly discharges of 340 000-370 000 pre-pandemic (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S1</xref>).

During the pandemic, COVID patients experienced longer hospital stays, lower likelihood of discharge to home with self-care, and higher mortality rates compared to patients without COVID. However, these patterns for the 2 groups generally converged by the second quarter of 2022. Additionally, we observed significant shifts in post-acute care utilization patterns, with a notable transition toward home health care that began to converge between COVID and non-COVID patients by early 2021, coinciding with the widespread availability of COVID-19 vaccines.</p><p>A key contribution of this study is the observation of differences in outcomes for MA enrollees and TM beneficiaries. While both MA and TM beneficiaries showed similar overall trends, MA enrollees, both those with and without COVID, on average experienced modestly longer hospital stays. Additionally, MA beneficiaries demonstrated higher utilization of home health services compared to TM beneficiaries, whereas TM enrollees had greater use of inpatient rehabilitation facilities. Interestingly, this finding contrasts with earlier studies that have found MA enrollees to have lower rates of home health care, attributed to more restrictive prior authorization processes and frequent recertification requirements for home health services.<sup><xref rid="qxaf056-B29" ref-type="bibr">29-32</xref></sup> This contrast could be driven by our focus on hospitalizations with 5 selected comorbidities. The differences in discharge disposition patterns between MA and TM beneficiaries, even during a public health crisis, suggest that program-level incentives and care management approaches may influence service use.</p><p>Mortality rates among hospitalized COVID patients fluctuated over time, declining significantly after the first wave of the pandemic as knowledge and therapeutics for inpatient management of COVID-19 improved, and then again with the introduction of COVID-19 vaccines in December 2020.<sup><xref rid="qxaf056-B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> Mortality increased again during the Delta variant surge in the summer of 2021,<sup><xref rid="qxaf056-B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> and then declined again in late 2021 and early 2022 with the emergence of the Omicron variants which were more contagious but less lethal than prior strains.<sup><xref rid="qxaf056-B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> Other factors, including broader population immunity due both to vaccination and natural infection and improved clinical management of COVID-19, including the emergence of antivirals and monoclonal antibodies, contributed to this transition to the &#x0201c;new normal.&#x0201d;<sup><xref rid="qxaf056-B36" ref-type="bibr">36-39</xref></sup> Importantly, the similar mortality patterns observed among MA and TM beneficiaries, despite some differences in post-acute care use, suggest that insurance type had little influence on mortality, underscoring the dominant clinical impact of COVID-19 on high-risk populations regardless of payer type.</p><p>Our study also identified a significant shift in post-acute care patterns. Comparing before and after the pandemic, we observed a decline in discharges to SNF, decreasing from 11.9% to 9.6% among non-COVID patients. Concurrently, the proportion of patients discharged to home&#x02014;both with and without home health care&#x02014;increased. These findings point to a broader trend away from SNFs during the pandemic, likely driven by concerns about infection risk and evolving care preferences.<sup><xref rid="qxaf056-B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup></p><p>These trends in discharge patterns have several policy implications for Medicare. First, the shift toward home-based post-acute care highlights the need for appropriate infrastructure and reimbursement to support post-acute care in the home setting.<sup><xref rid="qxaf056-B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="qxaf056-B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> The recent change in Medicare's home health payment model to the PDGM, which shifted reimbursement to be based on patient clinical characteristics rather than service volume, needs ongoing evaluation to ensure it incentivizes appropriate home-based care for high-risk patients.<sup><xref rid="qxaf056-B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> Second, access to telehealth and remote monitoring services could potentially help support safe transitions to home for certain patients with chronic illness. During the pandemic, CMS temporarily expanded telehealth coverage, allowing providers to virtually engage patients at home when in-person visits posed risks&#x0200b;.<sup><xref rid="qxaf056-B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup> Making some of these telehealth flexibilities permanent, with appropriate safeguards and ongoing evaluation of their effectiveness, may help improve continuity of care for recently discharged patients by enabling timely virtual check-ins, monitoring of symptoms, and follow-up consultations&#x0200b;. Third, investment in the home-based care workforce is critical. The pandemic exacerbated nationwide shortages of nurses, therapists, home health aides, and other direct care workers, straining the capacity of home health providers.<sup><xref rid="qxaf056-B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup> Policymakers may need to bolster workforce development programs and incentives to attract and retain qualified home health professionals. For example, several states have used American Rescue Plan Act funds and Medicaid waivers to strengthen their direct care workforce, and similar investment strategies could be considered within Medicare (or through cross-payer initiatives) to ensure an adequate supply of home-based care services for Medicare beneficiaries.<sup><xref rid="qxaf056-B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup></p><p>Our findings also highlight the importance of having comprehensive discharge and transitional care plans in place for both TM and MA populations, particularly those with chronic illness after hospitalization for COVID-19. Value-based care initiatives like the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program incentivize improved discharge planning and care coordination for conditions common in our study cohort.<sup><xref rid="qxaf056-B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup> Policy efforts could focus on strengthening evidence-based discharge planning and post-discharge follow-up across both payment models, perhaps by enhancing reimbursement for transitional care management services. Ultimately, our findings suggest that quality of care transitions, rather than payer type, are associated with outcomes for vulnerable patient populations during public health emergencies.</p><p>In conclusion, our analysis highlights the evolving impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on hospital discharge dispositions and post-acute care patterns among Medicare beneficiaries. While differences between COVID and non-COVID patients attenuated over time, the pandemic accelerated a shift away from post-acute care provided in SNFs toward home-based care. These findings underscore the need for continued monitoring and adaptive health policies to support vulnerable populations in the face of future public health challenges.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="sup1" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>qxaf056_Supplementary_Data</label><media xlink:href="qxaf056_supplementary_data.zip"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="ack1"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We are thankful to the editors and the anonymous reviewers for their insightful feedback, which enhanced the quality of our article.</p></ack><sec id="qxaf056-s4"><title>Supplementary material</title><p>
