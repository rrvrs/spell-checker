The activation of HSCs is influenced by paracrine signaling interactions among various liver cell types, but molecular mechanisms remain to be elucidated. Secretory Meteorin-like (Metrnl) can effectively ameliorate fulminant hepatitis. However, little is known about its role in liver fibrosis. In our study, we found that hepatic Metrnl mRNA transcripts and protein expression were significantly downregulated in patients and mouse models of hepatic fibrosis. Hepatocyte-specific and global knockout of Metrnl exacerbated CCl4-induced liver fibrosis. In contrast, the administration recombinant Metrnl or AAV-Metrnl overexpression markedly ameliorated CCl4-induced liver fibrosis in mice, suggesting a protective role for Metrnl. Mechanistically, hepatocyte-derived Metrnl not only influences the activation of HSCs through paracrine signaling but also modulates the release of the fibrogenic cytokine PDGFB via the transcription factor EGR1, thereby regulating PDGFB/PDGFR&#x003b2; signaling to affect HSC activation. Furthermore, Metrnl absence in hepatocytes and HSCs leads to the downregulation of the E3 ubiquitin ligase HECW2, inhibiting K48-linked ubiquitination of FN and preventing its proteasomal degradation, thus promoting FN secretion from HSCs. These effects contribute to ECM deposition and the activation of HSCs, ultimately exacerbating liver fibrosis. Collectively, our study reveals Metrnl as a novel regulator of liver fibrosis that mediates communication between hepatocytes and HSCs, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target for liver fibrosis. The identification of Metrnl as a critical player in the pathogenesis of hepatic fibrosis underscores the importance of understanding cellular crosstalk in the progression of liver disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Diseases</kwd><kwd>Mechanisms of disease</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China (No.82170743).</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China (National Science Foundation of China)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>82000741, 32160207</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhou</surname><given-names>Yuxia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Excellent Young Talents Plan of Guizhou Medical University (2021105).

Advanced liver fibrosis can lead to severe complications like cirrhosis, liver failure, and hepatocellular carcinoma, thereby increasing global morbidity and mortality rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Despite the use of conventional anti-fibrotic drugs, many patients still experience persistent fibrosis. Currently, liver transplantation is the only effective treatment for end-stage liver disease; however, its availability is limited due to donor shortages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms of liver fibrosis regression could help identify new therapeutic targets.</p><p id="Par3">Multiple cell types, including hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), hepatocytes, Kupffer cells, and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells are involved in liver fibrosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The activation of latent HSCs is a key event in liver fibrosis and occurs when HSCs interact with other viable and infiltrating hepatocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. This leads to the production of different inflammatory factors and fibrotic cytokines. Upon microenvironmental stimulation, quiescent HSCs can transform into activated myofibroblast-like cells that exhibit fibrotic characteristics. These activated HSCs express &#x003b1;-smooth muscle actin (&#x003b1;-SMA) and produce excessive extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, resulting in fibrosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. However, the regulation of HSC activation and the interaction between HSCs and other liver cells are not well understood. Therefore, understanding these interactions is crucial for gaining a deeper understanding chronic liver disease biology and discovering potential therapeutic targets.</p><p id="Par4">Meteorin-like (Metrnl) is expressed in various tissues, such as adipose tissue, skin, liver, and cardiac tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], acting as a myokine or adipokine that plays a role in regulating metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].

Furthermore, Metrnl deficiency has been linked to decreased blood HDL cholesterol levels under a high-fat diet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], while overexpression of Metrnl has shown effectiveness in ameliorating fulminant hepatitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], indicating a potential role of Metrnl in liver function. Despite these findings, the specific role of Metrnl in regulating liver disease, particularly fibrosis, and the underlying mechanisms of hepatic Metrnl function remain unclear.</p><p id="Par5">This study aimed to investigate the impact of Metrnl in liver disease using CCl4-induced liver injury mouse models with Metrnl global knockout, HSC-specific knockout, and hepatocyte-specific knockout mice, as well as in patients with fibrotic livers. The study also explored the effects of restoring Metrnl expression on liver fibrosis through the administration of Metrnl recombinant protein and gene overexpression. Additionally, the research delved into the potential mechanisms through which Metrnl may regulate liver fibrosis. The findings of this study offer valuable insights into fibrosis control and emphasize the critical role of Metrnl in safeguarding the liver against fibrosis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>The expression of Metrnl is decreased in activated HSCs and fibrotic liver</title><p id="Par6">Previously, we reported that Metrnl exhibits widespread expression across multiple adult tissues, with particularly elevated levels in mouse livers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. To investigate its potential implications in the pathogenesis of liver disease, we conducted an initial examination of Metrnl&#x02019;s expression in both healthy and fibrotic human livers. Utilizing immunohistochemical (IHC) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) staining techniques, we observed a significant downregulation of hepatic Metrnl protein and mRNA in fibrotic livers compared to their healthy counterparts (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1A&#x02013;C</xref>). Immunofluorescence analysis of liver tissue from CCl4-induced mice demonstrated that activated hepatic stellate cell (HSC) markers, such as &#x003b1;-SMA, exhibited minimal colocalization with Metrnl, as indicated by the white arrow (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1D</xref>). Furthermore, Metrnl was primarily expressed in hepatocytes. The literature indicates that Metrnl is also secreted by infiltrating monocytes and macrophages; however, using the macrophage marker F4/80, we found that Metrnl expression in macrophages within the liver tissue of CCl4 model mice was nearly absent (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1D</xref>). This suggests that Metrnl is predominantly expressed in hepatocytes and HSCs, closely associated with fibrosis.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>The expression of Metrnl is decreased in activated HSCs and fibrotic liver.</title><p>Representative IHC staining and FISH staining of Metrnl (<bold>A</bold>), along with quantitative (<bold>B</bold>, <bold>C</bold>) (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;8-15 fields) were conducted on liver tissues from humans with liver fibrosis (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;6), fibrosis cirrhosis (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;5), and healthy controls (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;6).

Additionally, immunofluorescence studies revealed a reduction in endogenous Metrnl protein expression in LX-2 cells following stimulation with recombinant TGF-&#x003b2; (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1F</xref>). We then extended our analysis to commonly utilized murine models of liver fibrosis induced by CCl4 administration or a methionine-choline deficient (MCD) diet. Our findings demonstrated that an 8-week course of CCl4-induced liver injury in C57BL/6 mice resulted in liver fibrosis, as indicated by &#x003b1;-SMA and Sirius-Red staining (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1G</xref>). Consistent with the decreased Metrnl levels observed in fibrotic livers of patients, IHC staining confirmed the downregulation of hepatic Metrnl in CCl4-induced fibrotic livers of mice (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1G</xref>). This was further corroborated by Western blot analysis (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1H</xref>), which revealed a significant reduction in Metrnl expression in the liver tissues of CCl4-treated groups. Moreover, both Western blot analysis and IHC staining indicated that Metrnl protein level were also decreased in the livers of MCD diet-induced mice compared to the control group (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1I</xref>; Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1A</xref>).

To explore the effects of restoring Metrnl expression on liver fibrosis, we generated a liver-targeted Metrnl gene adeno-associated virus vector AAV8-Metrnl, and induced liver fibrosis by injecting CCl4. Treatment with AAV8-Metrnl resulted in Metrnl overexpression in the liver (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1B, C</xref>). Notably, the liver tissue subjected to CCl4 exhibited significant infiltration of inflammatory cells, along with flaky and spotty necrosis of hepatocytes. However, AAV8-Metrnl overexpression markedly alleviated both hepatocyte necrosis and inflammatory cell infiltration (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2A</xref>; Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1D</xref>). Both H&#x00026;E and Sirius-Red staining showed that Metrnl overexpression alleviated CCl4-induced liver fibrosis compared to the control group (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2A</xref>; Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1E</xref>).

Additionally, the mRNA levels of &#x003b1;-SMA, Col1, Col3, and Col4 in the liver were significantly decreased after Metrnl overexpression (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>). Western blot analysis further confirmed the improvement in liver fibrosis (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>).

Therefore, it is essential to identify the factors that regulate this cell-to-cell communication to develop effective therapeutic approaches for the disease.</p><p id="Par28">This study presents compelling evidence from genetic deletion and pharmacological treatment in animal models, indicating that Metrnl plays a crucial role in liver fibrosis. Metrnl facilitates communication between hepatocytes and HSCs, influencing HSC activation and regulating liver fibrosis. The research observed a significant decrease in Metrnl expression in the liver during hepatic fibrogenesis in mouse models induced by CCl4-treatment and MCD diet, as well as in patients with fibrotic livers and activated HSCs. The results indicate that the specific deletion of Metrnl in hepatocytes or the use of a global knockout model exacerbates liver fibrosis. In contrast, genetically overexpressing Metrnl or administering recombinant Metrnl protein can mitigate liver fibrosis in mice. While the impact of HSC-specific deletion of Metrnl on hepatic fibrosis is slightly exacerbated, a notable activation effect on primary HSCs isolated from Lrat-Metrnl KO mice was observed in vitro. Both hepatocyte-specific deletion and global deletion of Metrnl resulted in significant liver injury and fibrosis, suggesting that hepatocyte-derived Metrnl may partially compensate for the effects of HSC Metrnl deletion through paracrine action. This hypothesis was supported by in vitro co-culture experiments and Metrnl antibody neutralization.

Metrnl deficiency in hepatocytes enhances the secretion of PDGFB by upregulating transcription factor EGR1 expression, leading to PDGFR&#x003b2; signaling activation in HSCs through paracrine pathways. This cascade accelerates HSC activation and liver fibrosis progression. Moreover, the lack of Metrnl in HSCs downregulates E3 ubiquitin ligase HECW2, impeding K48-linked ubiquitination of FN for proteasomal degradation, thereby promoting FN protein expression, secretion from HSCs. These actions contribute to ECM deposition, HSC activation, and worsen liver fibrosis. Overall, these results shed light on a novel regulatory pathway involving Metrnl that mediates communication between hepatocytes and HSCs, offering insights into potential therapeutic targets for liver fibrosis.
