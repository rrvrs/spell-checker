They face various health challenges, including chronic diseases, cognitive decline, and mental health issues. Recent projections suggest that by 2050, the number of older adults will exceed 2 billion globally, leading to increased pressure on healthcare systems (<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Therefore, improving the health and quality of life of older adults has become a significant public health concern. In recent years, an increasing number of studies have recognized the importance of physical activity and exercise for health, especially for older adults. Research has shown that regular physical exercise not only helps older adults maintain physical health and reduce the occurrence of chronic diseases but also significantly improves mental health and quality of life (<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2&#x02013;4</xref>). Studies have demonstrated that moderate-intensity physical activity can reduce the risks of cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and some cancers, and can also delay the onset of dementia and other cognitive impairments (<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Therefore, how to promote the health of older adults through effective physical exercise, particularly in terms of enhancing health care seeking behavior, has become a topic worth exploring.</p><p>Health care seeking behavior refers to the various medical actions and behaviors individuals take when facing health issues, including seeking medical care, receiving treatment, and utilizing medical resources. Previous studies have emphasized that health care seeking behavior is influenced by a complex interplay of biological, psychological, and social factors (<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Studies have found that health care seeking behavior is closely related to an individual&#x02019;s health status, mental state, and lifestyle (<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7&#x02013;9</xref>). For older adults, physical activity not only has a direct impact on physical health but may also indirectly promote changes in health care seeking behavior by improving mental health and enhancing self-efficacy (<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). However, the mechanisms through which physical activity affects health care seeking behavior in older adults remain unclear, particularly in terms of the mediating roles of physical and mental health. To address this issue, the present study aims to investigate the impact of physical activity on the health care seeking behavior of older adults and further analyze the mediating roles of physical and mental health. Based on data from the 2021 China General Social Survey (CGSS), this study employs statistical methods such as regression analysis, and mediation analysis to examine the impact of physical activity on the health care seeking behavior of the older adults and the underlying mechanisms. Specifically, the study first examines the relationship between physical activity and health care seeking behavior in older adults, proposing that physical activity may influence health care seeking behavior by improving physical and mental health. Second, the study focuses on the mediating roles of physical health and mental health in the relationship between physical activity and health care seeking behavior, further validating the beneficial role of exercise in promoting health management among older adults. The mental health benefits of physical activity, such as reduced depression and anxiety, may lead to more proactive health-seeking behaviors (<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Lastly, this study conducts heterogeneity analysis to explore the differences in the impact of physical activity on health care seeking behavior across different age groups of older adults, providing evidence for targeted health intervention measures.</p><p>The innovative aspect of this study lies in its comprehensive investigation of the impact of physical exercise on health care seeking behavior from the dual perspectives of physical and mental health. By examining how physical exercise influences health care seeking behavior through improvements in both physical and mental health, this study provides a new theoretical perspective and support for future interventions and policies aimed at the health of older adults. Furthermore, the findings of this study are of great practical significance for promoting targeted and personalized health interventions for older adults. Overall, through a comprehensive exploration of the impact of different frequencies and intensities of physical activity on health care seeking behavior among older adults of all ages, this study provides important theoretical and empirical support for promoting the health of older adults and improving health care seeking behavior.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec6"><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec7"><label>2.1</label><title>Data processing</title><p>The data is taken from the 2021 Chinese General Social Survey (CGSS), which is the earliest national, comprehensive, and continuous academic survey project in China. The CGSS adopts a multi-stage stratified probability sampling design and covers over 10,000 households across all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions in China, systematically and comprehensively collecting data at the social, community, household, and individual levels. The CGSS 2021 consists of three parts: the core module, the household questionnaire module, and the social network module, containing more than 800 variables. The data quality is strictly controlled and has good representativeness and reliability. As the 2021 CGSS includes rich data on factors influencing residents&#x02019; health, data from this year was selected for this study. The data was officially released on March 31, 2023. The original dataset contained 8,148 participants. In this study, the research team screened the original samples based on the research objectives, and the sample screening, data cleaning, and statistical analysis were completed by researchers with a background in social science quantitative research, ensuring the scientific nature of the data processing process and the credibility of the results. The data screening process followed a series of inclusion and exclusion criteria to ensure the focus of the study was on older adults and related health information. As shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>. First, participants under the age of 60 were excluded, leaving 2,929 participants aged 60 and above. Next, participants with incomplete or unclear self-reported health information (<italic>n</italic> =&#x0202f;20) were excluded, leaving 2,909 participants with valid self-reported health data. Subsequently, participants with unavailable or unclear physical exercise information (<italic>n</italic> =&#x0202f;6) were excluded, leaving 2,903 participants with valid physical exercise data. Finally, participants without valid or clear health care seeking behavior data (<italic>n</italic> =&#x0202f;1,902) were excluded, resulting in a final sample of 1,001 participants for analysis. The final dataset of 1,001 older adults was used to explore the relationship between physical exercise, self-perceived health, and health care seeking behavior. The data was processed and cleaned to address missing values and ensure consistency of the variables used for analysis.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Flowchart of the inclusion of the study participants.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fpubh-13-1566321-g001" position="float"/></fig></sec><sec id="sec8"><label>2.2</label><title>Variables description</title><sec id="sec9"><label>2.2.1</label><title>Independent variable</title><p>&#x0201c;Physical exercise&#x0201d; was measured using the question: &#x0201c;In the past year, did you regularly engage in physical exercise during your leisure time?&#x0201d; Respondents were asked to choose from five options, each corresponding to a numerical value: a response of &#x0201c;never&#x0201d; was assigned a value of 1, indicating no participation in physical exercise; &#x0201c;occasionally&#x0201d; was assigned a value of 2, reflecting infrequent engagement; &#x0201c;sometimes&#x0201d; received a value of 3, indicating moderate frequency; &#x0201c;often&#x0201d; was assigned a value of 4, representing frequent participation; and &#x0201c;always&#x0201d; was given a value of 5, indicating regular and consistent physical exercise.

Chronic disease was coded as 0&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;no chronic disease, 1&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;at least one chronic disease (a total of 14 chronic non communicable diseases).</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec13"><label>2.3</label><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data analysis was conducted using R 4.4.1. Descriptive statistics were first performed to summarize the sample characteristics, including means and standard deviations for continuous variables and frequencies and percentages for categorical variables. To examine the relationship between physical exercise and health care seeking behavior, a series of regression analyses were performed (<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Regression models were adjusted for potential confounders, including demographic variables such as age, gender, and residence, as well as health status variables, to ensure that the observed relationships were not influenced by these factors. In addition to the basic regression analysis, mediation analysis was conducted to investigate the indirect effects of physical health and psychological health on the relationship between physical exercise and health care seeking behavior (<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). This was done using a bootstrapping method to assess the significance of the indirect effects. To test the robustness of the findings, lasso and ridge regression were employed as part of the sensitivity analysis (<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Finally, to explore age-related differences in the impact of physical exercise on health care seeking behavior, heterogeneity analysis was conducted by stratifying the sample into different age groups.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec14"><label>3</label><title>Research results</title><sec id="sec15"><label>3.1</label><title>Descriptive statistics and correlation analysis of each variable</title><p>The baseline characteristics of the participants are summarized in <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>.

The gender distribution was nearly equal, with 49.35% being male and 50.65% female. Most participants resided in rural areas (58.64%). In terms of education, 22.08% were illiterate, 33.57% had primary education, 24.68% had middle school education, and 19.68% had high school or higher education. The majority of participants were married or had a partner (72.43%). The average natural logarithm of income was 7.34. Most older adults (61.14%) suffer from chronic diseases. Regarding physical exercise habits, 50.75% of the participants reported exercising often, while 3.40% never exercised. The sports venue environment was considered adequate by 73.83% of the participants. 8.89% of older adult people engage in high-intensity exercise every day that can make them sweat or breathe faster for more than 20&#x0202f;min. Health care seeking behavior was reported as always by 3.80% of the participants, often by 12.19%, sometimes by 35.16%, occasionally by 20.18%, and never by 28.67%. Health check-ups were not conducted by 57.24% of the participants, while 42.76% had undergone health check-ups.

In Model 1, which includes only physical exercise as the independent variable, the effect is significantly negative (<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;&#x02212;0.092, <italic>p</italic>&#x0202f;&#x0003c;&#x0202f;0.01), with a 95% confidence interval of [&#x02212;0.145, &#x02212;0.039]. This indicates that older adults who engage in more frequent physical exercise tend to exhibit lower levels of health care seeking behavior, suggesting that physical activity may reduce the need for medical services. Model 2 incorporates chronic diseases along with demographic controls. The negative association between physical exercise and health care seeking behavior remains significant (<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;&#x02212;0.087, <italic>p</italic>&#x0202f;&#x0003c;&#x0202f;0.001), with a confidence interval of [&#x02212;0.151, &#x02212;0.053].

In addition, age (<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;0.093, <italic>p</italic>&#x0202f;&#x0003c;&#x0202f;0.01), gender (&#x003b2;&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;0.209, <italic>p</italic>&#x0202f;&#x0003c;&#x0202f;0.05), and residence (&#x003b2;&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;0.306, <italic>p</italic>&#x0202f;&#x0003c;&#x0202f;0.01) are significantly positively associated with health care seeking behavior, suggesting that older adults, males, and urban residents are more likely to seek medical care. In Model 3, self-perceived physical health is added. The effect of physical exercise remains significantly negative (<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;&#x02212;0.084, <italic>p</italic>&#x0202f;&#x0003c;&#x0202f;0.01), with a confidence interval of [&#x02212;0.138, &#x02212;0.030].

Model 4 introduces self-perceived mental health. The effect of physical exercise remains robust and significantly negative (&#x003b2;&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;&#x02212;0.100, <italic>p</italic>&#x0202f;&#x0003c;&#x0202f;0.001), with a confidence interval of [&#x02212;0.154, &#x02212;0.046].

Furthermore, when replacing the variable of &#x0201c;physical exercise&#x0201d; with the variable of &#x0201c;high-intensity exercise,&#x0201d; it was found that older adults with higher exercise intensity visited medical institutions less frequently, which is also consistent with the results of basic research. This substitution method confirms the stability of the impact of physical exercise on health care seeking behavior, indicating good robustness. Furthermore, adopting a dual machine learning model (DML) to examine the impact of physical exercise on health care seeking behavior. The dual machine learning model combines traditional econometric methods and machine learning techniques, relaxes the assumptions about the intrinsic correlation of data, allows for more flexible functional forms, and has better stability. According to <xref rid="tab5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>, physical exercise has a gradually increasing negative effect on health care seeking behavior of older adults. Compared to never engaging in physical exercise, older adults who exercise more frequently tend to seek medical attention less frequently. Comparing the results of the dual machine learning model and the basic regression model, there is not much difference between the two. Overall, the research conclusions of the benchmark regression model are stable.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="tab4"><label>Table 4</label><caption><p>Regression results of the impact of sports venue on the health care seeking behavior of older adults.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Factors</th><th align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Coef.</th><th align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">S.E.</th><th align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">

Our results suggest that older adults who engage in regular physical exercise may have a reduced need for medical services, and the higher the frequency of exercise, the weaker their dependence on medical services (&#x003b2;&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;&#x02212;0.100, <italic>p</italic>&#x0202f;&#x0003c;&#x0202f;0.001). It is possibly due to a decrease in the incidence of preventable diseases and an increase in self-efficacy in managing their health. This aligns with the findings of a longitudinal study by Amanda et al. (<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), which reported that older adults with higher physical activity levels had lower rates of hospital admissions. Although the regression results demonstrate that physical activity exerts a statistically significant effect on health care seeking behavior among older adults, the relatively narrow confidence interval indicates that the effect size is modest. This attenuated magnitude may be attributable to the inherent complexity of individual behavioral patterns and the multifactorial nature of healthcare-seeking behaviors, which are often influenced by variables such as socioeconomic status, accessibility of medical resources, and the burden of chronic conditions. In addition, the study by Liu et al. (<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) demonstrated that high-intensity physical exercise significantly reduces healthcare expenditures among older adults, with a robust negative association (<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;&#x02212;0.0192, <italic>p</italic>&#x0202f;&#x0003c;&#x0202f;0.01), which aligns with this study. Moreover, the current results also resonate with the concept of autogenic health, as proposed by Antonovsky (<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>), which emphasizes the importance of general resistance resources that enable individuals to cope with stress and maintain health. The implication here is that physical exercise may act as a health promoting factor, enhancing the ability of older adults to manage their health and reducing their reliance on medical services. Furthermore, the Health Belief Model (<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) suggests that individuals who perceive themselves to be at lower risk are less likely to seek medical care. This is supported by the research, which identified perceived health status as a significant predictor of healthcare utilization (<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Additionally, the Self-Regulation Model of Health Behavior (<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) posits that individuals&#x02019; interpretations of their symptoms and health status guide their health actions, which may explain why older adults who exercise regularly may experience fewer symptoms and have a more positive perception of their health, leading to a reduced need for medical services.</p></sec><sec id="sec21"><label>4.2</label><title>The mediating role of self-perceived physical health</title><p>The mediation analysis in this study revealed that self-perceived physical health significantly mediated the relationship between physical exercise and health care seeking behavior, with an indirect effect of &#x02212;0.026, accounting for 29.89% of the total effect. This finding aligns with Dost&#x000e1;lov&#x000e1; et al.&#x02019;s (<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) observation of exercise-induced improvements in self-perceived health (<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;0.33, <italic>p</italic>&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;0.07). It suggests that the perception of one&#x02019;s physical health is a crucial factor influencing the decision to seek medical care. This aligns with the Self-Regulation Model of Health Behavior, which posits that individuals&#x02019; interpretations of their symptoms and health status guide their health actions (<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Our findings suggest that older adults who exercise regularly may experience fewer symptoms and have a more positive perception of their health, leading to a reduced need for medical services. Moreover, the Common Sense Model suggests that individuals use their own schema to interpret health threats, which may influence their health behavior (<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). This is supported by the work of Shaelyn et al. (<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), who found that older adults with a more positive self-assessment of their physical health were less likely to engage in avoidant health behaviors. Additionally, the Social Cognitive Theory emphasizes the role of self-efficacy in health behavior, suggesting that individuals who believe they can manage their health effectively are less likely to seek medical care (<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). This is further supported by the study by Elavsky et al. (<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>), which reported that older adults with higher self-efficacy in physical activity had lower healthcare utilization. Lastly, the Transtheoretical Model suggests that individuals progress through stages of change, and those in later stages are more likely to engage in health-promoting behaviors, which may reduce their need for medical services (<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Furthermore, it is worth considering that self-perceived physical health may also influence preventive healthcare behaviors. Older adults with a positive health perception may be more inclined to engage in regular health check-ups or adopt healthier lifestyles, thereby reducing the occurrence of severe health issues and the subsequent need for extensive medical interventions.</p></sec><sec id="sec22"><label>4.3</label><title>The mediating role of self-perceived mental health</title><p>Our analysis revealed a statistically significant mediating role of self-perceived mental health in the relationship between physical exercise and health care seeking behavior (indirect effect&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;&#x02212;0.008), accounting for 9.2% of the total effect. It suggests that the psychological benefits of exercise may contribute to a reduced need for medical services. This is supported by the literature on mental health and physical health comorbidity, which suggests that mental health issues can exacerbate physical health problems and increase the use of healthcare services (<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Our findings suggest that by improving mental health, physical exercise may reduce the exacerbation of physical health issues and decrease the need for medical interventions. Furthermore, the Biopsychosocial Model (<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) emphasizes the impact of psychological factors on health outcomes. This is supported by the study by Adepoju (<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>), which noted that better mental health was associated with lower healthcare utilization among older adults. Additionally, the Social Support Theory suggests that social support can buffer the effects of stress and improve mental health, which may influence healthcare seeking behavior (<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). This is further supported by the work of Hamid (<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>), who found that older adults with stronger social networks had better mental health and lower healthcare utilization. Lastly, the Stress-Buffering Model posits that social support can reduce the negative impact of stress on health, which may explain why older adults who exercise and have better mental health seek medical care less frequently (<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Moreover, it is worth considering that improved self-perceived mental health through regular physical exercise may also enhance older adults&#x02019; resilience and coping mechanisms. This, in turn, could reduce their perceived need for medical care, as they may feel more capable of managing minor health issues independently.</p></sec><sec id="sec23"><label>4.4</label><title>Age-related heterogeneity in the effects of physical exercise</title><p>The heterogeneity analysis in our study reveals significant differences in the impact of physical exercise on health care seeking behavior across different age groups of older adults. This finding is supported by the Selective Optimization with Compensation theory, which suggests that older adults adapt their behavior based on their age-related resources and needs (<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Our results contribute to the work of Jakovljevic et al. (<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>), who found age-related differences in the effects of physical activity on health outcomes. The practical implication is that public health interventions should consider the specific needs and capacities of different age groups when promoting physical activity. Furthermore, the Disengagement Theory suggests that older adults may withdraw from social roles and activities, including health-related behaviors, as they age (<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). This is supported by the study by Shin (<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>), which reported that older adults in their 80s and above were less likely to engage in physical activity compared to younger older adults. Additionally, the Activity Theory posits that older adults maintain their mental health by remaining active and engaged in social roles (<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>), which may influence their health behaviors. This is further supported by the work of Yilmaz (<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>), who found that older adults who were more active had better health outcomes. Lastly, the Continuity Theory suggests that older adults tend to maintain their health behaviors from middle age into later life, which may explain the differences in the impact of physical exercise on health care seeking behavior across age groups (<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). Furthermore, another possible explanation is that as age increases, other factors such as the presence of family members and economic status have a greater impact on older adults&#x02019; health care seeking behavior than their own health status. For example, some older adults may not be able to seek medical treatment voluntarily due to disability, lack of companionship, or poor economic conditions. Moreover, it is worth considering that older adults in more advanced age groups may benefit from alternative forms of low-impact physical activities, such as tai chi or water aerobics, which are better suited to their physical limitations (<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>).</p><p>This study makes significant contributions both theoretically and practically. First, it explores the impact of physical exercise on health care seeking behavior among older adults and reveals the mediating roles of physical and mental health, providing new insights into understanding health behaviors in older adults. The use of regression analysis and mediation tests provides preliminary evidence of the relationship between physical exercise and health care seeking behavior, offering a scientific basis for health promotion interventions. Second, the study highlights significant age-related differences in how physical exercise affects health care seeking behavior, enriching the existing literature on age-related health behaviors in older adults. To ensure the robustness of the findings, this study validated the results by substituting variables (such as sports venue and High-intensity exercise) in regression models and employed a dual machine learning model to test the stability of the results. The dual model, which combines traditional econometric methods with machine learning techniques, further confirmed the reliability and robustness of the conclusions.</p><p>However, there are certain limitations to this study. First, due to the cross-sectional design of the data, causality cannot be inferred, and future longitudinal studies should be conducted to establish causal relationships. Second, this study could not fully account for all potential confounding variables, such as participants&#x02019; medical history and social support networks, which may impact the accuracy of the results. Additionally, although heterogeneity analysis was conducted across different age groups, some groups, particularly those aged 80 and above, had small sample sizes, which may limit the generalizability of the findings for this subgroup. Lastly, although physical and mental health was analyzed as a mediating variable in this study, there are other variables such as diet, chronic diseases, daily medication, and medical history that can affect the physical exercise and health care seeking behavior of older adults. Future studies should further explore the mediating and moderating effects of these factors.</p><p>This study has several innovative aspects and advantages. First, compared with existing studies, our research not only confirms the impact of physical exercise on older adults&#x02019; health care seeking behavior but also further explores the mediating roles of physical and mental health, revealing the underlying mechanisms. This provides a deeper theoretical foundation for older adults&#x02019; health management. Second, in the robustness check, the high-intensity exercise variable has been introduced, verifying our findings from the perspective of different exercise types. This extends the analytical framework of existing studies. Moreover, this study utilizes nationally representative CGSS 2021 data, covering a broader older adults and conducting age-stratified analysis, with particular attention to the unique characteristics of individuals aged 80 and above, enhancing the practical significance of this findings. Additionally, two machine learning models, LASSO Regression and Ridge Regression, are also employed for supplementary analysis. These extended analyses not only strengthen the reliability of research conclusions but also provide more targeted references for public health policy formulation.</p><p>The health promotion intervention strategies of this study are as follows. Firstly, promoting regular physical activity programs should be prioritized. Community-based exercise initiatives, such as walking groups, tai chi, or water aerobics, should be tailored to older adults, particularly those aged 60&#x02013;79, who demonstrated the strongest reduction in health care seeking behavior due to exercise. Incentivizing participation through subsidies or rewards (e.g., discounted gym memberships, health insurance benefits) could further encourage engagement. Additionally, improving access to safe and age-appropriate exercise venues&#x02014;such as parks and senior fitness zones&#x02014;is essential, especially in rural areas where environmental barriers may limit opportunities for physical activity. Secondly, integrating health education and self-efficacy building into intervention strategies is crucial. Workshops should be organized to help older adults understand the connection between exercise, self-perceived health, and reduced medical reliance, emphasizing the preventive benefits of physical activity against chronic diseases. Peer-led support groups, where older adults who have experienced positive health outcomes from exercise mentor their peers, can foster motivation and reinforce social support, aligning with Social Cognitive Theory principles. Thirdly, age-specific and personalized interventions should be implemented. For adults aged 60&#x02013;69, moderate-intensity activities like brisk walking or cycling can help maintain physical health and delay age-related decline. For those aged 70&#x02013;79, balance and flexibility exercises (e.g., yoga, resistance training) should be emphasized to reduce frailty and enhance mental well-being, given this group&#x02019;s significant response to exercise. Adults aged 80 and above may benefit from low-intensity, supervised activities (e.g., chair exercises) combined with regular health monitoring to accommodate mobility limitations and comorbidities. Finally, addressing mental health mediation through mind&#x02013;body programs and counseling services can amplify the benefits of physical activity. Incorporating mindfulness-based exercises (e.g., meditation, qigong) into fitness regimens can improve mental well-being and reduce anxiety-driven medical visits. Additionally, offering free or low-cost mental health screenings alongside exercise programs can help identify and address psychological barriers to self-care, ensuring a holistic approach to health management. By implementing these targeted strategies, policymakers and healthcare providers can effectively reduce unnecessary medical utilization among older adults while enhancing their overall well-being.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec24"><label>5</label><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study provides preliminary evidence that physical exercise is negatively associated with health care seeking behavior among older adults, and the higher the frequency of physical exercise, the greater the promotion effect on reducing health care seeking behavior. The findings demonstrate that self-perceived physical and mental health were identified as significant mediators in the relationship between physical exercise and health care seeking behavior. The subgroup analysis revealed age-related differences in the impact of physical exercise on health care seeking behavior. Older adults aged 70&#x02013;79&#x0202f;years showed a stronger positive effect of physical exercise on health care seeking behavior compared to those in the 60&#x02013;69 age group, while the effect for those aged 80 and above was not statistically significant. This suggests that the benefits of physical exercise on health behavior may vary across different age groups.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="sec25"><title>Data availability statement</title><p>The original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/supplementary material, further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding authors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="ethics-statement" id="sec26"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>Written informed consent was obtained from the individual(s) for the publication of any potentially identifiable images or data included in this article.</p></sec><sec sec-type="author-contributions" id="sec27"><title>Author contributions</title><p>JL: Funding acquisition, Investigation, Software, Supervision, Writing &#x02013; original draft, Writing &#x02013; review &#x00026; editing.
