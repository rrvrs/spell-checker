Current strategies using specific antibodies in sow milk to prevent Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea (PED) in these piglets through specific antibodies in sow milk is unsatisfactory. Preliminary studies have shown limited success. Emerging evidence suggests that general immune factors in sow milk provide protection to neonatal piglets, particularly, lactoferrin, play a crucial role in protecting piglets by inhibiting PEDV replication. However, the precise mechanism by which lactoferrin exerts its antiviral effects remains unclear. This study sought to clarify these mechanisms through both in vitro and in vivo approaches, proposing that higher concentrations of lactoferrin lead to greater antiviral activity. It was hypothesized that lactoferrin can impede PEDV by blocking its binding to heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG) on the surface of target cells, and molecular docking experiments was conducted to identify the binding sites between lactoferrin and HSPG. Additionally, the findings indicated that lactoferrin can effectively trigger the maturation of porcine dendritic cells and boosts their antigen-presenting functions, thereby improving intestinal mucosal immunity in neonatal piglets against PEDV. Overall, these findings aid to elucidate the antiviral actions and mechanisms of lactoferrin in sow colostrum, offering new insights for the effective prevention and control of PED in neonatal piglets.</p><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s13567-025-01456-5.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Lactoferrin</kwd><kwd>PEDV</kwd><kwd>heparan sulfate proteoglycans</kwd><kwd>mucosal immunity</kwd><kwd>neonatal piglets</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions </institution></funding-source><award-id>24KJD230002</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Peng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>school level scientific research project of Jiangsu Agri-Animal Husbandry Vocational College </institution></funding-source><award-id>NSF2023CB02</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Peng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Taizhou Science and technology Support Programs </institution></funding-source><award-id>Agricultural Projects, TN202119</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lu</surname><given-names>Hui</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; L&#x02019;Institut National de Recherche en Agriculture, Alimentation et Environnement (INRAE) 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) is an infectious gastrointestinal disease in swine caused by the Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV). The disease is characterized by severe watery diarrhea and is notorious for its high morbidity, rapid spread, and devastating mortality rates, with neonatal piglets experiencing mortality rates of up to 90% upon infection with PEDV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Currently, most vaccines aimed at preventing PED are delivered through intramuscular injections. However, these vaccines often fail to provide effective immunity in time due to the immature immune systems of neonatal piglets, leaving them highly vulnerable to PEDV infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Studies have shown that orally immunizing pregnant sows with PEDV can boost specific antibody levels in their milk, which in turn can significantly lower the mortality rates among neonates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Therefore, vaccinating sows to confer immunity to their offspring is seen as the most viable prevention method. However, the rapid mutation rate of the PEDV S gene presents a challenge, as it causes a delay in vaccine development that struggles to keep up with viral evolution, complicating efforts to manage PED in swine populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Even though orally immunized sows produce high levels of specific antibodies in their milk, piglets still exhibit symptoms of diarrhea when challenged with heterologous PEDV strains, suggesting that while some cross-protection exists among PEDV subtypes, it is not entirely effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par3">In addition to specific antibodies, innate immune components in milk, such as cytokines and antiviral proteins, are crucial in fighting off viral infections in the intestine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Sow milk is differentiated into colostrum and mature milk based on the time of secretion. Colostrum, unlike mature milk, is abundant in immune factors, including antibodies, immune cells, cytokines, and antiviral proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Lactoferrin (LF) is an iron-binding glycoprotein predominantly present in mammalian colostrum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. LF not only inhibits viral invasion but also modulates the host's immune response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Although prior studies have shown impact of LF on PEDV replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], the specific mechanisms of its antiviral action against PEDV remain to be fully understood. Therefore, in this study, we first conducted in vitro experiments to explore how LF inhibits PEDV replication by blocking its binding to heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG) on the surface of target cells. Additionally, we investigated how LF can enhances the intestinal mucosal immunity of neonatal piglets to protect them from PEDV infection. In summary, this project has elegantly elucidated the molecular mechanisms by which LF prevents PEDV infection in neonatal piglets. These findings provide a solid theoretical foundation for developing strategies to prevent and control PED in neonatal piglets, offering significant insights into the role of LF in enhancing intestinal mucosal immunity and inhibiting viral replication.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Strain and cell lines</title><p id="Par4">The wild-type PEDV strain and its susceptible Vero E6 cells were kindly provided by Professor Li Zhang from our laboratory.

For this study, BALB/c mice aged 4&#x000a0;weeks were divided into five groups, each consisting of five mice. Following a 3-day period of acclimatization with standard feeding, the mice were given varying concentrations of LF solutions daily through gavage for a week.

Before the experiments began, these pigs tested negative for antibodies against Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus (PEDV), Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus (PRRSV), Porcine Respiratory Corona Virus (PRCV), Transmissible Gastroenteritis Virus (TGEV), and Porcine Circovirus Type 2 (PCV2). Twenty-five healthy newborn piglets were randomly selected from the pig farm and were continuously fed commercially available milk powder for 7&#x000a0;days. Subsequently, on the 5th day of age, the piglets were inoculated with PEDV (10<sup>4</sup> PFU/mL). One hour before the PEDV inoculation, they were orally administered either PBS or LF. The control group consisted of piglets that were orally administered 1&#x000a0;mL of PBS but were not inoculated with PEDV. The positive control group consisted of piglets that were orally administered 1&#x000a0;mL of PBS and were inoculated with PEDV. In the LF1 group, piglets were orally administered 1&#x000a0;mL of commercially available LF (100&#x000a0;mg/kg). In the LF2 group, piglets received 1&#x000a0;mL of LF (200&#x000a0;mg/kg), and in the LF3 group, they received 1&#x000a0;mL of LF (400&#x000a0;mg/kg). All three groups were also inoculated with PEDV. Euthanasia was performed on all piglets 48&#x000a0;h post-infection. Fecal samples were collected from the piglets at 0, 6, 12, 24, 36, and 48&#x000a0;h post-infection, and tissues from the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum were obtained for relevant assays. Additionally, the pathological changes in the intestinal tract were observed from 0 to 48&#x000a0;h after infection and were scored according to the severity of diarrhea. The scoring criteria were as follows: 0 indicated that the stool was hard and shaped, 1 indicated that the feces were soft and shaped, 2 indicated that the feces were semi-solid without shape, a score of 3 indicated watery diarrhea.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Detection of cytotoxic effects of HSPG and the LF and inhibitors on cells</title><p id="Par7">In this study, the cytotoxic effects of HSPG, LF, and their inhibitors were assessed using the CCK-8 assay kit, following the manufacturer&#x02019;s protocol.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Effects of HSPG or LF on PEDV replication</title><p id="Par8">Vero E6 cells were initially incubated with different concentrations of HSPG (10, 100, 250, and 500&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g/mL), LF (100, 250, and 500&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g/mL), and LF inhibitors (1, 25, and 50&#x000a0;&#x000b5;M) at 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for 1&#x000a0;h.

The RNA concentrations from various treatment groups were measured using a UV spectrophotometer (840-317400, Thermo Scientific&#x02122;, USA), and the samples were diluted to maintain consistency across all groups. RNA normalization was then performed by reverse transcription using the HiScript TM QRT SuperMix kit according to the manufacturer's instructions to synthesize cDNA. Absolute quantification methods were used to quantify the PEDV viral load in the feces, employing a plasmid containing the PEDV-N gene sequence to construct a standard curve. The PEDV viral load in the piglet intestines was determined using relative quantitative PCR.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Western blot analysis</title><p id="Par24">The processing of tissue samples was carried out as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]: (1) A small amount of jejunal and ileal tissue was collected into a 2&#x000a0;mL centrifuge tube, to which 1&#x000a0;mL of PBS was added, and the tissue was homogenized using a tissue grinder for 1&#x000a0;min.

Prior investigations have shown that LF does not affect these stages directly. However, pre-incubation of LF with host cells before viral introduction markedly suppressed PEDV replication (Additional files 1A-C). Thus, we hypothesized that LF can modulate PEDV replication by interacting with the host cells. First, the influence of LF on host cell viability was measured via the CCK-8 assay, revealing that LF was non-toxic across various concentrations (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>A). Moreover, in vitro tests demonstrated that introducing LF during the virus attachment phase caused significant inhibition PEDV replication. This antiviral action of LF was found to be concentration-dependent, with higher doses enhancing the inhibition of viral replication (Figures&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B&#x02013;D). In vivo experiments involved orally administering different doses of LF to piglets prior to PEDV infection. An acute toxicity assessment using a single oral gavage showed no mortality post oral administration LF (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>A), confirming the safety and lack of adverse effects of the administered LF concentrations. Clinical symptoms in PEDV-infected piglets were monitored. Those in the PBS and LF1 groups developed severe watery diarrhea within 48&#x000a0;h post-infection, and diarrheic piglets exhibited other clinical signs including lethargy, anorexia, and vomiting. In severe cases, yellow watery feces were observed contaminating the perianal region. Conversely, piglets receiving higher doses of LF (LF2 and LF3 groups) experienced notably milder symptoms. These piglets exhibited normal mental status and appetite, with only a few showing mild diarrhea characterized by well-formed feces. The severity of diarrhea was quantitatively evaluated through stool consistency scores, where higher scores indicated more severe diarrhea. Results indicated significantly lower diarrhea scores in the LF-treated groups compared to the PBS group, with the LF3 group showing the least severe symptoms (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>B). Furthermore, necropsy findings showed no pathological changes in the intestines of piglets in the uninfected control and LF3 groups, displaying normal intestinal contents and intact walls. However, those in the LF1 and PBS groups had notable intestinal abnormalities, including empty and thin, translucent walls (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>C). Finally, analysis of fecal viral load demonstrated a considerable reduction in viral shedding at 36 and 48&#x000a0;h post-infection among LF-treated groups (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>E).

Consequently, newborn piglets rely solely on passive immune protection obtained through the sow's milk, especially from colostrum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Sow colostrum is rich in LF, a protein known for its antibacterial and immunomodulatory properties, its role in facilitating iron absorption in the intestines, and its contribution to neurological development among other functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].

Additionally, other studies have also indicated that bovine LF can block PEDV entry, albeit using LF from bovine milk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In the context of swine farming, piglets typically receive LF through maternal colostrum, suggesting that boosting LF levels in colostrum might improve piglet resistance to PEDV infection.</p><p id="Par33">LF primarily blocks virus entry by attaching to cell surface receptors or viral particles, thus preventing their interaction with host cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].

The glycosaminoglycan surface molecules of LF can electrostatically bind to the negatively charged HSPG, preventing virus-cell binding; (3) potentially enhancing the Type I interferon system to activate host antiviral responses. However, in this study, the co-incubation of LF and PEDV in Vero cells did not alter virus replication, indicating that LF does not inhibit PEDV replication by binding to the PEDV S protein. Additionally, since Vero cells do not produce interferon (IFN), indicating LF also does not inhibit PEDV replication through the IFN system. Therefore, LF likely inhibited PEDV replication primarily by competing with the virus for binding to cell surface HSPG receptors. This conclusion is supported by findings similar to those in Jonathan Z Sexton&#x02019;s research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], which demonstrated LF ability to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication by binding to HSPG.</p><p id="Par34">LF not only has antiviral properties but also plays a vital role in immune modulation. Neonatal piglets receive LF through suckling colostrum, which is internalized into intestinal epithelial cells via LF receptors, primarily through megalin-mediated endocytosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Subsequently, LF is released into the lamina propria of the intestinal mucosa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Beneath this layer, numerous DCs are widely distributed. DCs are pivotal antigen-presenting cells in host immune responses, continually surveilling for invading pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].

Our study revealed that LF effectively impeded PEDV attachment to host cells. However, the impact of LF on PEDV binding to host cell receptors remains unclear.
