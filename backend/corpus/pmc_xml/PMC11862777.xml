In 1897, Poncet and Dor described it as "botryomycosis humaine" [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In 1974, Hartzell coined the terms "granuloma pyogenicum" and "granuloma teleangiectaticum" [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Later, in 1982, Cooper and Mills introduced the term "lobular capillary hemangioma" (LCH) to describe a group of hemangiomas--polypoid, intradermal, subcutaneous, and intravenous--that share identical microscopic characteristics [<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>-<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>When LCH develops during pregnancy, it is referred to as granuloma gravidarum, epulides gravidarum, or colloquially as a "pregnancy tumor." Despite these different names, histopathologically, they are identical to non-pregnancy-associated cases [<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. These lesions arise from mucous membranes and skin, with a preference for intraoral or perioral areas during pregnancy. Other commonly described locations include the head, neck, and hands.</p><p>LCH typically presents as a rapidly growing vascular tumor or nodule on the skin or mucosa, characterized by a friable surface that bleeds easily. Clinical diagnosis can be challenging, particularly in cases complicated by bleeding, infection, or ulceration. While macroscopic examination may suggest LCH, a biopsy is crucial to rule out malignancy and confirm the diagnosis. The etiology and pathogenesis of LCH remain unclear; however, it is believed to result from local angiogenesis stimulated by an increase in angiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) [<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The systemic increase in hormones during pregnancy is also a known trigger. Hormonal changes during pregnancy, particularly in the second or third trimesters, significantly increase the incidence of LCH, affecting up to 5% of pregnant women [<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>This case report describes a 23-year-old pregnant patient who developed a 14 mm lesion on her left breast within one week. While differential diagnoses may include benign lesions, such as cherry hemangiomas, the lesion&#x02019;s rapid growth and invasive nature warrant consideration of malignancy.</p><p>The aim of this case report is to explore the differential diagnosis and management approach for fast-growing lesions during pregnancy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="cases"><title>Case presentation</title><p>A 23-year-old woman, G4P3A1, presented at 33 weeks of pregnancy with a painless mass on her left breast. The lesion had appeared one week prior and had been growing rapidly. The mass began bleeding after her son accidentally struck his head against her left breast, prompting the patient to seek medical attention. Upon examination, the lesion measured approximately one centimeter in diameter and displayed a polypoid, elevated structure with a characteristic raspberry-red color (Figure <xref rid="FIG1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).</p><fig position="anchor" fig-type="figure" id="FIG1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>On the left, macroscopically the lesion measured one centimeter in diameter, exhibiting a polypoid, elevated structure with a raspberry-red colour. On the right, a detailed closer view of the lesion is presented.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="cureus-0017-00000078039-i01" position="float"/></fig><p>Upon gentle palpation, immediate bleeding was observed from the lesion due to its fragile tissue. Aside from spontaneous bleeding or bleeding triggered by contact, the patient reported no other systemic symptoms. Upon further examination, this was the only lesion present on her body. Clinical evaluation of the breasts, in line with her gestational age, was unremarkable, with no evidence of axillary or inguinal lymphadenopathy.</p><p>Given its rapid development and vascular nature, the lesion was highly suggestive of LCH. However, other benign and malignant possibilities could not be ruled out. To establish a definitive diagnosis, a biopsy was deemed essential. Due to the lesion's high risk of bleeding, an excisional biopsy was preferred. The differential diagnosis prompted a discussion of various treatment options, including ablation, cryotherapy, laser therapy, and surgical excision.</p><p>Surgical resection was performed under local anesthesia using 2% xylocaine, with the goal of obtaining a definitive histopathological diagnosis. The lesion was completely excised with a macroscopic margin of 5 mm. Histopathology revealed a specimen consisting of a non-oriented elliptical skin excision from the left breast, measuring 14 x 7 mm. At its center, the lesion exhibited a raised pink to dark pink appearance with a smooth surface, measuring 14 x 9 mm and 5 mm in height. The lesion was located 2 mm from the nearest surgical margin, with the excision margins marked in green ink (Figure <xref rid="FIG2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).</p><fig position="anchor" fig-type="figure" id="FIG2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>(Left) H&#x00026;E staining reveals centrally raised pink- to dark-pink lesion is seen with a smooth surface, measuring 14 x 9 mm with closest surgical margins of 2mm, with the excision margins inked green (Top right).

Microscopically, the lesion exhibited a mushroom-shaped, raised, partially polypoid structure with overlying atrophic epidermis and peripheral acanthosis. At the center, the dermis displayed a prominent branching capillary network, resembling vascular lobules, with minimal erythrocyte presence and notable mitotic activity (Figure <xref rid="FIG2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). No ulceration, atypia, or evidence of malignancy was observed. The histopathological findings were consistent with an LCH of the skin of the breast.</p><p>The patient was discharged on the same day as the excision in good general health, and no recurrence was noted during the remainder of the pregnancy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>A lobular capillary hemangioma is a benign, vascular lesion of the skin and mucosa. Different subtypes of LCH are described with the most frequent being the cutaneous type (86%) and mucosal type (12%) [<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The precise etiology of LCH is unknown.

The MAPK pathway may be attributed to the physiologic and pathologic angiogenesis. Staining for the phosphorylated form of MAPK (P-MAPK) may help the pathologist differentiate benign from malignant tumors. Inhibitors of the MAPK pathway may be useful for treatment options. Trauma or irritation (such as infection) is associated with the development of approximately 7-50% of LCH cases, as seen in our patient [<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. During pregnancy, the immune response is heightened due to increased levels of sex hormones like estrogen, further contributing to the lesion's development. Notably, around 30% of periungual LCH cases are associated with the use of certain medications.</p><p>Clinically, LCH often presents as a small, shiny red or pink papule [<xref rid="REF14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The lesion is typically elevated and may have an irregular surface. It undergoes rapid growth initially before stabilizing. In most cases, it is painless and highly vascularized, making it prone to oozing, bleeding, and ulceration. The ease of bleeding, particularly during pregnancy, is a significant concern for patients and increases susceptibility to infection. When located in the esophagus, LCH can cause difficulty swallowing, and if situated in the airway, it may lead to breathing problems. Rapidly growing cutaneous lesions, especially during pregnancy, present a clinical challenge. It is crucial to accurately identify these lesions, as some may be malignant.</p><p>Table <xref rid="TAB2" ref-type="table">2</xref> presents a list of fast-growing lesions that may occur during pregnancy, along with their clinical presentations and associated risks [<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Given the potential dangers linked to these lesions, accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment are of paramount importance. For instance, while basal cell carcinoma may remain indolent for an extended period, it can accelerate and ulcerate during pregnancy. Similarly, although melanoma is rare, its prognosis can be significantly worsened if diagnosed too late, highlighting the critical need to distinguish it from conditions like LCH.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="TAB2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><title>Differential diagnoses of fast-growing cutaneous lesions during pregnancy together with their presentation and risks </title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr style="background-color:#ccc"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Lesion Type</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Presentation</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Risks</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Benign Lesions</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td></tr><tr style="background-color:#ccc"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Hemangioma</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Bright red (mostly) birthmark; rubbery bump or flat red patch</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Ulceration, pain, bleeding, scarring, infection</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Peripheral giant cell granuloma</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Red to bluish-purple, usually more blue than pyogenic granuloma</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Ulceration, infection</td></tr><tr style="background-color:#ccc"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Keratoacanthoma</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Crateriform appearance, ulcer-like</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Scarring, ulceration, bleeding</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Angiokeratoma</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Dark bluish-red lesion with crust; often multiple and easily bleeding</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">N/A</td></tr><tr style="background-color:#ccc"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Lobular capillary hemangioma</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Rapidly growing, easily bleeding, red lesion on skin or mucosa</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Bleeding, ulceration, infection</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Cherry angioma</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Asymptomatic, solitary red lesion growing with age</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">N/A</td></tr><tr style="background-color:#ccc"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Bacillary angiomatosis</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Wart-like lesion, black-red, often multiple</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Immune deficiency</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Verruga perugana</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">(Solitary) angiomatous nodule</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Bartonella bacilliformis infection</td></tr><tr style="background-color:#ccc"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Malignant Lesions</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Basal cell carcinoma</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Flat, firm, pale area; small, raised, pink or red; easily bleeding</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Recurrence, metastasis</td></tr><tr style="background-color:#ccc"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Squamous cell carcinoma</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Red nodules or crusty patches; often an open wound</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Metastasis</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Nodular melanoma</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Elevated, firm lesion; dark-colored; rapidly growing</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Metastasis</td></tr><tr style="background-color:#ccc"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Merkel cell tumor</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Flesh-colored or bluish-red nodule; fast-growing; painless</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Metastasis</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Kaposi&#x02019;s sarcoma</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Purple, brown, or red spots or patches; bumpy or smooth</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">HIV (new diagnosis or exacerbation)</td></tr><tr style="background-color:#ccc"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Cutaneous neuroblastoma</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Fleshly red nodule on skin; heterogeneous, with multiple bruises; rapidly growing lump under skin</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Invasion, metastasis, death</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>Differentiating LCH from its differential diagnoses based solely on clinical assessment can be particularly challenging. While dermoscopy may provide additional insights, histopathological examination remains essential for a definitive diagnosis, which is crucial for guiding treatment decisions.

The choice of treatment depends on factors such as the size, location, and extent of the lesion.

The diagnosis of LCH or pyogenic granuloma is rare but its changes are increased during pregnancy. The preferred treatment for these lesions is local excision, which effectively minimizes complications like bleeding, ulcerations, infections, or recurrence. Furthermore, this approach provides an accurate pathological diagnosis, ensuring timely detection of any potential malignancies.</p><p>Fast-growing lesions during pregnancy are often influenced by hormonal changes, which contribute to increased vascular growth and may lead to the formation of tumors. These pregnancy-related tumors can be either benign or malignant. The rapid growth of these lesions, along with their tendency to bleed easily, can sometimes mimic malignancy, making their appearance confusing and challenging to diagnose. To ensure an accurate diagnosis, it is crucial to obtain a biopsy. This is the only way to rule out malignancies and confirm the true nature of the lesion.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to acknowledge the contribution of Dr. Vereeck, Sascha, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Antwerp University, Wilrijk, Belgium (Sascha.vereeck@uza.be).
