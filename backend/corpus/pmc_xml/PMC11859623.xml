The identification of plant genes related to defense mechanisms is crucial to unravel the molecular basis of plant&#x02013;pathogen interactions. Among the candidate genes, BiP stands out as a molecular chaperone located in the endoplasmic reticulum that facilitates protein folding and is induced under stress conditions, such as pathogen attacks. In this study, the <italic toggle="yes">Soy</italic>BiP<italic toggle="yes">D</italic> gene was expressed in <italic toggle="yes">Solanum lycopersicum</italic> plants and the plants were challenged with <italic toggle="yes">M. perniciosa</italic>. The control plants exhibited severe symptoms of witches&#x02019; broom disease, whereas the transgenic lines showed no or mild symptoms. Gel-free proteomics revealed significant changes in the protein profile associated with BiP overexpression. Inoculated transgenic plants had a higher abundance of resistance-related proteins, such as PR2, PR3, and PR10, along with increased activity of antioxidant enzymes, including superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), guaiacol peroxidase, and fungal cell wall-degrading enzymes (glucanases). Additionally, transgenic plants accumulated less H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, indicating more efficient control of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The interaction network analysis highlighted the activation of defense-associated signaling and metabolic pathways, conferring a state of defensive readiness even in the absence of pathogens. These results demonstrate that BiP overexpression increases the abundance of defense proteins, enhances antioxidant capacity, and confers greater tolerance to biotic stress. This study demonstrates the biotechnological potential of the BiP gene for genetic engineering crops with increased resistance to economically important diseases, such as witches&#x02019; broom in cocoa.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>witches&#x02019; broom disease</kwd><kwd>biotic stress resistance</kwd><kwd>proteomics</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>This research received no external funding.</funding-statement></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-plants-14-00503"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Cocoa (<italic toggle="yes">Theobroma cacao</italic> L.) is an agricultural crop of great economic importance worldwide as the base for the production of chocolate and a variety of other cocoa-derived products [<xref rid="B1-plants-14-00503" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-plants-14-00503" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Global cocoa production reached around 4449 million tons in 2023, demonstrating the magnitude of this commodity. In Brazil, production reached 290,000 tons in the same year, consolidating the country as an important producer in the cocoa market [<xref rid="B3-plants-14-00503" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. However, cocoa production faces significant challenges, especially from diseases that affect cocoa trees. Among the most significant is witches&#x02019; broom disease, caused by the hemibiotrophic fungus <italic toggle="yes">Moniliophthora perniciosa</italic> [<xref rid="B4-plants-14-00503" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-plants-14-00503" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], which poses a particularly serious threat, especially in the producing countries of South and Central America [<xref rid="B6-plants-14-00503" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-plants-14-00503" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. This disease, in the absence of integrated management, can cause devastating losses of up to 90% in severely affected areas. The infection causes abnormal tissue growth and deformation of shoots, flowers, and fruits, culminating in the death of the infected tissues [<xref rid="B8-plants-14-00503" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-plants-14-00503" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-plants-14-00503" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The complex life cycle of <italic toggle="yes">M. perniciosa</italic>, characterized by monokaryotic (biotrophic) and dikaryotic (necrotrophic) phases, involves penetration into plant tissues, intercellular colonization, and the subsequent production of spores that spread the disease [<xref rid="B4-plants-14-00503" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B11-plants-14-00503" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-plants-14-00503" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Responding effectively to the threat posed by witches&#x02019; broom requires an in-depth understanding of plant defense mechanisms and plant&#x02013;pathogen interactions. The search for solutions to control this disease has driven research on several fronts, with emphasis placed on integrated management practices, such as crop rotation, the use of resistant varieties, and the application of appropriate agronomic techniques. These approaches are essential to reduce the spread of the pathogen and reduce damage to crops [<xref rid="B13-plants-14-00503" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-plants-14-00503" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. At the same time, research into plant defense mechanisms, especially the activation of resistance genes, is emerging as a promising alternative to increase crops&#x02019; resilience to diseases [<xref rid="B15-plants-14-00503" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-plants-14-00503" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Proteomic analyses have excelled in identifying essential molecular targets for plant defense. [<xref rid="B17-plants-14-00503" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] explored protein interactions between <italic toggle="yes">T. cacao</italic> and necrosis-inducing proteins (NEPs) from <italic toggle="yes">M. perniciosa</italic>, and identified three target proteins in cacao that interact directly with the NEP, MpNep2.</p><p>In this context, BiP (binding immunoglobulin protein) has emerged as an important protein, since its increased expression is associated with protection against cell damage [<xref rid="B18-plants-14-00503" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-plants-14-00503" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. BiP is a molecular chaperone located in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), belonging to the HSP70 (Heat Shock Protein) family. This class of proteins is involved in the regulation of various cellular processes, such as the translocation of proteins into the ER, protein quality control, and protection against cellular stress [<xref rid="B20-plants-14-00503" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-plants-14-00503" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-plants-14-00503" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In the ER, BiP plays a key role in regulating the proper folding of proteins in the secretory pathway, ensuring the correct three-dimensional conformation of molecules before their secretion. During infection by <italic toggle="yes">Moniliophthora perniciosa</italic>, BiP helps control the accumulation of misfolded proteins and activates the UPR stress response. Its overexpression strengthens the plant&#x02019;s defenses, increasing resistance to the pathogen by improving protein homeostasis and activating antioxidant pathways [<xref rid="B23-plants-14-00503" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24-plants-14-00503" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. It acts as a stress sensor, helping to identify and degrade malformed proteins through the proteosomal degradation pathway, and is vital for maintaining protein homeostasis and preventing cell dysfunction [<xref rid="B24-plants-14-00503" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-plants-14-00503" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-plants-14-00503" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The regulation of BiP expression is crucial for cellular homeostasis and has been identified in all genomes of eukaryotic organisms [<xref rid="B18-plants-14-00503" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B27-plants-14-00503" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. A signaling pathway known as the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) is triggered when there is an increase in secretory activity or an accumulation of misfolded proteins within the endoplasmic reticulum, activated by a decrease in free BiP [<xref rid="B23-plants-14-00503" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B28-plants-14-00503" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Stress events, both biotic and abiotic, lead to the activation of this pathway, where a signaling cascade, mediated by the phosphorylation of stress response initiator proteins, induces molecular chaperones including BiP (one of the most induced), to correct malformed proteins [<xref rid="B18-plants-14-00503" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B23-plants-14-00503" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B29-plants-14-00503" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Studies indicate that increased BiP synthesis in plants is associated with a more effective response to biotic stresses, such as fungal infestations and insect attacks [<xref rid="B30-plants-14-00503" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B31-plants-14-00503" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In addition, overexpression of this gene via transgenesis is directly related to an increased tolerance to abiotic stresses, such as water deficit [<xref rid="B32-plants-14-00503" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B33-plants-14-00503" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B34-plants-14-00503" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p><p><italic toggle="yes">Soy</italic>BiP<italic toggle="yes">D</italic>, isolated from soybean (<italic toggle="yes">Glycine max</italic> L.)

Micro-Tom overexpressing the <italic toggle="yes">soy</italic>BiP<italic toggle="yes">D</italic> gene were tested for inoculation with the <italic toggle="yes">M. perniciosa</italic> fungus, where a correlation was observed between higher accumulation of BiP and better plant response in terms of growth, productivity, and resistance to infection. Therefore, in this study we aim to further investigate the potential of the BiP gene when overexpressed in model tomato plants (<italic toggle="yes">S. lycopersicum</italic>) in response to attack by the pathogen <italic toggle="yes">M. perniciosa</italic>. To this end, we used proteomic analysis techniques, including mass spectrometry, to identify upregulated and differentially abundant proteins (those present in both compared samples, but at different intensities) in control plants (NT) and in those overexpressing BiP, infected and not infected with the <italic toggle="yes">M. perniciosa</italic> fungus.</p><p>The results of this study can contribute significantly to the advancement of knowledge of plant&#x02013;pathogen interaction, particularly in the context of resistance to witches&#x02019; broom, by providing information on the molecular mechanisms of plant defense against <italic toggle="yes">M</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">perniciosa</italic> mediated by BiP overexpression. The identification of key proteins involved in the defense response, as well as the use of the BiP gene as a target, can lead to more resistant cultivars, impacting several agricultural crops, in addition to cocoa.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec2-plants-14-00503"><title>2. Results</title><sec id="sec2dot1-plants-14-00503"><title>2.1.

Micro-Tom overexpressing BiP presented resistance to <italic toggle="yes">M. perniciosa</italic>. Therefore, we aimed to better understand the molecular differences that could be related to our previous findings. NT and transgenic lineages were inoculated with <italic toggle="yes">M. perniciosa</italic> basidiospores, and again, we observed that NT plants showed severe symptoms of infection, including hyperplasia, overgrowth and blackening, whereas the lineages with the highest accumulation of BiP (L9, L10, and L12) remained asymptomatic throughout the experimental period (45 days after infection), with no visible signs of infection (<xref rid="plants-14-00503-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>Mass spectrometry analysis was carried comparing transgenic plants (L12) and control plants (NT), both inoculated and non-inoculated with <italic toggle="yes">M. perniciosa</italic>, revealing a significant number of proteins in different experimental conditions. In non-inoculated plants, a total of 1911 proteins were identified in the NT plants, while 1909 proteins were detected in the L12 transgenic plants. In the inoculated plants, a total of 1588 proteins were identified in NT, while 1406 proteins were detected in L12. After filtering the data based on identification in 100% of the triplicates, 273 proteins were retained in the NT plants and 377 proteins in the L12 BiP plants in unstressed conditions. Considering the inoculated treatment, 254 proteins were retained in NT plants and 246 proteins in transgenic plants (<xref rid="app1-plants-14-00503" ref-type="app">Supplementary Figure S4</xref>). Venn diagrams were used to show the number of upregulated and differentially abundant proteins between the experimental conditions. In the comparative non-inoculated treatment (<xref rid="app1-plants-14-00503" ref-type="app">Supplementary Figure S5A</xref>), 14 proteins were upregulated in the NT plants, while 34 proteins were upregulated in the transgenic plants, with 181 differentially abundant proteins between the groups. In the comparative treatment after inoculation (<xref rid="app1-plants-14-00503" ref-type="app">Supplementary Figure S5B</xref>), 37 proteins were identified as being upregulated in NT plants, while 30 proteins were upregulated in the transgenic plants, with 141 proteins being differentially abundant between the two groups. According to the principal component analysis (PCA) and the Venn diagram methods, all the proteins identified as being upregulated and differential were considered. However, the analysis of these proteins only included those that met the significance criteria (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic>-value &#x0003c; 0.05 and |fold-change| &#x0003e; 1.5) (<xref rid="app1-plants-14-00503" ref-type="app">Supplementary Tables S1 and S2</xref>).</p><p>The heatmap shows the differentially abundant proteins for each treatment. A total of 57 upregulated and differentially abundant proteins were identified in the comparison of the non-inoculated NT plants vs. the L12 BiP plants (<xref rid="plants-14-00503-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>A), while 78 proteins were detected as being upregulated or differentially abundant in NT vs. L12 BiP in the inoculated treatment (<xref rid="plants-14-00503-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>A), allowing for a more detailed view of the specific changes imposed on the proteomic profile (<xref rid="app1-plants-14-00503" ref-type="app">Supplementary Tables S1 and S2</xref>).</p><p>The comparative proteomic analysis of the non-inoculated heatmap (<xref rid="plants-14-00503-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>A), revealed significant differences in specific protein abundance. Hierarchical clustering highlighted proteins that were upregulated or differentially abundant, associated with various biological processes. In the NT plants, upregulated proteins associated with energy metabolism were identified, such as glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and malate dehydrogenase, involved in glycolysis and the citric acid cycle. In the field of regulation and signaling, proteins such as histone H2A, which acts in DNA compaction, and RING-type domain-containing protein, involved in ubiquitination, stood out. In addition, the chlorophyll a-b binding protein was detected, which plays an important role in photosynthesis, especially in light capture and energy transfer. However, in the transgenic plants, upregulated proteins such as luminal-binding protein precursor (BiP), an essential chaperone for protein folding, as well as aspartic proteinase and annexin, which act in protein degradation and membrane stabilization, were identified. In energy metabolism, proteins such as triosephosphate isomerase and malate dehydrogenase were observed, while in regulation and signaling, 14-3-3 domain-containing protein and isocitrate dehydrogenase (NADP+) stood out. Among the differentially abundant proteins identified between the treatments, the most abundant proteins in the transgenic plants included those related to energy metabolism, such as glycinamide ribonucleotide synthetase, which is essential for purine biosynthesis. Proteins related to regulation and signaling were detected, such as leucine-rich repeat-containing N-terminal proteins, with potential involvement in pathogen recognition, and proteins involved in protein folding such as peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase. On the other hand, among the most abundant proteins in NT plants, carboxypeptidase, involved in protein degradation, stood out. The functional characterization of the proteins (<xref rid="plants-14-00503-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>B) revealed that those with the greatest participation were those associated with ATPase activity and cofactor binding, both representing 26.1% of the total proteins. In addition, 21.7% of the proteins showed enzyme inhibitor activity. Proteins associated with oxidoreductive activity and heat shock protein binding were also detected, accounting for 13.0% each. In the biological processes (<xref rid="plants-14-00503-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>B) (<xref rid="app1-plants-14-00503" ref-type="app">Supplementary Table S1</xref>), the largest proportion of proteins (21.2%) was involved in the generation of metabolic precursors and energy, followed by proteins associated with protein folding (15.2%), highlighting the role of chaperones in the endoplasmic reticulum. Other significant categories included proteins involved in glucose metabolism and the regulation of molecular functions, both accounting for 12.1%.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-plants-14-00503"><title>2.2. The Identification of Upregulated and Differentially Abundant Proteins Revealed That Plants That Accumulate BiP Responded Differently than Control Plants to Pathogen Infection, by Activating Defense and Oxidative Stress Proteins</title><p>In NT plants, we identified upregulated proteins related to photosynthesis and chloroplast metabolism, such as ATP synthase subunits (&#x00394; and &#x003b5;) and photosystem II oxygen evolution system proteins, such as 23 kDa subunit and PSB27-H1.

On the other hand, L12 BiP plants showed a greater abundance of the protein related to energy metabolism, glycinamide ribonucleotide synthetase, which is essential for purine biosynthesis. With regard to regulation and signaling, peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase, involved in protein folding, was detected, indicating specific adaptations to stress and the maintenance of cellular homeostasis.</p><p>Functional characterization of the proteins (<xref rid="plants-14-00503-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>B, <xref rid="app1-plants-14-00503" ref-type="app">Supplementary Table S2</xref>) showed that 47.1% of the proteins in the treatment were involved in tetrapyrrole binding, associated with photosynthesis and pigment metabolism. Other molecular functions included proteins with chitin-binding activities, ATP synthase activity, and specific binding to protein domains, each representing 17.6%, reflecting functional diversification in response to inoculation. In the biological processes, 16.2% of the proteins were related to the generation of metabolic precursors and energy. Proteins involved in carbohydrate metabolism and photosynthesis were also predominant, accounting for 14.4% each. In addition, there was a high participation of proteins associated with the response to biotic and abiotic stimuli (10.8%).

In the NT vs. L12 BiP non-inoculated treatment (<xref rid="plants-14-00503-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>A), 16 proteins were detected. The NT plants showed the upregulation of 27 kDa acidic endochitinase, a protein associated with chitin degradation, which is a common component of fungal cell walls. In contrast, the BiP plants exhibited a more diverse protein profile, geared towards defense even without inoculation, with upregulated proteins including two isoforms of the SCP domain-containing protein, associated with pathogen recognition and triggering defense responses, and the RRL-RLP leucine-rich repeat-containing protein, known for its role in pathogen recognition. Other important defense proteins, such as the chitin-binding type-1 domain-containing protein and the bulb-type lectin domain-containing protein, were also found exclusively in L12 BiP plants, both associated with pathogen recognition and response to biotic stimuli. In addition, antioxidant proteins, such as thioredoxin domain-containing protein and annexin, were also upregulated in the transgenic plants. Although peroxidase was present in both genotypes, its accumulation was significantly higher in NT, while it was possible to detect PR10 protein, wound-induced proteinase inhibitor 1, and proteinase inhibitor II in both genotypes, with higher abundance in L12 BiP plants.</p><p>With M. perniciosa infection, we also identified diverse accumulation of defense proteins in the L12 BiP plants (<xref rid="plants-14-00503-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>B). In the inoculated NT plants, some upregulated proteins were associated with stress and defense responses, such as the osmotin homolog, related to the response to osmotic stress, and glutaredoxi, which acts in the control of oxidative stress. In addition, the Avr9/Cf-9 rapidly elicited protein, known for its role in elicitor-activated defense, was also upregulated to NT plants. In inoculated BiP plants, there was a greater abundance of upregulated proteins, many of which are directly linked to the degradation of fungal cell wall components and defense against pathogens, such as the glucan endo-1,3-beta-<sc>d</sc>-glucosidase protein, where three isoforms were identified. Other defense and biotic stress response proteins, such as pathogenesis-related protein PR2, PR1 protein, and PR10 protein, were also only detected in the transgenic plants, reinforcing the activation of a more robust defense response. In addition, the BiP L12 plants presented upregulated antioxidant proteins, such as thioredoxin-dependent peroxiredoxin, as well as several isoforms of peroxidase with high abundance. Among the proteins shared after inoculation, superoxide dismutase stood out, which was slightly more abundant in NT plants. Although both genotypes accumulated superoxide dismutase, the NT plants were focused on a specific antioxidant response, while the L12 plants exhibited a broader profile of antioxidant enzymes.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3-plants-14-00503"><title>2.3.

Discussion</title><p>Overexpression of the molecular chaperone BiP in transgenic plants has been associated with their response to osmotic stress and drought tolerance by maintaining cellular homeostasis and delaying hypersensitive cell death [<xref rid="B33-plants-14-00503" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B35-plants-14-00503" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="B36-plants-14-00503" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="B37-plants-14-00503" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Despite its association with abiotic stress, little is known about BiP&#x02019;s role in plant resistance to biotic stress. Previous studies have mainly focused on metabolic [<xref rid="B38-plants-14-00503" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="B39-plants-14-00503" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] and signaling pathways [<xref rid="B40-plants-14-00503" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] that suffer modifications under BiP accumulation and that could be related to the plant&#x02013;pathogen interaction. In contrast, we focused on the fundamental protein composition modification imposed by BiP accumulation that could be related to plant resistance to fungal attack. For this, it was essential to first obtain transgenic <italic toggle="yes">Solanun lycopersicum</italic> plants that overexpressed BiP and had acquired resistance to the very aggressive pathogen, <italic toggle="yes">M. perniciosa</italic>.</p><p><italic toggle="yes">M. perniciosa</italic> is a high-impact pathogen, responsible for plant death and reduced productivity. Infection by this fungus activates immune responses in plants, including the activation of defense proteins and the modulation of cellular signaling mechanisms, which are essential for controlling the infection and reducing damage [<xref rid="B41-plants-14-00503" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The resistance observed in transgenic plants overexpressing BiP against <italic toggle="yes">M. perniciosa</italic> suggests that BiP accumulation may alter the plants&#x02019; protein composition, enhancing their defense against the fungus.</p><p>The observation that the total number of proteins identified in transgenic and NT plants was similar suggested that BiP overexpression alone did not cause significant changes in the plants&#x02019; basic metabolic processes. However, the protein composition was variable. NT plants showed a higher abundance of proteins related to energy metabolism, such as glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and malate dehydrogenase (MDH), both playing a role in glycolysis, generating ATP and metabolic intermediates that are essential for cell survival. In addition, under oxidative stress, this protein can undergo oxidative post-translational modifications (oxPTMs), such as sulfenylation and nitrosylation, which redirect its function towards cell signaling. These changes allow it to act in processes such as the response to oxidative damage and the regulation of apoptosis, highlighting its relevance as a mediator of cellular responses to stress [<xref rid="B42-plants-14-00503" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. MDH, a member of the citric acid cycle, contributes to the production of NADH, which is essential for the continuity of metabolic flows and for maintaining the reducing power in cells [<xref rid="B43-plants-14-00503" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. This activity is important for NT plants, allowing them to meet normal metabolic demands and face the challenges imposed by environmental stresses. In addition, proteins related to structural and genomic regulation have been identified, such as histone H2A and the RING-type domain-containing protein, indicating a greater control over DNA compression and protein regulation by ubiquitination, fundamental processes for maintaining cellular balance [<xref rid="B44-plants-14-00503" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="B45-plants-14-00503" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. In contrast, in transgenic plants, proteome BiP stood out, indicating the overexpression of this chaperone. In addition, the increased abundance of proteins such as triosephosphate isomerase (TPI), a crucial enzyme for glycolyses, and 14-3-3 domain-containing protein, involved in cell signaling processes, indicated adjustments in metabolism and cell signaling. Together, these results suggest that different pathways, related to cell maintenance and immune responses in plants, are triggered in BiP-transgenic plants [<xref rid="B46-plants-14-00503" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="B47-plants-14-00503" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] even in the absence of stressors. Indeed, it has been reported that the acquired tolerance to drought of transgenic plants overexpressing BiP [<xref rid="B33-plants-14-00503" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] is somehow related to the UPR (unfolded protein response) pathway, which induces ER-associated quality control genes to promote the restoration of ER homeostasis [<xref rid="B48-plants-14-00503" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="B49-plants-14-00503" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="B50-plants-14-00503" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="B51-plants-14-00503" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="B52-plants-14-00503" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="B53-plants-14-00503" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>].

In NT plants, proteins that play key roles in the stability and functionality of photosystem II stood out, such as the ATP synthase subunits (&#x00394; and &#x003b5;) [<xref rid="B4-plants-14-00503" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], the 23 kDa subunit protein (PsbP) and PSB27-H1.

Further, the presence of ribose-5-phosphate isomerase reinforces the importance of the pentose pathway, which is essential for nucleotide synthesis and cell regeneration [<xref rid="B57-plants-14-00503" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], indicating the need for greater energy input to cope with biotic stress. On the other hand, when challenged with <italic toggle="yes">M. perniciosa</italic>, BiP-transgenic plants&#x02019; protein profile showed a metabolic direction aimed at energy mobilization and the maintenance of cellular homeostasis, such as glycinamide ribonucleotide synthetase [<xref rid="B58-plants-14-00503" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>], sucrose-phosphate synthase [<xref rid="B59-plants-14-00503" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>,<xref rid="B60-plants-14-00503" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>], and peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase [<xref rid="B61-plants-14-00503" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. These proteins are mainly related to production of nucleotides necessary for cell development, sucrose production, and to provide additional energy contributing to signaling and metabolic support under stress and protein folding, even under pathogen infection [<xref rid="B61-plants-14-00503" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. The biological process of the proteins confirmed these differences, indicating that NT plants prioritize photosynthetic processes to maintain basic energy flows, while BiP-transgenic plants adjust their energy metabolism and cell repair mechanisms.</p><p>We further analyzed specific proteins related to plant defense mechanisms, such as PRs and antioxidant enzymes. The higher abundance of defense proteins in BiP-transgenic plants suggests they have a pre-established state of defense, even in the absence of infection, which is usually characterized by the basal activation of response mechanisms to biotic and oxidative stress. In other pathosystems, this state of metabolic alert enables the early activation of proteins associated with the recognition of pathogen molecular signals, even before direct contact with the infectious agent, enabling a faster and more effective response [<xref rid="B62-plants-14-00503" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>,<xref rid="B63-plants-14-00503" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. In fact, it has already been shown that BiP accumulation in transgenic <italic toggle="yes">Arabdopsis thaliana</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Glycine max</italic> promotes a delay in the perception of stress symptoms in plants and negatively regulates the process of programed cell death (PCD) [<xref rid="B35-plants-14-00503" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="B54-plants-14-00503" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. The higher accumulation of peroxidase and wound-induced proteinase observed on NT plants in the absence of <italic toggle="yes">M. perniciosa</italic> suggests that, even in control conditions, NT plants deal with a stronger molecular stress situation in comparison to BiP-transgenic plants [<xref rid="B64-plants-14-00503" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>,<xref rid="B65-plants-14-00503" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. We decided to further quantify antioxidant enzymes&#x02019; activities in three different BiP-transgenic lineages (L2, L9 and L12) to evaluate if the mechanism was conserved between the lineages. The observation that all BiP-transgenic lineages tested presented a higher activity of catalase, GPX and SOD, in the absence of or during <italic toggle="yes">M. perniciosa</italic> infection, suggests that with BiP accumulation, plants have an improved ability to eliminate ROS. This mechanism must be especially important to plant defense against <italic toggle="yes">M. perniciosa</italic>, since the production of ROS, including superoxide and hydrogen peroxide, has already been reported to act as an initial barrier to limit the progression of witches&#x02019; broom disease [<xref rid="B66-plants-14-00503" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>,<xref rid="B67-plants-14-00503" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>,<xref rid="B68-plants-14-00503" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. In different pathosystems, these enzymes have been shown to play key roles in plant defense against pathogens. For example, in citrus rootstocks infected by <italic toggle="yes">Phytophthora nicotianae</italic>, the most tolerant genotypes exhibited greater regulation of CAT, SOD, and GPX, which was crucial for controlling H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> levels and maintaining redox homeostasis, while more sensitive genotypes showed excessive accumulation of ROS and low antioxidant efficiency [<xref rid="B69-plants-14-00503" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. In addition, the potential of guaiacol as an antioxidant agent was highlighted by its fungicidal activity against <italic toggle="yes">Fusarium graminearum</italic>, where its ability to modulate the pathogen&#x02019;s oxidative metabolism reduced fungal growth and the production of deoxynivalenol (DON), reinforcing the critical role of antioxidant enzymes in reducing oxidative stress during plant&#x02013;pathogen interactions [<xref rid="B70-plants-14-00503" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. The quantification of hydrogen peroxide in plants validated the proteomic data, since the NT plants had the highest levels of hydrogen peroxide, while transgenic plants contained significantly lower levels, in both inoculated and non-inoculated conditions.</p><p>Mass spectrometry also revealed that other proteins related specifically to plant defense mechanisms were more abundant on BiP-transgenic plants, even in the absence of <italic toggle="yes">M. perniciosa</italic>, such as RRL-RLP Leucine-rich repeat-containing protein, PR-10, and PR1. RRL-RLP leucine-rich repeat-containing protein is recognized in other pathosystems for its function in immunity triggered by pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMP-Triggered Immunity, PTI), allowing for the recognition of conserved structures, such as flagellins in bacteria and chitins in fungi [<xref rid="B71-plants-14-00503" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Its lower abundance in NT plants may indicate a limitation in the efficiency of the immune response to infectious agents.

Therefore, the highest level of this PR protein in transgenic plants must provide a molecular advantage to face <italic toggle="yes">M. perniciosa</italic> infection, or any other stressful situation, strengthening the plants&#x02019; defensive capacity and preparing them to deal more effectively with future aggressions. When challenged with <italic toggle="yes">M. perniciosa</italic>, BiP-transgenic plants presented an even higher abundance of defense proteins such as PR1, PR 2 (glucan endo-1,3-beta-D-glucosidase), PR3 (chitin-binding type-1 domain protein) and PR10. These PR proteins may act as antimicrobial agents and modulators of the cellular environment, creating unfavorable conditions for the growth and spread of the pathogen [<xref rid="B75-plants-14-00503" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. The higher accumulation of PR protein was also confirmed when we quantified the activity of glucanase (PR2) and by the Western blot assay (PR 1 and PR10). The higher accumulation of PRs after <italic toggle="yes">M. perniciosa</italic> inoculation reinforces the role of BiP in promoting the production of defense-related proteins, which is essential for the replication and protein synthesis of the invaders [<xref rid="B72-plants-14-00503" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>,<xref rid="B76-plants-14-00503" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. Santos et al. (2023) revisited the molecular mechanisms of the interaction between <italic toggle="yes">T. cacao</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">M. perniciosa</italic>, highlighting the role of proteins such as PR1, PR2, PR10, peroxidase and superoxide dismutase (SOD) in the defense against the pathogen, suggesting that these proteins are promising biotechnological targets for genetic engineering programs aiming to achieve resistance to witches&#x02019; broom disease. Similarly, the present study with BiP-transgenic plants also identified key proteins associated with defense, such as PRs and antioxidants, corroborating the importance of these elements in modulating the response to oxidative stress and defense against fungal infections. These findings offer new perspectives on the use of BiP as a biotechnological tool in the development of cocoa cultivars that are more resistant to <italic toggle="yes">M. perniciosa</italic>, with implications for disease control. Further studies, including investigations into the specific molecular mechanisms involved in resistance, are needed to clarify the role of BiP in the plant&#x02013;pathogen interaction and to explore its potential in other crops susceptible to fungal diseases (<xref rid="plants-14-00503-f010" ref-type="fig">Figure 10</xref>). </p></sec><sec id="sec4-plants-14-00503"><title>4.

The period of 45 days after inoculation was selected for the analysis since in this interval, the symptoms of infection by <italic toggle="yes">Moniliophthora perniciosa</italic> were more advanced, allowing for a more precise assessment of the plants&#x02019; response. At this stage, the infection was already clearly evident, but the pathogen had not yet reached the stage of causing plant necrosis and death, which made it possible to study molecular interactions and plant defenses before the irreversible progression of the disease.

Conclusions</title><p>In this study, we found that overexpression of the <italic toggle="yes">soy</italic>BiP<italic toggle="yes">D</italic> gene in tomato plants (<italic toggle="yes">Solanum lycopersicum</italic>) conferred greater resistance to the pathogen <italic toggle="yes">Moniliophthora perniciosa</italic>. While the NT plants succumbed to the infection after showing severe symptoms, the transgenic strains L9, L10, and L12 remained asymptomatic throughout the experiment. This difference was strongly associated with the greater accumulation of BiP, which contributed to cellular homeostasis by reorganizing damaged proteins and modulating defense pathways. Our results highlight the potential of BiP as a molecular chaperone capable of increasing plant resilience, especially in environments prone to stress caused by pathogens. Proteomic analyses showed that even under normal conditions, overexpression of BiP gave the transgenic plants a pre-activated defense state, preparing them to respond more efficiently to future stresses. In response to inoculation, the transgenic plants prioritized the production of defense proteins, such as PR2, PR3, and PR10, which play key roles in the plant&#x02019;s immune response. Another highlight was the superior efficiency of the L12 BiP plants in regulating the accumulation of ROS, which is essential for preventing oxidative damage and maintaining the redox balance. Antioxidant proteins such as peroxidases and PRX, along with SOD, GPX, and catalase, showed a more robust antioxidant system in the transgenic plants. In contrast, NT plants showed high levels of hydrogen peroxide, indicating a lower efficiency in controlling ROS. The broader implications of this study reinforce the biotechnological potential of the BiP gene for innovation in agriculture. These results demonstrate that the combination of enhanced basal defense, adjusted metabolic responses and efficient antioxidant systems may offer a promising strategy to face biotic challenges in species of agricultural interest, such as cocoa.
