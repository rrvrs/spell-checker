However, evidence regarding the impacts of floods on hospitalization remains limited. Here we collected daily hospitalization counts during 2000&#x02013;2019 from 747 communities in Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, New Zealand, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam. For each community, flooded days were defined as days from the start dates to the end dates of flood events. Lag&#x02013;response associations between flooded day and daily hospitalization risks were estimated for each community using a quasi-Poisson regression model with a distributed lag nonlinear function. The community-specific estimates were then pooled using a random-effects meta-analysis. Based on the pooled estimates, attributable fractions of hospitalizations due to floods were calculated. We found that hospitalization risks increased and persisted for up to 210&#x02009;days after flood exposure, with the overall relative risks being 1.26 (95% confidence interval 1.15&#x02013;1.38) for all causes, 1.35 (1.21&#x02013;1.50) for cardiovascular diseases, 1.30 (1.13&#x02013;1.49) for respiratory diseases, 1.26 (1.10&#x02013;1.44) for infectious diseases, 1.30 (1.17&#x02013;1.45) for digestive diseases, 1.11 (0.98&#x02013;1.25) for mental disorders, 1.61 (1.39&#x02013;1.86) for diabetes, 1.35 (1.21&#x02013;1.50) for injury, 1.34 (1.21&#x02013;1.48) for cancer, 1.34 (1.20&#x02013;1.50) for nervous system disorders and 1.40 (1.22&#x02013;1.60) for renal diseases. The associations were modified by climate types, flood severity, age, population density and socioeconomic status. Flood exposure contributed to hospitalizations by up to 0.27% from all causes. This study revealed that flood exposure was associated with increased all-cause and ten cause-specific hospitalization risks within up to 210&#x02009;days after exposure.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="web-summary"><p id="Par2">Using 300 million hospital records from eight countries and territories, this study found that exposure to floods was associated with increased risks of hospitalizations for all causes considered: cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases, infectious diseases, digestive diseases, mental disorders, diabetes, injury, cancer, nervous system disorders and renal diseases.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Diseases</kwd><kwd>Health services</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100004704</institution-id><institution>National Research Council of Thailand (NRCT)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>N33A650979</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tantrakarnapa</surname><given-names>Kraichat</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>Department of Health | National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GNT2000581</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Guo</surname><given-names>Yuming</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer Nature Limited 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Main</title><p id="Par3">Floods are the most frequent natural disaster, and an estimated 23% of the global population is exposed to inundation depths of &#x0003e;0.15&#x02009;m during 1-in-100-year flood events<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Projections indicate an escalation in the severity, duration and frequency of floods due to the more frequent extreme precipitation events and rising sea levels due to global warming<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Besides the well-recognized direct health impacts caused by physical forces of floods or related accidental events (for example, drowning, electrocution and hypothermia), emerging evidence suggests that floods can indirectly have broad impacts on human health<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. This suggests that the health impact of floods may have been underestimated and will further exacerbate as the climate changes.</p><p id="Par4">Current epidemiological evidence about the health impacts of flood exposure focuses on disease incidence risks, mainly covering digestive diseases, infectious diseases and mental disorders, with some evidence for respiratory diseases, cardiovascular diseases and nervous system disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. However, floods can lead to risk factors that would result in health impacts beyond those covered by the current epidemiological evidence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Contaminated food and water can lead to digestive diseases, while exposure to pathogens and compromised hygiene practices increases the risks of respiratory and infectious diseases. Displacement and deteriorated living environments contribute to both physical and psychological impacts. Furthermore, impaired access to healthcare and medication non-compliance (due to unavailability) can exacerbate preexisting chronic conditions. Therefore, it is plausible to hypothesize increased hospitalization risks for reasons including but not limited to cardiorespiratory diseases, mental disorders, infectious diseases and digestive diseases after flood events.</p><p id="Par5">Understanding the impact of floods on hospitalization risks is crucial for healthcare providers to prepare for the increased demand of health services after flood events, for public health institutions to surveil outbreaks and for policymakers to enhance preparedness and response protocols, especially considering the anticipated surge in flood events. Despite the evident need for comprehensive knowledge, previous studies only assessed the associations of flood with a handful of cause-specific hospitalizations in a single region, including cardiovascular, respiratory and infectious diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. To address the knowledge gaps, we conducted a multi-country/territory study covering hospitalizations over two decades across regions with various geographical and demographic characteristics. We aimed to quantify the hospitalization risks and periods of concern of various major diseases in the aftermath of floods and to identify potential effect modifiers.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p id="Par6">We included 747 communities from eight countries and territories (hereafter countries/territories) in the analyses, after excluding 301 communities that were without flood events during the study period (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>).

Among populations exposed to floods, the risks of hospitalization increased immediately (except that respiratory diseases and mental disorders increased gradually) and returned to normal around 210&#x02009;days (90&#x02009;days for infectious diseases and 150&#x02009;days for mental disorders) after floods.

One study observed an increased risk of hospitalization due to schizophrenia during 5&#x02013;15&#x02009;days after floods in a provincial capital city of mainland China in 2005&#x02013;2014 (ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>). In addition, the results indicated that the association was stronger among those aged &#x0003c;40&#x02009;years. Another study in seven provinces in the Vietnam Mekong River Delta found that the risks of hospitalizations for non-external causes (RR 1.07, 95% confidence interval 1.03&#x02013;1.11), infectious diseases (1.16, 1.04&#x02013;1.30) and respiratory diseases (1.26, 1.16&#x02013;1.36) increased during and after flood seasons in 2011&#x02013;2014 (ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>). The increase in hospitalization risk lasted for around 4&#x02009;weeks for non-external causes and infectious diseases, and more than 4&#x02009;weeks for respiratory diseases. The other study observed that flood exposure was associated with increased hospitalization risks of cardiovascular diseases (1.04, 1.02&#x02013;1.06), chronic respiratory diseases (1.07, 1.02&#x02013;1.11), respiratory infections (1.11, 1.05&#x02013;1.17) and food- or water-borne diseases (1.17, 1.06&#x02013;1.30) in New York State during 2002&#x02013;2018 (ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>). The findings of these studies generally align with our findings, but differences exist in association strengths and maximum lag periods. The differences may stem from variations in spatial coverage and exposure assessment methods. Our study notably extended the spatial coverage to eight countries/territories, while previous studies were limited to a city or a small region; the study in mainland China defined flood events with cumulative rainfall over consecutive days, which may result in exposure misclassification because rainfall is only one of the factors leading to flood occurrences.</p><p id="Par13">Our study identified increases in hospitalization risks of all-cause and cause-specific diseases in 210&#x02009;days after flood exposure. There are several potential pathways, which may explain the adverse and lasting health effects. One way is through the contamination of water supply system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, which can elevate the risk of digestive diseases and aid the spread of infectious diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. In addition, floods can create environments that are conducive to the growth of fungi, bacteria, viruses and vectors such as mice, cockroaches and mosquitoes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. These environments can trigger outbreaks of respiratory, digestive and infectious diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Floods may also force massive evacuations, causing displacement. Even when temporary shelters are provided, insufficient sanitation facilities often result in hygiene issues, increasing the likelihood of respiratory, digestive and infectious diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Furthermore, access and capacity healthcare services may be impaired after floods, leading to delays in regular medical interventions, which include dialysis for renal diseases, chemotherapy and radiotherapy for cancer, and medication regimens for cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases, infectious diseases, digestive diseases, mental disorders, diabetes, nervous system disorders and renal diseases. Exposure to environmental hazards, such as extreme temperatures, high humidity and indoor air pollution, could contribute to a broad range of diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Finally, long-term psychological stress (for example, from property damage and financial losses) can worsen or induce adverse health outcomes by compromising the immune system, disrupting sleep, leading to substance abuse and diminishing self-care<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par14">We found that the RR of hospitalization for mental disorders was lower than for the other diseases. This could be due to several reasons. First, the onsets of mental disorders were less immediately compared with the other diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. This is supported by the observed lag&#x02013;response associations. Second, some individuals might be reluctant to seek help for mental health concerns because of stigma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Third, the other diseases (for example, injury and infectious diseases) might have been prioritized, so the hospitalization demands of mental disorders were less fulfilled in the 210&#x02009;days after floods.</p><p id="Par15">Our results also revealed counterintuitive findings, with a reduction or no difference in the risk of all-cause hospitalization after floods in certain countries/territories (for example, respiratory diseases in Thailand). These findings might be attributed to impaired admission capacity of and access (that is, traffic system) to local hospitals, implementation of protective public health interventions, or raised awareness of health after floods. In Australia, the hospitalization risks of some cause-specific diseases decreased after floods, while the hospitalization risks of other cause-specific diseases increased after floods. A reason for this might be that the hospitalizations of some diseases were prioritized after floods, so the hospitalizations of other diseases were delayed and limited in number. Further research is warranted to reveal the underlying mechanisms.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Effect modification</title><p id="Par16">Our findings align with the findings reported by the US Global Change Research Program, indicating that children or adolescents and older adults are particularly vulnerable to various health impacts of natural disasters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Children or adolescents are more vulnerable because some of their organs are still developing and they take in more food, water and air per unit of body weight compared with adults, which may expose them to more hazards during and after floods<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. A cross-national analysis of population surveys from 29 countries and a large-scale meta-analysis of 192 epidemiological studies both indicated that the peak age of the first onset of mental disorder is around 14&#x02009;years (refs. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>). Older adults are generally more frail, with existing illness, or dependent on nursing or assisted living facilities, and their compromised mobility exposes them to more environmental hazards during and after floods<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Our findings suggest that local climate type modifies the association between flood and hospitalization risks, which may be explained by several potential reasons. First, the infrastructure (for example, traffic and sewage) and health system resilience and preparedness (for example, food and water) to floods might vary with climate type. Second, the population vulnerability and prevalence of diseases might be different among communities with different climate types<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Communities with high population density exhibited stronger associations, possibly due to the longer time of exposure to hazardous environments caused by congestion during evacuations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>; abundant medical sources that were able to admit more patients; and a higher likelihood of infectious disease outbreaks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par17">Counterintuitively, the flood&#x02013;hospitalization associations showed less harm in communities with a lower SES (compared with a higher SES), where the residents were often thought to be more vulnerable to health hazards. The reason for this might be that a lower SES generally indicated less medical resources and resilience to natural disasters, resulting in hospitalization requests not being fulfilled owing to hospitals reaching capacity sooner after floods. In addition, people in this community might die before arriving at hospitals or might be unable to travel to hospital owing to traffic infrastructure interruption during and after floods, compared with people in communities where the traffic infrastructures were resilient to flooding disasters. Consequently, communities with a lower SES presented a smaller increase in hospitalization risk compared with communities with a higher SES.</p><p id="Par18">Surprisingly, the effects of more serious floods on hospitalization risks were less harmful. This is an unusual finding because more serious floods generally have a greater impact on the environment and infrastructure. One possible reason is that more serious floods had a greater impact on the capacities of healthcare systems and the traffic systems, leading to more patients not being admitted to hospital or dying before admission. Another possible reason is that serious floods forced large-scale evacuations, and individuals changed their residential community, so the hospitalizations among these individuals were excluded from the hospitalization of the original community.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Clinical and policy implications</title><p id="Par19">Our findings have important implications for clinical and policy decisions. Health service providers should anticipate increased health risks during and after floods and prepare for the heightened service demands, possibly through strengthening capacities in medical supplies, human resource management and triage strategy. Public health institutions should closely monitor reasons for hospitalization after floods as a method for disease control and efficient resource allocation in the aftermath of floods. Policymakers should prioritize enhancing health system resilience to natural disasters, recognizing that overwhelmed health systems after floods can lead to severe disease burden and even avoidable deaths. Moreover, policymakers should also improve disaster preparedness, early warning and detection systems, and efficient disaster response protocols to reduce the hazardous exposure during and after floods.</p><p id="Par20">Our findings highlight the importance of improving the resilience to climate change. Healthcare systems and traffic infrastructure that are resilient to flooding disasters can ensure that hospitalization needs are fulfilled during and after the disasters, reducing avoidable deaths and lessening the health burden. Additional attention should be given to communities with a low SES status, especially to those in low-income countries, given that the residents in these countries are exposed to more floods and have weaker abilities to migrate out of these flooding areas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p id="Par21">We included communities with diverse characteristics (for example, climate, geographic, demographic and socioeconomic) and all flood events in these communities.

By estimating the impacts on all-cause and ten cause-specific hospitalizations, this study provides comprehensive insight into the health impacts of exposure to floods.</p><p id="Par22">This study has some limitations. The Dartmouth Flood Observatory (DFO) dataset primarily covers flood events mentioned in the news and may underrepresent floods, especially in South America<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. This might have resulted in exposure misclassification, where flooded days were regarded as non-flooded days. However, this would only bias the associations towards the null, and the extent of the underrepresentation of floods was small<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Besides, the exposure assessment was at the community level rather than at the individual level because exact residential addresses were confidential. Some people might reside in non-flooded areas in a community that was deemed as flooded. However, these people would still be impacted by floods through interruptions to infrastructure and health services, impairment of food and water supply systems, evacuations and psychological stresses, and the exposure misclassification would probably bias our estimates towards the null. Furthermore, it is important to note that the observed increases in hospitalizations do not equate to the increases in hospitalization demands because some cause-specific hospitalizations may be low priority, the admission capacity of hospitalizations can be impaired, and the access to healthcare can be interrupted. However, this would lead to underestimation of the hospitalization risks.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par23">This study fills a gap in the knowledge about the associations between floods and hospitalization risks, based on a multi-country/territory dataset and standard time-series statistical methods.
