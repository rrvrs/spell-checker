Aim: To evaluate the effectiveness of two novel subunit vaccines targeting outer membrane proteins on LI. Methods: The two vaccines included OMP2c.cVLP, where the OMP2c antigen was anchored on the surface of capsid virus-like particles (cVLP); and MBP.INVASc, where antigens were anchored to an MBP fusion protein. Groups of six mice, as proof of concept, and six piglets were immunized with either OMP2c.cVLP, MBP.INVASc., or PBS as a control using a prime-boost regime. Results: Both OMP2c.cVLP and MBP.INVASc subunit vaccines induced strong antigen-specific serum IgG and IgA responses. There were no significant differences in weight gain among the groups. Mild-to-moderate clinical signs of LI infection were observed, but vaccinated groups showed lower inflammatory scores and fewer animals tested positive for bacteria by immunohistochemistry. Although neither vaccine completely prevented clinical signs of LI infection, both effectively reduced inflammation and lowered the pathogen load, thereby mitigating the severity of the disease, particularly the MBP.INVASc vaccine. Conclusions: These findings suggest that both vaccines have the potential for further development and optimization to enhance their protective efficacy against LI infections.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>pigs</kwd><kwd>antigen</kwd><kwd>virus-like particle</kwd><kwd>enteropathy</kwd><kwd>diarrhea</kwd><kwd>OMP2</kwd><kwd>MBP.INVASc</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>Innovation Fund Denmark</funding-source><award-id>8088-00032B</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>This research was funded by Innovation Fund Denmark, grant number 8088-00032B.</funding-statement></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-vaccines-13-00207"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Enteric pathogens pose a significant threat to livestock, compromising animal health and welfare and undermining production efficiency. Traditional treatments, reliant on antibiotics, face increasing challenges due to the emergence of antimicrobial resistance, prompting the necessity for the development of novel preventive or therapeutic approaches, including vaccines [<xref rid="B1-vaccines-13-00207" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. <italic toggle="yes">Lawsonia intracellularis</italic> (LI) causes proliferative enteropathy, resulting in the thickening of the intestinal epithelial cells of pigs, and these changes are highly correlated with the intracellular presence of the pathogen [<xref rid="B2-vaccines-13-00207" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. LI is endemic worldwide, resulting in significant economic losses for swine producers due to decreased growth rates, increased mortality, and the additional expenses associated with antimicrobial treatment [<xref rid="B3-vaccines-13-00207" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-vaccines-13-00207" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Infection often leads to diarrhea, progressing from watery to bloody, and stunted weight gain, which can be fatal, especially in young pigs [<xref rid="B4-vaccines-13-00207" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-vaccines-13-00207" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Currently, commercial live-attenuated and inactivated bacterin-based vaccines are available for LI prophylaxis. The live-attenuated vaccine, commercially available since 2001, requires strict management practices such as an antibiotic-free feed window [<xref rid="B6-vaccines-13-00207" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The immunity produced by such a vaccine seems efficient but is still less robust than the immunity conferred by natural infection [<xref rid="B4-vaccines-13-00207" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B7-vaccines-13-00207" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-vaccines-13-00207" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Even though some benefits, such as improved weight gain and reduced antimicrobial use, have been demonstrated, the live attenuated commercially available vaccine still does not fully prevent clinical disease and transmission [<xref rid="B9-vaccines-13-00207" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The inactivated vaccine, on the other hand, has no restrictive practices but tends to generate a lower immune response [<xref rid="B8-vaccines-13-00207" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], which remains suboptimal compared to natural infection. Considering that both vaccines do not provide full protection and have drawbacks [<xref rid="B6-vaccines-13-00207" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B8-vaccines-13-00207" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], further research into new vaccine approaches is necessary. Recent immunoproteomic studies have identified outer membrane proteins, such as OMP2c and INVASc, which are targets of naturally acquired immunity [<xref rid="B10-vaccines-13-00207" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. These proteins have shown protective efficacy when used as subunit vaccines, although previous studies have used co-formulation of the antigens. Recent research for other pathogens has developed vaccines based on capsid virus-like particles (cVLPs), combined with a unique technique to anchor antigens on the surface of the capsid [<xref rid="B11-vaccines-13-00207" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The repetitive surface geometry of cVLPs facilitates strong B cell receptor crosslinking and subsequent B cell activation. The structural mimic of the native virions enables efficient lymphatic drainage, uptake by antigen-presenting cells, and activation of the innate immune system [<xref rid="B11-vaccines-13-00207" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-vaccines-13-00207" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Therefore, cVLPs are potentially valuable as scaffolds for antigen display in vaccine development. In these constructs, vaccine antigens are expressed and purified as genetic fusions with a short split-protein binding tag, facilitating their attachment onto pre-assembled cVLPs. Upon mixing with cVLPs presenting the corresponding binding partner (a Catcher protein), a covalent isopeptide bond is formed between the Tag and antigen. A traditional approach is to link the antigen to a maltose-binding protein (MBP) fusion. This enhances the stability and solubility of the target antigen, which is particularly useful for antigens with poor solubility [<xref rid="B13-vaccines-13-00207" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The current study aimed to compare the humoral immune response of OMP2c and INVASc in their native structural context and when applied as subunit vaccines in mice, as a proof of concept, and piglets to assess their protective efficacy against LI.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-vaccines-13-00207"><title>2.

Immunization Study of Piglets</title><p>Eighteen (18) piglets, approximately two weeks old, were obtained from non-immunized Danish crossbreed sows and underwent CLP immunization. These piglets were purchased from a pig production herd in Denmark, with selection based on a birthweight of 1&#x02013;2 kg and a lack of prior disease history in the sows. Both male and female piglets were randomly included in the selection process. The selected piglets were divided into three groups, identified with earmarks (six pigs per group). Before vaccination, serum samples were taken from six randomly selected piglets. Piglets were then administered the initial immunization of either OMP2c.cVLP + AddaVax&#x02122; (Copenhagen, Denmark) adjuvant or MBP.INVASc + AddaVax&#x02122; adjuvant. All vaccines were given at a dose of 100 &#x000b5;g of total protein. A Control group was included, in which animals received a mock vaccination with PBS saline solution. One piglet from the control group died before the challenge. On the weaning day (17 days post prime), piglets were transported to the experimental facility at the University of Copenhagen, Frederiksberg, Denmark. Upon arrival, each piglet received a booster shot of the immunization according to their immunization plan. Serum samples were collected 24 days post-prime immunization (seven days post-boost).</p><p>The piglets were housed in separate rooms according to their assigned groups, with each pen featuring solid concrete floors and sawdust bedding. The facility maintained negative ventilation pressure and included a clean room for waste management. Daily waste, including used bedding, was collected in plastic bags and disinfected to prevent contamination. Strict hygiene protocols were followed, including complete changes of clothes, hairnets, gloves, and boots upon entry and exit from the rooms. Boots were disinfected each time, and handwashing and surface cleaning were conducted regularly. No materials were shared between rooms to prevent cross-contamination. Ventilation was maintained at a rate of ten air exchanges per hour, while temperature control kept the environment within 20&#x02013;24 &#x000b0;C. Additionally, piglets had access to a heated resting area maintained at 30&#x02013;32 &#x000b0;C. Throughout the study, piglets were provided ad libitum access to standard commercial feed without antibiotics, zinc, organic acids, or blood plasma.</p><p>Twelve (12) days after the booster, each animal was administered a capsule containing the LI challenge, with dosing repeated for three consecutive days. Piglets were weighed on the challenge day and on the termination day (12 days post-challenge). Post-challenge clinical examinations and fecal consistency scoring were conducted on days five, eight, and twelve. Fecal scoring followed a scale, in which 0 represented normal feces, 1 indicated mild diarrhea, 2 signified moderate diarrhea, and 3 indicated severe diarrhea or the presence of blood, following the criteria by Jacobs et al. [<xref rid="B17-vaccines-13-00207" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The body condition scoring was 0 for normal, while 1 indicated visible gaunt or sunken sides, and 2 was assigned when animals exhibited protruding spine and rib bones. Gross pathology assessments were conducted after termination, involving inspection of stomach contents, inspection of the small and large intestine, and evaluation of the ileocecal valve. Fragments from the distal ileum and mid-colon were collected for histopathological examination, while fecal content from the distal ileum, colon, and cecum was sampled for qPCR analysis.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot5-vaccines-13-00207"><title>2.5. qPCR Analysis</title><p>LI was detected in the fecal swab and intestinal content samples via qPCR following the protocol described by St&#x000e5;hl et al.

After routine processing and paraffin embedding, tissue sections were sliced at 4&#x02009;&#x000b5;m thickness and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&#x00026;E). Microscopic analysis was conducted using an Olympus BX45 light microscope equipped with a DP25 digital camera (Olympus, S&#x000f8;borg, Denmark). For the immunohistochemistry (IHC), sections (circa 3 &#x003bc;m thick) of tissue samples were cut onto SuperFrost Plus slides (Menzel-Glaser, Braunschweig, Germany), deparaffinized in xylene, rehydrated through graded alcohols, and air-dried. Endogenous peroxidase was blocked by treating sections with 3% hydrogen peroxide solution for 20 min followed by two washes in Tris-buffered saline (TBS), pH 7.5&#x02013;7.6. All slides were then subjected to Ultra V block (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA) for 5 min. Then, the primary antibody, Law1-DK (BIO 323 Bio-X Diagnostics), diluted at 1:1000, and antibody number 2, IgG1 (DAKO X0931), diluted at 1:219 in TBS, were added, followed by two TBS washes. Then, Ultravision ONE HRP polymer (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA) was applied for 30 min, followed by two washes with TBS. All sections were incubated in 3,3&#x02032;-diaminobenzidine (DAB) substrate solution (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MI, USA) for 10 min and then rinsed twice with distilled water. Slides were then stained with hematoxylin and mounted with glycerol-gelatine. Sections were evaluated for inflammation according to the following criteria: (0) no significant lesions; (1) up to 25% hyperplastic enterocytes, focal or multifocally, with a reduction in the number of goblet cells; (2) 25 to 50% hyperplastic enterocytes, multifocally, with reduced goblet cell numbers; (3) 50 to 75% hyperplastic enterocytes, multifocally, with decreased goblet cell numbers; and (4) more than 75% hyperplastic enterocytes, multifocally or diffusely, with reduced goblet cell numbers.

Regarding the post-challenge body condition, one piglet from the LI control group and one from the OMP2c group showed a body condition score of 1, indicating mild dehydration. Despite these cases, no signs of severe dehydration were detected in any of the animals.

As regulations on the usage of antimicrobials in the swine industry are becoming more controlled, the demand for effective prophylactic options is increasing. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of two potential vaccine candidates, OMP2c.cVLP and MBP.INVASc, against <italic toggle="yes">LI</italic> infection in both murine and porcine models.</p><p>Our findings provide valuable insights into the potential use of the subunit vaccines, OMP2c.cVLP and MBP.INVASc, to mitigate inflammatory responses and bacterial load. In our in vivo studies, both subunit vaccines demonstrated immunogenicity. Presenting the OMP2 antigen on the cVLP surface is expected to increase its immunogenicity due to better recognition and processing by the immune system. Displaying poorly immunogenic vaccine antigens on the surface of cVLP is a well-validated method to increase antigen immunogenicity, resulting in enhanced antibody responses [<xref rid="B11-vaccines-13-00207" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Similarly, a recent study using cVLP targeting F4 enterotoxigenic <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> demonstrated that cVLP might potentially improve the humoral response against low-immunogenic antigens in piglets, particularly if these are not targeted by pre-existing maternal immunity [<xref rid="B11-vaccines-13-00207" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>MBP.INVASc did not show effective or stable binding cVLP particles, leading us to use the unconjugated MBP.INVASc protein in subsequent immunization studies. Despite this challenge, we were able to generate a stable and soluble protein fraction when fused to MBP. The MBP-fusion was chosen because it can enhance the solubility and proper folding of target proteins, and it is one of the most used tags for recombinant proteins in bacterial cells [<xref rid="B10-vaccines-13-00207" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B22-vaccines-13-00207" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>Both OMP2c.cVLP and MBP.INVASc induced robust systemic antibody responses in mice and pigs. However, the relevance of antibody-mediated protection against LI and the protection associated with natural LI is not fully established [<xref rid="B22-vaccines-13-00207" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. These findings may suggest that the natural infection and current whole pathogen vaccines fail to generate antibody responses of sufficient magnitude towards specific surface antigens, rather than indicating a general inadequacy of humoral responses in preventing LI-induced enteric disease. Therefore, further investigation into the immunological correlations of protection and the relative importance and contribution of systemic and mucosal responses in controlling the pathogen will be highly beneficial. In this study, pigs were vaccinated i.m. Therefore, while strong humoral levels were detected in the serum, this approach likely did not generate gut-specific mucosal responses, which may be an additional factor that can be optimized in further studies.</p><p>In clinical trials, mild-to-moderate clinical signs of LI infection, such as soft feces or watery diarrhea, were observed across all groups (<xref rid="vaccines-13-00207-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>D). This suggests that despite the vaccines induced an immune response, they did not fully prevent the clinical manifestations of the infection. However, the signs observed were mild, and the animals remained active. Additionally, the fact that the animals remained active despite exhibiting mild symptoms implies that the vaccines may help maintain general health and activity levels, even in the presence of infection. Those observations might be explained by inherent variability in the host response; therefore, a larger sample size in further experiments would improve the robustness of our findings. Furthermore, we observed a similar average daily gain among the groups (<xref rid="vaccines-13-00207-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>A), which was slightly lower than the Danish reference daily average gain of 463 g [<xref rid="B23-vaccines-13-00207" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. A reduction in weight gain occurs when young piglets are primarily exposed to LI [<xref rid="B5-vaccines-13-00207" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], with clinically affected animals reducing daily gains proportional to the level of bacterial shedding [<xref rid="B21-vaccines-13-00207" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Infected enterocytes accumulate LI at the apical end, causing heavily infected cells to swell and form protrusions, and as the disease progresses, LI can also be observed in macrophages located in the lamina propria [<xref rid="B4-vaccines-13-00207" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. This leads to a marked hyperplastic proliferation of immature crypt-epithelial cells. In this study, the protection provided, particularly that provided by MBP.INVASc, was evident from the reduction in lesion severity, as well as the low detection of LI (low IHC scores). Although our study did not determine whether the vaccines could prevent bacterial shedding, a significant reduction in pathology scores was observed among the vaccinated animals (<xref rid="vaccines-13-00207-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). Both subunit vaccines (MBP.INVASc nor OMP2c.cVLP) demonstrated a specific effect in minimizing inflammation (<xref rid="vaccines-13-00207-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>E,F), suggesting that these vaccines offer protection against inflammation. These findings suggest that although our subunit vaccines do not completely prevent bacterial shedding, they do confer a degree of protection by reducing the pathological impact of the infection. This aligns with observations from another study on inactivated or killed vaccines, which were also not effective in preventing bacterial shedding following exposure to a field strain but were demonstrated to reduce inflammation degree [<xref rid="B24-vaccines-13-00207" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>In natural infections, both humoral and cell-mediated responses occur, potentially providing a better mucosal response against colonization. Other studies have found similar limitations, likely due to the stimulation of mainly humoral response [<xref rid="B25-vaccines-13-00207" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-vaccines-13-00207" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Perhaps further investigation of alternative routes, such as intranasal and oral dosing, could help overcome some limitations and mimic a natural infection. Unfortunately, similar studies using VLP vaccines have not succeeded with intranasal dosing in pigs [<xref rid="B11-vaccines-13-00207" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Therefore, further development of vaccine alternative delivery methods is still required and strongly suggested.</p><p>Interestingly, our observations show slightly higher levels of haptoglobin among MBP.INVASc-vaccinated piglets, even though it is not significantly different (<xref rid="vaccines-13-00207-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>C). Haptoglobin is an acute-phase protein that binds to free hemoglobin, thereby preventing oxidative damage [<xref rid="B20-vaccines-13-00207" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The kinetics of its induction following bacterial infection are related to an acute-phase response, which is an indicator of early defense mechanisms unspecified against trauma, inflammation, or infection [<xref rid="B19-vaccines-13-00207" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec5-vaccines-13-00207"><title>5.
