However, there are still cases of ineffective treatment. B-cell lymphoma 6 (Bcl6), a transcriptional suppressor, is known to have regulatory effects on multiple immune-associated cell subsets. FX1, a novel specific BCL6 Bric-&#x000e0;-brac (BTB) inhibitor, has shown positive effects in many disease models, but its effects and mechanisms in IBD control remain unclear.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We observed colon length and DAI score of colitis mice after treatment. HE staining section was used to evaluate colonic injury, while the expression of colonic pro-inflammatory cytokines by RT-qPCR. And differences in immune cell subsets between the two groups was analyzed by flow cytometry. Additionally, IHC and RT-qPCR were employed to evaluate the expression of colonic tight junction proteins. Furthermore, RAW264.7 cells and co-cultured Caco2 cells were detected by ELISA and RT-qPCR.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In the treat group, colitis symptoms in mice were significantly improved, and there was a decrease in proportion of macrophages and protection of intestinal mucosal integrity-indicating anti-inflammatory effects of FX1. In cell experiments, we found that FX1 decreased secretion of pro-inflammatory factors by macrophages and increased expression of tight junction proteins in Caco2 cells after co-culture.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The experimental findings demonstrate the inhibitory effect of FX1 on inflammation in murine colitis model as well as its potential mechanism. BCL6 is a potential target for treating IBD.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>BCL6</kwd><kwd>IBD</kwd><kwd>pro-inflammatory cytokines</kwd><kwd>macrophage</kwd><kwd>tight junction proteins (TJPs)</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>The author(s) declare that financial support was received for the research and/or publication of this article.

This increase in prevalence is not only related to morbidity but also reflects the overall growth of IBD cases (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Since 1990, the highest reported prevalence values have been observed in Europe and North America. Although still lower in East Asian compared with Western countries, incidence has been on the rise in newly industrialized countries in Africa, Asia, and South America, including Brazil. This suggests that changing environmental factors play an important part (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). IBD not only has a physical impact on patients&#x02019; lives, but also leads to higher levels of anxiety, depression, and sleep disturbances, further reducing their quality of life. Therefore, it is crucial to explore new mechanistic targets in IBD in order to facilitate the development of clinically effective drugs (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>).</p><p>Bcl6 (B-cell lymphoma 6) is a transcriptional repressor that plays a critical role in regulating germinal centers (GC) and T cell differentiation, as well as the production and maturation of germinal center B cells (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Bcl6 encodes a BTB domain at its amino terminus, which is essential for the transcriptional inhibition of several proteins, including SMRT and NCOR (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Bcl6 not only prevents premature activation and differentiation of GC B cells (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), but also plays a key role in the development and differentiation of T cells, especially Tfh cells (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Bcl6 is a key transcription factor that regulates germinal center B cell differentiation and germinal center response, and is important for the development of memory type CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and follicle-killing CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). In addition, Upregulation of Bcl6 is associated with the expression of the chemokine receptor CXCR5, which allows Tfh cells to migrate to the T-B boundary and GCs region, where they interact with B cells of the specific antigen (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). It follows that Bcl6 plays a role in regulating Tfh development and is critical for Tfh cell differentiation and function (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).</p><p>Existing studies have demonstrated that Tfh cells can be regulated through the modulation of the Bcl-6/Blimp-1 signaling pathway, thereby influencing the incidence of IBD (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Furthermore, Wei et&#x000a0;al. discovered that activation of the Bcl6/Syk/BLNK signaling pathway in mice with DSS-induced colitis can regulate the balance of memory B cell subsets, prevent excessive accumulation of inflammatory cells, and mitigate immune damage (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). As an important factor in inflammatory and autoimmune diseases (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), Bcl6 may provide a new idea for the treatment of IBD. Compared with gene editing, the intervention method of small molecule inhibitors is easier to achieve clinical conversion application (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). The Bcl6 inhibitor, FX1, exhibits a 10-fold greater potency than endogenous corepressors and is the most efficient among Bcl6 small molecule inhibitors. FX1 disrupts Bcl6 recruitment of corepressors to its endogenous target genes and induces derepression of Bcl6 target genes and transcriptional program. Hence, FX1 can broadly disrupt the BCL6 transcriptional program in cells (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Previous studies have shown that in mice with sepsis, FX1 can reduce the condition by inhibiting Bcl6 in macrophages (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). However, the role of BCL6 in macrophages within the context of IBD remains unclear.</p><p>Based on the previous research, Bcl6 has been mentioned as a potential therapeutic target for patients with IBD (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). However, the therapeutic role of FX1 in mice with colitis remains unclear. The objective of this study was to investigate the therapeutic effects of FX1 on colitis both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>, as well as to elucidate its possible mechanisms. Our findings indicate that FX1 exhibits anti-inflammatory effects in DSS-induced colitis mice and LPS-induced cell inflammation experiments.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2_1"><label>2.1</label><title>Ethics statement</title><p>For all experiments, we used 8&#x02013;10-week-old wild-type (WT) C57BL/6 male mice. The WT mice were obtained from Liaoning Changsheng Biotechnology Co., LTD (Benxi, China) and were housed at the Medical science research institute of Henan province. The housing conditions included a temperature of 22&#x02013;23&#x000b0;C and a 12-hour light/dark cycle, with ad libitum access to food and water. The experiments were approved by the Ethics Committee of the Medical science research institute of Henan province(Ethical code: 2024-yyy-030).</p></sec><sec id="s2_2"><label>2.2</label><title>Dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis models</title><p>Sixteen C57BL/6J mice were fed for 1 week in the Experimental Animal Center of Zhengzhou University and randomly divided into two groups as colitis mouse model treatment group and control group. A mouse model of acute colitis was established by free drinking of 2.5% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) solution (MP Biomedicals, USA) for 6 days. Mice in the treatment group received a daily intraperitoneal injection of 25mg/kg FX1 solution(Selleck, S8591), while the control group was injected with a DMSO carrier. Clinical progression of colonic inflammation in mice was assessed using a disease activity index (DAI) score based on body weight, stool, and occult blood (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) (<xref rid="ST1" ref-type="supplementary-material">
<bold>Supplementary Table S1</bold>
</xref>). The DAI is calculated as follows: DAI = (weight loss score + stool character score + hematochezia score)/3 (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), and the DAI score ranges from 0 to 4, with higher scores indicating more severe disease activity. After modeling and treatment, the psychophysiological state of the mice was monitored daily through assessing signs of lethargy, fatigue, inactivity, crouching behavior, and reduced activity levels. Additionally, food intake, weight fluctuations, and stool characteristics were systematically recorded, and fecal occult blood was tested from day 3. On the seventh day, anesthetize mice via intraperitoneal injection of room temperature 20 mg/ml Avertin (0.45 mg/g body weight). Avertin administration timing is set at 5 minutes per mouse. The mice were subsequently assessed for toe reflexes to confirm that they were fully anesthetized. The mice were euthanized by cervical dislocation. Colons, spleens, mesenteric lymph nodes, and peripheral blood samples were collected. Changes in colon length were measured.</p></sec><sec id="s2_3"><label>2.3</label><title>HE</title><p>After the colon was rinsed with PBS at 4&#x000b0;C, it was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and then embedded in paraffin for sectioning and histological evaluation (<xref rid="ST1" ref-type="supplementary-material">

Following this, the sections underwent staining using the hematoxylin-eosin routine (Servicebio, Wuhan, China) and were observed under a microscope with tissue panoramic scanner (GCell, Guangzhou, China) for image capture (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2_4"><label>2.4</label><title>IHC</title><p>The paraffin-embedded slices underwent incubation at 100&#x000b0;C for 30 min.

Antigen repair of the slices was performed using citrate buffer and EDTA. The tissue was incubated with a 3% hydrogen peroxide solution for 25 minutes to block endogenous peroxidase. It was then uniformly covered with 3% BSA and left at room temperature for 30 minutes. After incubation with the primary antibody at 4&#x000b0;C overnight (ZO1: abcam, AB221547,1:500/Occludin: abcam, AB216327,1:200), the secondary antibody was incubated at room temperature for 50 minutes. DAB color development was performed, and hematoxylin was re-dyed for 3 minutes.</p><p>The staining results were semi-quantitatively evaluated based on staining intensity and the percentage of positive staining cells. Staining intensity was assessed using a four-point scale: 0 for negative, 1 for weak, 2 for moderate, and 3 for strong. The percentage of positive cells was categorized into four grades: 0 indicating &#x0003c;5%, 1 representing 6%-25%, 2 representing 26% to 50%, 3 representing 51% to75%, and 4 representing &#x0003e;75%.

Throughout the course of the disease, treatment with FX1 significantly alleviated intestinal inflammation, reduced the proportions of macrophages and CD4+ T cells within the intestinal environment, and preserved the integrity of the intestinal epithelial mucosa. Further investigations revealed that FX1 decreased pro-inflammatory factor secretion by macrophages while enhancing tight junction protein expression levels. Our findings demonstrate the efficacy of BCL6 inhibitor FX1 in treating colitis in mice. In recent years, it has been reported that the down-regulation of Bcl6 can promote colonic epithelial cells apoptosis and M1 macrophage polarization while exacerbating the progression of ulcerative colitis (UC) (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Additionally, silencing Bcl6 may lead to unexpected outcomes such as atherosclerosis and xanthomatous tendinitis (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). However, our animal studies have indicated that Bcl6 possesses potential therapeutic effects on colitis. Notably, the injection of FX1, a specific inhibitor of Bcl6, did not worsen DSS-induced intestinal inflammation in mice. Furthermore, targeted inhibition of Bcl6 significantly alleviated colitis symptoms in these animals, as assessed by Disease Activity Index (DAI) scores and observed changes in the colon.</p><p>Bcl6 functions as a transcriptional suppressor, influencing both macrophages and T cell subsets (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). This study utilized <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments to demonstrate that the application of Bcl6 inhibitors could mitigate colon inflammation induced by DSS in mice. Notably, the expression levels of intestinal inflammatory factors significantly decreased following treatment. Further investigations revealed an overall reduction in macrophage populations within the gut and other immune tissues. <italic>In vitro</italic> assays indicated that Bcl6 inhibitors possess the capacity to diminish cytokine production from macrophages and inhibit pro-inflammatory effects. In macrophages, Bcl6 is recognized as a critical regulator of IL-1&#x003b2; and IL18. It promotes Th2 cell differentiation in allergic diseases while inhibiting chemokine Ccl2 expression and NF-&#x003ba;B activity, thereby mediating negative regulation of the innate immune response (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Additionally, Bcl6 directly inhibits the targeting of chemokines and pro-inflammatory cytokines by specifically binding to target gene promoters within macrophages (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). These findings suggest that Bcl6 plays a role in suppressing acute inflammatory responses (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). However, it has been observed that Bcl6 <sup>-/-</sup> mice exhibit a high incidence of severe TH2 inflammatory disease (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>), whereas Bcl6<sup>BTBMUT</sup> mice do not present with inflammation (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Consequently, some researchers propose that the inhibitory effect of Bcl6 on macrophage inflammation is independent of BTB domain regulatory factors; thus, employing FX1 will not exacerbate the inflammatory response (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Nevertheless, this perspective does not fully elucidate the anti-inflammatory properties associated with Bcl6 inhibitors.</p><p>In another mouse sepsis study, FX1 was shown to inhibit the phosphorylation of JNK, p38, and ERK in LPS-activated RAW 264.7 cells. Additionally, it inhibited the NF-&#x003ba;B signaling pathway to suppress LPS-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines. CHIP experiments demonstrated that following FX1 treatment, there was enhanced binding of Bcl6 to the promoters of IL6, CXCR4, and MCP-1 (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). This indicates that FX1 may block interactions between Bcl6 and its co-inhibitors, thereby enhancing Bcl6&#x02019;s binding to target gene promoters and leading to the inhibition of chemokines and pro-inflammatory cytokines.</p><p>Interestingly, while the Bcl6 inhibitor FX1 inhibits various cytokines, it does not affect TNF&#x003b1; (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Our results demonstrated that the BCL6 inhibitor FX1 significantly inhibited inflammatory factors such as IL6 and IL-1&#x003b2; in a DSS-induced colitis model, while showing no significant effect on TNF&#x003b1;. The potential mechanism underlying this selective regulatory phenomenon may be attributed to the specificity of BCL6 target genes and the compensatory activation of its signaling pathways. Previous studies have indicated that Bcl6 functions as a transcriptional suppressor by&#x000a0;binding to the promoter regions of STAT3-dependent inflammatory factors (such as IL6 and IL23) and recruiting HDAC complexes to inhibit their transcription (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). In contrast, the transcriptional regulation of TNF&#x003b1; is primarily governed by the NF-&#x003ba;B pathway (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). In the DSS colitis model, TLR4/MyD88 signaling consistently activates the IKK-NF-&#x003ba;B axis, thereby driving TNF&#x003b1; expression (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>), potentially bypassing any inhibitory effects exerted by Bcl6. This hierarchical regulatory network suggests that FX1 inhibits certain inflammatory factors through targeting the STAT3-BCL6 axis. However, the escape of TNF&#x003b1; may reflect the complexity inherent in multi-pathway interactions within an inflammatory microenvironment. This suggests that FX1 targets other inflammatory pathways and may be particularly beneficial in cases where anti-TNF&#x003b1; therapy is ineffective.</p><p>Our experimental results demonstrated that Bcl6 inhibitors significantly reduced the damage to intestinal epithelial cells and the secretion of inflammatory factors in colitis mice. Previous studies have indicated that macrophages played a crucial role in maintaining intestinal immune homeostasis and lamina propria monocytes and M1 macrophages infiltrating intestinal tissue directly compromise the epithelial barrier by dysregulating tight junction proteins and inducing apoptosis in epithelial cells, thereby exacerbating intestinal inflammation associated with IBD (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). We observed similar findings through IHC and flow cytometry analyses conducted on mouse colorectal tissues. Additionally, we noted a decrease in the M1/M2 phenotype across all tissues within the Bcl6 inhibitor group. The imbalance of this phenotype has been linked to worsening colitis in IBD mouse models (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Bcl6 inhibitors also modulate the detrimental effects of macrophages on intestinal epithelial cells. Marianne et&#x000a0;al. reported that non-polarized macrophages and selectively activated M2 macrophages enhance the integrity of the intestinal epithelial barrier, whereas monocytes and pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages increase barrier permeability (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). Our cellular experiments further corroborated these findings: after inhibiting inflammatory factor secretion from macrophages, we observed an increase in tight junction protein expression within Caco2 cells. We noticed that Occludin has significant difference on protein levels, while there were no statistical differences mRNA level. The RT-qPCR data exhibited substantial intra-group variability (as reflected in error bar magnitude) combined with limited sample size (n=5). These constraints likely reduced statistical power below the threshold required to detect significant differences. In addition, It has also been documented that post-transcriptional regulation or altered protein stability could amplify protein-level changes without proportional mRNA shifts (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). Similar results were found for measurements of IL-1&#x003b2;. Maturation and secretion of IL-1&#x003b2; in mononuclear cells and macrophages require multi-step activation. LPS alone may only induce the expression of inactive IL-1&#x003b2; (pro-IL-1&#x003b2;), but the maturation and secretion of IL-1&#x003b2; are controlled by inflammasome (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). Several studies have shown that the secretion of IL-1&#x003b2; requires inflammasome activation (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>), while TNF&#x003b1; and IL6 are directly induced by the MyD88/TRIF pathway after TLR4 activation (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Therefore, we consider that the inconsistencies of IL-1&#x003b2; in mRNA and protein levels are mainly attributed to its unique post-translational processing mechanism, and LPS alone is insufficient to activate the inflammasome, resulting in the inability of pro-IL-1&#x003b2; to mature secretion (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). In addition, limitations of detection methods, such as some ELISA kits only detect mature IL-1&#x003b2; (17 kDa), while cells may accumulate uncut pro-IL-1&#x003b2; (31 kDa) or secrete insufficient amounts, resulting in false negatives. IL-1&#x003b2; secretion may be lower than ELISA detection limit.</p><p>In addition, our study also analyzed T cell subsets, and we observed that the proportion of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in the spleen and colorectal of mice in the treatment group was reduced, but there was no significant difference in the intestinal Treg subsets (<xref rid="SF2" ref-type="supplementary-material">
<bold>Supplementary Figure S2</bold>
</xref>). Similar animal efficacy experiments showed that the BCL6 inhibitor extended the survival of chronically rejected heart grafts and also reduced the proportion and number of spleen CD4+T cells, effector CD4+T cells, proliferating CD4+T cells, and Tfh cells in chronically rejected mice (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). It was previously reported that down-regulating BCL6 expression in DSS-induced mice can affect Tfh and Tfr cell contents as well as the ratio of Tfh/Tfr cells, leading to an improvement in intestinal inflammatory response (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). Additionally, recent studies have shown that ICOS can increase BCL6 expression through molecular chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA), resulting in excessive Tfh cell response and GC response (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). This suggests that Bcl6 can influence CD4+T cell differentiation and promote inflammation. However, the Bcl6 inhibitor can reduce both proportion and number of CD4+T cells during inflammation processes; thus it may play a role in alleviating intestinal inflammation.</p><p>In summary, this study demonstrated both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> that the BCL6 inhibitor can alleviate acute colitis induced by DSS in mice. Treatment with the BCL6 inhibitor significantly reduces the migration of macrophages to the colon and rectum, as well as diminishes the secretion of inflammatory factors from these macrophages. These findings underscore the potential of BCL6 as a therapeutic target for IBD and highlight the promising role of BCL6 inhibitors in its treatment. Furthermore, no individual or cytotoxic effects associated with FX1 were observed in this study, alleviating concerns regarding the risks linked to its application.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The author sincerely appreciates all the practitioners who have provided assistance and made contributions to this research.</p></ack><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s5"><title>Data availability statement</title><p>The original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/<xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material">
