Although colonic pathology is widely investigated, little attention has been paid to the disorders in small intestine of UC. In this study, we investigated the impairments of UC to small intestine and further explored how iron metabolism regulated epithelial integrity and the activity of intestinal stem cells (ISCs).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Mice were treated by 2.5% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) for 7 days to established acute experimental colitis. Small intestinal tissues were collected at different time points in the process of DSS-induced colitis. Histological analysis was used to evaluate the changes of small intestine, including H&#x00026;E, Alcian blue and PAS staining, immunostaining, and qRT-PCR. Iron content was modulated by the supplementation of ferric citrate or depletion by deferoxamine (DFO). The influence of iron on the barrier integrity and stem cell function was further determined by histology, IEC-6 cell, and enteroid culture. ROS content was demonstrated by DHE staining. The proliferation of intestinal stem cells (ISCs) was shown by BrdU and Olfm4 staining, and Lgr5-tdTomato mice were used for lineage tracing study.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>It was shown that during DSS-induced colitis, small intestine underwent a serious injury process, including dysregulated integrity and decreased proliferation of ISCs. Iron overload significantly exacerbated intestinal injury in tissues, epithelial cell line, and intestinal organoids. However, iron chelation by deferoxamine (DFO) would greatly suppress small intestinal injury. Mechanistically, iron overload exacerbated the generation of ROS and enhanced the infiltration of immune cells. In addition, STAT3 and ERK pathways in intestinal epithelium were impaired during experimental colitis, and iron content significantly interrupted the expression of p-STAT3 and p-ERK1/2 within small intestine.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, this study proved that small intestine was also impaired in experimental colitis, and iron content could affect DSS-induced small intestinal damage and regeneration, indicating the strategy of iron supplementation in clinical practice needs to be more cautious and consider more factors.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>acute experimental colitis</kwd><kwd>iron</kwd><kwd>DFO</kwd><kwd>intestinal stem cell</kwd><kwd>organoid</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>The author(s) declare that financial support was received for the research and/or publication of this article.

IBD has a variety of extraintestinal manifestations, with the most common complication being anemia (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). IBD anemia is detected in up to 70% of inpatients and 20% of outpatients (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>) and is thought to affect one-third of the IBD population (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). IBD-related anemia can be caused by multiple factors, but it is usually caused by iron deficiency anemia (IDA). Anemia in these patients is also caused by functional or absolute iron deficiency due to inadequate dietary intake of iron, decreased absorption, and blood loss (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>).</p><p>IBD attracts more attention in both clinical practice and laboratory research due to several reasons. For example, IBD has profound negative influences on the life quality of patients and causes great increase of health costs, and more importantly, it is related to increasing risks of potential colorectal cancer (CRC) (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Among IBD, CD is considered with genetic background. Therefore, UC is more widely investigated in laboratory study (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced experimental colitis is one of the most commonly utilized animal models to mimic ulcerative colitis (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). DSS belongs to a sulfated polysaccharide, and it was first described for use in hamsters in 1985 (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>) and subsequently reported for use in mice in 1990 (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). DSS-induced experimental colitis has great simplicity and high reproducibility, which is the important reason that why it attracts many interests of IBD researchers to explore the pathogenesis and countermeasures of human IBD (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). When animals are provided with access to drinking water supplemented with different doses of DSS, acute chemical induced toxicity and inflammation first appears in colonic epithelium, especially within the middle and distal colon, which might explain why azoxymethane (AOM)-DSS-induced colorectal cancer appears in the distal colons (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). The clinical symptoms of DSS-induced colitis contain weight loss, diarrhea, and rectal bleeding, which is consistent with human UC. These symptoms usually are quantified as disease activity index (DAI) to reflect the severity of colitis (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>).</p><p>Although experimental colitis mainly impairs the colonic epithelium, it has been reported that DSS also induces pan-gastroenteritis and in rat and mice, including colon, gastric mucosal, and small intestine (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), and even cardiac disorder (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Small intestine (SI) is one of the most important organs responsible for nutrient absorption and mucosal immunity, and it has been indicated that DSS-induced colitis would also cause morphological and biochemical changes extending to SI. Using DPIV knockout mice, Yazbeck et al. had shown that DSS-induced damage was not constrained to the colon but also extended to small intestine (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), and loss of DPIV activity resulted in functional adaptations to brush border enzyme activity. DPIV inhibitors are now a recognized therapy for type-II diabetes. Some researchers have characterized the effects of Lactobacillus fermentum BR11 on DSS-induced small intestinal damage, and they found increased ileal crypt depth and cell proliferation (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Paneth cells constitute the niche of ISCs, and DSS would induce decrease of the quantity of Olfm4<sup>+</sup> and Lgr5<sup>+</sup> ISCs. Meanwhile, Lyz1<sup>+</sup> Paneth cells would dedifferentiate into ISC-like cells and give rise to ISCs and other epithelial lineages to promote the regeneration of SI epithelium (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Inflammatory process in the small intestine after DSS treatment is also associated with dysmotility and altered barrier permeability, and it is revealed that ileitis affects enteric dopaminergic neurotransmission, and dopaminergic pathways participate in IBD-mediated neuromuscular dysfunction (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>).</p><p>Many nutrients affect the physiological function of small intestinal epithelium and the regeneration after DSS-induced injury. DSS declined the percentage of small intestinal intraepithelial lymphocyte (IEL) &#x003b3;&#x003b4;-T cells and higher mRNA expressions of IFN-r, TNF-a, IL-17, and complement 5a receptor in &#x003b3;&#x003b4;-T cells. Glutamine (Gln) increased the proportion of small intestinal IEL &#x003b3;&#x003b4;-T cells and downregulated the expression of inflammatory mediators in them, which might alleviate the severity of small intestinal epithelial injury (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Sunset yellow (SY), an azo dye, is commonly used in the food industry. In DSS-treated mice, DAI and expression levels of IL-1b and TNF-a were enhanced in the SY group, concluding that SY exacerbated DSS-induced intestinal inflammation. SY could disturb the homeostasis of the small intestinal epithelium by generating high levels of ER stress and oxidative stress, with long-term continuous consumption of SY potentially increasing the risk of intestinal inflammation (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Therefore, inappropriate uptake of nutrients might impair the progression of DSS-induced small intestinal injury.</p><p>Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is often present in patients with IBD, and the main source of excess iron loss is intestinal bleeding (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Treatment of all patients with IDA with or without symptoms is recommended by correcting the underlying cause and supplementing adequate iron stores (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). However, there is a lack of research on whether additional iron supplementation improves IDA and causes additional damage to the small intestine. Among different nutrients, iron is mainly absorbed by small intestine. Iron is indispensable to the energy production, DNA synthesis, and cell proliferation. Sufficiency of iron is critical to maintain tissue homeostasis, but overload of iron might increase the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which exhibits cellular toxicity. Therefore, it is important to maintain the balance of iron metabolism for both physiological health and the prognosis of many diseases. For example, iron status and inflammation are strongly linked during the process of aging (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Iron is also tightly linked to infection and immunity (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Both invading pathogens and host cells require appropriate iron to exert their individual biological functions (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). During the inflammation status, appropriate ferritin levels represent an important host defense mechanism that deprives bacterial growth of iron and protects tissue homeostasis. Both anemia and hyperferritinemia are harmful to human health (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Oxidative stress in acute lung inflammation also results iron accumulation in macrophages (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Iron deposition was involved in the occurrence of pulmonary fibrosis in bleomycin (BLM)-treated mice and &#x003b2;-thalassemia-induced lung injury, and chelation of iron by deferoxamine (DFO) significantly reduced the degree of these lung injuries (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>).</p><p>In the previous study, we found iron depletion would greatly affect the onset and healing of DSS-induced colitis. Meanwhile, we observed that small intestine was also impaired by DSS-induced inflammation. In the present study, we aimed to determine the dynamic histological changes of small intestine in DSS-induced experimental colitis and explore how iron metabolism would modulate epithelial integrity, ISCs, and inflammation responses within small intestine. Our results implicated that the balance of iron might be an important intervening target during the prevention and treatment of human IBD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials and methods" id="s2"><title>2 Materials and methods</title><sec><title>2.1 Mice</title><p>In this study, 6- to 8-week-old male C57BL/6 mice were ordered from HFK Bioscience Co., LTD (Beijing, China). B6.129P2-Lgr5<sup>tm1(cre/ERT2)Cle</sup>/J (Lgr5-EGFP-IRES-CreERT2) and B6;129S6-Gt(ROSA)26Sor<sup>tm14(CAG &#x02212; tdTomato)Hze</sup>/J (tdTomato) mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA), and they were crossed to generate Lgr5-tdTomato offspring. The genotype of their pups was determined using the protocols provided by Jackson Laboratory. Mice used in this study were kept in a specific pathogen-free (SPF) facility under a 12-h light/dark cycle with access to water and food <italic>ad libitum</italic>. Experimental treatments were in accordance with guidelines for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, and the protocols were approved by the Ethics Committee of Sichuan Cancer Hospital &#x00026; Institute (SCCHEC-04-2024-038).</p></sec><sec><title>2.2 Establishment of DSS-induced colitis and drug treatment</title><p>Mouse experimental colitis was induced as previously elsewhere. In brief, C57BL/6 mice or Lgr5-tdTomato mice were randomly divided into different groups and treated with free access to drinking water supplemented with 2.5% colitis grade dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) (#216011080, MW: 36,000&#x02013;50,000, MP Biomedicals) for 7 consecutive days. Mice were simultaneously treated with ferric citrate (#44941, Sigma) by daily intraperitoneal (i.p) injection at the dose of 15 mg/kg (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Some mice received deferoxamine mesylate (DFO) (HY-B0988, MCE) also by daily i.p injection at 50 mg/kg (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). The number of mice in each study was described in the relevant figure legend, and 4&#x02013;6 mice were included for each time point of different treatments. Both iron and DFO were given from Day 1 to Day 7. The influences of drug treatment on blood iron level were determined by red blood cell (RBC) and hemoglobin levels using a Systemax blood analyzer.</p></sec><sec><title>2.3 Disease activity index (DAI) and FITC-dextran permeability</title><p>The severity of mouse colitis was evaluated by disease activity index (DAI), which was determined by grading of weight loss, stool consistency, and rectal bleeding. For details, weight loss was scored from 0 to 4, which was classified as none, 1&#x02013;5%, 5&#x02013;10%, 10&#x02013;15%, and 15&#x02013;20% weight loss. Stool consistency was also scored from 0 to 4, indicating normal stool, semi-normal stool, loose stool, loose stool adhered to anus, and liquid stools adhered to the anus. Rectal bleeding was determined as follows: 0 = normal; 1 = seminormal; 2 = positive hemoccult; 3 = blood traces in stool visible; and 4 = gross rectal bleeding. These three parameters lead to a maximum of 12 scores for DAI. The impact of iron modulation on intestinal permeability was evaluated by FITC-dextran experiments as previously described (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>) with appropriate modification. In brief, at the end of DSS-induced colitis, mice were starved for 14 h and gavaged with 50 mg/kg FITC-dextran (FD4, 3,000&#x02013;5,000, Sigma-Aldrich, USA) in a volume of 0.2 mL. Blood was collected after 4 h to prepare serum samples. The fluorescent intensity of FD4 in serum was measured by Cytation 5 (Bio-Tek, USA).</p></sec><sec><title>2.4 Sampling and histological staining</title><p>Gastrointestinal tract was collected at the indicated time as described, respectively. Mice were given i.p injection of 100 mg/kg BrdU at 90 min before tissue collection. Tissues were quickly removed and placed on ice. Gross images of intestines were captured. Different segments of small intestines, including duodenum, jejunum, ileum, were flushed with ice-cold PBS and fixed with 4% precooled paraformaldehyde (PFA) (#BL539A, Biosharp) for more than 48 h. Tissues were further trimmed, dehydrated, and paraffin-embedded using our standard protocols. Then, 4 &#x003bc;m thick sections were dewaxed and rehydrated for subsequent hematoxylin&#x02013;eosin (H&#x00026;E) staining regularly.</p></sec><sec><title>2.5 Alcian blue and PAS staining</title><p>Intestinal goblet cells were stained by Alcian blue and periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining. Tissue slides were processed regularly before staining. Alcian blue was stained for acid mucus polysaccharides with Alcian blue kit (Catalog: #E670107, BBI). PAS staining was used to stain neutral mucus substances by PAS Staining Kit (Catalog: G1281, Solarbio). Each step of the staining procedures was performed under the instruction protocols provided by the manufacturers. Nuclei were stained with fast red or hematoxylin solution.</p></sec><sec><title>2.6 Immunostaining</title><p>Small intestinal sections were routinely processed before staining. Antigen retrieval was performed for 20 min in boiling TRIS-EDTA Antigen Retrieval Solution (#BL618A, Biosharp) after tissue rehydration, and blocking was conducted with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) (#A7906, Sigma) solution, containing 0.5% Triton X-100. Primary antibodies were diluted at 1:200 and then incubated overnight at 4&#x000b0;C. The details of primary antibodies used in this study are shown in <xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S1</xref>. On the next day, primary antibodies were washed, and HRP-linked secondary antibody (ZSBio, Beijing, China) was incubated for 40 min. DAB kit (ZSBio, Beijing, China) was used for immunohistochemical (IHC) visualization. Hematoxylin was used for counterstaining to show nucleus. For immunofluorescent staining, Alexa Fluor&#x02122; 594-conjugated highly cross-adsorbed donkey anti-rabbit or mouse IgG (H+L) antibodies (Thermo Fisher, USA) were used, and nuclei were stained with DAPI (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Slides were observed with Olympus BX53 and Nikon Confocal microscope.</p></sec><sec><title>2.7 Lineage tracing of Lgr5<sup>+</sup> ISCs</title><p>To examine how iron metabolism influenced Lgr5<sup>+</sup> ISCs, Lgr5-tdTomato mice were used in the next study as previously described (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). In brief, mice were treated with DSS in combination of ferric citrate or DFO for 7 continuous days. On day 6, mice were intraperitoneally injected with tamoxifen (2 mg/20 g) to induce the expression of Cre recombinase in Lgr5<sup>+</sup> ISCs. These ISCs and progenies would be labeled by tdTomato. Intestines were collected at day 7. Small intestines were removed, flushed, and fixed for the preparation of frozen sections. Images were captured with Nikon Confocal microscope.</p></sec><sec><title>2.8 Cell culture</title><p>IEC-6 cell line was introduced from ATCC and kept in our laboratory. It was cultured following the standard protocol described by ATCC. In brief, cells were cultured in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin solution. Cell culture was performed in the incubator (Thermo Fisher, USA) with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> at 37&#x000b0;C. Cells were treated with LPS (100 ng/ml) or hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) (1 mM) to induce inflammation and oxidative stress. Ferric citrate (100 mM) and DFO (100 &#x003bc;M) were, respectively, loaded. Cell viability was determined by CCK-8 kit (Dojindo, China). For staining, IEC-6 cells were fixed with 4% PFA for 30 min, washed with cold PBS, and then stained for fluorescence using antibodies against ZO-1 or Occludin. The toxicity of iron and DFO on LPS-treated IEC-6 was determined using the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) Cytotoxicity Assay Kit (Beyotime, Shanghai, China), following the manufacturer's protocol.</p></sec><sec><title>2.9 Culture of organoid</title><p>Small intestinal tissues were quickly isolated from healthy or colitis mice to culture enteroids. In brief, intestines were flushing with ice-cold PBS, cut into 3&#x02013;5 mm pieces, vigorously washed in PBS to remove bacteria, and finally placed into 5 mM EDTA chelation buffer supplemented with 1% FBS.

Mice had access to food and water <italic>ad libitum</italic>. As expected, the body weights of mice were gradually declined with the drinking of DSS and regained after the withdrawal of DSS (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). DAI could directly reflect the severity of colitis, and we observed a representative increasing of DAI score and a declining after withdrawal of DSS (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>), indicating a reliable experimental colitis was established. When we examined the gross appearance of gastrointestinal tract, it was found that the length of colons underwent decrease and recovery (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1D</xref>, <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">E</xref>). Interestingly, their small intestines were also experienced the same changes (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1D</xref>, <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">F</xref>), indicating that experimental colitis also caused apparent injury to small intestine. For example, the length of small intestine at day 7 was 27.61 &#x000b1; 0.63 cm, which was significantly shorter than the control group (34.71 &#x000b1; 1.01 cm). To confirm these results, we observed the histology of small intestine by H&#x00026;E staining, and it was found that the intestinal epithelium was obviously damaged at day 5 and day 7, especially in the distal ileum (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>). Quantitative results showed significant decreasing the length of crypts and villi (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>). Subsequently, we used Alcian blue to stain goblet cells within the epithelium of small intestine, and it was shown that the number of goblet cells was declined after DSS treatment (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1I</xref>, <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">J</xref>).

Importantly, using IHC staining, we found there were less BrdU<sup>+</sup> proliferative cells and Olfm4<sup>+</sup> ISCs within intestinal crypts caused by DSS treatment (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1M</xref>).

In brief, mice were treated by intraperitoneal (i.p) injection of ferric citrate at the dose of 15 mg/kg or DFO at 50 mg/kg during the period of DSS-induced colitis (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). The body weight of DSS-treated mice had an obvious decrease as expected. Meanwhile, the supplementation of iron exaggerated the loss of body weight compared with DSS group, and iron depletion by DFO greatly alleviated the body weight loss (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). The overview of abdominal cavity showed different appearance of gastrointestinal tract. There were more luminal blood contents in small intestine of iron treated mice, which was better alleviated in DFO-treated group (<xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S1A</xref>). We found the lengths of small intestines were also different in each group, iron overload resulted in shorter length, and DFO group had longer small intestines (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2C</xref>, <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">D</xref>). Iron supplementation caused more serious damage to intestinal epithelium during DSS treatment. Similarly, mice in DFO group had better histological characteristics (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2E</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">G</xref>). Mucus-secreting goblet cells were stained by Alcian blue and PAS, and there were less goblet cells in iron-treated DSS mice, but DFO rescued such a decrease (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2H</xref>, <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">I</xref>, <xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S1B</xref>). Immunostaining and qPCR results showed iron supplementation led to more serious downregulation of both Occludin and ZO-1, and DFO reversed these effects (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2J</xref>, <xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S1C</xref>).

Therefore, we treated mice with DSS and iron for 7 consecutive days and then collected intestines for analysis on day 10 (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). It was found that the body weight of iron overload group was recovered more slowly than those DSS-treated mice (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). We compared the gross abdominal appearance and found iron-treated mice had slenderer small intestine and thinner intestinal walls (<xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S2A</xref>). We further isolated the whole gastrointestinal tract, and it was found that the small intestines in iron treated mice were significantly shorter than those of DSS-treated mice (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3C</xref>, <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">D</xref>). H&#x00026;E staining demonstrated iron overload caused a poor recovery of intestinal epithelium, which had shorter crypts and villi (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3E</xref>, <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">F</xref>). In addition, the number of Alcian blue positive goblet cells was also decreased in iron-treated mice (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3G</xref>, <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">H</xref>), and iron overload also led to fewer staining ZO-1 and less mRNA expression of Tjp1 (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3I</xref>, <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">J</xref>). Similarly, there were fewer BrdU and olfm4 positive proliferative cells within iron-treated crypts (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3K</xref>).

However, iron chelation by DFO alleviated the damage (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). Moreover, it was found that iron treatment apparently increased the ROS level stained by DHE in LPS and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2&#x02212;</sub>treated IEC-6, and DFO decreased the ROS content (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). In addition, monolayer IEC-6 could represent the intestinal epithelium. We stained ZO-1 and Occludin to examine how iron modulated their integrity.

When we isolated crypts from freshly dissected small intestine, it was found that the ROS content was increased in DSS-treated mice, and iron and DFO oppositely affected the increasing of ROS (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). After 7-day culture, fewer enteroids with poor quality were observed in DSS-treated crypts as compared to the healthy enteroids, iron-treated enteroids even grew worse, but DFO-treated crypts showed better growth (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>, <xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S3A</xref>). Next, we stained Ki67 to evaluate the proliferation and found an obvious decreasing in DSS-treated enteroids.

In addition, we also treated enteroids grown for 3 days with iron and DFO in combination with LPS or H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. It was discovered that iron caused a dose-dependent decrease of organoid number in control group and LPS- or H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-treated enteroids, but DFO preserved the quantity of enteroids (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5E</xref>, <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">F</xref>). Subsequently, we investigated the ROS level in enteroids by DHE staining.

It has been known that STAT3 and ERK1/2 are two critical pathways of intestinal epithelium due to their modulation on signaling transduction and proliferation activity of ISCs (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). We performed IHC staining against p-STAT3 and p-ERK1/2 to examine how the activity of STAT3 and ERK1/2 pathways changed during intestinal inflammation. Interestingly, it was revealed that DSS treatment caused an increased expression of p-STAT3 within epithelium and iron promoted such an increase at day 7, but iron chelation by DFO restricted the hyperactivation of STAT3 pathway. When DSS was removed at day 10, there was still a high staining of p-STAT3, and DFO group had almost normal level of p-STAT3 (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). ERK signaling was mainly detected in crypts, whose expression was seriously inhibited by DSS-induced inflammation, and high level of iron content exacerbated such inhibition at day 7. Oppositely, DFO treatment partially saved p-ERK1/2 expression and maintained the histology of intestinal epithelium at day 7. After withdrawal of DSS, iron-treated intestine had a retarded recovery of p-ERK1/2 compare with DSS group, but DFO group showed even a higher recovery for the expression of p-ERK1/2 (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). It has been reported that iron accumulation could promote the generation of ROS in immune cells, such as macrophages. Then, we stained the infiltration of inflammatory cells and observed that the supplementation of iron greatly promoted the infiltration of immune cells into small intestine, including CD3<sup>+</sup> T cells and MPO<sup>+</sup> neutrophils. These infiltrated immune cells might enhance local inflammatory response and thus promoted intestinal injury. In addition, CX3CR1<sup>+</sup> macrophages are considered as resident macrophages, and we found these spindle-like macrophages became short, indicating their polarization might be changed due to iron treatment (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>).

Oral iron is the most commonly used iron replacement therapy due to its low cost, availability, and ease of administration (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). In summary, diet, microbes, and iron metabolism present complex interactions in the gut, further revealing the complexity of iron metabolism.</p><p>Several studies have discussed some changes of small intestine during colitis. For example, Yazbeck et al. showed inflammatory damage would extend to small intestine (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). BR11, which was a microbial fermented product, increased epithelial proliferation (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Schmitt et al. reported that DSS-induced colitis even triggered the dedifferentiation of terminally differentiated Paneth cells to reconstitute the damaged epithelium of small intestine (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). However, we believe that it is critical to understand the basic pathologic process of small intestinal injury to propose any useful and specific interventions. Therefore, in this study, we characterized the whole process of small intestinal injury during DSS-induced experimental colitis.</p><p>We utilized drinking of DSS to establish experimental colitis. DSS-induced colitis depends on the molecular weight and concentration of DSS and the period of treatment (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). Here, we treated mice with 2.5% DSS (molecular weight: 36,000&#x02013;50,000) for 7 days, which is the most frequently regimen in the previous study. Interestingly, our results showed that the length of small intestine in mice was significantly reduced with the drinking of DSS (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). Histological staining also confirmed the injury of small intestinal epithelium, such as shrunk villi, atrophic crypts, less mucus-secreting goblet cells, and downregulated expression of tight junction markers ZO-1 and Occludin (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1G</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">L</xref>). Meanwhile, the degree of DSS-induced injury in small intestine varied depending on different segments, and distal ileum showed the most serious damage. Therefore, we concluded that small intestine was impaired during DSS-induced colitis.</p><p>Iron is an essential trace element for both health and the pathology of diseases in mammals (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). It is inevitable to a wide variety of biological processes. For example, oxygen transport in red blood cells depends on the iron-rich hemoglobin, and ATP generation in mitochondria also needs the involvement of iron. However, inappropriate iron supplementation may result in harm to tissue homeostasis and regeneration due to the over production of ROS and ferroptosis. Although many IBD patients always have a deficiency of iron caused by chronic bleeding and insufficient absorption, overload of iron has been identified to exacerbate intestinal injury (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). Recently, using DSS-induced IBD model of drosophila, Usman et al. demonstrated that ferrous sulfate increased lipid peroxidation and bathophenanthroline disulfonate (BPS), which was also an iron chelator, protected flies from DSS-induced IBD (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>). In the current study, we found overload of iron was harmful to small intestine, which worsened the epithelial injury during DSS treatment (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>) and delayed the epithelial regeneration after withdrawal of DSS (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). Meanwhile, to rule out the non-specific effects of iron and DFO, we used a control group without DSS treatment and found the current strategy of iron supplementation or depletion would not impair the healthy small intestine (<xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S4</xref>). Although iron supplementation alleviated DSS-induced decreasing of RBC count (<xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S5A</xref>), it increased the intestinal permeability as shown by FITC-dextran (FD4) assay (<xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S5B</xref>). Iron also enhanced the cytotoxicity of LPS-treated IEC-6 cells and enteroids, which were determined by LDH releasing assay (<xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figures S5C</xref>, <xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material">D</xref>). These results suggest that although most patients with IBD require iron supplementation to improve anemia, iron overload would damage small intestine. Therefore, the strategy of iron supplementation in clinical practice needs to be more cautious and consider more factors.</p><p>ISCs are the hub of epithelial renewal and regeneration. Dysfunction of ISCs is tightly related to less generation of new epithelial cells, which restricts the regeneration speed of intestinal barrier (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>, <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>). For example, ionizing radiation caused rapid apoptosis of ISCs, and we have shown that berberine (BBR) or intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) could boost the activity of ISCs to promote epithelial regeneration (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). In the circumstance of DSS-induced colitis, we found iron supplementation resulted in more infiltration of inflammatory cells (e.g., CD3<sup>+</sup> T cells and MPO<sup>+</sup> neutrophils), and it also changed the morphology of CX3CR1<sup>+</sup> resident macrophages surrounding intestinal crypts (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). Over-dosing iron could directly impair the biological activity of intestinal epithelial cells. Using IEC-6, we showed iron modulation would affect the proliferation, ROS content, and tight junction (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). Moreover, it was demonstrated that isolated crypts from mice with DSS-induced colitis formed less enteroids compared to healthy crypts, and iron-treated enteroids even grew worse (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). Importantly, it was demonstrated that iron overload was able to inhibit the differentiation of EGFP positive Lgr5<sup>+</sup> ISCs (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5H</xref>, <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">I</xref>, <xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S3B</xref>). Therefore, these data supported that iron content would greatly influence barrier integrity and ISC function via both enhancing inflammation and direct effects.</p><p>There are several shortcomings in the current study. First of all, we used the doses of iron supplementation and DFO following the previous study (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Given iron can exhibit both beneficial and detrimental effects <italic>in vivo</italic>, iron doses should be optimized before the study. Second, the current study mainly focused on the acute settings of DSS-induced colitis. However, many clinical IBD patients suffer from a chronic disease process, so a longitudinal analysis of iron regulation (both supplementation and depletion) is worth of great value for more exact determination of whether these effects could persist or lead to adaptive compensatory. Third, gut microbiota would not only impair the absorption and transportation of iron, but their diversity is also affected by the iron supplementation or depletion. A sequencing analysis of microbiome shift due to the iron regulation would contribute to further understanding of the observed results. Finally, there is lack of monitoring the concentration of iron in the blood, which will be able to directly reflect the bioavailability of iron. The function of hematopoiesis should also be considered during the administration of iron supplementation and DFO. It would be more helpful if we can collect some clinical biopsy samples to validate the findings.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>5 Conclusion</title><p>In summary, our study revealed that small intestine was also significantly impaired during the process of experimental colitis, and iron overload was negative to intestinal epithelial barrier and ISCs. This study emphasizes that it is of great importance to investigate cellular and molecular changes in small intestine during the process of experimental colitis, and appropriate and careful iron uptake is vital to control DSS-induced intestinal injury. The strategy of iron supplementation in clinical practice needs to be more cautious and consider more factors.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank the members in Dr. Dengqun Liu's laboratory for their critical reading and suggestions during the preparation and revision of this manuscript.</p></ack><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s6"><title>Data availability statement</title><p>The original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/<xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary material</xref>, further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding authors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="ethics-statement" id="s7"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>The animal study was approved by Ethics Committee of Sichuan Cancer Hospital &#x00026; Institute.
