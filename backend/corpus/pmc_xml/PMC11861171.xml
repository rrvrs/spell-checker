The LRGGs, published in 2021, consist of three limits: gamble no more than 1% of household income per month; gamble no more than four days per month; and avoid regularly gambling at more than two types of games. All three limits should be followed at the same time. This study focuses on the situation in Finland before the LRGGs were published. The aim of this study is to investigate trends in lower-risk gambling by age and net income among men and women in the Finnish adult population in 2011, 2015, and 2019. Data were drawn from cross-sectional Finnish Gambling population surveys, including permanent residents in Mainland Finland aged 15&#x02013;74 with Finnish, Swedish or S&#x000e1;mi as their mother tongue (2011; <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;4,484, 2015; <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;4,515, and 2019; <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;3,994). The results showed an increase in the prevalence of lower-risk gambling, rising from 29% in 2011 to 39% in 2019. This upward trend was observed among both men and women, with the prevalence among men increasing from 23 to 33%, and among women from 34 to 45%. The lowest prevalence of lower-risk gambling was found among individuals aged 60&#x02013;74, especially regarding expenditure guidelines, as well as among women in the lowest income tertile. In conclusion, although the prevalence of lower-risk gambling has increased in Finland, there is still potential for further improvement to minimize harm.</p><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s10899-024-10355-x.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Gambling</kwd><kwd>Population survey</kwd><kwd>Gender</kwd><kwd>Socio-economic factors</kwd><kwd>Lower-risk gambling guidelines</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare</institution></funding-source></award-group><open-access><p>Open Access funding provided by Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare.</p></open-access></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Gambling is a growing public health issue with diverse, harmful impacts at the individual, family, community, and society level (Latvala et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2019</xref>; Wardle et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2019</xref>). According to the Conceptual Framework of Harmful Gambling (Abbott et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2018</xref>), any type of gambling can potentially lead to negative outcomes. The harms can be short- or long-term and their intensity can vary from minor to significant. The factors related to the risks and effects of harmful gambling are multifaceted, ranging from the general (cultural, social, psychological, and biological) to the specific (gambling environment, gambling exposure, gambling types, and gambling resources). Although the greatest amount of personal gambling-related harm is suffered by those with problem gambling (incl. gambling disorder), most of the total gambling-related harm is distributed among people gambling who do not meet the definition of a &#x0201c;problem gambler&#x0201d; (Browne et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2018</xref>; Browne et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2020</xref>; Volberg et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2021</xref>). From the public health perspective, societal effects of gambling are therefore largely attributable to the harms experienced by people gambling at &#x0201c;at-risk&#x0201d; levels. It is noteworthy that the efforts targeted at the prevention of harmful gambling, rather than problem gambling, may potentially be more effective as they can impact a larger group of people (Currie et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2009</xref>).</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>The Lower-Risk Gambling Guidelines</title><p id="Par3">To fill the lack of evidence-based guidelines about how to gamble in a way that poses minimal risk, the Lower-Risk Gambling Guidelines (LRGGs) were developed by the Canadian Centre on Substance Use and Addiction (CCSA) (Young et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2022</xref>; Hodgins et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2023</xref>; Canadian Centre on Substance Use and Addiction, 2024). These guidelines, which were published in 2021, are a set of quantitative limits, and information about special risk populations, contextual factors and other health messages that should be followed in order to gamble in a lower-risk manner. The LRGGs consist of three limits: gamble no more than 1% of household income per month; gamble no more than four days per month; and avoid regularly gambling at more than two types of games. All three limits should be followed at the same time to minimize the risk of experiencing gambling-related harm.</p><p id="Par4">Development of the LRGGs spanned 4 years and included analysis of data from over 60,000 people who gamble from eight different countries, including Finland. Because the project funding and core research team were based in Canada, much of the other development work was conducted in Canada. This included consultation with a pan-Canadian multi-sectorial advisory committee, input from a national online survey (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;10,000), and interviews with people who gamble. Additional work included a systematic literature review and meta-analysis assessing special risk populations and contextual factors associated gambling harm (Allami et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2021</xref>) and a literature review assessing the influence of alcohol and other substances on gambling behaviour. This work resulted in six scientific publications (Hodgins et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2023</xref>; Young et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2022</xref>; Currie et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2019</xref>; Allami et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2021</xref>; Currie et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2020</xref>; Flores-Pajot et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2021</xref>) and a suite of knowledge mobilization (KmB) products such as downloadable banner ads, posters, and an online self-assessment tool permitting people to assess the risk level of their own gambling (Canadian Centre on Substance Use and Addiction, 2024).</p><p id="Par5">The quantitative recommended limits on expenditure, frequency, and gambling types have been found to be consistent with previous research and can predict future harm from gambling (Dowling et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2021</xref>). They are useful for public health promotion and can also be used to monitor risk of harm at the population level. Currently, research is underway to test the feasibility of using the LRGGs in the Finnish cultural context to prevent and reduce the gambling-related harm among the population.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Socio-Demographic and Socio-Economic Differences in Gambling Harms</title><p id="Par6">Within the general population, some groups experience more harmful gambling than others. Men and young adults are often found to be the most vulnerable (William et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2012</xref>; Ekholm et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2014</xref>). There is also evidence middle-aged women experience harmful gambling, especially among those who play electronic gaming machines (EGMs) (Hing et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2016</xref>), although, a recently published meta-analysis did not support this (Allami et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2021</xref>). Compared to men, women tend to start gambling later in their life and progress more quickly from the gambling onset to experiencing gambling problems. This reflects to a telescoping progress (Syvertsen et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2023</xref>). In Finland, the prevalence of problem gambling (SOGS 3+) among women has increased in the last decade (Salonen et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2020</xref>).</p><p id="Par7">Evidence also suggests that gambling harms are disproportionately experienced by socio-economically disadvantaged groups (Sharman et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2019</xref>). Low education is found to be associated with harmful gambling (Ekholm et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2014</xref>). Furthermore, harmful gambling is more common among those who have received social security benefits. This is especially the case among those who have received income support, which is a last resort form of financial aid in Finland. (Latvala et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2021</xref>.) In addition, harmful gambling is more prevalent among unemployed (Latvala et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2021</xref>). Higher income is found to be associated with higher total gambling expenditure (Gr&#x000f6;nroos et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2022</xref>). However, lower-income individuals spend a higher proportion of their income on gambling and are also at higher risk of experiencing harms (Castr&#x000e9;n et al.,2018; Roukka &#x00026; Salonen, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2020</xref>). Overall, those with gambling problems often face other challenges as well, such as health problems and other addictions (Lorains et al.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2011</xref>; Dowling et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2015</xref>; H&#x000e5;kansson et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2018</xref>; Gr&#x000f6;nroos et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2024</xref>). These problems can be further exacerbated by gambling.</p><p id="Par8">In this paper, the focus is on the situation in Finland before the LRGGs were published in 2021. This study describes the proportion of individuals gambling above and below each of the quantitative limits included in the guidelines as well as the proportion of gambling above and below all three limits together. Previous literature suggests that gambling participation and harms among men and women may differ in terms of age and socio-economic factors. In this study, separate analyses are therefore conducted for men and women, as combined analysis may obscure gender distinctions due to the stronger effect sizes of men. The aim of this study is to investigate trends in lower-risk gambling by age and net income among men and women in the Finnish adult population in 2011, 2015, and 2019. The overall prevalence of gambling in the population was stable over this period.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Design, Participants, and Data Collection</title><p id="Par9">The cross-sectional data were extracted from the Finnish Gambling population studies, which were conducted by the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare (Salonen et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2020</xref>). The surveys assessed gambling, problem gambling, and attitudes and opinions towards gambling. The participants were randomly selected from the National Population Information System covering the total population in Finland. Based on that, invitation letters were sent to 16,000 persons in 2011, 7,400 in 2015, and 7,800 in 2019. The inclusion criteria were: (1) aged 15 to 74; (2) Finnish, Swedish or S&#x000e1;mi as first language; and (3) resident in Mainland Finland.</p><p id="Par10">In 2011, the study was described to the potential participants as a &#x02018;gambling and health survey&#x02019; and data were collected by Taloustutkimus, a private market research company. In 2015 and 2019, the study was described to the potential participants as a survey on &#x02018;gambling and opinions on gambling&#x02019;, with the data collected by Statistics Finland. The data (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;12,993) were collected as computer-assisted telephone interviews. Ultimately, responses were obtained from 4,484 participants in 2011, 4,515 participants in 2015, and 3,994 participants in 2019. The response rates were 28%, 62%, and 52%, respectively. For this present study, only those who have a legal right to gamble (i.e., 18&#x02013;74-year-olds) in Finland were included. The data represents the entire Finnish population.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Measures</title><sec id="Sec7"><title>Prevalence of Gambling no More than 1% of Individual Net Income</title><p id="Par11">Gambling expenditure was measured in 2011 and 2015 as follows: &#x02018;Roughly how much money do you spend on gambling in a typical week (&#x020ac;)?&#x02019;. In 2019, gambling expenditure was inquired with the question: &#x02018;Think about the past 12 months. Estimate the amount of money that you spent on gambling on average per week, per month or during the year (&#x020ac;).&#x02019; All gambling expenditure figures were transformed into monthly gambling expenditure. In the LRGGs (Young et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2021</xref>; Hodgins et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2023</xref>), household net income is the first limit (gamble no more than 1% of household net income per month). However, individual net income was used as household net income was not available. Furthermore, individual net income is better suited to the Nordic context, as Finnish couples typically maintain their own financial accounts rather than share them with their spouses (Pepin &#x00026; Cohen, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2021</xref>). Then, based on monthly gambling expenditure and individual monthly net income, &#x0201c;gamble no more than 1% of individual net income per month&#x0201d; (yes/no) was created.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Prevalence of Gambling No More Than Four Days per Month</title><p id="Par12">Gambling frequency was asked for 18 game types. The list included games provided by the Finnish gambling monopoly company Veikkaus Oy. In addition, offshore games and games offered in &#x000c5;land and in ferries between Finland, Sweden, and Estonia were included in the list. Gambling days per month were calculated as follows. First, gambling frequency for each game type was transformed into days: 1) daily or almost daily&#x02009;=&#x02009;30/month; several times a week&#x02009;=&#x02009;16/month; once a week&#x02009;=&#x02009;4/month; 2 to 3 times a month&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.5/month; once a month&#x02009;=&#x02009;1/month; and less than monthly&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.25/month. In 2019, gambling frequency was measured by four categories, instead of six. Therefore, in 2019, gambling frequency for each game type was transformed into days: 1) daily or several times a week&#x02009;=&#x02009;19/month; once a week&#x02009;=&#x02009;4/month; 1 to 3 times a month&#x02009;=&#x02009;2/month; and less than monthly&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.25/month.

The limits and the trends in them were observed each on its own and together, as recommended by the CCSA (Young et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2021</xref>). Overall, the prevalence of lower-risk gambling among all Finns was 39.3% in 2019. Further, a positive change was observed since the prevalence of lower-risk gambling has increased from 2011 (28.7%) and from 2015 (29.7%). This is positive as such an increase indicates that, over the assessed time period, a greater proportion of the Finnish population gambled at levels of gambling involvement that were at low risk of gambling related harm. This finding is in line with the previous Finnish Gambling study results based on the South Oaks Gambling Screen (SOGS; Salonen et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2020</xref>). While at-risk gambling (SOGS&#x02009;=&#x02009;1&#x02013;2) decreased from 13.3 to 10.7%, the prevalence of problem gambling (SOGS&#x02009;=&#x02009;3+) remained unchanged at around 3% during this time. It is noteworthy, that at the same time past-year gambling prevalence has been rather stable in Finland, being 77.9% in 2011, 80.0% in 2015 and 78.4% in 2019 (Salonen et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2020</xref>).</p><sec id="Sec15"><title>Lower-Risk Gambling by Gender</title><p id="Par27">As expected, the prevalence of lower-risk gambling was higher among women than among men. Several previous studies have shown that men gamble more often and have more gambling problems than women (Ekholm et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2012</xref>; Dowling et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2017</xref>; Salonen et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2022</xref>). Men also tend to spend more money on gambling than women (Gr&#x000f6;nroos et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2022</xref>). Furthermore, men also have different game type preferences compared with women. In Finland men gamble more on all types of games compared with women, except for the scratch cards (Salonen et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2020</xref>). Finnish men also gamble offshore more often than Finnish women (Hagfors et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2023</xref>), and offshore online gambling has increased between 2007 and 2019 (Salonen et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2022</xref>). Despite this, the prevalence of lower-risk gambling increased between 2011 and 2019 among men. Among women, however, the prevalence of lower-risk gambling decreased between 2011 and 2015, while the prevalence of lower-risk gambling increased from 2015 to 2019 considerably.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Lower-Risk Gambling by Age and Income</title><p id="Par28">Another finding of this study was that the prevalence of lower-risk gambling has clearly increased among 18&#x02013;29-year-olds. The result was in line with the Finnish Gambling study results indicating a reduction in at-risk gambling (SOGS&#x02009;=&#x02009;1&#x02013;2) among 19&#x02013;24-years-olds (Salonen et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2020</xref>). At the same time, attitudes towards gambling changed more negative particularly among 18&#x02013;34-year-old men. This trend may have been partly influenced by the fact that the age limit of gambling in Finland was raised from 15 to 18 in October 2010. Therefore, many in this age group have grown up in different type of gambling environment than previous generations. EGMs were given a slightly longer transition time and the new age limit for EGMs took effect on July 2011. At the time, the aim was also to improve the supervision of age limits and prohibit gambling advertisements directed to under 18-years-olds. Interestingly, the prevalence of lower-risk gambling was shown not to be of lowest among the youngest age group. This finding is somewhat surprising given that at-risk gambling is highest among 18&#x02013;34-years-olds (Salonen et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2020</xref>). It should be noted that the type of gambling in which a person regularly engages is a strong predictor of gambling problems. The risk is found to be highest in online gambling and gambling EGMs or poker (Allami et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2021</xref>). This type of gambling is rather common among young age groups; however, all types of underaged gambling has decreased since 2011, except for gambling scratch cards (Salonen et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2020</xref>).</p><p id="Par29">The prevalence of lower-risk gambling was lowest among 60&#x02013;74-years-olds, particularly for the limit related to gambling expenditure. In this age group, most common game types include weekly lottery games (70%), scratch cards (39%), slot machines outside the casino (18%) and daily lottery games (24%), while other game types are gambled only rarely (Salonen et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2020</xref>). Furthermore, 60&#x02013;74 year-olds can be quite diverse in their backgrounds; some are still at work, and some are already pensioners. However, it can be assumed that a large number are already retired because in Finland a common retirement age is around 63 years. A declined income in retirement may partly explain the lower proportion of lower-risk gambling among the oldest age group, in particular in the guideline related to gambling expenditure relative to income. In retirement, some individuals may continue their previous level of gambling despite a reduction in income (Landreat et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2019</xref>). Further, it is noteworthy that the negative consequences of gambling may be particularly significant for older adults. As already mentioned, many older people have a lower income due to retirement, and thus have fewer financial resources to recover from social, financial, and, especially, health-related consequences resulting from problematic gambling (Levens et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2005</xref>; Landreat et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2019</xref>).</p><p id="Par30">Among women, the prevalence of lower-risk gambling was of lowest in the lowest income tertile in 2019. This was not a surprising result as gambling problems are found to be more common among those with lower income (Latvala et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2021</xref>). In addition, although those with high income spend more on gambling, those with lower income contribute proportionally more (Beckert &#x00026; Lutter, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2009</xref>; Canale et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2016</xref>; Castr&#x000e9;n et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2018</xref>; Roukka &#x00026; Salonen, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2020</xref>). EGMs have been identified as a single most harmful game type (Binde et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2017</xref>; Russell et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2023</xref>). In fact, it has also been proven in Finland that that the density of EGMs is higher in areas with a lower socio-economic level than in areas with a higher socio-economic level (Raisamo et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Finnish Gambling Policy / Environment</title><p id="Par31">In addition to the increase in the age limit for gambling, the Finnish gambling environment has changed in other ways over the last decade as a result of other policy changes as well as transnational gambling trends. Formerly, the Finnish three-party monopoly system changed in early 2017, since the three operators were merged into a single company, Veikkaus Oy. At the time, Veikkaus Oy opened a new online gambling site with an easy access to a large number of different gambling activities. On the other hand, mandatory identification, which allowed the use of several gambling management tools, were introduced first online and later on land-based. Firstly, in 2017, new restrictions and gambling management tools (including game loss limits, money transfer limits, and the possibility of a game ban) were provided on Veikkaus Oy&#x02019;s new online gambling site. These online gambling restriction tools, some of which are mandatory and some of which are voluntary, may have particularly affected the amount of money spent on gambling, which may be seen in the increase in the prevalence of lower-risk gambling, especially in the prevalence of spending no more than 1% of individual income.</p><p id="Par32">The percentage of Finns reporting they had gambled online gambling during the last decade increased, with the highest growth between 2015 and 2019 (Salonen et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2020</xref>). As shown in several studies, online gamblers are more likely to report harmful gambling than land-based gamblers (Griffiths et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2009</xref>; Wood &#x00026; Williams, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2011</xref>; Canale et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2016</xref>; Pallesen et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2021</xref>; Allami et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2021</xref>). Nevertheless, lower-risk gambling has simultaneously increased. A recently published Finnish study (Lind et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2022</xref>) showed that online gambling was not linked to higher problem gambling prevalence. This may be partly due to the Finnish gambling context which is characterized by a high prevalence of land-based EGMs in everyday locations such as grocery stores and petrol stations. Therefore, the particularly harmful nature of land-based gambling in Finland may partly overshadow the negative consequences of online gambling (Lind et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2022</xref>). Thus, the increase in online gambling may not have affected lower-risk gambling among the general population as much as in other countries.</p><p id="Par33">Moreover, despite of increased gambling availability due to online gambling, gambling has become more occasional in Finland; gambling less than monthly has increased, whereas gambling at least once a month has decreased (Salonen et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2020</xref>). This change may be due to adaption, which is related to gambling exposure, one of the gambling-specific factors depicted in the Conceptual Framework of Harmful Gambling (Abbott et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2018</xref>). In the framework, adaption means that, over time, populations adapt to gambling exposure and people participate less in gambling and experience less gambling-related harm, even though gambling exposure continues to increase. In Finland, those who gamble may have adapted to the large number of different gambling activities at least at some extent and, thus, increased gambling availability may not have affected to gambling involvement &#x02013; thus the observed increase in prevalence of lower-risk gambling.</p><p id="Par34">In addition, it is noteworthy that LRGGs do not take into account the number of player accounts in different online gambling sites. In other words, it is possible for a person to gamble only one or two game types, but on several different gambling sites, leading possibly to greater gambling. Consideration of this issue is timely, as the government of Finland reforms the Finnish gambling system by opening it up to competition through a licensing system by first of January 2026. In principle, online casino games and online betting would be covered by the licencing system. In 2019, those Finns who had gambled non-monopoly games, had an average of 2.7 different player accounts. Around 30% of them had three or more accounts. The large number of player accounts is found to be linked to gambling problems. (Salonen et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2020</xref>).</p><p id="Par35">Several other potential factors may have influenced the increase in the prevalence of lower-risk gambling among Finns. During recent years, the public debate on gambling and Veikkaus Oy has been exceptionally active and critical, which may have affected Finns&#x02019; gambling and attitudes towards gambling (Macey et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2023</xref>). Also, long-term work on preventing and reducing gambling-related harm in Finland may have had an effect.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Strengths and Limitations</title><p id="Par36">There are some limitations in this study, which should be taken into consideration when interpreting the results. This study utilized self-reported data, as in most gambling studies (Shaffer et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2010</xref>). A few studies have evaluated the accuracy of self-reported data with actual data provided by gambling operator (Braverman et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2014</xref>; Auer &#x00026; Griffiths, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2017</xref>). These studies showed that respondents tend to underestimate the amount of money they spent on gambling (Braverman et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2014</xref>; Auer &#x00026; Griffiths, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2017</xref>). However, it should be noted that self-reported loss is still found to correlate with the actual loss (Auer &#x00026; Griffiths, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2017</xref>). In addition, the respondents are not found to consistently indicate a favourable distortion of their gambling losses or gains, as they underestimated or overestimated their gambling outcomes (Braverman et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2014</xref>).</p><p id="Par37">In order to ensure cross-sectional comparability, an effort was made to ensure the design and the questionnaire remained as similar as possible throughout the trend series. However, in 2011, the data were collected by Taloustutkimus, and in 2015 and 2019 the survey was conducted in collaboration with Statistics Finland. Moreover, the data for 2011 and 2019 were collected in autumn/winter, while the data for 2015 was collected in the spring. Moreover, the response rate varied throughout the years, which may affect comparisons of data collected in different years. In 2019, the respondents reported their gambling expenditure based on gambling frequency of their choice. In earlier years, the questions concerning gambling expenditure were worded slightly differently. Despite some differences, the combined data forms coherent data that enables trend research, covering important information on Finnish gambling for a decade.</p><p id="Par38">This study did not examine the impact of game form on whether a person gambled according to the LRGGs. However, previous studies have shown that some forms of gambling (e.g., electronic gaming machines, poker, casino games) are more closely associated with problem gambling than other forms (e.g., lotteries) (Binde et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2017</xref>). Fast-paced games that involve frequent betting can more quickly lead to problems than discontinuous forms of gambling. With these fast-paced games such as electronic gaming machines, people can spend large amounts of money in a short time. In future studies, it should be important to investigate how participation with different types of games affect the prevalence of lower-risk gambling.</p><p id="Par39">Lastly, this study evaluated gambling from the public health perspective and the results were encouraging. On the other hand, it is noteworthy that this type of evaluation does not give an insight from the perspective of those suffering from the most severe gambling harms. Above mentioned changes, in the gambling environment such as 24/7 availability, increase in online and particularly offshore gambling, may have impacted differently those gambling extensively.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec19" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par40">Before the LRGG were published and implemented, the prevalence of lower-risk gambling among all Finns was 39.3% in 2019. Although the overall past-year gambling prevalence remained unchanged between 2011 and 2019, the prevalence of lower-risk gambling increased during this period. This suggests that a greater proportion of people than before are gambling in ways that reduce the risk of harm from gambling. Despite this, there is still room for improvement and interventions targeting at-risk gambling. Implementation of the LRGG might further enhance this positive trend. A group of multi-professional Finnish experts translated and prepared the LRGG materials for the Finnish cultural context in 2023. Currently, the feasibility of the LRGGs is being tested in order to clarify the LRGG&#x02019;s potential for implementation in Finland. Our results imply that, if/when the LRGG will be implemented in Finland, 60&#x02013;74-years-olds and persons with low income might benefit the most out of it.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic Supplementary Material</title><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.</p><p>
