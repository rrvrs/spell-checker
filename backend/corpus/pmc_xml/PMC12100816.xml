It is a vital practical skill used by doctors, paramedics, technicians, and registered nurses that involves psychomotor aspects, theoretical and practical knowledge, and manipulation skills [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. However, the assessment, maintenance, and removal of PVC is primarily the responsibility of nurses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Successful intervention rates vary depending on whether this intervention is specific to the patient (age, ethnicity, dark skin, body structure, adipose tissue accumulation, fluid status, blood velocity, and vessel diameter, obesity) or the underlying clinical picture (anamnesis of chronic disease, problems associated with the circulatory system-peripheral edema, hypothermia, dehydration, septic shock, vasoconstriction, presence of thrombophlebitis, hematoma, ecchymosis due to previous interventions) or the nurse&#x02019;s experience [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">PVC insertion is a skill that must be acquired in nursing education. Inadequate education or inaccurate placement of the PVC can increase the risk of complications. One of the recommendations to reduce PVC insertion failure and its complications is to increase nurses&#x02019; and nursing students&#x02019; education [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. PVC placement is an invasive intervention challenging to learn and perform. Nursing students often need multiple practice experiences to gain proficiency, and the process frequently leads to anxiety, stress, and fear of failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. PVC skill learning is carried out in two settings, i.e., simulation and clinical implementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Invasive nursing skills are learned and practiced in preparation for clinical learning experiences with partial-task trainers and peers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par9">The most key point to be taught to students in PVC skills training is techniques to increase vein prominence and visibility in parallel with selecting the correct site and vein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Vein prominence is assessed by methods of inspection and palpation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. It was found that considering the difficulty of developing palpation for the first time in PVC training, the lack of hand-eye coordination, and the lack of success resulting in frustration because of critical or non-critical errors, students need more practice with different teaching instruments under the supervision of instructors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. For nursing students to develop the manipulation skills required to meet the appropriate clinical learning objectives, various techniques can be used.</p><p id="Par10">A rich vascular anatomy and physiology knowledge is required for ensuring successful PVC learning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. During vessel selection by inspection, arteries, and nerves should be identified based on anatomical knowledge of the site (e.g., median nerve). The normal and abnormal characteristics of vessels, such as shape, size, path, patency, and flow, should be examined by palpation technique [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Therefore, it is important for nursing students to acquire theoretical and practical knowledge and the necessary skills in accordance with current guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. It is also very important to assess whether nursing students have achieved a sufficient level of knowledge in PVC skills to document the learning outcomes in accordance with the Bologna Declaration (a), to support PVC-related patient safety in clinical rotations (b), and to prevent complications (c). In this context, nurse educators should evaluate current educational strategies, and examine current technological equipment and devices, and methods to increase PVC skill learning of students [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p id="Par11">Near-infrared (NIR) vascular imaging makes veins more visible by taking advantage of the light-reflecting feature of haemoglobin. It creates a dark contrast with skin tissue due to light absorption, and veins are visualized in phosphorescent colour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. NIR light visualization and isometric exercise are known to be used in the clinical field to enhance the visibility of veins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Background</title><p id="Par12">The traditional methods used to increase vein prominence include milking the vein, slapping the skin, applying the tourniquet, negative pressure, warming the area, applying vasodilatation pastes, etc [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In addition to the traditional methods of increasing venous prominence, there are modern methods such as multi-spectral cameras [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], robotics systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], visible light transilluminators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], ultrasound [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], NIR spectroscopy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p id="Par13">There is a wide variety of clinical trials on NIR. Most clinical trials have focused on PVC in preterm infants and children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In addition, there are studies in which the effect of NIR on PVC skill has been examined in patients diagnosed with hemophilia with a history of difficult vascular access [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], in adult patients admitted to the emergency department [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], in patients diagnosed with rheumatism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], in patients receiving chemotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. All these study results support the inclusion of NIR vascular imaging in clinical practice, highlighting its potential benefits for patient safety. While no medical technology is entirely without risk, the evidence suggests that NIR is a safe and effective tool. Fukuroku et al., in a study comparing the tourniquet and NIR methods, indicated that NIR was effective for nursing students in locating difficult-to-detect veins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p><p id="Par14">There is a scarcity of clinical trials on isometric exercises. A study examining the effects of handgrip exercise training with and without venous restriction on muscle strength and vascular responses noted that it could potentially increase vein prominence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Rus et al., assessed the impact of daily handgrip training combined with intermittent compression on the forearm veins of chronic haemodialysis patients. Results showed significant increases in forearm circumference and venous diameter after eight weeks of training, indicating that handgrip exercises can enhance vein prominence through increased blood flow and vascular adaptation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Another study involving healthy individuals found that fist clenching significantly increased the visibility of both dorsal metacarpal and cephalic veins. Depending on the specific vein assessed, participants improved after an average of approximately 10 to 22 fist clenches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><p id="Par15">Among the advantages of NIR light is that the vein anatomy is imaged as the procedure occurs. This unique advantage can allow students to see the 2-dimensional anatomy and the potential complications that may arise. For this purpose, this study evaluated the effects of three techniques used to improve vein conspicuity on nursing students&#x02019; success, knowledge, and psychomotor skills during their first peripheral venous catheterization experience. Three techniques used to increase vein prominence were: vein visualization with NIR light, vein dilation through isometric exercise, and the traditional tourniquet method, which served as the control. This study is the first finding in nursing education that examines practical skill-learning techniques for increasing venous prominence fullness after isometric exercise with a stress ball and vascular imaging under bright light with NIR. The research questions were as follows:</p><p id="Par16">1) Is there a difference in initial PVC success among nursing students during the vein prominence improvement intervention with three different techniques?</p><p id="Par17">2) Is there a difference in initial PVC knowledge and psychomotor skill scores among nursing students during the vein prominence improvement intervention with three different techniques?</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Method</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Design</title><p id="Par18">This study was performed as a single-centre, parallel-group, randomized controlled study using a pre-test and post-test design.

</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Participants and data collection</title><p id="Par20">The research was conducted by enrolling first-year nursing students in western T&#x000fc;rkiye. The universe of the study consisted of nursing students (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;179) who were attending the Department of Nursing at a university and taking the course module for basic nursing skills between February and July 2022. The inclusion criteria for participants comprised individuals who had not previously undergone training in PVC skills, those who could certify their vaccinations as protective health workers, and those who volunteered to participate. Participants were excluded from the study if they had been diagnosed with a chronic illness, a bleeding disorder, or a psychiatric condition; if they had not received vaccinations for HBV, HCV, or HIV; or if they did not complete both the pre-test and post-test. Students who were excluded or withdrawn from the study continued their standard education.</p><p id="Par21">In the preliminary study conducted to calculate the sample size, power analysis was performed in G*Power Version 3.1.9.6 statistical software. In the success rate comparison between the groups, Cohen stated that when the effect size was 0.3 at the medium level, at least 48 participants should be included in each group at the 80% power and 5% significance level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. After the training and the PVC knowledge test, students were divided by the stratified sampling method into three groups of low, medium, and high levels according to their academic grade averages. This selection removes doubts concerning bias in the randomization processes. This, in turn, strengthens the internal validity of the research, allowing for more robust conclusions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p><p id="Par22">An equal number of participants from each level were distributed to a stratified sample group. Then the researchers used number 1 for the NIR light visualization training group, number 2 for the isometric exercise training group, and number 3 for the control group. These numbers were placed in a dark box. Participants selected numbers from the box and were assigned to groups in line with their numbers. This randomization process was repeated until the groups had equal participants. The study was completed with a simple random sampling method, with 147 students participating in the NIR light visualisation (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;49), isometric exercise (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;50), and control (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;48) groups. Data were collected between February and July 2022 in the spring academic semester. Blinding was not implemented in this study, limiting the ability to mitigate bias; however, due to the nature of the intervention and procedure, blinding was deemed impractical and ethically challenging, acknowledging this as a notable limitation of the research.</p><sec id="Sec6"><title>Phase 1: design of educational intervention</title><p id="Par23">For this study, the educational intervention was designed according to a synthesis of instructional theories proposed by the Miller Pyramid. The steps of this pyramid are as follows: (1) <italic>Knows</italic>: acquisition of theoretical concepts and skills (2) <italic>Knows How</italic>: connecting what students already know or can do with what is to be newly learned, discussing problem-based decision-making processes for integration of core concepts and skills (3) <italic>Shows How</italic>: demonstrations for students to show them what they are to learn knowledge and skills in a simulated laboratory environment (4) <italic>Does</italic>: opportunities for students to practice what they have learned and receive instructor mentoring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].

After the application of the tourniquet, the participants were asked about the degree of vein prominence under NIR light, and their subjective evaluations were recorded. The participants were allowed to use the inspection and palpation methods in the grading of vein prominence. Procedure success was recorded. Blood return upon removing the steel needle was considered a success criterion. The PVC procedure was considered a failure if no blood came into the cannula.

If one-way analysis of variance failed to demonstrate normal distribution in more than two group comparisons for normally distributed data, the Kruskal Wallis test was applied. The Wilcoxon sign-rank test was utilised for statistical differences between dependent groups. Categorical data were analysed using the Pearson Chi-square, Fisher-Freeman-Halton, and Fisher&#x02019;s Exact Chi-square tests. A multiple comparison test, the Bonferroni test, was utilised to determine significance. The agreement between raters was investigated using the intraclass correlation coefficient.

Due to these reasons, the prominence of veins varies significantly from individual to individual. On examination of the studies on the use of NIR light visualization, increased vein prominence and better vein visibility were reported to be obtained [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Chiao et al. detected that the use of NIR light visualization significantly improved vein prominence by 4 times in obese participants and by 3 times in morbidly obese participants, compared to the traditional method. In the same study, dark-skinned African American participants had better vein prominence than the control group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Like the literature, the results of the current research report an increase in the vein prominence in the NIR light visualization training group (grade 4) by 36.8%, while the isometric exercise training group (grade 4) has the highest rate of 38%. Current research results, which state the effectiveness of NIR in finding difficult-to-detect veins for nursing students, similar to Fukuroku et al., indicate that vein prominence has improved in the groups of NIR and isometric exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. It was reported that the use of NIR light visualization could visualize the hand veins of all babies and children; however, the veins in the antecubital fossa could not be visualized in 4 patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. In another study, one out of three operators reported that the use of NIR light visualization prevented venipuncture while performing PVC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. In another study, dissatisfaction with the vein visibility of NIR light visualization was stated as NIR light caused the veins to appear larger than they were, and the venous depth is not fully understood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. These differences in NIR light visualization evaluations may result from constantly evolving device versions. In another study, the effect of palm opening and closing, NIR light visualization, and standard methods on vein prominence was examined. The degree of vein prominence was 35.6% in both the NIR light visualization and standard teaching groups, compared to 11.11% in the isometric exercise group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The difference between the results may be due to the difference in the patient population, in that participants received chemotherapy in the study of Eren and &#x000c7;al&#x00131;&#x0015f;kan, while the vein prominence was graded in healthy adults in the present study.</p><p id="Par46">The success of PVC in healthy adults depends on the visibility and palpability of the veins and the skill, experience, and skill of the operator [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. The success of NIR light imaging used in clinical trials for PVC placement remains controversial in the paediatric population. Compared with the standard NIR light visualization method, results were obtained such that PVC reduced the number and duration of the intervention and facilitated the procedure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] Similarly, based on the results of the current study, the success rate of PVC placement on the first or second attempt was higher in the NIR light visualization group compared to the other groups. Contrary to these results, some studies indicated that the use of NIR light in the paediatric population did not reduce the number or duration of PVC interventions, and did not provide any advantage over the standard method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In one clinical study, there was a small increase in forearm flow velocity with 20&#x000a0;min of isometric palm squeezing exercise five days a week, but the results were not significant. Therefore, the effect of hand grip exercises in increasing the PVC success rate in the absence of peripheral complications was not supported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. When examining the findings of the current study, the groups with the highest success rate in the first attempt were NIR light visualization, isometric exercise, and control (respectively, 67.3%, 40.0%, 29.2%). In the present study, participants in the isometric exercise group had a lower success rate than those in the NIR light visualization group but a higher rate than the control group. These differences may be attributed to biochemical and physical variations between healthy participants (nursing students) and patient populations (e.g., chemotherapy patients). Although the isometric exercise group had the shortest first PVC attempt duration, no statistically significant difference was found between the groups. Similar to the results of the current study, in another study conducted in a paediatric blood collection centre, the use of NIR light was detected not to differ from the standard method in terms of the success and period of blood collection at the first attempt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. According to the authors&#x02019; experience, the use of NIR light may have caused a loss of time as it aroused students&#x02019; curiosity but was also a distracting activity element.</p><p id="Par47">Theoretical knowledge of PVC is essential for successful cannulation. In a randomized controlled study conducted with nurses working in the departments of internal medicine and surgery, it was determined that a training program using a computer-based simulator increased the level of success and knowledge in PVC application significantly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In another study, it was stated that PVC training in a mixed reality simulator increased the knowledge level of students [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Similar to the results of this study, on evaluation of the PVC knowledge levels of the participants in the present study, the knowledge level of the final test was detected to increase compared to the knowledge level of the pre-test in all three groups. In the present study, it was determined that the pre-test knowledge scores of the participants in the isometric exercise group were lower than the other groups, and the final test scores increased more than the other groups. There are also studies indicating that the training in the virtual simulator is not effective in increasing the knowledge level of the students [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. The reason for this difference may result from the fact that all participants were given detailed theoretical information in the present study, all participants practiced the PVC skill steps in the laboratory as much as they wanted, and in addition, they tried the PVC intervention on each other in reality. The techniques used in this research can improve students&#x02019; understanding and PVC knowledge in the future. Further investigation into the factors influencing the lack of significant differences in PVC knowledge levels and skill performance among the groups is warranted. Potential considerations may include variations in individual learning styles, prior experience with venipuncture techniques, or the effectiveness of instructional methods. Exploring these aspects could provide valuable insights for refining training approaches and optimizing skill acquisition in nursing education and clinical practice.</p><p id="Par48">Learning clinical psychomotor skills is an integral part of nursing education [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>].

The findings support the importance of using NIR light visualization technology and isometric exercise training tools for successful PVC placement. On evaluating the PVC knowledge levels of the participants in the study, the knowledge level of the final test was detected to increase compared to the knowledge level of the pre-test in all groups. Regarding PVC psychomotor skills, no differences were seen between the groups in this study. Strategies must be evaluated to enhance the PVC insertion technique before graduation. It can be recommended that different teaching techniques be continued under instructor supervision for students in the procedure of PVC placement.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#x02019;s note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The statistics were checked before submission by an expert statistician, G&#x000fc;ven &#x000d6;zkaya, ozkaya@uludag.edu.tr.
