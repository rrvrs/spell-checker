Antispastic treatments such as baclofen and botulinum toxin are commonly prescribed in poststroke recovery. However, their impact on motor recovery, especially when administered within the first 2 months after stroke, remains unclear.</p></sec><sec sec-type="objective"><title>Objective</title><p>This study aims to compare the motor recovery effects of botulinum toxin versus oral baclofen. The hypothesis is that botulinum toxin is more supportive of motor recovery than baclofen and enhances functional recovery.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>The study is a multicenter, controlled phase IV, comparative, prospective, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, superiority trial to compare the toxin and baclofen, and a noninferiority trial to compare the toxin and the placebo. It focuses on the time course of the Fugl-Meyer Motor Assessment (FMA) as the primary outcome. The main inclusion criterion is patients with a single stroke in the past 2 months. Treatment comprises 1 intramuscular injection at treatment initiation and oral tablets for 4 months. Randomized patients are allocated to 3 arms: botulinum toxin with placebo baclofen, baclofen with placebo botulinum toxin, and placebo baclofen with placebo botulinum toxin. FMA scores are assessed at pretreatment, 1 month, and 3 months later. Spasticity, functional abilities, activities of daily living, pain, and quality of life are also evaluated. Adverse effects are monitored. A positive difference of 13 points in the FMA time course between the botulinum toxin and baclofen groups is considered a relevant effect. The data analysis plan involves linear regression models to compare primary and secondary outcomes, with adjustments for covariates such as age, center, and associated treatments. Subgroup analyses will examine proportional recovery profiles, and missing data in Fugl-Meyer scores will be addressed using imputation methods.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>A total of 179 participants were randomized across 18 centers, with inclusions delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As of December 2024, the data manager currently has all the data, and a review of data quality is in progress. No statistical analysis has been conducted so far, and the blind will be lifted after the analysis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study identifies the most suitable spasticity treatment, considering the specificities of the stroke and constraints during the recovery phase.

A significant proportion of people who have had a stroke face long-term disability, with many requiring assistance with daily activities, walking, or occupational activities [<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Early subacute poststroke rehabilitation, which occurs during the period between 7 and 90 days post stroke, focuses on promoting motor recovery and reducing activity limitations, often through intensive rehabilitation and, where appropriate, pharmacological intervention. This phase is considered a critical window for neuroplasticity and motor recovery [<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. While there is substantial evidence from animal models suggesting that certain drugs impact motor recovery, human studies are limited, especially in the context of spasticity management during the subacute phase post stroke [<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Spastic motor syndrome involves spasticity, dystonia, co-contraction, and clonus due to diminished tonic stretch reflexes and increased muscle tone due to upper motor neuron damage [<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Although spasticity is typically treated in the chronic phase, there is an increasing trend toward early intervention during the subacute phase [<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Early management may potentially mitigate long-term functional limitations; however, it remains uncertain whether early pharmacological treatment of spasticity positively or negatively influences motor recovery [<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>Two primary pharmacological treatments for spasticity in France are baclofen and botulinum toxin A, each with distinct mechanisms and evidence of efficacy [<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Baclofen is a GABA (&#x003b3;-aminobutyric acid)-B agonist that reduces spasticity by enhancing presynaptic inhibition, thereby decreasing the excitability of afferents in spinal reflexes. Despite its widespread use and endorsement by the French National Health Authority, Haute Autorit&#x000e9; de Sant&#x000e9;, as a first-line treatment, studies in animal models have raised concerns about the impact of GABAergic drugs on motor recovery. Research indicates that GABAergic agents, such as diazepam, can impair motor recovery and brain plasticity postinjury [<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Baclofen has shown similar detrimental effects on visuomotor learning in healthy human participants, suggesting a potential risk for individuals undergoing motor recovery post stroke [<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However, the absence of direct studies on baclofen&#x02019;s effects during the recovery phase post stroke leaves a critical gap in understanding its impact on motor outcomes.</p><p>Botulinum toxin A, meanwhile, acts by blocking acetylcholine release at the neuromuscular junction, thereby temporarily paralyzing targeted muscle fibers and reducing spasticity [<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Its effects generally become noticeable within days and persist for approximately 4 months [<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Randomized controlled trials demonstrate botulinum toxin&#x02019;s effectiveness in reducing spasticity in patients with chronic stroke; yet, its effects on motor function are less clear [<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Most studies have focused on its use in the chronic phase over 6 months post stroke, a period when plasticity decreases and muscular changes may be irreversible. Notably, research using transcranial magnetic stimulation and functional magnetic resonance imaging indicates that botulinum toxin injections may have modulatory effects on the central nervous system, potentially enhancing brain plasticity and supporting recovery [<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>-<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. This evidence suggests that early use of botulinum toxin in the subacute phase could offer motor recovery benefits by influencing neuroplastic processes.</p><p>Given the limited understanding of how these treatments affect motor recovery in the subacute phase, this study aims to investigate the comparative efficacy of baclofen and botulinum toxin A on motor recovery post stroke. Our hypothesis is that botulinum toxin will demonstrate a superior effect on motor recovery compared to baclofen, as it may mitigate spasticity without the potential negative effects on plasticity observed with GABAergic drugs.</p></sec><sec><title>Objectives</title><sec><title>Main Objective</title><p>This study aims to demonstrate the superiority of botulinum toxin A over baclofen on motor recovery in the subacute phase after stroke.

Because of the different modes of administration of these treatments, each group receives both an injection and oral tablets. The study therefore comprises three arms: (1) a &#x0201c;toxin&#x0201d; group treated with an injection of botulinum toxin and placebo oral baclofen; (2) a &#x0201c;baclofen&#x0201d; group treated with oral baclofen and an injection of placebo botulinum toxin; and (3) a double &#x0201c;placebo&#x0201d; group treated with placebo oral baclofen and an injection of placebo botulinum toxin.

Conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, the study requires both oral and written informed consent from participants. During the preinclusion visit, the investigating physician explains the study&#x02019;s objectives, procedures, potential risks, benefits, and patient rights. Each participant receives an information sheet and consent form, followed by a minimum 48-hour reflection period to decide on participation. An ancillary study is carried out in the main investigating center. The patient is given a different consent form for this ancillary study and is provided with comprehensive information. In line with the French Public Health Code (articles L.1121-3 and R.5121-13), confidentiality is strictly maintained. Collected data are anonymized, with patient codes generated from initials and inclusion numbers, which are linked only to the center and enrollment order.

They must admit an adequate number of patients post stroke in the subacute phase for hospitalization every year.</p><p>Participants are recruited from among the outpatients and inpatients of the physical and neurorehabilitation medicine ward. Two or more experts determine eligibility according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria.</p></sec><sec><title>Intervention</title><p>At the allocation visit (V0), the investigator administered the intramuscular injections and prescribed the tablets. The tablets were taken daily for 3 months until the second postallocation visit (V2). The dosage of tablets was then gradually decreased over 1 month and the effects were monitored during the close-out visit. All participants also received at least 2 hours of neurorehabilitation daily, 5 days per week, led by specialized therapists. This regimen included both physiotherapy and occupational therapy to support comprehensive motor recovery in accordance with the routine practices of the neurorehabilitation centers.</p><sec><title>Botulinum Toxin Injection Protocol</title><p>The choice of muscle groups to be injected depended on the investigator&#x02019;s clinical examination. The muscle group that validated the patient&#x02019;s inclusion (Tardieu&#x0003e;1) was systematically injected. Other muscle groups that met the specific criteria (Tardieu score1) were also systematically injected: the triceps surae, flexor digitorum superficialis, flexor digitorum profondus, flexor carpi radialis, flexor carpi ulnaris, and the brachialis (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Multimedia Appendix 2</xref>). The maximum total dose permitted is 500 units. Additional muscle groups were injected based on the remaining dose of toxin [<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>Injection site localization was tracked using electrostimulation sometimes combined with muscle ultrasound. Depending on the muscles injected, 1 or 2 injection points would be considered at sites with the highest density of motor endplates. The total number of injection points could range between 15 and 20. If requested by the patient, an analgesia protocol with class II analgesics (paracetamol, codeine, and hydroxyzine) was administered 2 hours prior to the procedure, along with inhalation of an equimolar mixture of oxygen and nitrous oxide (Meopa). This was the standard procedure for toxin injections in the participating centers.</p></sec><sec><title>Baclofen Intake Protocol</title><p>Baclofen was provided in a 10 mg capsule and the chosen dose was 60 mg per day in 3 doses commonly used with success in baclofen studies [<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Treatment was initiated at a dosage of 10 mg in the evening (1 capsule). The dosage was then increased by 1 tablet (10 mg) every 4 days until a dosage of 60 mg per day was reached.

Patients already on a long-term prescription (over 1 month) of sleeping or anxiolytic treatment might continue this treatment. Discontinuing these patients&#x02019; medications had more drawbacks than benefits. Zolpidem and zopiclone, commonly prescribed to patients with poststroke sleep disorders, were permitted during this trial.</p><p>Considering the prevalence of poststroke depression and its influence on functional recovery, specific antidepressants are authorized. Antidepressants in the serotonin reuptake inhibitor class were permitted.

However, randomization aimed to evenly distribute these treatments across all groups, which minimized the risk of bias.</p><p>For secondary stroke prevention, patients were administered treatment according to current recommendations (antiplatelet agents, antihypertensive agents, and cholesterol-lowering agents). Effective-dose anticoagulants (heparin and anti&#x02013;vitamin-K) were grounds for noninclusion due to the risk of muscle hematoma during injections. However, if necessary, during the protocol postinjection, effective-dose anticoagulants were prescribed without necessitating withdrawal from the study.</p><p>It is important to note that all patients received standardized functional neurorehabilitation for 2 hours daily, which included physiotherapy and occupational therapy sessions in line with current practices.</p></sec><sec><title>Prohibited Care During the Trial</title><p>Anxiolytics and other benzodiazepines were prohibited, except zolpidem or zopiclone, which may have been prescribed for the duration of the protocol.

It allows the analysis of the resistance to stretching at several different speeds. Two speeds are used: XV1 is the slowest possible stretching speed and XV3 is the fastest possible stretching speed. Two results are noted: first, the Tardieu angle, which is the difference between the angle of passive joint amplitude obtained at XV1 and the angle of the first resistance to stretching at XV3, and second, the Tardieu intensity score of the resistance to stretching measured by an ordinal score from 0 to 4.</p><p>The end point was the progression from the allocation to 1 month later (V0 to V1) and from the allocation to 3 months later (V0 to V2), focusing on muscle groups such as the triceps surae (knee flexed and extended), carpal flexors, and elbow flexors.

All groups receive standard neurorehabilitation care.</p><p>This study is a randomized parallel 2-2-1 type design, which corresponds to the &#x0201c;toxin,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;baclofen,&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;placebo&#x0201d; groups, respectively. The main objective, which is to demonstrate the superiority of &#x0201c;toxin&#x0201d; over &#x0201c;baclofen&#x0201d; on motor function, corresponds to a 2-2 comparison. The secondary objective, which is to demonstrate the noninferiority of &#x0201c;toxin&#x0201d; to &#x0201c;placebo&#x0201d; on motor function, corresponds to a 2-1 comparison. The &#x0201c;placebo&#x0201d; arm is limited due to ethical considerations.</p><p>The sample size for the &#x0201c;toxin&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;baclofen&#x0201d; arms was calculated with the 2-sided test at a 5% significance level. This analysis compared the superiority of the toxin over baclofen indicated by the FMA gain, between the allocation visit (V0) and the second postallocation visit (V2). The expected variation in FMA was estimated at 30 points between V0 and V2. [<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. For an 85% power and an FMA difference of 12 points between the &#x0201c;toxin&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;baclofen&#x0201d; groups, 120 patients per group were initially required, accounting for missing data and protocol deviations. This 12-point difference was based on the minimal clinically important difference of FMA, which was approximately 6 points for both the upper [<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and lower extremities [<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Doubling the minimal clinically important difference for a total FMA score ensured a clinically significant change.</p><p>To demonstrate equivalence between the &#x0201c;toxin&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;placebo&#x0201d; groups, a 12-point unilateral zone of equivalence was defined. With an SD of 30 points, 60 patients in the &#x0201c;placebo&#x0201d; arm yielded a power of approximately 80% (77.6%), accounting for 10% missing data.</p><p>The original target was 300 patients, but by September 30, 2018, only 140 had been included. Given the time and funding constraints, an amendment increased the target FMA difference to 13 points between V0 and V2. This adjustment, while slightly higher, remains within a clinically meaningful range and is achievable under the study&#x02019;s operational constraints. Accordingly, 85 participants were required in both the &#x0201c;toxin&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;baclofen&#x0201d; groups, factoring in a 10% data loss. The &#x0201c;placebo&#x0201d; group was reduced to 44 patients to maintain the 2-2-1 randomization ratio. A total of 214 patients were therefore needed for trial inclusion.</p></sec><sec><title>Allocation</title><p>Randomization follows a 3-arm, type 2-2-1 (&#x0201c;toxin,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;baclofen,&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;placebo&#x0201d;) design. This process is conducted by Creapharm, the manufacturer and packager of the protocol&#x02019;s therapeutic batches. Creapharm is an independent company approved by the French drug agency (ANSM). Each center receives therapeutic batches containing 5 treatment packages (2-2-1). Randomization is therefore stratified by center.</p><p>A copy of the randomization list is kept by Creapharm and the sponsor&#x02019;s pharmacy. Randomization is performed before the study starts by assigning an inclusion number in the protocol that aligns with a specific therapeutic batch number. The pharmacy in each center is responsible for accurately assigning the therapeutic batch number associated with the inclusion number. This detail is routinely verified by the principal investigator at each center.</p></sec><sec><title>Blinding</title><p>Participants, care providers, investigators, outcome assessors, the data manager, and the biostatistician are blinded to the assignment of the intervention.

Unblinding might be necessary in case of a serious, life-threatening AE. Otherwise, unblinding only occurs after the database has been finalized at the end of the research.</p><p>In this study, a 2-2-1 randomization scheme is used, resulting in 2 treatment groups and 1 placebo group with differing sample sizes. While blinding is strictly maintained for the 2 treatment groups, the smaller size of the placebo group could potentially reveal its identity during data analysis. To minimize bias and preserve blinding integrity, all data analyses will be conducted on coded datasets, with each group labeled as &#x0201c;group 1,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;group 2,&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;group 3,&#x0201d; without specifying treatment identities. This approach ensures that data handling and interpretation are unbiased until the final analysis is complete. Additionally, the randomization and allocation processes are managed independently by a third-party data manager who has no role in data collection or analysis. These measures aim to uphold objectivity and reduce any influence of group size on the interpretation of results.</p></sec><sec><title>Data Collection and Management</title><p>All personnel involved in data collection undergo training before the study begins.

Data should be recorded promptly and transcribed neatly into the logbooks. If any erroneous data are identified, it should be clearly crossed out and the correct information entered along with the initials, date, and justification by the investigator or the authorized person who made the correction. These records are maintained in paper observation logbooks with 2 copies generated. One copy is kept by the center investigator, while the second is kept by the research monitor after monitoring. Laboratory and clinical examination results are clearly entered in the clinical records, and scales, which are considered source data, are entered directly in the observation logbooks.</p><p>Data are entered on paper by the research technician at each center and electronically at the coordinating center. One copy of the observation logbook triplicate is sent to the coordinating center.

SAEs are defined as events resulting in death, life-threatening situations, hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, significant or permanent disability, or interventions to prevent such outcomes. Minor AEs are defined as medical occurrences not meeting SAE criteria but which may still relate to study procedures.

It examines the correlation between initial impairment and subsequent recovery by analyzing FMA-UE both at baseline and in follow-up sessions and defines recovery as the change over time [<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. This research suggests that, on average, a significant subset of patients typically regains approximately 70% of their maximum potential recovery from impairment, while a smaller subgroup experiences notably less recovery. For recovery to be considered proportional, patients must recover roughly 70% of their maximum possible potential at the 3-month mark [<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Patients who initially show mild to moderate deficits according to the FMA-UE (&#x0003e;10) at baseline often follow a pattern known as &#x0201c;recoverers&#x0201d; [<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].

This approach provides a comprehensive evaluation of the efficacy of botulinum toxin relative to both an active treatment of spasticity (baclofen) and an inactive comparator (placebo). If mixed outcomes are observed&#x02014;for instance, if botulinum toxin is found to be superior to baclofen but not to placebo&#x02014;we will interpret these results separately within the context of each hypothesis. This distinction ensures clarity and rigor in the interpretation of findings and supports transparent discussion of implications for spasticity management.</p></sec><sec><title>Comparison With Prior Work</title><p>Previous studies on spasticity treatments after stroke have primarily focused on their effects on muscle tone rather than motor recovery. Botulinum toxin and baclofen are well-established treatments for spasticity, but their impacts on motor recovery remain unclear [<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Most randomized controlled trials have investigated botulinum toxin in the chronic phase of stroke recovery (more than 6 months post stroke), where brain plasticity is reduced and muscle changes are often irreversible. Conversely, evidence of baclofen&#x02019;s effects on motor recovery is largely absent, despite animal studies and small human trials suggesting that activation of GABA receptors may hinder motor learning [<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. This study uniquely investigates these treatments during the subacute phase, a critical window for neuroplasticity and motor recovery. Spastic symptoms usually begin around 4 weeks post stroke [<xref rid="ref46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="ref47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The inclusion criteria of 2 months after stroke provide a balance between including a sufficient number of patients with spasticity and ensuring a sufficient period before the end of the early subacute poststroke phase (more than 3 months) when most of the recovery occurs. By incorporating a placebo group, the study addresses a significant gap in the literature by evaluating the efficacy of these treatments against an untreated baseline. A placebo group was necessary because there is no evidence demonstrating that botulinum toxin or baclofen is superior to placebo for motor recovery during the subacute phase after stroke [<xref rid="ref48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Botulinum toxin&#x02019;s effect on motor recovery compared to placebo is unlikely to show significant differences due to the small sample size and limited study power, though previous literature suggests potential central effects [<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. An ancillary magnetic resonance imaging study aims to investigate the toxin&#x02019;s impact on brain connectivity, tractography, and activation, making it the first to include both placebo and healthy comparative groups to explore its role in neuroplasticity. The &#x0201c;placebo&#x0201d; group was intentionally kept smaller due to ethical concerns among investigators, who believe it is unethical to withhold spasticity treatment despite the lack of evidence supporting its efficacy for motor recovery. Additionally, a larger placebo group would likely hinder patient recruitment and limit participation from many centers.</p></sec><sec><title>Strengths and Limitations</title><p>A major strength of this study is its design, which integrates both placebo and active comparator groups to rigorously assess the effects of botulinum toxin and baclofen on motor recovery. The inclusion of a placebo group&#x02014;despite ethical and logistical challenges&#x02014;is crucial for disentangling treatment effects from natural recovery processes. Additionally, the ancillary imaging study offers a unique opportunity to explore the central effects of these treatments on brain plasticity.</p><p>However, the study has limitations. While the adjusted sample size is sufficient to detect clinically meaningful differences, it may reduce sensitivity to smaller effects on motor recovery outcomes. Furthermore, the follow-up period of 4 months, though valuable for assessing short-term outcomes, does not capture long-term effects or delayed AEs. Extending follow-up durations in future studies could provide more comprehensive insights into sustained efficacy and safety profiles. Nevertheless, the 3-month follow-up in this study offers valuable early insights into the immediate posttreatment phase, which is a critical period for poststroke motor recovery.</p><p>Practical or operational issues arose during the course of the study, reflecting the complexity of its implementation. Securing funding from the PHRC in 2010 marked the first step, but the subsequent year-long process to obtain administrative approvals and transfer funds delayed the study&#x02019;s initiation. Ensuring blindness between baclofen tablets and their placebo required encapsulating baclofen tablets after a request to affix the manufacturer&#x02019;s logo was denied. This additional step, involving patient safety measures like verifying expiry dates, added another 2 years. Consequently, the first patient inclusion occurred in 2015. The inclusion rate was slower than anticipated, necessitating a protocol extension and recalculating the required sample size to maintain sufficient statistical power. The COVID-19 pandemic further disrupted the recruitment process in 2020, causing additional delays. Despite these challenges, the study progressed without major technical or procedural issues. Importantly, the question of whether early spasticity treatment affects motor recovery remains unresolved, underscoring the relevance of this research.</p></sec><sec><title>Future Directions</title><p>The results of this study will inform recommendations for the timing and selection of spasticity treatments after stroke. Future research should build on these findings by examining the long-term impact of these treatments on functional recovery and quality of life. Larger, multicenter trials with extended follow-up periods are needed to confirm the findings and explore delayed effects. Additionally, further investigation into the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the effects of botulinum toxin and baclofen, particularly through advanced imaging techniques, could deepen our understanding of their roles in poststroke recovery. If botulinum toxin demonstrates its potential to boost natural poststroke recovery in clinical or ancillary studies, it may be possible in a larger protocol to focus on these properties independently of spastic symptoms by including patients earlier after stroke (eg, within 2 weeks).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study addresses critical gaps in the understanding of the effects of early spasticity treatments on motor recovery during the subacute phase of stroke. Comparing botulinum toxin to both baclofen and placebo provides robust insights into the efficacy and safety of these treatments. The ancillary magnetic resonance imaging study further deepens our knowledge of the neurobiological mechanisms underlying recovery, offering the potential to guide future therapeutic strategies. Despite challenges in implementation, the study is well-positioned to advance clinical guidelines and improve outcomes for people who have had a stroke.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>This research has been supported by grants from the French Ministry of Health (PHRC-N program, PHRC 2010 18-07).
