Limited research has focused on their experiences within the Australian health system. The aim of this study was to explore the lived experiences of adults receiving care for advanced cancer.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">A qualitative design with a descriptive phenomenological approach was used to explore the lived experiences of people with advanced cancer following their diagnosis. Twenty-three people living with an advanced solid malignancy receiving care were referred by their oncologists to take part in an interview conducted at their home, the hospital, or over the phone.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">Three key themes emerged relating to participants&#x02019; experiences of living with advanced cancer: (1) living with a life-limiting diagnosis and uncertainty, (2) living with symptom burden and side effects, and (3) living within the health system, with two subthemes, the patient-clinician relationship, and care coordination. Participant relationships with their health professionals were particularly important and had a defining impact on whether patient experiences living with cancer were positive or negative.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par4">People with advanced cancer experienced broad variation in their experiences navigating the health system, and their relationships with clinicians and other health professionals were important factors affecting their perceptions of their experiences. Attention to the coordination of care for people with advanced cancer is necessary to improve their experiences and improve symptom control and the management of their psychosocial burden.</p></sec><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00520-022-07107-1.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Neoplasms, Patient-centred care</kwd><kwd>Qualitative research</kwd><kwd>Continuity of patient care</kwd><kwd>Multidisciplinary communication</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Cancer Council WA</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Curtin University</institution></funding-source></award-group><open-access><p>Open Access funding enabled and organized by CAUL and its Member Institutions</p></open-access></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2022</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par5">Whilst clinical advances allow more people to survive a cancer diagnosis, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] many cancers are detected at a later stage of the disease where treatment goals are palliative as the diagnosis is incurable. An advanced cancer diagnosis has been recognised as a risk factor for anxiety and depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], which is concerning as psychosocial morbidities may result in treatment non-adherence, poorer quality of life, longer inpatient episodes, and negative impacts on family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Providing optimal care is essential to ensure patients with life-limiting diagnoses are able to experience optimal quality of life.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Living with advanced cancer</title><p id="Par6">Systematic reviews in this area have identified that living with advanced cancer is a complex process, affected by an individual&#x02019;s support network, personal coping strategies, and attitudes towards their diagnosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Garcia-Rueda et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] found that &#x02018;health context&#x02019; was another prominent theme, which encompasses the &#x02018;hospitalisation experience&#x02019; and their &#x02018;experience of healthcare access&#x02019;.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>The health context</title><p id="Par7">Garcia-Rueda et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] found that patient-clinician relationships are important elements of patient experiences within the health system. These could be targeted to improve patient quality of life by providing personalised care that acknowledges the unique challenges faced by people with life-limiting illnesses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. These findings have subsequently been built upon by an increase in qualitative research that explores patient perceptions of early palliative care interventions, seeking to address psychosocial distress people with advanced cancer may experience [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. These studies have been undertaken predominantly in the USA and in European settings, and consistently identify coordination of care to be an issue in health systems where patient care involves multiple services.</p><p id="Par8">Few qualitative studies have explored the lived experiences of Australians with advanced cancer. In 2018, Chambers et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] found that the experiences of men living with advanced prostate cancer were mediated by their life course and social and health context, and identified a need for holistic approaches to care to address issues related to patient-clinician communication and care coordination. An understanding of patient experiences navigating the health system provides a foundation for understanding how existing resources are meeting patient needs, and identifying areas for improvement.</p><p id="Par9">To our knowledge, there have been no studies examining the experiences of people living with advanced cancer in Western Australia. The health context for cancer care in Western Australia is presented in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. Understanding the role the health system plays in the experiences of people with advanced cancer is essential to identify and address priority issues. This study aimed to explore the lived experiences of people with advanced cancer, focussing on their interactions with the health system and health professionals.

Participants who gave verbal consent to be contacted were followed up by a researcher, who obtained written informed consent and arranged an audio-recorded interview. People receiving care for a haematological malignancy or those with cognitive impairment, defined as a score less than 7 on the Abbreviated Mental Test, were ineligible. The researcher administered the Abbreviated Mental Test before the interview. Haematological malignancies were excluded because treatment and disease progression are different from solid tumour malignancies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. A purposive sampling strategy was used (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>), and recruitment occurred until inductive thematic saturation was reached across the data.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], defined as when no new themes arose within the interviews.

We found that our key themes of living with advanced cancer and living with symptom burden fit into Arantzamendi et al.&#x02019;s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] framework for living well with the awareness of dying. This framework describes living with advanced cancer as an iterative process comprising five phases&#x02014;struggling, accepting, living with advanced cancer, sharing the illness experience, and reconstructing life&#x02014;all of which revolve around the central concept of awareness of dying. Our key themes of living with advanced cancer and uncertainty, and living with symptom burden and side effects, reflect these phases and people&#x02019;s complex and unique experiences. Our participants&#x02019; discussion about their symptom burden in the context of this framework illustrates their pervasive awareness of dying and highlights the important role symptom control plays in patient experiences. The role of formal and informal support in participant experiences has been discussed elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p id="Par57">Our results from a heterogenous group of Western Australians living with advanced cancer were similar to those reported by Chambers et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], who examined the experiences of Australian men diagnosed with prostate cancer, with regard to communication and care coordination. These commonalities suggest that the issues patients face navigating the health system may not be diagnosis- or stage-specific. The varied experiences of navigating care indicate an urgent need for additional support and resources at the patient, health professional, and system level.</p><p id="Par58">Participant interactions with their health professionals emphasise the importance of shifting from approaching care using the disease-based biomedical model to patient-centred care. Patient-centred care has been defined as care that is &#x0201c;respectful of and responsive to individual patient preferences, needs, and values and [ensures] that patient values guide all clinical decisions&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. It has been recognised that good communication between patients and health professionals is an essential component for eliciting patient values to guide patient-centred care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. We found that participants appreciated clear communication with and between their health professionals, and their experiences demonstrate the significant impact patient-clinician communication had on their perceptions of their care.</p><p id="Par59">Patient-clinician relationships in which clinicians proactively referred patients or had time to speak to them about their diagnosis/treatment had a positive impact on participants&#x02019; psychosocial wellbeing. Instances in which patients felt no health professionals were taking responsibility for their cancer care or where clinicians did not have time to discuss their diagnosis and treatment regimen were distressing and compounded the negative emotions the patients were already experiencing due to their terminal illness. Poor patient-clinician relationships have been associated with demoralisation in advanced cancer patient populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], and greater out-of-pocket expenses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Reasons for a breakdown in communication may include patient-related factors such as health literacy; clinician-related factors such as inter-professional communication issues; and system-related issues, such as lack of time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) have been recognised as a means to encourage patient-clinician discussion of their symptoms and care, and improve patient-clinician communication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. In Australia, The Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care is currently working to support the implementation and evaluation of PROMs. System-wide implementation of a PROMs&#x02019; program within Australia suggests that the program is feasible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]; however, barriers include the impact on clinical workflow, time for completion inadequate resources, and outcome follow-up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Further research into the implementation and efficacy of PROMs&#x02019; programs is necessary to determine if they can bridge gaps in patient-clinician communication.</p><p id="Par60">Participant reports of limited time with clinicians to satisfy their information needs and an inability to access allied health professionals are indicators that staffing and care coordination within the health system need to be assessed. Given that Western Australia has a Cancer Nurse Coordinator Service available to all residents navigating cancer care, ensuring they are adequately resourced is necessary. Previous studies have confirmed the positive impact of nurse-led support programs on cancer care e.g., improved quality of life and reduced hospital readmission rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Internationally, a systematic review of current literature exploring health professionals&#x02019; perceptions of care coordination recommended that health systems needed to (1) develop and provide better educational materials and guidelines for health professionals involved in care coordination, (2) ensure health services have adequate staff, administrative support, technology, and resources to coordinate care, and (3) conduct research to examine current care coordination practices to develop and test tools to help develop shared care plans for patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Adequate resources for health services are essential for clinicians and staff to be supported to provide well-coordinated care. The recommendations resulting from this study are outlined in Table <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>. Further research is necessary to quantify how health services are currently meeting the needs of people with advanced cancer, to ensure existing services are adequately resourced, and to inform future service-level interventions to improve patient care coordination.

Whilst data saturation was achieved, recruitment involved clinician referral resulting in <xref rid="Sec6" ref-type="sec">recruitment</xref> bias. However, due to the wide variation in participant experiences, this bias appears to be minimal. Whilst most participants noted the significant impact of their diagnosis on their carers, the carers were not interviewed as part of this study. Further research examining the experiences of carers and their support needs is necessary. Finally, we note that there was limited discussion of spirituality and its impact on patient experiences. There was only one question in the interview guide asking participants about the role of spiritual support. Given the prominence of spirituality in the experiences of people with advanced cancer in other research, this could be explored further in future research.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par62">Participant experiences living with advanced cancer are characterised by three key themes: (1) living with a life-limiting diagnosis and uncertainty, (2) living with symptom burden and side effects, and (3) living within the health system. The important role the patient-health professional relationships played in the experiences of people with advanced cancer highlights the value of patient-centred care to support patients with a life-limiting cancer diagnosis. Further attention to the coordination of care for people with advanced cancer is necessary to improve their experiences and the management of their psychosocial burden.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.<supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM1"><media xlink:href="520_2022_7107_MOESM1_ESM.pdf"><label>Supplementary file1</label><caption><p>(PDF 464 kb)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#x02019;s note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Change history</bold></p><p>5/23/2025</p><p>The missing supplementary material has been included.
