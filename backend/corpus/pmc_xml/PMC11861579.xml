It affects 2.5% of children and 5% of adults. Diagnosis is clinical.

Because of its pervasiveness, ADHD can interfere negatively with general well-being, as well as with social life, academic performance and the development of social skills, which can lead to low self-esteem.</p><p>ADHD has multiple etiologies. It is thought to be due to a complex interaction between genes and environment. In fact, genetic vulnerability predisposes to the disorder which, under the influence of an unfavorable environment, expresses itself in clinical symptoms represented by 2 dimensions: inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity.</p><p>Diagnosis is essentially clinical, and treatment is based on medication combined with psychosocial interventions.</p></sec><sec id="sec4754"><title>Conclusions</title><p>ADHD is one of the most frequently encountered disorders in general practice, pediatrics and child psychiatry. Early recognition of the disorder enables appropriate management, while limiting the impact of the disease on the functioning of the young person and his or her family.</p></sec><sec id="sec4755"><title>Disclosure of Interest</title><p>None Declared</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="1"/></counts></article-meta></front></article>
