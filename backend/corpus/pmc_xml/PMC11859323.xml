However, postictal psychosis appears to be much less common, with a prevalence of 2% in epilepsy. Postictal psychosis is defined as psychotic episodes starting within less than one week after an epileptic seizure.</p></sec><sec id="sec5215"><title>Objectives</title><p>Our aim was to study the clinical characteristics and the therapeutic options through a case report and a review of the literature.</p></sec><sec id="sec5216"><title>Methods</title><p>Case report and unsystematic literature review were obtained by searching the Pubmed.gov database. Thirty-six articles were identified through searches of this database and thirty-five articles were included in the selection of in-text articles integral</p></sec><sec id="sec5217"><title>Results</title><p>A 32-year-old men patient, without a personal or family history of psychiatric illness, was admitted to a psychiatric unit for a psychotic episode which has started three days before, mystical delusions, irritability, disorganized behavior, and aggressiveness, that had emerged shortly after a cluster of generalized tonic-clonic GTC seizures. Additionally, divided attention and memory deficits were noticed during psychiatric hospitalization.</p><p>Past medical history was relevant for epilepsy since he was 20 years olds. He did not regularly attend follow-up neurology appointments and had poor adherence to antiepileptic treatment. Last tomography images, a day before the hospitalization in psychiatry, had documented hypodense lesions in the periventricular white matter and subcortical semi-oval center distributed bilaterally and symmetrically suggestive of leukopathy. During the hospitalization, biochemical screening, renal and thyroid function were normal, serologies for B and C hepatitis were negative.</p><p>Psychotic symptoms subsided in the first 36 hours after admission upon treatment with Risperidone 4 mg/day, carbamazepine 600&#x000a0;mg/day, and 15O mg phenobarbital.</p></sec><sec id="sec5218"><title>Conclusions</title><p>From our research, we can deduce that although these syndromes are widely recognized, standard diagnostic manuals fail to acknowledge them, resulting in a noticeable lack of attention in the literature. Therefore, it is crucial for physicians to carefully examine patients with known risk factors for the symptoms of postictal psychosis.</p></sec><sec id="sec5219"><title>Disclosure of Interest</title><p>None Declared</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="1"/></counts></article-meta></front></article>
