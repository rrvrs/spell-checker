One of several strategies proposed by leaders in chiropractic to support the advancement of the profession in North America is to increase opportunities for interprofessional collaboration. One area where chiropractic has achieved some degree of integration in Canada is in the field of sports medicine. A result of the increased integration of chiropractic in the field of sports medicine has been more opportunity for interprofessional collaboration, development of interprofessional relationships and increased exposure to chiropractic. The attitudes of Canadian sport and exercise medicine physicians (CSPs) towards chiropractic are unknown. The purpose of this study is to determine the attitudes and their contributing factors of CSPs toward chiropractic and its use for treatment of athletes and/or Canadians who are participating in sports or exercise (ACSE).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">An invitation to complete the survey was included in a newsletter emailed to active physician members of CASEM (Canadian Academy of Sports and Exercise Medicine) in March and April 2023 and attendees of their symposium. The survey included the Chiropractic Attitude Questionnaire (CAQ), which allowed respondents to indicate their attitudes towards chiropractic care for ACSE using a 5-point Likert scale. The responses to the CAQ were the primary outcome measure. Descriptive statistics, including mean, median, standard deviation, maximum, minimum and range, regression analysis, t-tests, and ANOVAs were used to analyse the data.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">Seventy CSPs completed the survey (response rate: 11%). The summed CAQ scores ranged from 0 to 68 with a mean of 39.03 and a standard deviation of 15.30. CSPs who worked with a chiropractor in a multidisciplinary setting hold a more positive opinion of chiropractic. An independent samples t-test indicated that there was a significant difference between CAQ scores for those with experience of working with a chiropractor (M&#x02009;=&#x02009;42.03, SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;14.99) and those without (M&#x02009;=&#x02009;29.41, SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;13.10); t(58)&#x02009;=&#x02009;3.27, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">CSPs attitudes toward chiropractic and its use for treatment of ACSE range from very positive to extremely negative.

In Canada there is some evidence of progress in this regard with the inclusion of chiropractors in some Family Health Teams, working as Advanced Practice Practitioners screening patients for spine surgeons and the integration of chiropractic into some private sector medical facilities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Sports medicine is one field where, in Canada, chiropractors have achieved some level of integration. In the pursuit of excellence in athletic performance, sports medicine has evolved to embrace an interdisciplinary model of care commonly referred to in Canada as an Integrated Support Team (IST) that often includes a chiropractor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Interviews of stakeholders on sports medicine healthcare teams has suggested chiropractors&#x02019; inclusion was a manifestation of &#x02018;consumer-focused practice&#x02019; and that &#x02018;the athlete&#x02019;s wanted them&#x02019; not necessarily that the profession had been accepted by other healthcare professionals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Nonetheless, chiropractors have continued to integrate into the field of sports medicine. In 2010, at the Winter Olympics in Vancouver, chiropractic was included for the first time as an equal partner in the delivery of healthcare to all participants. It is now very common in Canada, particularly in urban centres, for private multidisciplinary clinics marketing themselves as &#x0201c;sports medicine&#x0201d; to include a chiropractor. The sports and exercise medicine residency programme at the University of Toronto has included a clinical placement with a chiropractor for its residents since 2014. At the 2023 Pan American Games in Chile, the Canadian Medical Services Team included 53 health care providers, of which five were chiropractors. In Canada, the sports medicine landscape has allowed for various opportunities for chiropractors to collaborate with Canadian sport and exercise medicine physicians (CSPs). Understanding how CSPs view chiropractic may provide information to examine the impact of improved integration, opportunities to enhance interprofessional collaboration and ultimately improve patient care. This study aims to evaluate the attitudes (hypothesis 1), and their contributing factors (hypotheses 2&#x02013;4), of CSPs towards chiropractic.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par6">We adapted a questionnaire previously used to evaluate attitudes and beliefs of orthopedic surgeons towards chiropractic for our study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Specific modifications include more details pertaining to medical training and practice experience resulting in a 49-item questionnaire that examined the attitudes of CSPs towards chiropractic care of athletes and/or Canadians who participate in sports or exercise (ACSE) (Appendix-A). The questionnaire included a 20-item section, the Chiropractic Attitude Questionnaire (CAQ), which captured respondent&#x02019;s attitudes towards chiropractic. The remaining 29 items related to demographics and other professional characteristics and activities. The clinimetric properties of the CAQ were established in previous studies as part of its original development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].

We approached CASEM and they agreed to include an invitation to participate in our survey in their monthly newsletter. The invitation included a link to the online survey where participants were presented with a disclosure letter and the questionnaire. We used Survey Monkey to facilitate online completion of the questionnaire. The study disclosure letter notified potential participants of the purpose of the study, what their involvement would entail, and the risks and benefits of partaking in the study, as well as a disclaimer notifying them that they were not obligated to participate. If a potential participant agreed to the terms of the study they indicated as such by clicking on an &#x0201c;I agree&#x0201d; button that linked them to the survey. Only actively practicing CSPs were asked to complete the survey.</p><p id="Par10">CASEM included the invitation to participate in our study in their electronic newsletter twice. It was sent to all 1045 CASEM members in March and April of 2023. At that time their membership included 638 active CSPs, which was our target population. CASEM provided us with some analytics from the Mail Chimp online distribution platform showing that in March and April, 289 and 280 recipients of the email clicked on the link to the newsletter that contained our invitation.</p><p id="Par11">CASEM also agreed to include a card with a QR code linking to our survey in the lanyards for the 381 CSPs who attended the 2023 CASEM symposium in Banff, Alberta. The survey was available to potential respondents for three months.</p><p id="Par12">There was no identifying information to link the respondent to a specific questionnaire and due to the nature of the software respondents were only able to complete the questionnaire once. Because Survey Monkey takes the IP addresses of respondents a research assistant stripped that information from the completed surveys prior to the research team reviewing the data. Respondents were asked if they were interested in the survey results and were prompted to provide their email address so that a summary of the study could be distributed to them upon completion of the study.</p><p id="Par13">There was no compensation for participating in the study however respondents were asked if they would like to submit their email address to be included in a random draw for one of five $50 gift cards. A research assistant removed the email addresses from the surveys of those that submitted for the random draw and after the data collection period was completed a randomization software programme was used to identify five email addresses to award a gift card.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Outcome measures</title><p id="Par14">The primary outcome measure for this study was the CSP&#x02019;s attitudes towards chiropractic and its use for treatment of ACSE as determined by the total score on the CAQ.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Analysis</title><p id="Par15">Each of the 20 questions comprising the CAQ was graded on a 5-point Likert scale, from 0 to 4. The responses were then summed to arrive at a total score ranging from 0 (most negative attitude towards chiropractic) to 80 (most positive attitude towards chiropractic).

We conducted an inspection of the CAQ scores including mean, median, standard deviation, maximum, minimum and range. We also carried out a regression analysis to explore the factors influencing attitudes towards chiropractic. A generalized linear model was employed, with the aggregate CAQ score serving as the dependent variable. Selection of the influencing factors was based on previous studies in this area [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and CSP demographics. All independent variables were nominal except for &#x02018;number of patients referred for chiropractic care in a typical year,&#x02019; which was ordinal (ranked groups from &#x02018;0&#x02019; to &#x02018;50&#x02009;+&#x02009;&#x02019;). Comparisons were all two-tailed, and variables were deemed statistically significant if the p-value was less than 0.05 in the final multivariable model. The unstandardized regression coefficient and its 95% confidence interval (CI) are reported, where the unstandardized regression coefficient indicates the change in the CAQ response score. Multicollinearity was deemed problematic if the variance inflation factor for any independent variable exceeded 5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] however this was not the case for any of the variables.

First, we combined all responses that confirmed previous work experience with a chiropractor in any of the specific scenarios detailed above and applied a t-test to investigate the relationship between previous experience working with a chiropractor (group/independent variable) and the CAQ score (test/dependent variable).

Our results provide evidence that previous recommendations to increase opportunities for medical doctors and chiropractors to interact can improve relations as CSPs who reported to have worked with a chiropractor in various sports medicine settings, including exposure to chiropractic during their sports and exercise medicine training, have more positive attitudes than those who have not.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7369" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.</p><p>
