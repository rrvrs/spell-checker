It is most often associated with pregnancy in the postpartum period and has a higher incidence in primiparous patients. Its presentation includes headaches, altered consciousness, seizures, visual disturbances, and specific radiological signs, particularly vasogenic edema of the subcortical white matter, primarily located in the posterior cerebral hemispheres. While PRES in obstetrics is most commonly associated with preeclampsia or, more frequently, eclampsia, we report a case occurring in a normotensive patient. Our case involves a primiparous patient in the postpartum period who presented with a wide range of severe neurological symptoms, including transient cortical blindness and severe memory loss correlated to lesions in atypical regions, such as the temporal lobes and bilateral hippocampi and thalami. The distribution of lesions, the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) MRI mapping allowed a differentiation of PRES from early cerebral ischemia, thus playing an essential role in management. This case highlights the need to consider PRES in postpartum patients with significant neurological symptoms, regardless of blood pressure or proteinuria status. Early recognition and diagnosis are essential for optimal outcomes, given the reversible nature of the syndrome with timely intervention.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>brain capillary leak syndrome</kwd><kwd>diffusion-weighted image (dwi)</kwd><kwd>neurologic disorder</kwd><kwd>posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (pres)</kwd><kwd>postpartum preeclampsia</kwd><kwd>preeclampsia-eclampsia</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) was first described in 1996 by Hinchey et al. [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. It is characterized by (sub)acute neurological symptoms such as headaches, altered consciousness, visual disturbances (ranging from blurred vision to hemianopia or even cortical blindness), seizures, and vasogenic edema mainly localized in the parieto-occipital lobes [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].&#x000a0;</p><p>This syndrome has been described in association with several pathologies, the most common being hypertensive encephalopathy, eclampsia and immunosuppressive and cytotoxic therapies, which is the most frequent etiology.&#x000a0;Although its prevalence is unknown, PRES affects individuals of all ages, mostly women. Its incidence in eclampsia reaches 22.5% in some series [<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].&#x000a0;Hypertension is reported in the majority of cases, although blood pressure may be normal or only slightly elevated in 20 to 30% of cases [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The physiopathology in normotensive patients is still poorly understood.</p><p>However, this clinical presentation is not specific to PRES and can be observed in other medical conditions, such as reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS), hypertensive encephalopathy, cerebral venous thrombosis, cerebrovascular syndrome, particularly the top-of-the-basilar syndrome with bilateral posterior infarction, acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis (commonly postinfectious or postvaccinial),&#x000a0;toxic or metabolic encephalopathy, infectious encephalitis, paraneoplastic or autoimmune encephalitis, and vasculitis [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].&#x000a0;Therefore, neuroimaging, especially diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and fluid-attenuated inversion-recovery (FLAIR) MRI mapping, is essential for the diagnosis and management of PRES.&#x000a0;Appropriate management is associated with limited neurological morbidity and, in most&#x000a0;cases, complete clinical recovery.</p><p>This case illustrates an atypical presentation of PRES in a normotensive patient during the puerperal period, marked by extensive brain lesions, including the unusual involvement of both temporal lobes, as well as bilateral hippocampal and left thalamic involvement associated with severe memory impairment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="cases"><title>Case presentation</title><p>A 34-year-old primiparous woman, at 38 weeks and two days pregnant, with no previous medical history and treated with Ursochol for gestational cholestasis, was admitted to the gynecology department for labor induction due to acute thrombocytopenia and persistent liver test disturbances (Table <xref rid="TAB1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).

She was weaned off the ventilator, and vasopressors were discontinued.</p><p>Forty-eight hours after the delivery,&#x000a0;the patient experienced a brief loss of consciousness (two to three minutes) associated with generalized tonic movements and ocular revulsion without any clonic movements. Her vital signs remained normal.&#x000a0;Upon awakening, she was amnesic of the late events (visit of her husband and baby 30 minutes before) and complained of holo-cranial headache, nausea, and asthenia.&#x000a0;Neurological examination showed no signs of meningeal irritation or sensory-motor lateralization. Her vision was normal, pupils were isochoric and reactive, and the cranial nerve examination was normal (in particular, no facial paralysis or oculomotor&#x000a0;disorder). Muscle tone was diminished but symmetrical in both the upper and lower limbs.&#x000a0;The plantar cutaneous reflexes were normal, and the deep tendon reflexes were brisk but symmetrical.

It is also referred as brain capillary leak syndrome or hyperperfusion encephalopathy due to its heterogeneous nature. The pathogenesis is incompletely understood, but it is believed to result from endothelial dysfunction and impaired cerebral autoregulation [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>Endothelial dysfunction has been linked to PRES associated with preeclampsia or cytotoxic therapies [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>In preeclampsia, the secretion of cytotoxic trophoblastic factors may provide the initial stimulus. Biomarkers indicating endothelial damage such as lactate dehydrogenase, abnormal red blood cells and more specific ones including fibronectin, tissue plasminogen activator, thrombomodulin, endothelin-1, and, in particular, von Willebrand factor can be detected before symptoms emerge.&#x000a0;The severity of cerebral edema in PRES seems to correlate more strongly with these markers than with fluctuations in blood pressure [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].&#x000a0;The syndrome frequently manifests during the&#x000a0;postpartum period (55% of cases) rather than during pregnancy and has a higher incidence in primiparous patients (81% of cases) [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].&#x000a0;Some studies suggest that PRES might serve as a neurological indicator of eclampsia, even in the absence of traditional signs like hypertension or proteinuria. Additionally, blood pressure levels in preeclamptic or eclamptic patients with PRES are generally lower than those observed in patients who develop the syndrome due to other causes&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].&#x000a0;</p><p>Few cases of PRES occurring in pregnant women without hypertension, preeclampsia or eclampsia, as observed in our patient, have been reported. However, the&#x000a0;pathophysiology remains poorly understood. Proposed mechanisms include immune system alterations, placental abnormalities, hormonal fluctuations, oxidative stress, dietary factors, and genetic susceptibility, among others [<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].&#x000a0;Further studies are needed to elucidate the pathophysiology of pregnancy-related PRES. Additionally, patients with predisposing risk factors such as intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, known to be associated with a higher risk of preeclampsia, should be closely monitored.</p><p>In PRES associated with cytotoxic therapies, endothelial damage leads to capillary leakage and disruption of the blood-brain barrier, ultimately resulting in vasogenic edema. The syndrome can develop even in patients with normal blood pressure and at&#x000a0;non-toxic doses. Among the various cytotoxic agents, cyclosporine is one of the most frequently associated with PRES neurological deficits.&#x000a0;The same mechanism is observed in PRES associated with chronic renal disease, lupus nephritis and hemolytic uremic syndrome [<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>On the other hand, cerebral autoregulation impairment in acute or severe hypertension leads to cerebral hyperperfusion. This results in the&#x000a0;disruption of the blood-brain barrier and leakage of intravascular fluid into the parenchyma, causing cerebral oedema. In this case, both the rate of blood pressure elevation and the level of hypertension are significant factors [<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].&#x000a0;Perivascular adrenergic innervation plays a role in autoregulation and is more prominent in the anterior circulation, explaining the preferential involvement of posterior cerebral regions [<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].&#x000a0;Although hypertension is common (75% of cases), PRES has also been observed in patients with normal blood pressure [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], such as children who have a more limited range of cerebral autoregulation, and their blood pressure at onset is&#x000a0;lower than in adults&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>The most common clinical symptoms include headaches, altered consciousness, visual disturbances and an epileptic seizure, which is often the first symptom. Only a minority of patients, mostly paucisymptomatic, are seizure-free. Osteotendinous reflexes may be sharp, and Babinski's sign is often present. Some patients can&#x000a0;exhibit weakness in the limbs and coordination disorders. Other focal neurological deficits are rare [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Neuroradiological abnormalities may be visible on non-contrast cerebral Computed Tomography but are best illustrated by MRI angiography.&#x000a0;Vasogenic edema in both subcortical and cortical areas is characteristic of PRES and typically&#x000a0;appears hypo- or iso-intense on DWI and hyperintense on ADC maps. FLAIR sequences enhance detection sensitivity, highlighting vasogenic edema as a hyperintense signal on the corresponding map. Although the parietal and occipital lobes are the most commonly involved (98%), lesions can be widespread. In a study involving&#x000a0;136 patients conducted by Bartynski and Boardman, other locations were reported, including the frontal lobe with preferential involvement of the superior frontal gyrus (68%, usually with lesions also detected in the posterior lobes). Lesions of the temporal lobes, which are less common, were observed in 40% of patients. The cerebellum (30%) and brainstem (30%) were also affected. Involvement of basal ganglia (13%) and splenium corpus callosum (10%) was described in a minority of patients [<xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>DWI helps differentiate PRES from early cerebral ischemia. In PRES, vasogenic edema is predominant. However, restricted diffusion, illustrated by hyperintensity on DWI and hypointensity on ADC, indicates cytotoxic edema. This lesion observed in approximately 11% to 26% of cases can be reversible or progress to ischemic injury [<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], which in our case was limited to the left inferior temporal gyrus.&#x000a0;In a series of 36 patients with PRES syndrome and cytotoxic edema reported by Wagih et al., lesions were completely reversible in 32 patients (88.9%), while only four patients (11.1%) progressed to infarction. The transition from&#x000a0;cytotoxic edema to infarction is a poorly understood process that remains challenging to predict with imaging&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>The originality of this case report stems from its wide clinical presentation, marked by persistent memory impairment, a much larger extent of the lesions than the parieto-occipital distribution usually described, with involvement of both temporal lobes along with&#x000a0;the presence of cytotoxic edema associated with vasogenic edema. The involvement of both hippocampi&#x000a0;(see Figure <xref rid="FIG2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>) explains the amnesia exhibited by our patient, similar to what is observed in hippocampal infarctions. The vascularization of the hippocampi is complex and is supplied by collateral branches of the anterior choroidal artery and the posterior cerebral artery, which is&#x000a0;classically involved in PRES syndrome [<xref rid="REF15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].&#x000a0;Moreover, the involvement of the left thalamus, whose vascularization depends on the posterior circulation, also contributes to memory impairment through damage to the mammillothalamic tract (the Vicq d&#x02019;Azyr circuit, which connects the hippocampus to the thalamus via the mammillary body) [<xref rid="REF16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Furthermore, given the extensive cerebral parenchymal involvement, the possibility of an additional diaschisis process cannot be ruled out. These specific lesions are rarely documented in previous studies, highlighting the exceptional nature of this case.</p><p>Other medical conditions have been associated with PRES, either due to medications administered for their management or their impact on blood pressure, particularly autoimmune diseases. Sickle cell disease, sepsis, immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive therapies, mainly cyclosporine, are examples of conditions or medications associated with PRES [<xref rid="REF17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>Most reviews indicate that PRES is generally reversible, with improvement occurring within days to weeks after addressing the underlying cause and managing blood pressure [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Radiological improvement is slower than clinical recovery.</p><p>Treatment depends on associated medical conditions and remains symptomatic.&#x000a0;In cases of PRES associated with pregnancy, management should also address severe pre-eclampsia. Several studies have shown that PRES associated with eclampsia has a better prognosis compared to other medical conditions [<xref rid="REF18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>Recurrence of epileptic seizures appears to be rare. In a case series of 127 patients with a recent history of PRES, seizures occurred in eight patients over a median period of 3.2 years. When seizures recur following&#x000a0;recovery from&#x000a0;PRES, it is appropriate to continue&#x000a0;or start antiepileptic treatment&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>Extensive vasogenic edema, cerebral ischemia, and intracerebral hemorrhage, described in around 20% of patients, are associated with a poor neurological prognosis [<xref rid="REF20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and may lead to death.&#x000a0;In the majority of follow-up investigations, the lesions either diminish significantly or completely heal, pointing towards edema instead of infarction.&#x000a0;The recurrence of PRES is rare (&#x0003c;10%) despite the recurrence of contributing factors in these patients [<xref rid="REF18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This case report emphasizes the importance of investigating PRES during the postpartum period when neurological symptoms are prominent despite the absence of hypertension and proteinuria. Early magnetic resonance imaging, especially DWI, is a valuable tool for prompt diagnosis and appropriate management. The long-term prognosis is often favorable, as demonstrated by our patient, who has experienced significant memory recovery after two months, with a maintained quality of life, indicating the likelihood of complete resolution.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group content-type="conflict"><title>Disclosures</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Human subjects:</bold> Consent for treatment and open access publication was obtained or waived by all participants in this study.</p><p><bold>Conflicts of interest:</bold> In compliance with the ICMJE uniform disclosure form, all authors declare the following:</p><p><bold>Payment/services info:</bold> All authors have declared that no financial support was received from any organization for the submitted work.</p><p><bold>Financial relationships:</bold> All authors have declared that they have no financial relationships at present or within the previous three years with any organizations that might have an interest in the submitted work.</p><p><bold>Other relationships:</bold> All authors have declared that there are no other relationships or activities that could appear to have influenced the submitted work.</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="other"><title>Author Contributions</title><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Concept and design:</bold>&#x000a0; Auriane Leslie Kouam Djembi, Valery Bogne Kamdem</p><p><bold>Acquisition, analysis, or interpretation of data:</bold>&#x000a0; Auriane Leslie Kouam Djembi, Marie-Anne Labaisse, Thibault Warlop, Valery Bogne Kamdem</p><p><bold>Drafting of the manuscript:</bold>&#x000a0; Auriane Leslie Kouam Djembi, Valery Bogne Kamdem</p><p><bold>Critical review of the manuscript for important intellectual content:</bold>&#x000a0; Auriane Leslie Kouam Djembi, Marie-Anne Labaisse, Thibault Warlop, Valery Bogne Kamdem</p><p><bold>Supervision:</bold>&#x000a0; Valery Bogne Kamdem</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="REF1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><article-title>A reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome</article-title><source>N Engl J Med</source><person-group>
