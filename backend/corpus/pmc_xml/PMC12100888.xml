Th2 cells release cytokines such as interleukin (IL)&#x02212;4, IL-5, and IL-13, which drive eosinophilic inflammation and play a central role in asthma pathophysiology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Current asthma treatments primarily focus on suppressing Th2-mediated inflammation but often face limitations, including drug resistance and inadequate symptom control, especially in severe cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. A critical drawback of these treatments is their limited impact on upstream processes of Th2 immune responses, particularly the differentiation and activation of dendritic cells (DCs), which are essential for antigen presentation.</p><p id="Par19">DCs, particularly CD11b<sup>+</sup> DCs, are pivotal in initiating and propagating Th2-mediated immune responses during allergic inflammation. These cells capture allergens and present them to T cells while producing key cytokines that drive the differentiation of na&#x000ef;ve T cells into Th2 cells, thereby exacerbating airway inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) also significantly contribute to shaping the immune environment of the airways by responding to epithelial cell-derived alarmins such as IL-25, IL-33, and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Activated ILC2s produce cytokines that further stimulate CD11b<sup>+</sup> DCs, leading to an amplification of Th2 airway inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Therefore, targeting the interaction of CD11b<sup>+</sup> DCs and ILC2s, as well as their associated cytokines, represents a promising therapeutic strategy for asthma management.</p><p id="Par20">Acupuncture, a non-invasive neural stimulation technique, has gained attention for its immunomodulatory properties presenting and potential therapeutic benefits in managing inflammatory conditions such as asthma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Among the acupoints commonly used for asthma treatment, <italic>Dazhui</italic> (GV14), <italic>Fengmen</italic> (BL12), and <italic>Feishu</italic> (BL13) have been prioritized due to their demonstrated effectiveness in improving respiratory function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Clinical evidence and experimental studies indicate that acupuncture at these acupoints alleviates allergic asthma symptoms by modulating the Th2 inflammatory response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. However, the mechanisms by which acupuncture regulates lung DC and ILC2 functions in allergic asthma remain incompletely understood.</p><p id="Par21">This study investigates the role of acupuncture in modulating CD11b&#x0207a; DC populations and functions in allergic asthma, hypothesizing that acupuncture attenuates Th2 airway inflammation by limiting CD11b&#x0207a; DC-mediated immune activation and subsequent Th2 cell recruitment. Additionally, the study explores whether acupuncture indirectly influences CD11b&#x0207a; DCs by regulating ILC2 activity. The findings are expected to provide mechanistic insights into acupuncture&#x02019;s immunomodulatory effects in asthma, supporting the development of novel therapeutic approaches for airway diseases.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Mice</title><p id="Par22">Female BALB/c mice (6&#x02013;8 weeks old) were purchased from Beijing Vital River Laboratory Animal Technologies Co., Ltd and randomly assigned to four groups: normal control (NC), asthma model (AS), asthma model with acupuncture treatment (AA), and normal control with acupuncture treatment&#x000a0;(NA).

Acupuncture, by stimulating specific acupoints, aims to restore <italic>Qi</italic> flow and balance bodily energy, enhancing respiratory function. Both the World Health Organization and the National Institutes of Health recognize acupuncture as an effective treatment for asthma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Recent meta-analyses support this, reporting that acupuncture improves quality of life, lung function (FEV1%), symptom scores, and Asthma Control Test scores, while reducing exacerbation frequency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Our analysis of numerous clinical controlled trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], along with our previous clinical and experimental studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], consistently demonstrated that the acupoints GV14, BL12, and BL13 produce significant therapeutic effects in asthma. Thus, these acupoints were selected for this study.</p><p id="Par59">Our results show that acupuncture at GV14, BL12, and BL13 significantly improves lung function in an HDM-induced asthma model by reducing R<sub>L</sub>, enhancing C<sub>dyn</sub>, and decreasing immune cell infiltration in BALF, including lymphocytes, macrophages, and eosinophils. Histological analysis reveals reduced airway inflammation and mucus hypersecretion. Acupuncture also mitigates Th2 airway inflammation by lowering Th2 cytokine levels and reducing the proportion of Th2 cells in lungs and MLN cultures. Consistent with prior findings, it decreases serum IgE, activated T cells, eosinophils, and Th17 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Together, our findings underscore the therapeutic potential of acupuncture at GV14, BL12, and BL13 in asthma treatment, particularly by modulating immune responses and alleviating Th2-driven airway inflammation.</p><p id="Par60">To assess potential non-specific effects of acupuncture on physiology and immunity, we included a non-asthmatic acupuncture (NA) group in our study. Compared to normal controls (NC), acupuncture in healthy mice did not significantly alter airway resistance, immune cell infiltration, or cytokine levels. Additionally, histological examination revealed no evidence of tissue damage or inflammation, indicating that acupuncture does not disrupt immune homeostasis under non-asthmatic conditions. This contrasting response highlights both the specific regulatory mechanisms of acupuncture in asthma and its inherent safety in a balanced physiological state.</p><p id="Par61">Acupuncture serum, collected from treated animals, contains bioactive factors and signaling molecules influenced by acupuncture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], and serves as a model to study its systemic effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. In this study, serum from the AA group showed no direct effect on T cell proliferation or activation in vitro. However, it inhibited BMDC maturation and reduced pro-inflammatory cytokine production upon LPS stimulation, suggesting an indirect modulation of T cell responses through DC regulation. Adoptive transfer of lung DCs from acupuncture-treated mice into wild-type recipients further confirmed this role. After antigen challenge, these DCs led to a reduction in BALF inflammatory cells, type 2 cytokines, HDM-specific IgE, and mucus secretion, demonstrating that acupuncture suppresses Th2 airway inflammation by modulating lung DC function.</p><p id="Par62">DCs originate from hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow and differentiate into distinct subtypes, including conventional DCs (cDCs) and plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs), which exhibit differences in both location and immunological function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. cDCs, particularly CD11b<sup>+</sup> DCs in the lung submucosa, play a pivotal role in T cell priming and Th2 polarization by expressing Th2-promoting molecules like OX40L and T1/ST2, which are not typically expressed by CD103<sup>+</sup> DCs or pDCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. CD11b<sup>+</sup> DCs also express dectin-1, which recognizes HDM antigens and drives allergic airway inflammation by modulating chemokine expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. This study demonstrates that acupuncture significantly reduces CD11b<sup>+</sup> DC populations in the lungs of asthma models without altering CD103<sup>+</sup> DCs, suggesting that acupuncture modulates CD11b<sup>+</sup> DC differentiation to mitigate asthma progression. Additionally, acupuncture downregulates co-stimulatory molecules such as CD86 and OX40L on CD11b<sup>+</sup> DCs, limiting their capacity to activate Th2 cells.</p><p id="Par63">CCR7 expression on CD11b<sup>+</sup> DCs is critical for their migration to lymph nodes via CCL19/CCL21 gradients, which are essential for antigen presentation and adaptive immune responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Our results show that acupuncture upregulated CCR7 expression on CD11b<sup>+</sup> DCs while simultaneously reducing their immunostimulatory activity, which may enhance immune tolerance and reducing local Th2 inflammation. Conversely, CCR2 facilitates CD11b<sup>+</sup> DC recruitment to inflamed lungs through interactions with CCL2 and CCL8, both of which are highly expressed in asthma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Our study found that acupuncture downregulated CCL2 and CCL8 expression, likely reducing CCR2-mediated CD11b<sup>+</sup> DC accumulation in inflamed airways by modulating the CCL2/CCR2 and CCL8/CCR2 pathways.</p><p id="Par64">CD11b<sup>+</sup> DCs are primary sources of type 2 chemokines CCL17 and CCL22, which recruit Th2 cells to the airways in allergic asthma, thus contributing to Th2 inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Acupuncture lowered CCL17 and CCL22 expression at both mRNA and protein levels, potentially limiting Th2 cell migration to the airways and alleviating inflammation. Additionally, CD11b<sup>+</sup> DCs produce IL-6, which promotes Th2 and Th17 cell differentiation and activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Our study showed that acupuncture inhibits IL-6 secretion upon in vitro antigen restimulation of lung DCs, suggesting its role in suppressing pro-inflammatory cytokine production from CD11b<sup>+</sup> DCs and alleviating the Th2 response in asthma.</p><p id="Par65">ILC2s produce IL-5, IL-9, and IL-13 in response to epithelial-derived signals (e.g., IL-25, IL-33, and TSLP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. In asthma, ILC2s play a pivotal role in initiating and amplifying airway inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. ILC2s stimulate lung CD11b<sup>+</sup> DCs to produce CCL17, promoting Th2 memory cell recruitment and exacerbating inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Our study found that acupuncture reduced the number of ILC2s in asthmatic lungs and suppressed their activation cytokines, including IL-33, IL-25, and TSLP. Given that ILC2s promote the activation of CD11b<sup>+</sup> DCs, the inhibitory effects of acupuncture on ILC2s may indirectly modulate the immune activity of CD11b<sup>+</sup> DCs, leading to a further reduction in Th2-mediated airway inflammation. These findings suggest that the ILC2&#x02013;DC interaction plays a central role in acupuncture&#x02019;s therapeutic effects on asthma.</p><p id="Par66">TSLP, IL-33, and IL-25 are key epithelial-derived alarmins that drive allergic inflammation in response to allergen exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Our findings suggest that acupuncture not only attenuates immune cell activation but may also restore epithelial homeostasis by reducing alarmin production. One potential mechanism is that by suppressing the activation of ILC2s and DCs, acupuncture disrupts the feedback loop that amplifies epithelial cytokine release. Alternatively, acupuncture may exert direct effects on epithelial cells via neuroimmune pathways, wherein sensory nerve stimulation transmits signals to the central nervous system, leading to vagal activation and neurotransmitter release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. These neurochemical signals not only regulate immune cell function but may also enhance epithelial barrier integrity and suppress alarmin production.</p><p id="Par67">This proposed mechanism aligns with the anatomical positioning of the acupuncture points used in this study (GV14, BL12, BL13), which are located near the cervical sympathetic trunk and the T1-T4 sympathetic chain. This spatial relationship suggests that acupuncture may exert its effects through sympathetic pathways, facilitating both systemic immune modulation via the hypothalamic&#x02013;pituitary&#x02013;adrenal (HPA) axis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] and localized regulation of pulmonary DCs and ILC2s through lung-specific sympathetic networks. Such multi-level neuroimmune modulation may underlie acupuncture&#x02019;s concurrent alleviation of airway inflammation and epithelial dysfunction. However, the precise mechanisms governing acupuncture-mediated epithelial-neuro-immune crosstalk, particularly the specific contributions of distinct neural subtypes to its anti-asthmatic effects, require further investigation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec33"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par68">In summary, this study demonstrates that acupuncture reduces lung CD11b<sup>+</sup> DC populations and activation, thereby inhibiting Th2 cell recruitment and activation. This effect likely occurs through the downregulation of epithelial-derived alarmins, including IL-33, IL-25, and TSLP, which diminishes ILC2 activation and consequently the CD11b<sup>+</sup> DC-mediated inflammatory response. These findings highlight the multi-target effects of acupuncture in modulating airway epithelial cells, ILC2s, DCs, and Th2 cells in asthma. Future studies on acupuncture&#x02019;s neural-immune interactions could deepen our understanding of its effects and advance acupuncture-based therapeutic targets and strategies for asthma.</p></sec><sec id="Sec34" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>
