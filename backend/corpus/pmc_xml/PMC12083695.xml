Beyond this period, sensory stimulation becomes deleterious and results in infarct. We have further demonstrated that such sensory-based protection depends on the integrative role of activated synapses, activated neurons activated astrocytes, and activated blood vessels. By using the same rat pMCAo model for the current study, we hypothesized that all such activations are potentially triggered by sensory stimulation-based evoked neuronal activity within the ischemic cortex, that in turn triggers the various processes that lead to protection. To test this hypothesis, we used functional imaging and postmortem histology and selectively blocked spontaneous or evoked neuronal activity within the ischemic territory by local administration of lidocaine. Our findings demonstrate that the ischemic cortex is extremely sensitive, as clear functional blockage at the site of lidocaine diffusion and a corresponding infarct at the same location were found for both spontaneous activity and sensory-based evoked activity. Furthermore, the extreme sensitivity of the ischemic cortex is demonstrated by the detrimental effects of Phosphate Buffer Saline (PBS) application if protective sensory-based stimulation is not present following pMCAo. We conclude that neuronal activity, either spontaneous or evoked, within the ischemic cortex is pivotal for protection during the early hyperacute phase of ischemic stroke.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award01"><funding-source>National Institute of Health</funding-source><award-id>NINDS: R01NS126526</award-id></award-group></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P4">Historically in stroke research, the role of neuronal activity in deterioration to ischemic stroke or in protection from ischemic stroke has not been recognized as a significant factor. Regarding protection, our laboratory&#x02019;s research has repeatedly demonstrated that protection from impending ischemic stroke during the clinically critical hyperacute phase of stroke depends on sensory (whisker) stimulation that activates the ischemic area. Previous findings from our laboratory have focused on <italic toggle="yes">in-vivo</italic> experiments in anesthetized and awake behaving rats during the hyperacute phase following dorsal permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAo) demonstrating consistent results regarding protection vs. deterioration to infarct and their relationship to sensory stimulation (for our earlier review see <sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>, for more recent independent reviews see <sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>). Employing functional imaging (Intrinsic Signal Optical Imaging (ISOI)), flow imaging (Laser Speckle Imaging (LSI)), neuronal recordings, histology, and behavioral assessments, our first publication<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> demonstrated that protection from impending ischemic stroke following dorsal pMCAo model (double ligation and transection at the M1 level<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>) is achievable at any time within the first 2h post pMCAo by delivering intermittent tactile stimulation of single whisker or the entire whisker array. Beyond the 2h protection period, this treatment is no longer protective, resulting in infarct formation <sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. Sensory evoked retrograde blood flow within the permanently occluded MCA is critical for this protection. Such retrograde flow originates from opening of distal pial collaterals with other cortical arteries (ACA, PCA) resulting in reperfusion of the ischemic MCA territory<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. During the 2h treatment window, we found that recovery of a whisker functional representation in barrel cortex to pre-pMCAo baseline level was surprisingly similar in its temporal dynamics regardless of time that the protective treatment starts: either immediately (+ 0h), 1h (+ 1h) or 2h (+ 2h) following pMCAo<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> indicating that the cortex can self-protect even without sensory stimulation for 2h following pMCAo. Between 2h and 3h post-pMCAo there is a dramatic reversal, namely the same sensory stimulation results in infarct that is even larger than the one obtained in no-stimulation controls. By 5h post pMCAo the stimulation seems to no longer have an effect. Notably, this sensory-based treatment is also protective for 21&#x02013;23 months old rats<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> indicating a considerable age-range effectiveness &#x02013; an important finding considering the association of age and stroke in humans<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. We have also demonstrated that this treatment is independent of anesthesia type<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>, and that the same protection was achieved in behaving rats that self-stimulate their sensory-motor systems while exploring an enriched environment, even after their whiskers were removed<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> therefore demonstrating that it is a general sensory-motor activation of the ischemic MCA territory that is necessary for early protection. We also found that protection is long term: even 4 months post pMCAo rats remain protected <sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. The same treatment however does not seem to protect popular strains of mice<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>, or spontaneously hypertensive rats<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. Finally, we demonstrated that following pMCAo collateral flow is surprisingly dynamic in its spatiotemporal flow patterns and that protective sensory stimulation always enhances its velocity and flux although they remain relatively weak <sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. Recently, using detailed, widespread and continuous neuronal recordings before and 5h after pMCAo from the entire depth the ischemic area by applying a 32 microelectrodes array, we have discovered that immediately (within 5 minutes) following pMCAo there is a widespread, strong increase in synchronicity of spontaneous (but not evoked) local field potentials (LFPs) that is predictive of pMCAo outcome and is desynchronized by sensory stimulation treatment within the first 2h after pMCAo, but not at 3h after pMCAo <sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. Finally, we have demonstrated that astrocytes have an important role in sensory-based protection by supplying lactate to the neurons in the ischemic area using the astrocytes-to-neurons shuttle (ANLS) <sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. Notably, our findings have followed an earlier study suggesting a protective role of sensory stimulation<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> and have also been independently replicated in several other labs all demonstrating protection following early sensory treatment <sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>. Further evidence supporting the importance of such protective activation was provided by the protective effects of transcranial electrical stimulation<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>, transcranial focused ultrasound stimulation<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>, and optogenetic stimulation of the ischemic MCA territory in rodents <sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">Taken together, the above results strongly suggested that sensory stimulation-based protection depends on direct activation of neurons and astrocytes in the ischemic area during the hyperacute state. However, this hypothesis has never been directly tested. Applying functional imaging, pharmacological manipulations and post-mortem TTC staining of the cortex, our aim was to directly demonstrate that both spontaneous neuronal activity and evoked neuronal activity have each a role as a trigger for the protection process. Here we demonstrate that pharmacologically blocking either spontaneous or evoked neuronal activity after pMCAo results in deterioration to stroke and therefore directly establishing the role of neuronal activity in protection during the hyperacute state following pMCAo, findings that are consistent even for two different types of sensory stimulation.</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p id="P6">All conducted procedures strictly followed the National Institute of Health (NIH) guidelines and were approved by University of California Irvine Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC, protocol: AUP-21&#x02013;065).

C2 whisker was marked, and the remaining whiskers were cut before head-fixing the rat in stereotaxic restraint. At the beginning and end of day 1 of the experiment 5% warmed dextrose (3mL, subcutaneous) and atropine (0.05 mg/kg, bw, intramuscular) were administered.

Briefly, the base of the left middle cerebral artery is permanently occluded at the M1 segment blocking flow to all MCA cortical branches. To do this, the skull and dura are carefully removed from a 1.5 &#x000d7; 1.5 mm &#x02018;surgical window&#x02019; just anterior and lateral to the imaging window (over the M1 segment of MCA, just distal to MCA&#x02019;s lenticulostriate branches and proximal to any cortical branching). A small needle is threaded with 8&#x02013;0 silk thread and passed through the pial layer of the meninges, below MCA. The two parts of threads are separated and then secured tightly around the MCA. Care is taken to avoid hemorrhaging the artery and nearby vessels. In some cases, a terminating small branch of a vein that is located very close to MCA was also unavoidably occluded, but the results in these cases were not different from only MCA occlusion cases. The experiments are terminated if MCA or any other major vessel in the vicinity is hemorrhaged. For the sham surgery group, the same procedure is used but without tying the artery.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Drug Administration</title><p id="P14">A petroleum jelly (Vaseline) well was made around the imaging window and filled with saline for baseline ISOI.

Rats were then returned to a clean cage to recover overnight prior to 24 hours (referred to as 24hr) ISOI. After 24hr ISOI, rats were euthanized, with lethal dose of Euthasol (2 ml, ip) and prepared for histology.</p></sec><sec id="S12"><title>Intrinsic signal optical imaging (ISOI)</title><p id="P16">The details of ISOI data acquisition and analysis can be found in our previous work<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>. Briefly, a charge coupled device (CCD) camera (16-bit Cascade 512, Photometrics, Tucson, AZ, USA) or a scientific complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (sCMOS Prime 95B, Photometrics, Tucson, AZ, USA), both equipped with an inverted 50 mm AF Nikon lens (1:1:8, Melville, NY, USA) combined with an extender (model PK-13, Nikon, Melville, NY, USA) is used for imaging and controlled by V + + Precision Digital Imaging System software (Digital Optics, Auckland, NZ). Data is acquired in 100 ms frames that are summed to 500 ms frames to improve signal-to-noise ratio.

WFR for sparse protocol shows three distinct phases following stimulation. The three phases are, in the order of their appearance, the initial dip (typically dark in relation to pre-stimulus baseline), the overshoot (typically bright in relation to baseline) and the undershoot (topically dark in relation to baseline)<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>. When the cortex is illuminated by red light (635 nm), the initial dip represents the increase in deoxyhemoglobin due to immediate oxygen support to neuronal activation, the overshoot represents the vascular response of blood flow into the activated area due to increase in oxyhemoglobin (like the BOLD response of fMRI). As in our previous publications, we have analyzed only the first two phases and therefore <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> in the <xref rid="S22" ref-type="sec">Results</xref> section shows only the initial 7s of data acquisition.

For both sparse (top half) and condensed (bottom half) protocols, suppressing neuronal activation with lidocaine during the treatment period post pMCAo leads to affected neurons&#x02019; inability to recover functionally as seen in groups 3 (pMCAo + lid + ns) and 4 (pMCAo + lid + 0hr). At 24-hr assessment, condensed and sparse imaging protocols reveal that the WFR is reliably absent from the area of drug diffusion. This data demonstrates that blocked neurons were unable to recover their functional representation in areas corresponding to the diffusion of lidocaine, indicating a sustained functional impairment. Group 5 (pMCAo + PBS + ns) showed similar 24-hr functional impairment due to the absence of neuronal activity through no-stimulation. Conversely, Groups 1 and 2 (vehicle or sham surgery, respectively) baseline vs. 24-hr WFR data remained consistent, demonstrating complete recovery at 24-hr. The stability of these 2 groups suggests that without lidocaine intervention, neural mechanisms can still take place under the stress of pMCAo to provide neuroprotection. The stark contrast between all the experimental groups strongly supports the idea that suppressing neuronal activation with lidocaine disrupts functional recovery mechanisms that would otherwise be observed following ischemic insult. Supplementary Fig. 1 demonstrates that lidocaine completely blocks evoked cortical activity during day 1 of the experiment following sham surgery.</p></sec><sec id="S24"><title>Spatial quantification of WFR response for each experimental group at baseline and 24hrs after pMCAo</title><p id="P28"><xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref> presents quantification of areal extent (Area) and Peak Amplitude (or value) results from initial dip and overshoot phases of WFR using sparse and condensed stimulation protocols.

This region corresponds precisely to the area of lidocaine diffusion, and in turn, where neurons were prevented from neuronal activation either in response to whisker stimulation or spontaneous activity for both groups. Two representative cases are provided for group 5, which displayed a different distribution of infarct pattern (sometimes localized to S1BF, other times sustaining a larger infarcted area overreaching the bounds of S1BF).</p><p id="P32">The confinement of the infarct to the S1BF in these groups highlight the direct relationship between the region of drug diffusion, and the population of neurons affected by lidocaine resulting in their inability to recover. These results suggest that the suppression of neuronal activity, in tandem with ischemia, leads to structural damage as observed from the infarcted tissue in groups 3&#x02013;5.</p></sec><sec id="S26"><title>Correlation of infarct volume and area of drug slit</title><p id="P33">The infarct area consistently encompassed the entire region of drug diffusion. Furthermore, <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> shows that in groups 3 and 4 the size of the dura slit opening made for drug diffusion was highly predictive of total infarct volume as confirmed by significant linear regressions. Generally, the larger the drug slit, the larger the population of neurons were inhibited, leading to greater infarcts. This finding suggests the extent of area exposed to lidocaine during stroke evolution directly influences the degree of structural damage for both groups 3 and 4 with extremely strong correlation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S27"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P34">Our previous results regarding sensory stimulation-based protection from ischemic stroke have revealed so far three underlying mechanisms involving active neurons, active astrocytes, and blood vessels that support such protection. They include (1) sensory stimulation-based activation of collaterals&#x02019; blood flow originating from other cortical arteries resulting in a new source of retrograde blood supply within the occluded MCA that consequently results in reperfusion of the ischemic area,<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> (2) sensory stimulation-based desynchronization of a strong and widespread buildup of spatiotemporal synchronization of spontaneous LFP in the ischemic territory following pMCAo<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>, and (3) sensory stimulation-based activation of the astrocytes to neurons lactate shuttle (ANLS) supporting neuronal activity within the ischemic area <sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. Since sensory stimulation typically results in an increase in neuronal activation in the ischemic area and consequently increase in astrocytes activation <sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup>, it led to the hypothesis that such increase triggers all the underlying mechanisms of protection, as non-stimulus controls in all three cases didn&#x02019;t exhibit any of the effects described above. To test the hypothesis regarding the importance of neuronal activity in triggering protection, the current study used the sodium channel blocker lidocaine to block neuronal activity in the ischemic cortex during the clinically important hyperacute phase of ischemic stroke.</p><p id="P35">Using functional imaging (ISOI) before pMCAo (baseline) and 24h following pMCAo, and using post-mortem TTC histology in the same rats, results showed strong support for our hypothesis. The two lidocaine-treated groups following pMCAo showed lack of functional activation following sensory (whisker) stimulation at ischemic area treated with lidocaine, findings that were further supported by the corresponding TTC histological findings that showed infarcted tissue at the lidocaine treated area. Notably, these functional imaging and histological results were consistent despite the administration of two very different types of sensory stimulation, i.e., condensed vs. sparse, and therefore suggest that these findings could be generalizable beyond the exact details of the stimulation parameters.</p><p id="P36">The results of blocking spontaneous activity seem surprising at first glance. Spontaneous activity is typically known to be weaker than evoked activity and therefore seem less expected to serve as a trigger of protection. However, previous results in mice using voltage sensitive dyes imaging in barrel cortex during spontaneous activity showed repeated activation of the cortical tissue by depolarizing waves <sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup>. Such spontaneous activity could potentially explain our previous results that showed that the ischemic cortex can be protected for 2h following pMCAo without sensory stimulation, suggesting therefore that spontaneous activity can keep the cortex protected for a limited time despite being weaker than sensory evoked activity. But beyond the 2h protection window by spontaneous activity, the cortex deteriorates to ischemic stroke as judged by functional imaging and postmortem histology 24h after pMCAo, whereas administrating sensory stimulation following any time within the 2h period following pMCAo results in protection as judged 24h after pMCAo <sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. Higher levels of spontaneous activity in the ischemic cortex in some rats could also potentially explain some cases that we have encountered where rats were found to be protected despite receiving pMCAo.</p><p id="P37">Another unexpected indication for the extreme sensitivity of the ischemic cortex are the findings from experimental group 5 (pMCAo + PBS + ns). It clearly shows that the application of PBS (Phosphate Buffered Saline) to the ischemic cortex is detrimental following pMCAo, specifically in the absence of stimulation, resulting in functional impairment and structural damage. PBS, widely used in many biological applications, is isotonic, pH neutral, buffered and nontoxic and therefore is an essential tool for maintaining physiological conditions and supporting cell viability. It seems, however, that for the extremely sensitive ischemic cortex the PBS molecular composition that is so essential for its successful applications, can be toxic to cortical activity. Group 5 results also add strong support to the importance of protection of the ischemic cortex by sensory-based activation, as other experimental groups containing PBS with the combination of sensory stimulation show functional and structural protection 24 hrs following pMCAo. It remains unclear why, compared to other experimental groups, group 5 shows an almost binomial spread of functional and structural results, and more research is needed to uncover the reasons.</p><p id="P38">Selecting a lidocaine concentration that would properly inhibit all neurons in the diffusion area, without inducing cytotoxicity was important. We conducted preliminary experiments to confirm that application of 5% lidocaine for half an hour does not influence the whisker functional response reassessed at 24hr. As in our previous publication<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>, we show here that the use of the dura slit method enables us to restrict drug diffusion in the cortex and consequently control the size of the resulting infarct, even when different opening sizes for drug delivery were used <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>. The fact that in both studies different drugs were used (here lidocaine and previously 4-CIN (alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamte)) suggests that the strong correlation between the area of the dura slit and the infarct volume could be holding irrespective of the drug used. Further research with different drugs is needed to further confirm this valuable finding, as controlling the volume of the infarct is an important tool for studying the effects of the infarct volume on various outcomes of deterioration of the ischemic cortex to infarct.</p><p id="P39">The success of employing the lidocaine in this study raises another potential hypothesis. We have found in the past that when the protective stimulation is administered 3&#x02013;5h after pMCAo, it is no longer protective but instead creates an infarct that is even larger than the one created with no stimulation as assessed by imaging and histology 24h after pMCAo <sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. Future research will be conducted to test the hypothesis that the administration of a blocking agent such as lidocaine specifically during the 3&#x02013;5h period after pMCAo, could also protect the cortex from deterioration to infarct. If so, both protection and deterioration to infarct during the hyperacute phase would critically depend on the appropriate modulation of neuronal activity.</p><p id="P40">Notably, the successful implementation of non-invasive techniques to enhance or inhibit cortical activity for rehabilitation after stroke seem to generalize the positive effects of cortical activity modulation even beyond the hyperacute state (reviewed <sup><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup>) and therefore highlights a growing understanding regarding the significant role of neuronal activity in protection, deterioration to infarct, and rehabilitation after stroke.</p></sec><sec id="S28"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="P41">Our results support the hypothesis that both spontaneous activity and sensory-based evoked activity during the hyperacute state following pMCAo activate the cortical ischemic tissue, activation that serves as a potential trigger for several underlying mechanisms that result in protection of the cortical tissue from impending ischemic stroke.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="S29"><title>Acknowledgement</title><p id="P42">Funding was provided by the National Institute of Health (NINDS: R01NS126526).
