BoNTs affect the peripheral cholinergic neurons. They effectively prevent the release of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that activates glandular secretion and the contraction of muscles, leading to hyposecretion of glands and profound, albeit transient neuromuscular paralysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Multiple serotypes of BoNTs are found namely, A-G, that vary in biogenesis, molecular size, and mechanism of action. The most effective and frequently used serotype is Type A (BoNT-A) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">BoNT-A is not only used in cosmetic conditions but also in therapeutic conditions such as blepharospasm, cervical dystonia, strabismus, hemifacial spasm, severe primary axillary hyperhidrosis, glabellar wrinkles tremor, hemifacial spasm, hyperhidrosis, and headache [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In dentistry, it is used in sialorrhea, bruxism, mandibular spasm, gummy smile, oromandibular dystonia, masseteric hypertrophy, trigeminal neuralgia, and temporomandibular joint disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">Despite some local effects at the site of injection such as pain, ecchymosis, swelling, and hypesthesia, BoNT-A is generally regarded as a safe medication; lacking serious side effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Many studies reported its effects on various tissues and organs. Suh et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] illustrated ultrastructural changes in the myotendinous nerve endings after BoNT-A injection into the cat extraocular muscle. Lee et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] depicted disturbance in eye alignment in 4% of patients with essential blepharospasm after BoNT-A injection. Also, BoNT-A injection led to nasal gland apoptosis in guinea pigs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">It is well-established that the process of apoptosis involves intrinsic and extrinsic pathways which both encompass the cascade activation of caspases. Caspase-3 is one of the executing caspases which is important for cell death. Many caspase substrates are cleaved by caspase-3. It can process pro-caspase 2, 6, 7, and 9 which illustrates the extensive involvement of caspase-3 in the process of cell death. In addition, caspase-3 is linked to some of the changes in cell morphology (membrane blebbing, DNA fragmentation, chromatin condensation) and biochemical events associated with the execution and completion of apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Moreover, it was reported that BoNT-A was able to promote caspase-3-dependent apoptotic pathways in breast cancer cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par9">Noteworthy, a surplus of clinical studies focused mainly on BoNT-A&#x02019;s clinical impacts disregarding the histopathological changes stemming from its injection.

Therefore, it was mandatory to study the histopathological effects of BoNT-A injection on the skin and mucosa of the cheeks at the perioral area. The current study was performed to resolve the following points: (1)&#x000a0;The effects of BoNT-A injection on the epithelial cells of the buccal mucosa and skin and the cells of the underlying connective tissue at the area of injection after one week. (2)&#x000a0;Analyzing the degrees of tissue injury through the inspection of the signs of pathological changes histologically.&#x000a0;(3)&#x000a0;The detection of the apoptotic changes immunohistochemically through caspase-3 expression in these tissues. (4)&#x000a0;The distant effects of BoNT-A injection at the other side of the mouth. (5)&#x000a0;Recognizing if these impacts declined or even disappeared after one month at both the injected and non-injected side.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Animal model</title><p id="Par10">All animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Committee of Ethics at Faculty of Dentistry, Tanta University (#R-OB-9&#x02013;22-8) and were conducted in accordance with the guidelines laid down by the ARRIVE (Animal Research: Reporting In Vivo Experiments) guidelines for conducting animal research. Eighteen healthy adult male Albino rats (200&#x02013;300&#x000a0;g) were used in this study.

BoNT-A injections showed efficacy in the treatment of disorders involving abnormal muscle function since it blocks the release of acetylcholine in the neuromuscular junction with subsequent reversible muscle relaxation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. In dentistry, it is used to treat functional dental along with aesthetic conditions as to smoothen wrinkles around the mouth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and wrinkles produced by the muscles of facial expression such as deep nasolabial folds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Accordingly, the perioral area near the angle of the mouth was selected for BoNT-A injection in the current study.</p><p id="Par35">After one week of BoNT-A injection, the buccal mucosa and adjacent skin demonstrated atrophic epithelium and degenerative changes. These alterations were similar to the findings of Chuang et al. (2006) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] who injected rat prostate with BoNT-A. The authors observed diffuse atrophy of the prostate, flattening of their epithelial cells, increased number of apoptotic cells with diminished cellular proliferation and &#x003b1;<sub>1A</sub>-adrenoceptor suppression. These effects disappeared after two weeks. They related these changes to the inhibitory effect of BoNT-A on cholinoceptors which could modulate cellular functions such as mitosis, proliferation as well as differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p id="Par36">The prevalence of cellular degeneration within the epidermal cells in our study would stem from the notion that the epidermal keratinocytes usually express one or more of the BoNT-A-binding proteins SV2, FGFR3, or vanilloid receptors and/or BoNT-A-cleavage target SNAP-25. Likewise, the degenerative effects on mucosal keratinocytes would be attributed to the ability of BoNT-A to cleave SNAP-23 which is widely expressed in mucosal tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. After binding, the exact mechanism by which BoNT-A mediates its effects is questionable. It has been suggested that BoNT-A disrupts the intercellular epithelial barrier either via binding the E-cadherin molecule [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] or through affecting cell morphology and viability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Furthermore, the similar tissue changes we observed at the non-injected side could reflect the diffusion ability of BoNT-A since it can disperse 30 &#x02013; 45&#x000a0;mm away from injected muscles even if fasciae were present [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p id="Par37">Of note, our study revealed that the skin and mucosa on the non-injected side exhibited a higher degree of cellular degeneration in the one-week and one-month groups. Such a remote effect on non-injected tissues would be linked to the potential diffusion of the drug through the circulation, a phenomenon supported by the findings of Hristova et al. (2012) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. They reported that BoNT-A can permeate through intact vessel walls in addition to the possibility of inadvertent intravenous injection. Another potential pathway for BoNT-A spread is the retrograde transport through microtubules in the nerve axon to motor and sensory regions in the spinal cord [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. A combination of vascular dissemination and retrograde axonal spread of BoNT-A is probably responsible for the distant side effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><p id="Par38">Additionally, the increased degeneration scores at the non-injected sides in one-week and one-month groups would be plausible according to the findings of Ravichandran et al. (2013) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] who demonstrated that blood had no impact on the structure, function, or biological half-life of BoNT-A. Whereas the drug at the injection side may be diluted or negatively affected by the local allergic reactions (edema, erythema, and urticaria) known to develop at the sites of BoNT-A injection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The latter would explain our finding regarding the existence of mast cells primarily in tissues at the injection side. In the same context, the results of the present study revealed decreased epithelial thickness after BoNT-A administration as compared to the control group. This was in line with the observations of Ward et al. (2012) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] who reported decreased acanthosis in a mouse model of psoriasiform dermatitis after BoNT-A injection.</p><p id="Par39">Furthermore, our findings revealed that BoNT-A effects extended to involve the underlying connective tissue and associated musculature which displayed atrophic signs along with increased fibrosis. The primary therapeutic effect of BoNT-A is relieving muscle contractions via chemical denervation due to the blockade of acetylcholine release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. As a consequence, muscles became unstimulated, hence it is not uncommon to see microscopic signs of atrophy in a manner comparable to disuse atrophy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Additionally, Pingel et al. (2017) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] related the enhanced synthesis of collagen to the acceleration of tissue remodeling following muscular destruction.</p><p id="Par40">Apoptosis is a highly regulated biochemical process, essential for the maintenance of tissue homeostasis and the elimination of unwanted cells. It is manifested as a group of morphological cellular changes mediated by a family of cysteine proteases called Caspases. Caspase-3 is one of the effector Caspases that, once activated by the initiator Caspases, can cleave cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], thus mediating the dramatic signifying apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Therefore, caspase 3 was used to investigate the apoptotic changes in these tissues in the current study.</p><p id="Par41">Our results showed positive Caspase-3 immunostaining within the epithelial cells as well as connective tissue fibroblasts in all the study groups except for the control group. Increased apoptosis in the epithelial cells is in accordance with the potential negative effects of BoNT-A on the intercellular bridges or the cell viability discussed before. Moreover, BoNT-A can directly affect the dermal fibroblasts in several ways. BoNT-A inhibits fibroblast proliferation, stops fibroblasts&#x02013;to&#x02013;myofibroblasts differentiation via counteracting transforming growth factor-&#x003b2;, and induces apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].</p><p id="Par42">In addition, the nucleocytoplasmic localization of Caspase-3 immunostaining was revealed to be prevalent among BoNT-A groups. This would confirm the active apoptosis process since Caspase-3 exists in the cytoplasm in a precursor form then it undergoes translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus following apoptosis initiation due to disruption of nuclear-cytoplasmic barrier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. In the same context, the significant increase in Caspase-3 staining intensity within one-month group (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.005) coined with the diffuse staining within all epithelial layers (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.001) as compared to decreased intensity and predominant basal and parabasal expression in one-week group would highlight the cumulative effects of BoNT-A that usually reaches a peak of maximum effects within 1 &#x02013; 4&#x000a0;weeks after injection. It is noteworthy that the average of BoNT-A effects declines through three months and the prolongation of its effects requires repeated injections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. This coincided with our H-score results which showed some decline after one month of BoNT-A injection at the skin and mucosa on the injected side. Whereas on the non-injected side, the H-score exhibited opposite results which agreed with our explanation of the increased accumulative effect of BoNT-A shown by increased caspase-3 immune intensity of this group.</p><p id="Par43">In conclusion, after one week of BoNT-A injection, the buccal mucosa and the adjacent skin demonstrated atrophic and degenerative changes that showed a slight decrease after one month in the injected side. At the non-injected side, the degeneration and cellular apoptosis were more significant than at the injected side and showed a slight increase after one month in both skin and mucosa. Consequently, in the clinical determination, the excessive usage of BoNT-A should be reviewed since its effects are not constrained to the injected side. In addition, the current study has some limitations including a single dose with a specific volume, the use of one marker, and short experimental periods. Therefore, further studies with a larger sample size, longer experimental periods and using more immunohistochemical markers are necessary to verify, explain and clarify these potential effects of BoNT-A.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#x02019;s Note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>G.S.H.: Conceptualization; Data curation; Formal analysis; Funding acquisition; Investigation; Methodology; Resources; Validation; Visualization; Writing&#x02014;original draft; Writing&#x02014;review and editing.
