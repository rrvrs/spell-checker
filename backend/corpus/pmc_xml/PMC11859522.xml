ECT is&#x000a0;particularly effective in resistant schizophrenia and may improve response to medication despite the presence of potential adverse side effects. Post-ECT delirium and Headaches are some of the most frequent side effects presented in literature. Fever is yet another unexplained reaction, however there are a few case reports and&#x000a0;retrospective studies that report on it.</p></sec><sec id="sec7912"><title>Objectives</title><p>We aim to illustrate through a clinical case and a review of literature the prevalence of post ECT fever as well as the possible explanatory mechanisms.</p></sec><sec id="sec7913"><title>Methods</title><p>In this study we report the case of a man with ultra-resistant schizophrenia who was treated successfully with ECT despite the development of transient febrile reaction and we present a review of literature on pubmed using the following key words : ECT, fever,resistant psychosis, mechanisms.</p></sec><sec id="sec7914"><title>Results</title><p>
Our patient is a 48-year-old man with a psychiatric history of schizophrenia evolving since the age of 34. He has a history of matricide in 2021 resulting in his hospitalisation in a forensic psychiatric ward. He underwent trials of classic and atypical antipsychotics that weren&#x02019;t efficacious thus he was diagnosed with resistant schizophrenia in 2022. He was treated initially with clozapine 500 mg per day and then with the&#x000a0;association (clozapine + amisulpride) yet it wasn&#x02019;t effective on his persecutory delirium and fratricide ideas. Plus,&#x000a0;there was no reduction in his PANSS (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale) scores. The diagnosis of ultra-resistant schizophrenia was established. The staff indicated the adjunction of ECT to Clozapine. In the inpatient unit, hours after his fourth ECT session he developed a fever (40&#x000b0;C), his blood pressure (120/80 mm Hg), pulse(85 beats per minute),and respiratory rate(20 breaths per minute) were normal. Blood samples, including cultures, were drawn, which showed normal blood cell count and CPK(140U/L) but CRP was elevated (31 U/L), a chest x-ray showed no acute pulmonary disease, and his urinalysis result and Covid test were negative. His&#x000a0;fever resolved then spontaneously after two hours. The same transient febrile reaction occurred again 3 times. It was postulated in literature that fever may be due to inadequate muscle reaction. Data also suggested the potential influence of ECT on the hypothalamus that is a key region in regulating body temperature.</p></sec><sec id="sec7915"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Further studies are required in order to establish the real prevalence of this side effect and its possible causes.</p></sec><sec id="sec7916"><title>Disclosure of Interest</title><p>None Declared</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="2"/></counts></article-meta></front></article>
