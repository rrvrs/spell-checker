The present study aimed to isolate and characterize the causative fungus from fingerlings of <italic>Pangasianodon hypophthalmus</italic> cultured intensively in freshwater cages in Indian reservoirs and to determine minimum inhibitory concentrations of different antifungal compounds against the fungal hyphae and zoospores. The fungal isolates grown on potato dextrose agar showed an abundance of gemmae, elongated mycelia, non-septate hyphae, primary zoospores, mature zoosporangia with numerous zoospores, cysts with bundles of long hairs and were further identified as <italic>Saprolegnia parasitica</italic> following PCR amplification and sequencing of internal transcribed spacer region. <italic>S. parasitica</italic> showed temperature-sensitive optimum growth in a narrow window of 12&#x02013;24 &#x02103;, which might drive its experimental pathogenesis as well as natural infections in the winter months. In vitro sensitivity testing established negligible inhibitory activity of fluconazole, boric acid, sodium thiosulfate, and potassium permanganate while clotrimazole arrested the spore and hyphal growths at 2 mgL<sup>-1</sup> concentration suggesting potential of the imidazole antifungal in treating <italic>S. parasitica</italic> infection in fish.

Pangasius contributed 5.1% to the global inland finfish aquaculture production (FAO, 2022), 40% of the global catfish production, and has a projected growth rate of 4.3% in the ASEAN region during 2015&#x02013;30<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Vietnam is the major catfish producer, generating about 1.7 million tonnes by 2021, whereas India produced 0.55 million tonnes during 2021&#x02013;22 (Department of Fisheries, 2022). It is India&#x02019;s third most cultivable fish species, after <italic>Labeo rohita</italic> and <italic>L. catla</italic>. Besides high productivity in tanks, Pangasius is cultured in very high densities in freshwater cages in reservoirs and floodplain wetlands of India with an average yield of 30.4&#x000a0;kg m<sup>&#x02212;3</sup> cage area (pers. comm.).</p><p id="Par11">Despite consistently high growth rate of the aquaculture sector in last few decades, disease outbreaks have remained a significant challenge, especially in intensive farming systems. Superficial mycosis, caused by <italic>Saprolegnia parasitica</italic> and <italic>S. declina</italic> complex, is one of the major fungal diseases of fish worldwide. Various fish species including <italic>Oreochromis niloticus</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>, <italic>P. hypophthalmus</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, <italic>Schizothorax richardsonii</italic> (Tandel et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>), <italic>Clarias batrachus</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, Indian Major Carps<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, <italic>Channa</italic> spp.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, Mullet, Tench, Barramundi and Sturgeon<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> are significantly affected by <italic>Saprolegnia</italic>. Low water temperature and survival of the secondary cyst in the culture system favour the development of saprolegniasis in fish (Tandel et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>). Viable zoospores of <italic>S. parasitica</italic> colonize the body surface of fish, impair osmoregulation, and cause tissue damage through secreted enzymes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Several putative proteins, including CBD proteins, CBEL-like proteins, glycosyl hydrolases, proteases, and protease inhibitors contribute to virulence of the fungus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Salmon farms and hatcheries in Scotland, Norway, and Chile incur more than 10% economic loss due to <italic>Saprolegnia</italic> infections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. In Japan, <italic>S. parasitica</italic> can cause up to 50% mortality in Coho salmon and eel<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>.

Despite significant loss from the disease, there are meagre works on developing preventive and therapeutic measures against the water mould. Antimicrobial sanitizers such as iodine, formalin, hydrogen peroxide, boric acid, sodium thiosulfate, immunostimulants, etc. are used to contain fungal outbreaks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, however, there is not enough convincing information about effectiveness of these chemicals against various life stages of <italic>Saprolegnia</italic>. The present study has identified the aetiological agent of superficial mycosis in Pangasius cultured in cages.

Although <italic>P. hypophthalmus</italic> is considered a hardy fish, the present study recorded 11.7% of catfish mortality in freshwater cage culture systems in winter months. The disease prevalence, severity of infection and mortality increased with the progression of winter, threatening the survival of standing crop in cages in winter months. Kumar et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> reported a wide range of catfish mortality ranging from less than 5% to 100% in the winter season in different ponds in Uttar Pradesh, India. In laboratory bioassay, the fungus induced a high level of mortality in winter but failed to induce any disease in summer, establishing high susceptibility of the catfish to the fungus in colder months, likely due to low temperature-induced immunosuppression. Besides influencing the host&#x02019;s susceptibility, the present study showed the strong influence of ambient temperature on the fungal growth&#x000a0;&#x02013;&#x000a0;luxuriant growth of the fungus was observed at 20&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C, which might easily disrupt the delicate host&#x02013;pathogen homeostasis in favour of the pathogen, especially when the fish is already immunocompromised. There was no hyphae growth at 4&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C, which corroborated with the lower temperature limitation of the fungus described by Tandel et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> and Magray et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> but contrasts with the finding of Liu et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> from China. This difference might originate from the temperature regime of the geographical area under study, nutrient load in the ecosystem, and water quality, which might significantly influence the biology of aquatic microorganisms. Further, the fungus growth decreases above 20 &#x02103;, explaining little occurrence of saprolegniasis in summer months. <italic>S. parasitica</italic> is considered eurythermous, however, several researchers have recorded the infection at lower water temperatures. It remains to be seen whether temperature also influences expressions of virulence factors such as lectins, peptides, haemolysin, toxins, protease, etc. Kitancharoen et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> reported good growth of <italic>S. parasitica</italic> from visceral mycosis at 30 &#x02103; and the production of more motile zoospores than the isolates from superficial lesions.</p><p id="Par32">Based on morphology and molecular evidence, the causative agent of superficial mycosis was identified as <italic>S. parasitica,</italic> the most prevalent and pathogenic oomycete pathogen in India. In vitro, the fungus reproduced asexually, and sexual form was not observed. Morphological features such as gemmae, elongated mycelia, zoosporangia, zoospores, and branched hyphae with immature sporangia and cysts observed here have also been reported earlier for <italic>S. parasitica</italic> from Pangasius from Vietnam and India<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, snow trout from India (Tandel et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, common carp from Iraq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, and brown trout from United Kingdom<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>.

Considering the recent growth trajectory of Pangasius production and vulnerability of the fish species to saprolegniasis clotrimazole might be a saviour for catfish farmers.
