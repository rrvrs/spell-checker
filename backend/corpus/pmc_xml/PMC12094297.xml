Adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cell (AD-MSC) therapy has emerged as a promising regenerative approach; however, the comparative efficacy and safety of autologous versus allogeneic AD-MSCs remain unclear. This systematic review and network meta-analysis (NMA) evaluated the effectiveness and safety of intra-articular AD-MSCs in adults with Kellgren-Lawrence Grade II-IV knee OA. A comprehensive search identified eight randomized controlled trials that compared high-dose autologous, high-dose allogeneic, and low-dose allogeneic AD-MSCs to placebo or standard care interventions, such as hyaluronic acid, corticosteroids, or physical therapy. The primary outcomes were pain relief, assessed by the Visual Analog Scale (VAS), and functional improvement, measured by the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), at three, six, and 12 months. Treatment rankings were determined using Surface Under the Cumulative Ranking (SUCRA) probabilities. High-dose autologous AD-MSCs ranked highest for pain relief at three, six, and 12 months (VAS SUCRA: 75.99%, 82.27%, 81.65%), while high-dose allogeneic AD-MSCs ranked highest for functional improvement at six and 12 months (WOMAC SUCRA: 74.6%, 71.71%). Low-dose allogeneic AD-MSCs consistently ranked lowest for both outcomes. Adverse event analysis indicated that low-dose allogeneic AD-MSCs had the highest risk of adverse effects (SUCRA: 22.24%), followed by high-dose allogeneic AD-MSCs (26.52%). In contrast, high-dose autologous AD-MSCs ranked safer (SUCRA: 54.08%).&#x000a0;Serious adverse events were rare and unrelated to&#x000a0;treatment, and consistency testing confirmed no significant inconsistencies in the NMA framework. Overall, high-dose autologous AD-MSCs provided sustained pain relief over 12 months, while high-dose allogeneic AD-MSCs demonstrated superior long-term functional improvement. These findings support a two-phase treatment model in which autologous AD-MSCs offer early and prolonged symptom relief, and allogeneic AD-MSCs assist in long-term joint recovery. Overall, AD-MSC therapy was well tolerated and may represent a viable, personalized, non-surgical knee OA management strategy.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>adipose-derived stem cells</kwd><kwd>allogeneic mscs</kwd><kwd>autologous mscs</kwd><kwd>functional improvement</kwd><kwd>knee osteoarthritis</kwd><kwd>mesenchymal stem cells</kwd><kwd>network meta-analysis</kwd><kwd>pain relief</kwd><kwd>regenerative medicine</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction and background</title><p>Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a major contributor to pain and disability globally, characterized by progressive cartilage degeneration, chronic synovial inflammation, and structural joint deterioration. Current non-surgical treatments, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), intra-articular corticosteroids, and hyaluronic acid injections, offer symptomatic relief but do not halt disease progression. With limited therapeutic options short of surgical intervention, mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapy has emerged as a promising regenerative approach. MSCs exert anti-inflammatory effects through IL-10 and TGF-&#x003b2; secretion, modulate inflammation, promote tissue repair, and improve joint function [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>Among MSC sources, adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AD-MSCs) have gained significant interest due to their high yield, ease of extraction, and strong proliferative potential. Compared to bone marrow-derived MSCs (BM-MSCs), AD-MSCs can be harvested through minimally invasive liposuction and demonstrate potent paracrine activity, facilitating cartilage repair and immune modulation [<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However, despite increasing clinical investigations, several key uncertainties remain, including the comparative efficacy of autologous vs. allogeneic AD-MSCs, the optimal dosing strategy, and long-term safety considerations [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Autologous vs. allogeneic AD-MSC therapy: mechanisms and clinical potential</p><p>AD-MSCs exert their therapeutic effects primarily through paracrine signaling, secreting cytokines, growth factors, and extracellular vesicles that modulate immune responses, reduce inflammation, and promote extracellular matrix remodeling. These properties are particularly beneficial in OA, where chronic inflammation accelerates cartilage degradation [<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>AD-MSCs can be autologous (from the patient&#x02019;s own tissue) or allogeneic (from a donor). Autologous AD-MSCs are considered advantageous due to their immune compatibility, reduced risk of rejection, and potentially longer persistence in the joint environment. Conversely, allogeneic AD-MSCs offer an off-the-shelf treatment option with potentially stronger immunomodulatory effects but may carry a risk of immune recognition and clearance. Some studies suggest that autologous AD-MSCs provide more rapid pain relief, whereas allogeneic AD-MSCs contribute to sustained regenerative effects. Emerging evidence also suggests that therapeutic efficacy may be dose-dependent, with higher cell doses potentially yielding stronger and longer-lasting effects [<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. However, optimal dosing thresholds remain unclear and are rarely compared across studies.</p><p>Need for a comprehensive comparative analysis</p><p>Despite increasing randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating AD-MSC therapy, variability in study designs, treatment protocols, follow-up durations, and outcome measures has led to conflicting conclusions [<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. While prior meta-analyses have evaluated MSC therapy for OA, none have fully addressed the comparative effectiveness of autologous versus allogeneic AD-MSCs across different doses. Our study addresses this gap using a Bayesian network meta-analysis (NMA), which provides a powerful solution by integrating direct and indirect evidence to enable the comparison of multiple AD-MSC treatment regimens within a unified analytical framework to rank treatment strategies. By evaluating outcomes across multiple time points, we aim to clarify the most effective and safest AD-MSC regimens for knee OA management, with implications for clinical decision-making and trial design.</p><p>Study objectives</p><p>This systematic review, pairwise and network meta-analysis, aims to comprehensively evaluate the comparative effectiveness and safety of low-dose allogeneic, high-dose allogeneic, and high-dose autologous AD-MSC&#x000a0;therapy for knee OA. The primary outcomes include pain relief, measured by the Visual Analog Scale (VAS), and functional improvement, assessed using the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC)&#x000a0;at three, six, and 12 months. Additionally, the study examines the adverse effect (AE) profile of different AD-MSC regimens to identify the most effective intervention based on Surface Under the Cumulative Ranking (SUCRA) probabilities. To ensure the reliability of findings, we perform consistency testing to assess the validity of direct and indirect comparisons within the NMA framework.</p><p>Hypothesis and Study Significance</p><p>This study hypothesizes that high-dose autologous AD-MSCs will provide rapid pain relief due to their more potent early anti-inflammatory effects. In contrast, high-dose allogeneic AD-MSCs will demonstrate superior long-term functional improvement due to prolonged immune modulation and regenerative activity.</p><p>This study aims to generate data-driven insights into the best AD-MSC&#x000a0;treatment strategy for knee OA by integrating direct and indirect evidence from multiple RCTs. By doing so, it aims to support the development of standardized protocols for regenerative medicine. Findings from this meta-analysis may also inform future clinical trials and help refine patient selection criteria, ultimately enhancing the therapeutic potential of AD-MSC&#x000a0;therapy in OA management.

The population consisted of adults diagnosed with mild to severe knee osteoarthritis (Kellgren-Lawrence Grade II-IV). The intervention included intra-articular injections of adipose-derived MSCs, categorized into low-dose allogeneic, high-dose allogeneic, and high-dose autologous MSCs. The comparators were placebo and standard care (e.g., corticosteroids, hyaluronic acid injections, physical therapy).</p><p>The primary outcomes assessed were pain relief (VAS) and functional improvement (WOMAC) at three, six, and 12 months. Secondary outcomes included treatment durability over time, adverse events, and the necessity for surgical intervention, such as knee replacement.</p><p>Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria</p><p>This meta-analysis included RCTs evaluating intra-articular AD-MSC&#x000a0;therapy for knee OA in adults (&#x02265;18 years) diagnosed using validated criteria such as the Kellgren-Lawrence grading system (Grade II-IV). The eligible studies administered adipose-derived MSCs as single or multiple intra-articular injections with defined cell doses and preparation protocols. Comparators included placebo (e.g., saline) and standard care (e.g., hyaluronic acid, corticosteroids, physical therapy). Studies were required to report at least one primary outcome related to pain relief (VAS, Numeric Pain Rating Scale {NPRS}) or functional improvement (WOMAC). Only peer-reviewed RCTs with a minimum six-month follow-up, published in English between January 1, 2010, and January 1, 2025, were included.</p><p>Studies were excluded if they involved non-human subjects, pediatric populations, or OA secondary to inflammatory conditions (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis). Trials using MSCs from non-adipose sources or systemic administration were excluded unless adipose-derived MSC outcomes were separately reported. Studies incorporating MSCs with non-standard adjunctive treatments (e.g., gene therapy) or surgical procedures were&#x000a0;excluded unless MSC-specific outcomes were independently analyzed. Additionally, non-randomized studies, case reports, reviews, abstracts, preprints, theses, unpublished data, and studies with less than six months of follow-up or published in non-English languages without reliable translations were not considered to maintain methodological rigor.</p><p>Search Strategy&#x000a0;</p><p>A comprehensive search was conducted across PubMed/MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Embase, <ext-link xlink:href="https://ClinicalTrials.gov" ext-link-type="uri">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link>, Web of Science, and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) to identify randomized controlled trials evaluating adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cell therapy for knee osteoarthritis. These databases were selected to ensure broad coverage of published trials across diverse clinical and geographical contexts.</p><p>We constructed our search strategy based on two main concepts: AD-MSCs and knee OA. For the AD-MSCs concept, we used keywords such as adipose stem cells, mesenchymal stromal cells, adipose-derived MSCs, adipose tissue stem cells, intra-articular MSC therapy, adipose-derived regenerative cells, stem cell injection, stem cell therapy, and adipose-derived stromal cells. The associated MeSH terms included Mesenchymal Stem Cells [MeSH], Adipose Tissue [MeSH], Stem Cell Transplantation [MeSH], Cell- and Tissue-Based Therapy [MeSH], and Regenerative Medicine [MeSH]. For knee OA, we included keywords such as knee osteoarthritis, osteoarthritis of the knee, degenerative knee joint disease, knee joint arthritis, degenerative joint disease, osteoarthrosis of the knee, and knee cartilage degeneration, and MeSH terms such as Osteoarthritis, Knee [MeSH], Arthritis [MeSH], Knee Joint [MeSH], and Osteoarthritis [MeSH].</p><p>These concepts were combined using Boolean operators (AND, OR) to build the advanced search string: (adipose stem cells OR mesenchymal stromal cells OR adipose-derived MSCs OR adipose tissue stem cells OR intra-articular MSC therapy OR adipose-derived regenerative cells OR stem cell injection OR stem cell therapy OR adipose-derived stromal cells OR Mesenchymal Stem Cells [MeSH] OR Adipose Tissue [MeSH] OR Stem Cell Transplantation [MeSH] OR Cell and Tissue-Based Therapy [MeSH] OR Regenerative Medicine [MeSH]) AND (knee osteoarthritis OR osteoarthritis of the knee OR degenerative knee joint disease OR knee joint arthritis OR degenerative joint disease OR osteoarthrosis of the knee OR knee cartilage degeneration OR Osteoarthritis [MeSH] OR Knee [MeSH] OR Arthritis [MeSH] OR Knee Joint [MeSH] OR Osteoarthritis [MeSH]).</p><p>The strategy was designed to identify all relevant studies evaluating AD-MSC interventions for knee osteoarthritis up to January 1, 2025, the final search date.</p><p>Study Selection</p><p>The systematic search across PubMed/MEDLINE, Cochrane CENTRAL, Embase, <ext-link xlink:href="https://ClinicalTrials.gov" ext-link-type="uri">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link>, Web of Science, and WHO ICTRP (World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform) identified 994 records. After removing 477 duplicates, 517 records remained for title and abstract screening, of which 461 were excluded for irrelevance. This left 56 full-text reports for eligibility assessment; however, 23 were not retrievable, reducing the total to 33 studies for a full review.</p><p>Following full-text assessment, 25 studies were excluded, primarily due to the use of non-adipose-derived stem cells, the absence of a control arm, or the combination with another intervention. Ultimately, eight RCTs [<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>-<xref rid="REF17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] met the inclusion criteria and were included in&#x000a0;the traditional pairwise and network meta-analyses (Figure <xref rid="FIG2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).</p><fig position="anchor" fig-type="figure" id="FIG2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>PRISMA flowchart of study selection process</title><p>PRISMA:&#x000a0;Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="cureus-0017-00000082713-i02" position="float"/></fig><p>Data Extraction</p><p>Data extraction was performed using a Microsoft Excel worksheet (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, Washington) to ensure consistency and accuracy.

Follow-up durations and effect estimates (mean differences, risk ratios, 95% confidence intervals) were extracted where available.</p><p>Outcome Measurement and Scale Standardization</p><p>Pain and function outcomes were assessed using either the VAS or the WOMAC, depending on the reporting format of each included study. For VAS, scores reported on a 0-10 Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) were converted to a 0-100 scale by multiplying by 10. In cases where the VAS scale was not explicitly specified, assumptions were made based on standard clinical conventions or baseline mean values. For WOMAC, raw scores with a maximum of 96 (sum of pain, stiffness, and function subscales) were converted to a 0-100 scale where applicable to allow for cross-study comparability. If studies reported only subscales, a composite score was derived using standard weighting. All transformations were performed prior to pooling data to minimize measurement-related variability.</p><p>Study Characteristics</p><p>Eight RCTs were included, evaluating allogeneic and autologous AD-MSCs at varying doses compared to hyaluronic acid, saline, or standard care [<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>-<xref rid="REF17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].

Some trials featured multiple treatment arms, forming a well-connected network. This network structure forms a cohesive subnetwork, ensuring that indirect comparisons can be made where direct head-to-head trials are unavailable. For instance, since both high-dose autologous and high-dose allogeneic were compared to the control group but not to each other, their relative efficacy can still be estimated through indirect comparison using the standard control group as a reference. By incorporating these comparisons, the analysis provided a comprehensive evaluation of the efficacy and safety of AD-MSC therapies for knee osteoarthritis.</p><p>Risk of Bias Assessment</p><p>The quality of the included studies was judged using the Cochrane risk of bias 2 (ROB2) tool, incorporating a weighted approach based on each study&#x02019;s contribution [<xref rid="REF18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Two independent reviewers&#x000a0;evaluated five domains: randomization, deviations from intended interventions, missing outcome data, outcome measurement, and selection of reported results. Discrepancies were resolved through discussion or consultation with a third reviewer.</p><p>Each domain was classified as low risk, with some concerns, or high risk of bias, with overall study ratings determined based on weighted contributions providing a transparent assessment of study quality [<xref rid="REF19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to evaluate the impact of studies with a higher risk of bias on meta-analysis findings.</p><p>Statistical Analysis</p><p>A traditional pairwise meta-analysis using a fixed-effects model was performed in RevMan 5.4.1 (Review Manager {RevMan}, 2020), with results presented as forest plots for direct treatment comparisons. A frequentist NMA was also performed to estimate overall treatment effects, visualized in a summary frequentist NMA forest plot.</p><p>Treatment rankings were determined using a Bayesian NMA framework, generating SUCRA probabilities to evaluate the relative efficacy of interventions [<xref rid="REF20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Consistency testing included a frequentist loop inconsistency test and a Bayesian node-splitting analysis to assess&#x000a0;direct and indirect evidence agreement. All NMA analyses were performed in MetaInsight (National Institute for Health and Care Research {NIHR} Complex Reviews Support Unit, University of Leicester, UK), following PRISMA-NMA guidelines [<xref rid="REF21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>Results</p><p>Introduction to Results</p><p>This section presents findings from&#x000a0;the traditional pairwise meta-analysis and network meta-analysis, assessing the effectiveness of different interventions for pain relief and functional improvement, as measured by the VAS and the WOMAC. Analyses were performed at three time points (three, six, and 12 months) to evaluate both short-term and long-term treatment efficacy. Additionally, adverse effects were examined across all time points to assess the safety profile of each intervention.</p><p>Traditional meta-analysis (direct comparisons): A traditional pairwise meta-analysis was conducted to summarize direct treatment comparisons from the available studies. The results are presented as forest plots, showing the pooled effect sizes of VAS and WOMAC scores at each time point. Funnel plots were also created to assess publication bias in the direct comparisons.</p><p>Frequentist&#x000a0;network meta-analysis (indirect and direct comparisons): To provide a comprehensive ranking of treatments, a frequentist NMA was conducted, integrating both direct and indirect evidence. The results are presented using a summary frequentist NMA forest plot, comparing all interventions based on VAS and WOMAC scores at each time point.</p><p>Treatment rankings were determined using SUCRA probabilities, derived from a Bayesian framework, which indicates the likelihood of each intervention being the most effective. These rankings are represented through radial plots and Litmus Rank-O-Gram plots, allowing for a clear interpretation of treatment efficacy over time.</p><p>Adverse effects analysis: To assess treatment safety, adverse effects were analyzed across all time points. Both traditional meta-analysis and NMA were used to compare adverse effects, with results presented as forest plots displaying risk estimates. Treatments were ranked based on safety profiles using SUCRA values, identifying interventions with the lowest risk of adverse effects.</p><p>Validity and quality assessment: To evaluate the reliability of the findings, two additional analyses were conducted. First, a ROB2 assessment was performed to assess study quality and potential bias. The results of the ROB2 evaluation indicate the proportion of studies categorized as having low, some, or high risk of bias, providing insight into the overall credibility of the evidence.</p><p>Second, consistency testing was conducted to verify whether direct and indirect evidence agreed within the NMA. A frequentist approach was used to assess global consistency through loop inconsistency tests, while a Bayesian node-splitting analysis was applied to detect potential inconsistencies in specific treatment comparisons.</p><p>Summary of treatment rankings: To identify the best-performing treatments, SUCRA values were calculated for VAS and WOMAC scores at all time points. A SUCRA bar graph provides an overview of which treatments are most effective across three, six, and 12 months. These rankings allow for a direct comparison of interventions, facilitating evidence-based decision-making regarding optimal pain management strategies.</p><p>Risk of bias assessment (ROB2 results): Eight RCTs were assessed using the ROB2 tool, which incorporates a weighted ROB2 approach to account for each study&#x02019;s contribution to the meta-analysis.

However, as time progressed, the rankings began to diverge. At six months, high-dose autologous AD-MSCs remained the most effective for pain reduction (VAS SUCRA: 82.27%), while high-dose allogeneic AD-MSCs emerged as the top-ranked treatment for functional improvement (WOMAC SUCRA: 74.59%). This divergence persisted at 12 months, with high-dose autologous AD-MSCs maintaining their leading position for pain relief (VAS SUCRA: 81.65%) and high-dose allogeneic AD-MSCs continuing to rank highest for functional recovery (WOMAC SUCRA: 71.71%).</p><p>These trends suggest that distinct biological mechanisms may underlie short-term pain relief versus longer-term improvements in joint function. Autologous AD-MSCs may exert their early analgesic effects through rapid immune modulation, high cytokine secretion, and prompt suppression of inflammation. In contrast, allogeneic AD-MSCs may provide delayed but durable benefits by promoting sustained tissue remodeling and gradual joint structure and function improvements.</p><p>Short-term vs. long-term efficacy<italic>:&#x000a0;</italic>The findings support a two-phase model of AD-MSC&#x000a0;therapy. High-dose autologous AD-MSCs consistently delivered the greatest pain relief (VAS) across all time points three, six, and 12 months, suggesting strong and sustained anti-inflammatory effects. In contrast, high-dose allogeneic AD-MSCs demonstrated superior outcomes in functional improvement (WOMAC) at both six and 12 months, indicating a delayed but durable impact on joint recovery. This highlights the differential therapeutic mechanisms of autologous and allogeneic AD-MSCs, where autologous AD-MSCs primarily drive sustained inflammation suppression and symptom relief, whereas allogeneic AD-MSCs&#x000a0;enhance long-term joint recovery through prolonged immune modulation and cartilage repair [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="REF23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="REF24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>Dose-dependent responses (high vs. low-dose AD-MSCs): A clear dose-dependent response was observed, with high-dose AD-MSCs consistently improving pain relief and functional outcomes across all time points. This pattern supports the hypothesis that higher concentrations of AD-MSCs enhance therapeutic efficacy, a finding also supported by previous network meta-analyses [<xref rid="REF25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>While low-dose AD-MSCs conferred some clinical benefit, their effects were modest compared to high-dose treatments. These results suggest that optimizing AD-MSC&#x000a0;dosage plays a critical role in maximizing therapeutic outcomes, particularly in patients with more advanced or symptomatic osteoarthritis.</p><p>Biological Insights and Ranking Validity</p><p>Biological mechanisms underlying source-dependent effects: The differing efficacy patterns of autologous and allogeneic AD-MSCs over time may be attributed to variations in cell survival, immunogenicity, and mechanisms of action. High-dose autologous AD-MSCs consistently provided the greatest pain relief at three, six, and 12 months, likely due to rapid cell integration, potent early paracrine signaling, and strong anti-inflammatory cytokine release, particularly IL-10 and TGF-&#x003b2; [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Autologous stem cells are patient-derived, so they are less likely to be cleared by the immune system, allowing for more robust early paracrine signaling and rapid symptom relief.</p><p>In contrast, while allogeneic AD-MSCs are not self-derived, they exhibit&#x000a0;immune-privileged properties&#x000a0;and can modulate host immunity. These effects, including inhibition of T-cell proliferation and promoting M2 macrophage polarization, may create a&#x000a0;sustained anti-inflammatory and pro-regenerative joint environment [<xref rid="REF26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="REF27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. This immune reshaping may mitigate rejection and enable&#x000a0;longer-term persistence and integration, supporting cartilage repair and improved function over time [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Overall, the observed clinical trends may be explained by the interplay of three primary mechanisms of AD-MSC&#x000a0;therapy: (1) paracrine signaling, which mediates early symptom relief through anti-inflammatory cytokines; (2) immune modulation, which alters chronic inflammatory pathways and fosters immune tolerance; and (3) tissue regeneration, which enables longer-term structural repair of joint tissues. These effects evolve dynamically over time and&#x000a0;are influenced&#x000a0;by AD-MSC&#x000a0;source, dose, and biological behavior.&#x000a0;This&#x000a0;may help explain why autologous cells yield rapid pain relief, whereas allogeneic cells contribute more to long-term functional restoration.</p><p>Network consistency and validity of findings: To ensure the reliability of the NMA results, consistency testing was performed using both frequentist loop inconsistency tests and Bayesian node-splitting analysis at 12 months. Neither method identified statistically significant inconsistencies between direct and indirect treatment comparisons, indicating that the assumptions of the network meta-analysis remained valid.</p><p>Interpretation of treatment rankings and temporal efficacy trends: The rankings of AD-MSC&#x000a0;therapies for pain relief (VAS) and functional improvement (WOMAC) demonstrated notable shifts across time points, reflecting differences in mechanisms of action, dose-dependent responses, and treatment durability. High-dose autologous AD-MSCs provided sustained analgesic effects over time, ranking highest for pain relief at three, six, and 12 months. Notably, high-dose allogeneic AD-MSCs ranked highest for functional improvement at six and 12 months, suggesting a more gradual and sustained regenerative effect on joint function.</p><p>Implications of consistency testing on AD-MSC treatment rankings: The consistency testing results confirmed that the NMA upheld its assumptions, with no statistically significant inconsistencies between direct and indirect&#x000a0;estimates [<xref rid="REF22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].&#x000a0;Both loop inconsistency testing and Bayesian node-splitting analysis indicated strong agreement across most treatment comparisons, reinforcing confidence in the validity of SUCRA-based treatment rankings.</p><p>Despite the network's overall robustness, some comparisons, particularly those involving low-dose allogeneic AD-MSCs, exhibited wider confidence intervals due to limited direct evidence. This suggests that while the general treatment hierarchy remains reliable, rankings for treatments with fewer direct pairwise comparisons should be interpreted with greater caution. Additionally, the absence of long-term follow-up beyond 12 months limits the ability to assess sustained&#x000a0;efficacy [<xref rid="REF28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>Given these findings, the NMA results provide a strong evidence base for guiding treatment selection, but future studies with longer follow-up and additional direct comparisons will be necessary to refine treatment rankings further.&#x000a0;</p><p>Safety Considerations</p><p>Adverse effects and safety profile: The safety analysis highlighted the important trade-offs between efficacy and adverse effects. Among AD-MSC treatments, low-dose allogeneic AD-MSCs had the highest risk of adverse effects (SUCRA: 22.24%), followed by high-dose allogeneic AD-MSCs (SUCRA: 26.52%). High-dose autologous AD-MSCs, while ranking lower in safety than the control group, remained the safest among AD-MSC&#x000a0;therapies (SUCRA: 54.08%). The control group was found to be the safest option (SUCRA: 97.16%).</p><p>Serious adverse events (is AD-MSCs therapy risky?): Across the included studies, serious adverse events (SAEs) were rare and occurred at similar or higher rates in control groups compared to AD-MSC&#x000a0;treatment groups. No SAE was directly attributed to AD-MSC&#x000a0;therapy. For example, one SAE (1.92%) in a control group involved a joint infection requiring study withdrawal [<xref rid="REF16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], while another study [<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] reported a pneumonia case in a high-dose autologous AD-MSCs patient and three unrelated SAEs in the control group. Similarly, a third study [<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] observed one unrelated SAE in the low-dose allogeneic AD-MSCs group. These findings reinforce the safety of AD-MSC&#x000a0;therapy for clinical use in osteoarthritis.</p><p>Clinical relevance (are the AEs worth the benefit?): While high-dose AD-MSCs were occasionally associated with transient joint pain or swelling at the injection site, these effects were mild and resolved without intervention. To provide additional clinical context, the most frequently reported adverse events across the included studies included&#x000a0;arthralgia, joint swelling, injection site discomfort, and stiffness. In&#x000a0;Kim et al. (2023), 48 patients (38.4%) experienced at least one adverse event, with&#x000a0;50 Grade 1&#x000a0;and&#x000a0;22 Grade 2&#x000a0;events and no Grade &#x02265;3 events [<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].&#x000a0;Kuah et al. (2018)&#x000a0;reported that over&#x000a0;80% of events were mild, with a single&#x000a0;severe event&#x000a0;(prepatellar bursitis) potentially related to the injection [<xref rid="REF14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].&#x000a0;Lee et al. (2019)&#x000a0;documented&#x000a0;22 Grade 1,&#x000a0;9 Grade 2, and&#x000a0;3 Grade 3&#x000a0;events, all resolved without further treatment [<xref rid="REF15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].&#x000a0;Chen et al. (2021)&#x000a0;noted treatment-related&#x000a0;joint pain (15.8%),&#x000a0;arthralgia (14%), and&#x000a0;joint swelling (10.5%), with only one Grade &#x02265;3 AE considered related to treatment [<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. These data collectively reinforce the&#x000a0;favorable safety profile of AD-MSC therapy, particularly for high-dose autologous preparations.
Notably, high-dose autologous AD-MSCs offered the strongest efficacy and ranked safest among all treatment options. In contrast, low-dose allogeneic AD-MSCs had the highest rate of adverse events and provided less clinical benefit, raising questions about their clinical value.</p><p>Selecting the appropriate AD-MSC&#x000a0;dose and source should be based on individual patient factors such as osteoarthritis severity, symptom burden, and tolerance for mild adverse effects. For patients prioritizing symptom relief and functional recovery, particularly those with moderate to severe disease, high-dose autologous AD-MSCs may offer the most favorable balance of safety and efficacy.</p><p>Trade-off between efficacy and safety of AD-MSC therapy: The balance between efficacy and safety is a critical factor in clinical decision-making for AD-MSC&#x000a0;therapy in knee osteoarthritis. High-dose AD-MSCs demonstrated the greatest improvements in both pain relief (VAS) and functional outcomes (WOMAC), particularly when autologous AD-MSCs were used. Importantly, adverse event risk did not increase uniformly with dose. High-dose autologous AD-MSCs exhibited the most favorable safety profile, while low-dose allogeneic AD-MSCs had the highest incidence of mild-to-moderate adverse events. These findings challenge the assumption that lower doses are inherently safer and highlight the importance of considering both cell source and dose when evaluating AD-MSC&#x000a0;therapies.</p><p>Clinical Translation and Future Directions</p><p>Limitations and clinical implications: Several limitations must be acknowledged. Most included studies received partial or complete&#x000a0;industry sponsorship, which may introduce publication or performance bias. Additionally, relatively few&#x000a0;direct head-to-head comparisons exist&#x000a0;between dose levels or MSC sources, requiring reliance on indirect evidence within the NMA framework. These limitations restrict generalizability and underscore the need for standardized outcome definitions, longer follow-up, and non-industry-funded trials.</p><p>A further notable&#x000a0;notable source of heterogeneity in this meta-analysis is differences in outcome measurement tools and scale reporting. While all included studies assessed pain and function, the specific implementation of these measures varied. Some studies utilized a 0-100 mm VAS, while others used a 0-10 Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS), introducing potential scale-related inconsistencies. Similarly, WOMAC scores were reported either as raw totals (maximum 96), normalized percentages (0-100), or as subscales without a unified format. Although we applied standardized conversions to harmonize these scales, such differences in measurement and reporting may have contributed to the observed between-study heterogeneity. However, our sensitivity analysis demonstrated that our findings were not dependent on any single study; despite moderate shifts in effect size and heterogeneity when removing influential studies, the findings' overall significance and direction remained robust. This enhances confidence in the reliability of our pooled estimates. These inconsistencies highlight the importance of future research adopting unified reporting standards to facilitate more accurate comparisons.</p><p>From a clinical perspective, treatment selection may based on practical and biological factors. Autologous AD-MSCs may be ideal for younger patients with early to moderate OA (Kellgren-Lawrence Grade II-III), given the higher regenerative capacity of autologous cells and their safety profile. However, autologous therapy involves liposuction, cell processing, and delayed treatment, which may be costly and logistically intensive. Allogeneic AD-MSCs, by contrast, offer off-the-shelf availability, making them more feasible for older patients, patients with comorbidities, or those seeking faster access to therapy. Depending on patient characteristics and resource availability, clinicians may consider a phased strategy, using autologous MSCs for early intervention and allogeneic products for sustained joint support.</p><p>Implications for clinical decision-making: The absence of treatment-related serious adverse events strengthens AD-MSC&#x000a0;therapy's overall safety profile, supporting its clinical viability. Clinicians should inform patients about the possibility of mild, self-limiting side effects while reassuring them that serious complications are rare&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="REF29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p>These findings suggest that high-dose AD-MSC&#x000a0;therapy, particularly autologous AD-MSCs, may offer a favorable balance of safety and efficacy for many patients. However, the choice between autologous and allogeneic sources should be individualized based on patient goals, tolerability, and whether rapid symptom relief or long-term functional improvement is prioritized.</p><p>Therapeutic role of AD-MSCs in knee OA: The findings of this network meta-analysis provide valuable insights into the clinical application of AD-MSC&#x000a0;therapy for knee osteoarthritis. High-dose AD-MSCs, particularly autologous AD-MSCs, demonstrated superior efficacy in pain relief (VAS), while high-dose allogeneic AD-MSCs showed greater improvements in long-term joint function (WOMAC). These findings suggest that AD-MSC&#x000a0;therapy may offer a more effective alternative to conventional intra-articular treatments such as corticosteroids or hyaluronic acid, especially for patients who have not responded to traditional pharmacologic or injection-based therapies [<xref rid="REF27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="REF30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p>While surgical intervention such as total knee replacement (TKR) remains the definitive option for advanced knee OA, AD-MSC&#x000a0;therapy presents a promising regenerative approach for patients aiming to delay or avoid surgery [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. One study [<xref rid="REF31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] even reported that patients treated with MSCs in one knee and TKA in the other experienced better functional outcomes and fewer complications in the MSC-treated knee. Although these findings are preliminary, they underscore MSC therapy&#x02019;s potential role as an intermediate option between conservative care and surgery.</p><p>Given its favorable safety and efficacy profile, AD-MSC&#x000a0;therapy may serve as a valuable treatment strategy for patients with moderate to severe OA who are not yet candidates for surgery. Individualized treatment decisions should consider patient preferences, disease severity, and the desire to delay surgical intervention.</p><p>Should clinicians prefer autologous or allogeneic MSCs?: The choice between autologous and allogeneic AD-MSCs should be guided by treatment goals and clinical context. High-dose autologous AD-MSCs demonstrated stronger and more consistent pain relief across all time points, making them a compelling option for patients seeking rapid symptom control. In contrast, high-dose allogeneic AD-MSCs ranked higher for functional improvement at six and 12 months, suggesting greater long-term regenerative effects. Practical considerations also influence clinical decision-making. Autologous AD-MSCs require harvesting and processing from the patient, which may increase procedural burden, cost, and treatment delay. Meanwhile, allogeneic AD-MSCs offer off-the-shelf convenience, enabling easier access and potentially broader scalability [<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Future research priorities: While this study provides strong support for the clinical use of AD-MSC&#x000a0;therapy in knee osteoarthritis, several key research gaps remain. One major limitation is the short follow-up duration in most studies. Although this network meta-analysis assessed outcomes up to 12 months, the long-term durability of AD-MSC&#x000a0;therapy remains uncertain. Future trials should extend follow-up beyond 24 months to determine whether improvements in pain and function are sustained or decline over time [<xref rid="REF28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Long-term safety monitoring will also be critical to assess any delayed adverse effects, including immune responses or intra-articular complications such as fibrosis.</p><p>Another important priority is the need for direct, head-to-head randomized controlled trials comparing autologous and allogeneic AD-MSC. While this NMA provided indirect comparisons, direct evidence is needed to clarify differences in clinical efficacy, immune compatibility, and persistence within the joint environment [<xref rid="REF25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="REF31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><p>Additionally, future studies should explore biomarker-based patient selection strategies to optimize AD-MSC&#x000a0;therapy. Given the heterogeneity of OA progression and treatment response, identifying biological predictors of success could improve outcomes and reduce unnecessary exposure for non-responders. Biomarkers such as IL-6, TNF-&#x003b1;, synovial fluid composition, or cartilage degradation products may help identify patients most likely to benefit from AD-MSC therapy [<xref rid="REF32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="REF33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. This personalized approach could enhance treatment precision and maximize the clinical value of AD-MSC&#x000a0;in OA management.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This network meta-analysis demonstrates that high-dose AD-MSC therapy offers superior pain relief and functional improvement compared to conventional intra-articular treatments for knee osteoarthritis. A clear dose-dependent response was observed, with higher doses consistently outperforming lower doses in symptom relief and functional outcomes. High-dose autologous AD-MSCs were most effective for rapid and sustained pain reduction, while high-dose allogeneic AD-MSCs ranked highest for long-term functional recovery at six and 12 months, suggesting distinct therapeutic profiles. Although mild to moderate adverse effects such as transient joint pain and swelling were more common in high-dose groups, serious adverse events were rare and occurred at similar rates to control groups, supporting the overall safety of AD-MSC therapy.</p><p>Clinically, high-dose autologous AD-MSCs may be preferred for patients seeking immediate symptom relief, whereas high-dose allogeneic AD-MSCs may better support long-term joint function. Given its favorable safety profile and comparative effectiveness, AD-MSC therapy represents a promising alternative for patients who have not responded to conventional treatments such as corticosteroids or hyaluronic acid. Future research should prioritize long-term follow-up beyond 12 months, direct head-to-head comparisons of autologous and allogeneic AD-MSCs, biomarker-based patient selection, and the optimization of dosing protocols. This study provides a framework to guide dose- and source-specific selection of AD-MSC therapies in the management of knee osteoarthritis.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The author would like to sincerely acknowledge the unwavering support and encouragement of my wife, Ecem Kasagga, whose love, patience, and motivation made this work possible.</p></ack><fn-group content-type="conflict"><title>Disclosures</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Conflicts of interest:</bold> In compliance with the ICMJE uniform disclosure form, all authors declare the following:</p><p><bold>Payment/services info:</bold> All authors have declared that no financial support was received from any organization for the submitted work.</p><p><bold>Financial relationships:</bold> All authors have declared that they have no financial relationships at present or within the previous three years with any organizations that might have an interest in the submitted work.</p><p><bold>Other relationships:</bold> All authors have declared that there are no other relationships or activities that could appear to have influenced the submitted work.</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="other"><title>Author Contributions</title><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Concept and design:</bold>&#x000a0; Alousious Kasagga</p><p><bold>Acquisition, analysis, or interpretation of data:</bold>&#x000a0; Alousious Kasagga, Anushka Verma, Eiman Saraya, Mehjabin S.
