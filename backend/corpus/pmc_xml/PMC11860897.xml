However, there is a paucity of experimental studies specifically addressing the relationship between NALCN and immune cell infiltration in gastric cancer (GC).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>The expression levels of NALCN in tumor tissues, peripheral blood and gastric cancer cells lines from patients with GC were assessed using RNA sequencing, immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining and RT-qPCR. Data obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) databases were utilized to investigate the correlation between NALCN expression and immune cell infiltration in GC. Subsequently, the relationship between NALCN expression and infiltrating immune cells in GC tissues was examined through immunofluorescence method. Additionally, <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments were conducted to evaluate the impact of NALCN knockdown on T cells function in GC cell lines.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>RNA sequencing analysis revealed that NALCN expression was significantly downregulated in GC tissues. Specifically, NALCN levels were lower in GC tumor tissues and plasma compared to adjacent non-tumor tissues and healthy controls. Consistent with these findings, the expression trend of NALCN mRNA in the GEO database mirrored the experimental results. Mechanistically, NALCN knockdown markedly enhanced cell proliferation, colony formation and migration while reducing apoptosis rates in AGS and GES-1 cells. Analysis of the TCGA database indicated a positive correlation between NALCN expression and the infiltration of B cells, cytotoxic cells, immature dendritic cells (iDC) cells, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, and others in GC tissue. Conversely, Th17 and Th2 cells infiltration exhibited a negative correlation with NALCN expression. Immunofluorescence staining confirmed that B cells and CD8 T cells were more abundant in GC tumor tissues with high NALCN expression, whereas Th17 and Th2 cells were less prevalent. Subsequently, we co-cultured GC cells transfected with NALCN knockdown or control vectors along with their supernatants with T cells. The results demonstrated that NALCN knockdown in GC cells or their supernatants inhibited T cell proliferation compared to control conditions. Moreover, NALCN may play a role in glucose and glutamine uptake.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>NALCN facilitates immune cell aggregation in GC and has potential as a biomarker for immune infiltration.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>NALCN</kwd><kwd>gastric cancer (GC)</kwd><kwd>immune infiltration</kwd><kwd>tumor immune microenvironment (TIME)</kwd><kwd>biomarker</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>The author(s) declare that financial support was received for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.

According to Global Cancer Statistics 2022, it ranks fifth in incidence and is the fifth leading cause of cancer-related mortality, imposing a substantial burden on public health (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Although both the incidence and mortality rates of GC have shown a gradual decline, the global disease burden remains significant, with the highest incidence observed in East Asia and Eastern Europe, and the highest mortality rates in East Asia (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Currently, surgical resection remains the primary treatment for early-stage GC patients and is the only curative option available. However, only a limited proportion of GC patients are eligible for radical surgery. Despite notable advancements in diagnostic and treatment approaches, the overall cure and survival rates for GC remain disappointingly low, and long-term overall prognosis to be poor. This underscores the urgent need to address the considerable disease burden posed by GC (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>).</p><p>Currently, immunotherapy has made achieved substantial advancements relative to traditional systemic anti-tumor therapies, including chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and targeted therapies, thereby significantly enhancing progression-free survival and overall survival in patients with GC (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Previous studies have demonstrated that immunotherapies modalities such as immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), adoptive cell therapy, cancer vaccines, and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy have been extensively applied in the treatment of advanced GC (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). However, there is growing evidence that most patients do not benefit from immunoantitumor therapy such as ICIs, and some patients benefit briefly from immunotherapy and then progress rapidly (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). This phenomenon may be associated with the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME). Consequently, to identify novel immunotherapeutic targets for GC, screening for specific immune-related molecules has become a clinical priority.</p><p>NALCN is a relatively new cation channel discovered in recent years (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), which is mainly a group of genes associated with nerve. NALCN was first discovered in rat brains (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>) and is extensively expressed in neurons across the central nervous system of both mammals and invertebrates (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). NALCN channels modulate the resting membrane potential of neurons by facilitating sodium leak currents, thereby playing a crucial role in various biological processes, including nerve excitability, circadian rhythm regulation, and respiratory rhythm modulation (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Research has demonstrated that functional mutations in NALCN are associated with the development of neurological disorders (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>).</p><p>Recently, results from Richard J. Gilbertson&#x02019;s team have shed new light on NALCN. They discovered that the transport of epithelial cells to distant tissues is modulated by NALCN, thereby identifying NALCN as a critical regulator in cancer metastasis (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Chen et&#x000a0;al. found that NALCN is a key gene for malignant mutations in normal human liver cell lines (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). However, the potential mechanisms by which NALCN influences tumor development and its immune interactions with GC remain to be elucidated. Additionally, experimental studies investigating the association between NALCN and immune cell infiltration are currently limited.</p><p>In this study, we initially identified differentially expressed mRNAs in 22 paired GC tissues and their corresponding adjacent non-tumor tissues using RNA sequencing. Our results indicated that NALCN expression was significantly lower in GC tissues compared to adjacent non-tumor specimens. Subsequently, we validated the expression levels of NALCN in a large cohort by expanding the sample size and incorporating the data from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). Furthermore, we investigated the association of NALCN with immune cells in the TIME, which was further supported by <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments and comprehensive database analyses.</p><p>The objective of this study was to elucidate the critical role of NALCN in GC progression and to characterize immune cell infiltration within the tumor microenvironment. Furthermore, further revealing the potential relationship between NALCN and tumor infiltrating immune cells, as well as the mechanism by which NALCN influences this process. Ultimately, identifying new therapeutic targets for GC is expected to fundamentally transform the current treatment landscape.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2_1"><title>Patient samples and ethics statement</title><p>Fresh frozen GC tissue, adjacent non-cancerous tissue and paraffin-embedded tissue blocks were collected from 22 pairs of surgically resected specimens obtained between 2019 and 2023 from Shanxi Cancer Hospital (Shanxi, China). Additionally, peripheral blood samples were collected from 91 newly diagnosed GC patients who had not undergone surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy or immunotherapy between 2023 and 2024, as well as from 69 healthy volunteers.

In Homo sapiens, NALCN is encoded by a single gene (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>).

Their findings indicate that NALCN expression exhibits tissue specific and is aberrantly regulated in multiple cancer types, indicating its potential as a crucial biomarker for cancer diagnosis (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). More recently, Richard J.

Our findings revealed a significant downregulation of NALCN expression in GC tissues compared to normal tissues. Consistently, at the protein level, NALCN expression was also markedly reduced in GC tissues relative to normal tissues. These results suggest that NALCN may function as a potential tumor suppressor in GC. However, our findings were inconsistent between the expression trends of NALCN in GC tissues from our study and TCGA database reported by He et&#x000a0;al. (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Several factors may contribute to this discrepancy. Firstly, NALCN expression may vary across different pathological types of GC, as our tissue samples included not only STAD but also other subtypes. Secondly, NALCN expression could be tissue specific, which necessitates further investigation with an expanded sample size to validate this hypothesis. Subsequently, we performed immunofluorescence staining on GC patient tissues to characterize the expression levels of NALCN and investigate its potential correlation with immune cell infiltration. The results demonstrated that elevated NALCN expression was associated with increased immune cell aggregation and higher expression of immune cell markers. These findings indicate that NALCN is likely to play a role in the regulation of multiple immune cells and may possess potential prognostic significance in cancer immune therapies.</p><p>GC is among the most prevalent types of malignant tumors.

During tumor progression, the interaction between TIME and tumor cells can lead to tumor immune tolerance, thereby influencing the anti-tumor immune response (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>).</p><p>TIME comprises tumor cells, immune cells, cytokines, and other components. The interaction among these elements determines the direction of anti-tumor immunity, which can be is categorized into anti-tumor and pro-tumor. Anti-tumor immune cells primarily include effector T cells (such as cytotoxic CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and effector CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells), natural killer cells (NK), dendritic cells (DC). Conversely, tumor-promoting immune cells mainly consist of regulatory T cells (Tregs), myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), M2-polarized macrophages, etc. Additionally, metabolic and biochemical factors significantly influence the function of immune cell (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>).</p><p>An increasing body of research demonstrates that TIME is intricately linked to the clinical efficacy of immunotherapy. D&#x02019;Alterio et&#x000a0;al. reported that modulating CXCR4 within the TIME enhanced T cell infiltration, thereby improving the effectiveness of anti-PD-1 therapy (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). A recent study revealed that concurrent inhibition of PD-L1, CXCR1/2, and TGF-&#x003b2; significantly augmented T-cell infiltration and activation in the tumor microenvironment, consequently enhancing the antitumor activity of ICI (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of the molecular characteristics and immune status of TIME can facilitate the development of personalized immunotherapies for different GC patients. Currently, the availability of high-throughput sequencing data and large-scale immunization databases enables the identification of novel and reliable immune-related biomarker. Previous studies have utilized algorithms based on gene expression to develop immune signatures that predict clinical outcomes in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma or lung cancer (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). However, there remains a lack of biomarkers capable of systematically evaluating TIME and predicting prognosis or immunotherapy response in GC patients.</p><p>To summarize, this study represents the pioneering investigation into the relationship between NALCN and various types of immune cells through immunofluorescence staining. By leveraging publicly available databases, we confirmed the significant role of NALCN in the GC immune microenvironment. Immunofluorescence staining revealed that CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and B cells exhibited higher infiltration levels in samples with elevated NALCN expression, whereas lower NALCN expression was associated with reduced immune cell infiltration. These findings suggest that NALCN may play a crucial role in the regulating immune cell infiltration, thereby influencing the tumor microenvironment and immune response, potentially contributing to immune escape. Consequently, NALCN&#x02019;s influence on the tumor microenvironment may present a potential therapeutic target. However, further research is required to elucidate the precise mechanism by which NALCN affects GC immune infiltration. To explore this, we conducted co-culture experiments involving NALCN knockdown or control GC cells with T cells. The results indicated that NALCN knockdown significantly diminished the antitumor activity of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, reduced the granzyme B and IFN-&#x003b3; secretion in T cells, inhibited T cell proliferation (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">
<bold>Figures&#x000a0;5B&#x02013;D</bold>
</xref>), and promoted T cell apoptosis. This suggests that NALCN knockdown may suppress anti-tumor immunity by inhibiting T cell function and promoting tumor progression. Low NALCN expression is associated with altered tumor immunity and poor prognosis in GC patients.</p><p>However, there are several limitations. Firstly, bioinformatics analysis and patient tissue samples were utilized solely to verify the relationship between NALCN and immune cell infiltration. Considering the complexity of the TIME, employing animal models could provide a more comprehensive understanding of NALCN&#x02019;s role in GC immunity. The primary objective of this study was to investigate the correlation between NALCN expression and immune infiltration and its impact on the prognosis of GC patients. This research contributes to our understanding of the pivotal role of NALCN in human tumors, including GC.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our current study provided compelling evidence that elevated expression of NALCN promotes immune cell aggregation in GC and can serve as a potential biomarker for immune infiltration. This investigation elucidated several possible roles of NALCN in regulating immune cell infiltration with GC tissues. Nevertheless, further research is warranted to explore the molecular mechanism underlying NALCN&#x02019;s role in tumorigenesis and its clinical application prospect.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s6"><title>Data availability statement</title><p>Publicly available datasets were analyzed in this study.
