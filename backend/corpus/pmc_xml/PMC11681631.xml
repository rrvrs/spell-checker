Hypoxia-inducible factor-1&#x003b1; (HIF-1&#x003b1;) and the Hippo&#x02013;YAP pathway are implicated in these processes, but their specific roles remain unclear. This study investigated the HIF-1&#x003b1;/Hippo-YAP pathway in SAS-related hypertension.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">We established a rat model of SAS-induced hypertension via chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH). Rats were treated with siRNA targeting HIF-1&#x003b1;. Blood pressure, inflammation, oxidative stress, vascular remodeling, and VSMC function were assessed. In vitro experiments with A7r5 cells and human aortic smooth muscle cells (HAoSMCs) explored the effects of HIF-1&#x003b1; silencing and YAP1 overexpression.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">Compared with the control group, the CIH group presented significant increases in both HIF-1&#x003b1; and YAP1 expression, which correlated with increased blood pressure and vascular changes. HIF-1&#x003b1; silencing reduced hypertension, oxidative stress, inflammation, and the severity of vascular remodeling. Specifically, siRNA treatment for HIF-1&#x003b1; normalized blood pressure, decreased the levels of oxidative damage markers (increased SOD and decreased MDA), and reversed the changes in the levels of inflammatory markers (decreased high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and soluble E-selectin (sE-s)). Structural analyses revealed reduced vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation and collagen deposition, along with normalization of cellular markers, such as &#x003b1;-SMA and TGF-&#x003b2;1. Furthermore, the Hippo&#x02013;YAP pathway appeared to mediate these effects, as evidenced by altered YAP1 expression and activity upon HIF-1&#x003b1; modulation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">Our findings demonstrate the significance of the HIF-1&#x003b1;/Hippo-YAP pathway in CIH-induced hypertension and vascular remodeling. HIF-1&#x003b1; contributes to these pathophysiological processes by promoting oxidative stress, inflammation, and aberrant VSMC behavior. Targeting this pathway could offer new therapeutic strategies for CIH-related cardiovascular complications in SAS patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s10020-024-00987-5.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Sleep apnea syndrome</kwd><kwd>HIF-1&#x003b1;, Hippo</kwd><kwd>YAP</kwd><kwd>Vascular remodeling</kwd><kwd>Inflammation</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Joint Fund Project of the National Key Laboratory for the Etiology and Prevention of High-Incidence Diseases in Central Asia Co. built by Provincial and Ministerial Departments with Aral Hospital in 2023</institution></funding-source><award-id>SKL-HIDCA-2023-ALE3</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Research Project within the First Division Aral Hospital in 2023 </institution></funding-source><award-id>YNKY-202308</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Hangzhou City Medical and Health Science and Technology Project in 2023</institution></funding-source><award-id>B20230455</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>The Hangzhou City Medical and Health Science and Technology Project in 2021</institution></funding-source><award-id>A20210546</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research 2024</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par15">Sleep apnea syndrome (SAS) refers to the number of repeated apnea and hypopnea events over thirty during 7&#x000a0;h of sleep per night or a sleep apnea hypopnea index&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;5 times/h (Bhadriraju et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2008</xref>). Chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH), which is related to repeated upper airway collapse during sleep in SAS patients, is the major physiological feature of SAS and the main stimulus for comorbidities of SAS, such as cardiovascular comorbidities and systemic hypertension (Ma et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2016</xref>; Jordan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2014</xref>). Numerous studies have revealed that SAS-induced CIH is an independent risk factor for hypertension (Seravalle and Grassi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2022</xref>; Wang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2016</xref>), and the incidence of hypertension is significantly elevated in SAS patients (Akashiba et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2022</xref>). SAS causes or exacerbates hypertension via acute physiological impacts such as elevated left ventricular afterload, decreased left ventricular preload, increased sympathetic nerve activity, and increased neurohumoral factors (Floras <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2015</xref>). Vascular remodeling has been identified as the basis of the pathogenesis of SAS with hypertension (Arnaud et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2020</xref>). Therefore, investigating the underlying mechanism of CIH-induced hypertension might provide novel therapeutic targets for clinical practice.</p><p id="Par16">Emerging evidence suggests that alterations in the transcription of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) constitute a crucial molecular mechanism of SAS in hypertension (Prabhakar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2020</xref>). HIF-1 was the first discovered part of the HIF family, followed by HIF-2 (Heer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2020</xref>). HIF-1 is present in all mammalian cells, but HIF-2 is limited to certain tissues, including developing blood vessels, the lung, and the adrenal medulla (Zhang and Kong <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2023</xref>). Both HIF-1 and HIF-2 can be composed of an O<sub>2</sub>-regulated &#x003b1; subunit together with a constitutive &#x003b2; subunit (Ceranski et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2023</xref>). Hypoxia-inducible factor&#x02010;1&#x003b1; (HIF&#x02010;1&#x003b1;) is a subunit of HIF&#x02010;1 that plays a vital role in hypoxia-related signaling pathways by modulating various cellular and molecular events (Li et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2019</xref>). HIF&#x02010;1&#x003b1; has been shown to be highly expressed in patients with SAS and hypertension (Lu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2017</xref>). However, the specific role and possible mechanism of HIF&#x02010;1&#x003b1; in the SAS in patients with hypertension are obscure.</p><p id="Par17">The Hippo&#x02013;Yes&#x02013;associated protein (YAP) pathway affects many diseases (Lv and Ai <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2022</xref>). YAP1 is a transcriptional activator of Hippo signaling that combines with the HIF-1&#x003b1; protein in the nucleus and maintains its stability (Kashihara et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2022</xref>). As reported previously, the Hippo&#x02013;YAP pathway is implicated in promoting inflammation and oxidative stress in diseases (Zheng et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2021</xref>; Shao et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2014</xref>). In addition, the Hippo&#x02013;YAP pathway can change the production of the extracellular matrix as well as vascular smooth muscle cell growth and migration, contributing to vascular remodeling (He et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2018</xref>). However, the potential of the Hippo&#x02013;YAP pathway in SAS-related hypertension is unclear.</p><p id="Par18">Therefore, this study explored the potential of the HIF-1&#x003b1;/Hippo-YAP pathway in the progression of SAS-related hypertension.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Construction of the animal model</title><p id="Par19">The animal experiments were implemented with the approval of the animal ethical committee of our hospital. Eight-week-old male Sprague&#x02012;Dawley rats (Vital River, Beijing, China) were housed in a specific pathogen-free room at the proper temperature and provided with adequate food and water. Rats were exposed to CIH via an anoxic apparatus to establish an animal model of SAS complicated with hypertension. The specific procedure was as follows: (a) nitrogen (7%) was added for 1&#x000a0;min to maintain hypoxia, and (b) oxygen (20%) was added for 0.5&#x000a0;min to maintain reoxygenation. The cycles of a and b could be repeated every day from 9 am to 5 pm, and the total experiments lasted for 56 days. The rats were not given food or water when exposed to CIH via a hypoxic instrument. The control rats were kept in the same apparatus under normal air conditions (He et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2020</xref>; Guo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2022</xref>). The blood pressure of the caudal artery was measured via a blood pressure monitor on days 0, 14, 28, 42, and 56. At the end of the experiment, an animal model with a blood pressure greater than 150 mmHg was successfully established.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>In vivo HIF-1&#x003b1; treatment</title><p id="Par20">The rats were randomly separated into (a) control, (b) CIH, and (c) CIH&#x02009;+&#x02009;siRNA-HIF-1&#x003b1; groups (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;6 per group).

We also demonstrated that the downstream target YAP1 was upregulated and that its phosphorylation level (p-YAP1) was reduced in the aortic tissues of CIH rats, whereas HIF-1&#x003b1; silencing decreased the expression of YAP1 and elevated p-YAP1 levels, suggesting that the activation of the Hippo&#x02013;YAP signaling pathway in CIH rats was suppressed by HIF-1&#x003b1; knockdown (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A). Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B shows a progressive increase in systolic blood pressure over 56 days in the CIH-exposed rats. Conversely, rats in the CIH&#x02009;+&#x02009;siRNA-HIF-1&#x003b1; group displayed a notable reduction in blood pressure, underscoring the hypertensive role of HIF-1&#x003b1; in this model.</p><p id="Par36">

</p><p id="Par37">Furthermore, we investigated the influence of HIF-1&#x003b1; on oxidative stress and inflammation, which are critical components in the development of hypertension in SAS. Our data, presented in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>C, indicate that superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity was significantly compromised in the CIH group but was preserved upon HIF-1&#x003b1; silencing, suggesting a protective role against oxidative damage. Additionally, the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), a marker of lipid peroxidation, were elevated in the CIH group but were mitigated by siRNA-HIF-1&#x003b1; treatment (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>D).</p><p id="Par38">Inflammatory profiling further revealed elevated levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and serum endothelin (s-Es) in the CIH group.

Histological analysis via H&#x00026;E staining revealed cardiomyocyte degeneration and blood vessel dilation in the CIH group. Importantly, these pathological changes were significantly reduced in the rats pretreated with siRNA-HIF-1&#x003b1;. Additionally, the CIH group exhibited an irregular arrangement of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and increased thickness of the vascular media layer, both of which were ameliorated following siRNA-HIF-1&#x003b1; treatment. Furthermore, Masson&#x02019;s trichrome staining revealed increased collagen deposition within the vessel wall in the CIH group, indicative of vascular fibrosis; this effect was also mitigated following HIF-1&#x003b1; knockdown (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A&#x02012;C). To characterize vascular remodeling further, we assessed the expression of &#x003b1;-smooth muscle actin (&#x003b1;-SMA), a marker of the VSMC contractile phenotype, and transforming growth factor-&#x003b2;1 (TGF-&#x003b2;1), a potent profibrotic factor. Immunohistochemistry and western blot analyses revealed decreased &#x003b1;-SMA and increased TGF-&#x003b2;1 expression in the CIH group. Additionally, we verified the CIH-induced upregulation of HIF-1&#x003b1; and Ki67 and the reduction in TUNEL-positive cells. Western blot analysis also revealed that the expression of Ki67 and Bcl-2 was elevated, whereas that of Bax was decreased in the rat aorta tissue and heart tissue in the CIH group. Strikingly, these alterations were reversed following siRNA-HIF-1&#x003b1; administration (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>D and E), suggesting that HIF-1&#x003b1; plays a key role in promoting the phenotypic changes associated with vascular remodeling.</p><p id="Par40">

Notably, HIF-1&#x003b1; silencing resulted in decreased expression of the transcriptional coactivator YAP1, along with increased phosphorylation of YAP1 (p-YAP1), in A7r5 cells and HAoSMCs, indicating pathway inactivation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>A, Figure <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>A).

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec23" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par47">SAS and hypertension coexist and are closely related (Gonzalez-Pliego et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2016</xref>). SAS-induced oxidative stress is the main cause of hypertension (Dumitrascu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2013</xref>). In addition, inflammation is considered copathogenesis of SAS together with hypertension (Wang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2023a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">b</xref>). As a crucial end product of lipid oxidation, MDA induces tissue damage and is a vital index for evaluating oxidative damage (Tsikas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2017</xref>). SOD is a crucial antioxidant enzyme that over clears reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Yang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2022</xref>). Hs-CRP is an indicator of systemic inflammation (Moutachakkir et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2017</xref>), IL-6 can trigger and enhance vascular inflammation and contribute to SAS (Imani et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2020</xref>), and sE-s are indicators of endothelial dysfunction (Roldan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2003</xref>). In the present study, the levels of hs-CRP, IL-6 and sE-s in the serum of SAS-hypertensive rats induced by CIH were elevated, the MDA level was increased, and the SOD level was decreased, suggesting that high levels of inflammation and severe oxidative damage are related to SAS combined with hypertension.</p><p id="Par48">Vascular remodeling is a complicated process involving thickening of the vascular wall, narrowing of the lumen and vascular dysfunction (Wang and Khalil <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2018</xref>). The imbalance between the proliferation and apoptosis of VSMCs as well as the transition from a contractile phenotype to a synthetic phenotype of VSMCs are crucial factors for vascular remodeling (Yu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2022</xref>). During hypertension, the expression of &#x003b1;-SMA, a systolic marker of VSMCs, is decreased (Zhang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2017</xref>). The proliferation, migration and synthesis of large amounts of ECM components in VSMCs can also cause vascular remodeling (Zou et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2022</xref>). TGF-&#x003b2;1 induces ECM deposition along with fibroblast proliferation, stimulates the transformation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts, and promotes vascular remodeling (Jia et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2023</xref>). Therefore, &#x003b1;-SMA together with TGF-&#x003b2;1 is a vital indicator of vascular remodeling. In the present study, CIH exposure reduced &#x003b1;-SMA expression but increased TGF-&#x003b2;1 expression in rats. Moreover, histological staining revealed increased collagen deposition and changes consistent with vascular remodeling after exposure to CIH.</p><p id="Par49">Repeated apnea leads to CIH-induced HIF-1&#x003b1; upregulation and increased ROS production, thus promoting the occurrence of hypertension (Guo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2022</xref>). In this study, HIF-1&#x003b1; expression increased in rats after CIH exposure. Knockdown of HIF-1&#x003b1; repressed the systolic blood pressure, oxidative stress, inflammation and vascular remodeling stimulated by CIH, which was consistent with the findings of previous studies (Luo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2019</xref>).</p><p id="Par50">It is well known that YAP1 can promote VSMC phenotypic modulation and vascular remodeling (Osman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2021</xref>; Lin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2018</xref>). HIF-1&#x003b1; increases the nuclear localization of YAP while decreasing its phosphorylation (Ma et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2017</xref>). Hypoxia promotes the binding of YAP to HIF-1&#x003b1; in the nucleus, thereby stabilizing the HIF-1&#x003b1; protein (Zheng et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2023</xref>). Our research revealed that silencing HIF-1&#x003b1; reduced YAP1 expression but increased p-YAP1 levels. Moreover, overexpression of YAP1 reversed the inhibited proliferation and migration as well as increased apoptosis in HIF-1&#x003b1;-silenced A7r5 cells and HAoSMCs, suggesting that HIF-1&#x003b1; promotes VSMC proliferation by activating the Hippo&#x02013;YAP pathway, which was in line with the findings of a previous study (Chen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2018</xref>).</p><p id="Par51">This study has several limitations. First, only young adult male rats were used, whereas sleep apnea is commonly observed in elderly women in clinical settings. Future studies should incorporate both aging and sex as variables to fully explore the role of HIF-1&#x003b1; and its regulatory mechanisms. Second, while we investigated the role of the Hippo&#x02013;YAP pathway in hypoxia-exposed cells, further validation of whether HIF-1&#x003b1; exacerbates CIH-induced hypertension through the Hippo&#x02013;YAP pathway in vivo is necessary.</p><p id="Par52">In conclusion, this study is the first to demonstrate that HIF-1&#x003b1; knockdown alleviates hypertension, inflammation, oxidative stress, and vascular remodeling in a CIH-induced hypertension model. These effects are mediated through the activation of the Hippo&#x02013;YAP pathway. Our findings suggest that targeting HIF-1&#x003b1; could be a promising therapeutic strategy for managing CIH-related hypertension in SAS patients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.</p><p>
