<xref rid="ref-2" ref-type="bibr">American Psychiatric Association, 2013</xref>). It is primarily characterized by (i) reexperiencing symptoms, reliving the traumatic event in the form of flashbacks and nightmares, (ii) avoidance symptoms, a deliberate effort to avoid reminders of the traumatic event/s, (ii) negative cognitions and mood, and (iii) hyperarousal symptoms, such as irritability, aggression, risky or destructive behaviour, hypervigilance, heightened startle reaction, and difficulty concentrating and sleeping (
<xref rid="ref-2" ref-type="bibr">American Psychiatric Association, 2013</xref>). Furthermore, it is common for individuals with PTSD to suffer from psychiatric comorbidities including anxiety, depression, substance use disorder, and insomnia (

<italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2016</xref>;
<xref rid="ref-72" ref-type="bibr">Whitworth
<italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). While 25&#x02013;40% of PTSD cases can be expected to remit within one year, for many these symptoms can endure indefinitely (
<xref rid="ref-12" ref-type="bibr">Bromet
<italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2017</xref>). Many psychological treatments have demonstrated efficacy for PTSD, the strongest evidence exists for trauma-focused interventions, such as cognitive behavioral therapy with a trauma focus (
<xref rid="ref-22" ref-type="bibr">Department of Veterans Affairs, 2017</xref>;
<xref rid="ref-41" ref-type="bibr">International Society for Traumatic Stress Studies, 2019</xref>). For these evidence-based treatments, many fail to respond to treatment and dropout rates are high (

<xref rid="ref-43" ref-type="bibr">Kehle-Forbes
<italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2016</xref>). High dropout rates have been linked to poorer PTSD treatment outcomes (

<xref rid="ref-14" ref-type="bibr">Caspersen
<italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 1985</xref>). Exercise is a safe, readily accessible, and cost-effective way of improving physical and mental health (

<italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Exercise has been found to reduce PTSD symptom severity as well as related physical and mental health problems, such as anxiety, depression, pain disorders, sleep disturbances, and cardiovascular diseases (
<xref rid="ref-51" ref-type="bibr">Oppizzi &#x00026; Umberger, 2018</xref>). Unfortunately, people with PTSD are more likely than the general population to be physically inactive (
<xref rid="ref-66" ref-type="bibr">Vancampfort

<xref rid="ref-67" ref-type="bibr">Vancampfort
<italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2017</xref>). The mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of exercise, when incorporated into the treatment of PTSD, are not fully understood (
<xref rid="ref-18" ref-type="bibr">Crombie
<italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2023</xref>).</p><p>Fear extinction, essential for reducing fear responses to trauma-related cues, is often impaired in individuals with PTSD, resulting in persistent fear and anxiety (
<xref rid="ref-78" ref-type="bibr">Lokshina
<italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2023</xref>). These impairments, linked to dysfunctional neural circuits, especially in the amygdala and prefrontal cortex, hinder the retention of extinction memories, sustaining symptoms such as hypervigilance and intrusive thoughts. By helping individuals distinguish between trauma memories and safe present contexts, fear extinction can reduce anxiety and avoidance behaviors in everyday life.</p><p>In terms of biomedical mechanisms, it has been hypothesized that exercise-induced changes in neurotransmitters, neurotransmitter modulators, and peptides may modulate molecular processes in key neural pathways underlying enhanced consolidation of extinction learning. Implicated mechanisms include endocannabinoids, dopaminergic signalling, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and neurotrophic factors such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which regulates synaptic plasticity, long-term learning, and memory (
<xref rid="ref-42" ref-type="bibr">Izquierdo
<italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2016</xref>;
<xref rid="ref-68" ref-type="bibr">Vecchio
<italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2018</xref>). </p><p>Important to note is the fact that many of the mechanisms that regulate fear extinction are modulated by exercise. This suggests that exercise could be an effective augmentation of psychotherapy for PTSD. Recent investigations suggest that moderate-intensity aerobic exercise during the consolidation window of fear extinction, using exposure-based psychotherapy, reduces threat expectations and symptom severity in women with PTSD (
<xref rid="ref-19" ref-type="bibr">Crombie
<italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2021a</xref>;
<xref rid="ref-20" ref-type="bibr">Crombie
<italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2021b</xref>). For example, previous studies suggest that higher serum levels of BDNF enhance fear extinction. Individuals with low levels of BDNF, like those with Met allele carriers, have impaired fear extinction and thus present with more severe PTSD symptom severity. Exercise modulates genes that regulate BDNF, enhancing fear extinction and reducing PTSD symptom severity (
<xref rid="ref-54" ref-type="bibr">Pitts
<italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2019</xref>;
<xref rid="ref-55" ref-type="bibr">Powers
<italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In addition, because of their roles in regulating stress response and fear memories, endocannabinoids are potential target drugs or therapies for PTSD and other trauma-related mental disorders. A case-control study among trauma survivors in Northern Uganda with and without PTSD reported significant reductions in endocannabinoids among survivors with PTSD (
<xref rid="ref-73" ref-type="bibr">Wilker
<italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2016</xref>). The authors suggested that the differential reduction in endocannabinoids in survivors with PTSD negatively affected fear extinction. Moreover, another study reported an inverse relationship between the level of endocannabinoids and PTSD symptom severity. PTSD symptom severity could potentially be reduced through exercise-induced elevation of the levels of circulating blood endocannabinoids (
<xref rid="ref-11" ref-type="bibr">Botsford
<italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2023</xref>;
<xref rid="ref-20" ref-type="bibr">Crombie
<italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2021b</xref>). Moderating levels of endocannabinoids is, therefore, a promising strategy for managing PTSD.</p><p>Other studies have shown that the effects of anxiolytics and antidepressants likely stem from the effects on neurogenesis through the PGc1alpha-FNDC5-BDNF (
<xref rid="ref-3" ref-type="bibr">Babaei

<xref rid="ref-1" ref-type="bibr">Alghadir &#x00026; Gabr, 2020</xref>). The effects of exercise on enhancing extinction learning and augmenting exposure therapy in PTSD also involves neurochemical events involving the endocannabinoid system (
<xref rid="ref-46" ref-type="bibr">Marsicano
<italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2002</xref>), dopaminergic signalling (

<xref rid="ref-48" ref-type="bibr">Moya
<italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2020</xref>). Further, exercise has been reported to enhance pattern separation and episodic memory (
<xref rid="ref-23" ref-type="bibr">D&#x000e9;ry
<italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2013</xref>), which is important in differentiating safety from threat and restricting avoidance behaviour. Avoidance behavior, a hallmark symptom of PTSD, reflects an impaired ability to process contextual cues, leading to the generalization of fear responses to non-threatening situations (
<xref rid="ref-79" ref-type="bibr">Sheynin
<italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2017</xref>). It has been postulated that this effect is modulated by exercise-induced increases in hippocampal volume (
<xref rid="ref-28" ref-type="bibr">Erickson
<italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2011</xref>).</p><p>With regard to psychosocial mechanisms, self-efficacy theory, distraction hypothesis, and social interaction have been used to explain the beneficial effects of exercise for PTSD. Self-efficacy refers to an individual&#x02019;s belief in their ability to meet a desired goal, and has been proposed as a psychological mechanism responsible for the beneficial effects of exercise on mental health (
<xref rid="ref-47" ref-type="bibr">McAuley &#x00026; Blissmer, 2000</xref>;
<xref rid="ref-58" ref-type="bibr">Robert, 2018</xref>). According to the self-efficacy theory, self-efficacy can be increased in several ways; for example, through mastery experiences and vicarious learning (
<xref rid="ref-5" ref-type="bibr">Bandura, 1977</xref>). Negative cognitions/affect, which is a core feature of PTSD, often leads to low self-esteem, self-efficacy and feelings of fear, shame, and guilt (
<xref rid="ref-2" ref-type="bibr">American Psychiatric Association, 2013</xref>;
<xref rid="ref-10" ref-type="bibr">Bonfils
<italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2018</xref>). Research suggest that exercise can increase self-efficacy and feelings of accomplishment, which can lead to mental health benefits such as decreased anxiety, depression and PTSD symptoms (
<xref rid="ref-9" ref-type="bibr">Bodin &#x00026; Martinsen, 2004</xref>). The distraction hypothesis proposes that when one is engaged in exercise, it is difficult to focus on their negative thinking and cognitive distortions (
<xref rid="ref-58" ref-type="bibr">Robert, 2018</xref>). Exercise can serve as a distraction from intrusive memories and negative cognitions, core symptoms of PTSD, which can lead to improve mood during and post exercise. Furthermore, exercise has been shown to positively impact resilience and mental health across diverse populations (

<xref rid="ref-93" ref-type="bibr">Liu
<italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2024</xref>). For example, a cross-sectional study conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic found that exercise, particularly outdoor group activities, enhanced resilience, with stronger effects observed in women (
<xref rid="ref-92" ref-type="bibr">Lancaster &#x00026; Callaghan, 2022</xref>). These findings highlight the potential of exercise as a valuable strategy for promoting resilience and mitigating the negative effects of traumatic events (
<xref rid="ref-91" ref-type="bibr">Kochi
<italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2017</xref>). Lastly, the benefits of social support are well-documented in the PTSD literature. Perceived social support has been associated with reduced PTSD symptom severity, as it is regarded as one of the strongest predictors (
<xref rid="ref-56" ref-type="bibr">Price
<italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2018</xref>;
<xref rid="ref-77" ref-type="bibr">Zalta
<italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). Exercise can serve as a social activity, with mutual support among individuals involved providing a sense of connection with others. This can result in increased social interaction, which in turn can lead to improvements in PTSD related outcomes (
<xref rid="ref-74" ref-type="bibr">Wilkins
<italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Considering the above, exercise can play an important role in reducing symptom severity and/or improving functional impairment (e.g., disability, quality of life) in patients with PTSD and other trauma-related mental disorders. Functional impairment captures the extent to which symptoms of PTSD interfere with daily activities. This outcome reflects the impact of PTSD on quality of life and day-to-day functioning and is distinct from symptom severity, as a person might experience high functional impairment even with moderate symptom severity, or vice versa (
<xref rid="ref-94" ref-type="bibr">Ust&#x000fc;n &#x00026; Kennedy, 2009</xref>). Nevertheless, the precise mechanisms underpinning the effect of exercise in PTSD management are not fully understood. There is a need to move beyond providing evidence that exercise is effective as an adjunctive treatment, which several studies have already done. Investigation into biological and psychosocial mechanisms of exercise in PTSD and its psychotherapy augmenting mechanisms is an emerging and as yet poorly understood field. Systematic investigation of the underlying mechanisms of its effect and synthesizing these findings into living evidence, which is currently scarce, will be a major contribution to precision care in PTSD (
<xref rid="ref-18" ref-type="bibr">Crombie
<italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2023</xref>). It will provide knowledge on the mechanisms of exercise that drive the discovery of other interventions (non-drug and drug) that work through the same or similar mechanisms.</p><p>Elucidating the potential mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of exercise for PTSD is firstly important for fundamental knowledge; secondly, it can shed light on individual-level differences in the effectiveness of exercise for PTSD; and thirdly, it can inform the discovery of other interventions to target these mechanisms. The aim of this living systematic review is to review the evidence on the biopsychosocial mechanisms through which exercise (i.e., aerobic exercise, resistance training, etc.) can facilitate extinction learning, memory, and emotion regulation in PTSD and thereby reduce symptom severity and/or functional impairment.</p></sec><sec><title>Review objectives</title><p>To review the biopsychosocial mechanisms through which exercise reduces symptom severity and functional impairment among individuals with PTSD.</p></sec><sec><title>Research questions</title><p>

<italic toggle="yes">Examining the associations between exercise, mediators and outcomes</italic>
</bold>
</p><p>To explain the biopsychosocial mechanisms through which exercise affects the outcome of interest (PTSD symptom severity) for research questions I in humans and animals, we will examine potential mediating variables. A mediating variable directly affects the relationship between the independent and dependent variables, which provides an (often partial) explanation for why the relationship exists. To give a biomedical example, it has been hypothesized that exercise (independent variable) modulates genes that regulate BDNF (mediator), which in turn reduces PTSD symptom severity (dependent variable/outcome). Similarly, in terms of psychosocial mechanisms, exercise (independent variable) can lead to increased self-efficacy (mediator), which in turn reduces PTSD symptom severity (dependent variable/outcome).
<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref> shows a very simplified version of the mediation of the effect of exercise on PTSD symptom severity mediated via BDNF. For research questions I, we will extract data that evaluate the associations of type B (the impact of exercise on a mediator) and C (the impact of the mediator on the outcome).</p><fig position="float" fig-type="figure" id="f1"><label>Figure 1a. </label><caption><title>Example of a mediation of the effect of exercise on improving PTSD symptoms via changing the levels of BDNF.</title><p>Assuming a continuous outcome and mediator, the indirect effect of exercise on the outcome A

Effect modifiers affect the strength of the relationship between exercise and PTSD symptoms, and by examining them, we might gain some insight into what mechanisms are at play. For example, if sex was found to be a strong modifier of the relationship between exercise and PTSD symptom severity, this could be indicative of different mechanisms of action between males and females.</p><p>The potential mediators and effect modifiers are currently unknown so, for both non-human and human studies, we make some assumptions below about the variables we suspect could be either mediators or modifiers.

There are often relatively trivial differences in values extracted from graphs for continuous data, therefore we will flag for reconciliation those data points for which the discrepancy between the two reviewers is greater than 10%.

However, non-human studies have provided us with a deeper understanding of the mechanisms behind human functioning, leading to substantial advancements in the medical field (
<xref rid="ref-34" ref-type="bibr">Giannakou &#x00026; Vyrides, 2021</xref>).</p><p>The evidence about the potential mediators of the association between exercise and PTSD-related outcomes from human and non-human studies will be considered in an expert meeting when there is sufficient evidence available from at least two sources. The participants in the meeting will consider the evidence from the human and non-human studies as summarized in the Summary of the Evidence on Moderators (SEM). We will attempt to organize the examined mediators according to a hierarchy of association and classify them as probable or improbable mediators of the association. We will also consider whether the review should continue for some or all studied outcomes, and the type of update that should be done (see SUMMARY OF THE EVIDENCE, for research questions I).</p></sec><sec><title>Updating the systematic review and stopping the living mode of the review</title><p>This study will be set up as an LSR, a high-quality online summary of the scientific literature updated as new research that meets study inclusion criteria becomes available (
<xref rid="ref-26" ref-type="bibr">Elliott
<italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2014</xref>). Once we have completed the first version of the systematic review, the methods applied will be reconsidered to judge their suitability and efficiency in practice. If judged to be appropriate, the methodological approaches of data extraction and synthesis will be amended accordingly, and any changes will be documented. The literature search will be updated every three months, and any new studies meeting the inclusion criteria will be incorporated into the latest version of the evidence. If sufficient new data exists, a triangulation meeting will be held to incorporate the new evidence. Furthermore, it will be decided whether the review updates will continue, and whether to widen the scope of the review (this may include contacting authors of major studies to provide missing data). When there is insufficient new data to warrant triangulation, the review will be updated again after three months. We will also consider whether to incorporate hypothesis testing of identified probable mediators as a specific aim going forward. The living systematic review will use a versioning system based on the one used by F1000. We will clearly report all updates, and any deviations from the methods outlined in this protocol will be documented and justified.</p></sec><sec><title>Co-production aspects</title><p>We have employed a multidisciplinary approach by considering the perspectives, experience, and knowledge of multiple stakeholders such as preclinical and clinical researchers, clinicians, systematic review methodologists, statisticians, and experiential advisors.</p><p>In formulating the focus of the review, we utilized existing prioritization exercises that had co-production embedded in their process, namely, the UK MH research goals 2020&#x02013;2023, the WHO Grand Challenges in Mental Health (
<xref rid="ref-17" ref-type="bibr">Collins
<italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2011</xref>) and the James Lind Alliance&#x02019;s Top 10 Priorities for Depression (2016) and Schizophrenia (2011). Common themes emerged, including research to develop new and improved treatments, root causes, a better understanding of therapeutic mechanisms for current drug and psychological treatments, and this is the starting point for the initial LSR questions within GALENOS.</p><p>To ensure the comprehensive consideration of perspectives from all stakeholders involved, we will assemble a team of co-authors who represent the diverse backgrounds mentioned above. It is anticipated that each co- author will substantially contribute more to specific sections based on their individual experiences and expertise. The review team will be provided with guidance by work package 1 (WP1) on effective models of involvement for Experiential Advisors. As a result, a multidisciplinary approach will be implemented throughout all stages of the review, from identifying needs, formulating the research aims, designing the review, and interpreting and disseminating the findings to the research and public community.</p><p>Considering the complexity and multidimensionality of the review topic, we will establish a schedule of regular team meetings and foster effective communication within the GALENOS project. The primary objective of these initiatives is to facilitate a shared understanding, promote the transferability of knowledge, encourage the exchange of ideas and perspectives, and identify the distinct needs of various stakeholders. By implementing these measures, we aim to create an environment where all stakeholders have equal standing and can actively contribute to the collaborative production of the review.</p></sec><sec><title>Dissemination of information</title><p>This LSR will be published via the GALENOS Gateway on Wellcome Open Research, the GALENOS website, and the quarterly Research Roundup newsletter on Mental Health Research issues. A Plain English summary will accompany the review. We will use social media (e.g., Twitter, Facebook) and write blog posts that will be available on the GALENOS website to disseminate our findings further. Furthermore, we aim to present GALENOS at the World Congress of Biological Psychiatry as well as other conferences.</p></sec><sec><title>Study status</title><p>The study status at the date of submission 11.08.2023 is reported below.</p><p>

<underline>Author response</underline>
</bold> Thank you for taking the time to review our protocol paper,
<italic toggle="yes">Mechanisms through which exercise reduces symptom severity and/or functional impairment in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD): Protocol for a living systematic review of human and non-human studies</italic>. We respectfully disagree with the suggestion that the protocol paper does not warrant independent publication. Protocol papers are critical for maintaining transparency and accountability in systematic reviews. They provide a publicly accessible record of the planned methods and objectives, enabling readers to evaluate whether the living systematic review adheres to its original stated intent. This is particularly important for living reviews, where iterative updates are expected as new evidence emerges. Since the decision on whether protocols are suitable for publication in a journal depends on the journal's policies, it is important to highlight the policy of Wellcome Open Research regarding systematic review protocols: &#x0201c;The peer review focuses on whether the paper has full academic merit, not on interest or novelty, and we welcome protocols for any study design in these Wellcome-funded areas&#x02026; Protocols for systematic reviews should be registered and must follow the PRISMA-P guidelines.&#x0201d; (
<ext-link xlink:href="https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/for-authors/article-guidelines/preparing-a-study-protocol-article" ext-link-type="uri">https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/for-authors/article-guidelines/preparing-a-study-protocol-article</ext-link>) Publishing a protocol separately ensures that the review process is grounded in pre-specified plans, reducing the potential for selective reporting or unintentional deviations. It provides a detailed roadmap of the methods, including inclusion and exclusion criteria, data extraction strategies, and bias mitigation measures, thereby enhancing the rigor and credibility of the review. The protocol paper also facilitates replication by making the methodological framework accessible to other researchers providing a replicable model for future systematic reviews in PTSD and related fields. Furthermore, publishing the protocol allows for early engagement with peers, enabling constructive feedback that can improve the quality of the systematic review before its results are synthesized. This engagement aligns with the ethos of transparency and collaboration promoted by open-access platforms like Wellcome Open Research. Living systematic reviews are dynamic by nature, incorporating new evidence over time. A protocol serves as a stable reference point, ensuring that updates to the review remain aligned with the original methodological framework. Additionally, including an abridged version of the methods in the main review paper will not capture the depth of methodological detail or rationale that would be provided in a standalone protocol. Having a dedicated protocol allows readers to fully understand the rigor underlying the systematic review process. In light of these considerations, we believe that the independent publication of the protocol paper would significantly strengthen the transparency, reproducibility, and overall impact of our research. We hope this explanation underscores the importance of publishing the protocol in Wellcome Open Research.</p></body></sub-article></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reviewer-report" id="report106653"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.21956/wellcomeopenres.22038.r106653</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer response for version 1</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Sheynin</surname><given-names>Jony</given-names></name><xref rid="r106653a1" ref-type="aff">1</xref><role>Referee</role><contrib-id contrib-id-type="orcid">https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8463-2317</contrib-id></contrib><aff id="r106653a1">

</italic> Thank you for your thoughtful suggestion. We agree that understanding the role of exercise in building resilience and potentially preventing PTSD is an important avenue for research. However, we have chosen to focus specifically on populations with a clinical diagnosis of PTSD or those who have above-threshold symptoms of PTSD. This decision aligns with our goal to maintain a focused and clinically relevant scope that addresses the unique therapeutic needs and mechanisms pertinent to individuals already experiencing PTSD. The mechanisms underlying the effects of exercise any mirror mechanisms underlying PTSD, such as those involved in fear extinction, neuroplasticity, and stress response regulation. These mechanisms are often trauma-specific, with distinct neurochemical and physiological responses that may not be present in healthy individuals or those without a PTSD diagnosis. By examining these mechanisms within a PTSD cohort, we aim to better elucidate how exercise interventions can be optimized for therapeutic impact in this population. &#x000a0;</p><p>

</italic> In the start of the Methods section, we have added: &#x0201c;
<underline>A LSR is a systematic review that is continually updated as new research emerges, ensuring the evidence base remains up-to-date. This method is particularly valuable in rapidly advancing fields, where integrating new findings in real-time can significantly improve clinical practice and policy-making </underline>
<underline>(Elliott et al., 2014)</underline>&#x0201d; (pg 8) Additionally, under
<italic toggle="yes">Updating the systematic review and stopping the living mode of the review</italic>, we state: &#x0201c;This study will be set up as an LSR, a high-quality online summary of the scientific literature updated as new research that meets study inclusion criteria becomes available (Elliott et al., 2014). Once we have completed the first version of the systematic review, the methods applied will be reconsidered to judge their suitability and efficiency in practice. If judged to be appropriate, the methodological approaches of data extraction and synthesis will be amended accordingly, and any changes will be documented. The literature search will be updated every three months, and any new studies meeting the inclusion criteria will be incorporated into the latest version of the evidence. If sufficient new data exists, a triangulation meeting will be held to incorporate the new evidence. Furthermore, it will be decided whether the review updates will continue, and whether to widen the scope of the review (this may include contacting authors of major studies to provide missing data). When there is insufficient new data to warrant triangulation, the review will be updated again after three months. We will also consider whether to incorporate hypothesis testing of identified probable mediators as a specific aim going forward. The living systematic review will use a versioning system based on the one used by F1000.

<bold>This protocol will focus on 2 main clinical outcomes: &#x0201c;symptom severity&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;functional impairment&#x0201d; (e.g., see title). While the first outcome is indeed very clear, I suggest to clarify the latter outcome. What is exactly meant by functional impairment in PTSD and how is it distinct from symptoms severity?</bold>

</italic> Functional impairment captures the extent to which these symptoms interfere with daily activities. This outcome reflects the impact of PTSD on quality of life and day-to-day functioning and is distinct from symptom severity, as a person might experience high functional impairment even with moderate symptom severity, or vice versa. In our review, functional impairment will be assessed through validated scales like the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) and other self-reported or clinician-assessed measures that evaluate disability and quality of life. By including this outcome, we aim to provide a more comprehensive view of how exercise interventions may improve not only the symptoms of PTSD but also the overall functional capacity and life satisfaction of individuals affected by the disorder. In the methods section, under

<bold> he review will focus on individuals with PTSD. However, symptom severity and functional impairment can also be analyzed in subthreshold PTSD, i.e., in individuals who develop PTSD symptoms but are not diagnosed with PTSD, per se. This could also be included in this review and the title could be edited, accordingly.</bold>

</italic> We are including participants with above-threshold PTSD symptoms, in addition to those with a formal diagnosis of PTSD. Individuals with above-threshold PTSD symptoms on standardized self-report measure experience a clinically meaningful level of distress and impairment, even if they do not have a formal PTSD diagnosis. These participants often require similar treatment interventions and face comparable challenges in daily life as those with a formal diagnosis. By including them, the meta-analysis can provide insights that are applicable to a broader spectrum of individuals who would potentially seek or benefit from PTSD treatments in real-world clinical settings. Studies of PTSD treatments often use standardized inclusion criteria that require above-threshold symptoms or a formal PTSD diagnosis. Including below-threshold cases would likely introduce inconsistencies, as these cases might not meet the standard inclusion criteria in most trials. This approach keeps the meta-analysis consistent with the typical criteria used in PTSD research, enhancing the comparability and reliability of the findings. &#x000a0;</p><p>
<bold>There is growing literature on the neural biomarkers involved in PTSD treatment, as detected by functional MRI (e.g., Rauch et al. 2018, PMID: 29081351). However, in this manuscript the research on neuroimaging/fMRI is not discussed. I suggest to elaborate on this topic, and state the key regions/networks that might be associated with the positive effects of exercise. </bold>

<underline>Fear extinction, essential for reducing fear responses to trauma-related cues, is often impaired in individuals with PTSD, resulting in persistent fear and anxiety </underline>
<underline>(Lokshina et al., 2023)</underline>
<underline>. These impairments, linked to dysfunctional neural circuits, especially in the amygdala and prefrontal cortex, hinder the retention of extinction memories, sustaining symptoms such as hypervigilance and intrusive thoughts. By helping individuals distinguish between trauma memories and safe present contexts, fear extinction can reduce anxiety and avoidance behaviors in everyday life</underline>.&#x0201d; (pg 6) &#x000a0;</p><p>

</italic> Thank&#x000a0; you, we have updated to reflect your suggestion: &#x0201c;Further, exercise has been reported to enhance pattern separation and episodic memory (D&#x000e9;ry et al., 2013), which is important in differentiating safety from threat and restricting avoidance behaviour.
<underline>Avoidance behavior, a hallmark symptom of PTSD, reflects an impaired ability to process contextual cues, leading to the generalization of fear responses to non-threatening situations (Sheynin et al., 2017).</underline> It has been postulated that this effect is modulated by exercise-induced increases in hippocampal volume (Erickson et al., 2011).&#x0201d; (pg 7) &#x000a0;</p><p>

</italic> Research Question I is explicitly focused on understanding the mechanisms&#x02014;specifically, the mediators that could explain how exercise may influence symptom severity and functional impairment in PTSD. Research Question II, on the other hand, aims to evaluate the direct effects of exercise itself on these outcomes. It is concerned with quantifying and understanding overall effects, rather than unpacking the pathways or mediators involved. This is stated in our research questions: &#x0201c;I. How does exercise reduce symptom severity and/or functional impairment in PTSD? II. What are the effects of exercise on symptom severity and functional impairment in individuals with PTSD, and which factors can moderate it? " (pg 5) Our data analysis section is in line with the research questions: "

<sub>direct</sub> obtained from mediation analysis gives insight into the importance of the examined mediator. We will collect all study-specific estimates of the effects of type B, C, A

<sub>direct</sub> would be only crude estimates of the true direct and indirect effects of exercise on the outcome. If enough estimates of sufficient quality are extracted for the same mediator, these can be synthesized across studies using random-effects meta-analyses (Cheung, 2022).
<underline>Research question II: The impact of exercise on PTSD symptoms and function impairment </underline> We expect several estimates of type A total to be available for potential synthesis from human studies. Heterogeneity will be assessed by visually inspecting forest plots considering the direction and magnitude of effects and the degree of overlap between Cis. If the heterogeneity is not judged to be substantial, we will conduct random-effects meta-analysis using the restricted maximum likelihood estimator of the between-study variance (&#x003c4; 2). We will the Hartung-Knapp correction for the confidence intervals of the summary estimate when at least five studies are available. Heterogeneity will be quantified using the &#x003c4; 2 and presented with the 95% prediction intervals (95% PI) of the treatment effects. When a meta-analysis is not feasible, we will synthesize the data without an accompanying meta-analysis (SwiM) ( Campbell et al., 2020). Furthermore, for non-human studies, we will conduct multilevel multivariable meta-regression with robust variance estimation (RVE)."

</italic> Thank you for your thoughtful suggestion. After careful consideration, we would like to clarify that the primary focus of our review is on examining mediators of the effect of exercise on PTSD-related outcomes. In this context, effect modifiers found of the effect of exercise on PTSD-related outcomes will primarily be used to explore potential heterogeneity in the observed relationships using subgroup analysis and meta-regression. &#x000a0;</p><p>
