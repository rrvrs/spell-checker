Introduction</title><p>Avian infectious bronchitis (IB) is caused by avian coronaviruses, members of the genus Gamma coronavirus, family <italic toggle="yes">Coronaviridae</italic> and order <italic toggle="yes">Nidovirales</italic>. The prototype of avian coronaviruses is avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), the first coronavirus being identified in the 1930&#x02019;s followed by the mouse hepatitis virus and the transmissible gastroenteritis virus in the next ten years [<xref rid="B1-vaccines-13-00146" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-vaccines-13-00146" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-vaccines-13-00146" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Despite being of a different genus, IBV has many similarities with SRAS-CoV-2 in the pathology of the respiratory system and vaccination [<xref rid="B4-vaccines-13-00146" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-vaccines-13-00146" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Thus, as the first identified and most extensively investigated naturally occurring coronavirus, IBV may be considered as a useful model for studying the evolution, transmission, pathogenesis, and prevention of coronavirus.</p><p>Vaccination has been extensively performed to control IBV infections for decades. Live attenuated vaccines are widely administered for prime vaccination in layers and breeders and is sufficient to protect broilers. Inactivated vaccines are normally used to boost the immunity against IBV in layers and breeders before the onset of egg production. Meanwhile, outbreaks caused by constantly emerging variants due to genome recombination between different viral strains, including vaccine strains, occur worldwide annually [<xref rid="B6-vaccines-13-00146" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-vaccines-13-00146" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Like other coronaviruses, for example, SRAS-CoV-2, IBV is susceptible to mutation and genome recombination between different viral strains, including vaccine strains, and is therefore highly diverse. The cross-protection among strains is low. However, other types of vaccines, such as inactivated and subunit vaccines, still encounter issues like poor immunogenicity and low efficiency, which are often difficult to overcome with traditional immune-regulating strategies like adjuvants [<xref rid="B8-vaccines-13-00146" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-vaccines-13-00146" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The development of novel vaccines against IBV infection with high efficacy and lower biosafety risks is necessary but is hindered by a limited understanding of the initiation of antiviral adaptive immune responses by IBV vaccination. In fact, chickens have made significant contributions to the development of immunology, particularly in the understanding of adaptive immunity [<xref rid="B10-vaccines-13-00146" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-vaccines-13-00146" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. For example, B lymphocytes, which are crucial for the adaptive immune response, were first identified in chickens, because of the unique immune organ of birds, the bursa of Fabricius. Interferon, a protein that plays a key role in the immune response to viruses, was also first described in chicken embryos exposed to the influenza virus in 1957. Compared with mammals, chickens have a compact and simple major histocompatibility complex (MHC), which has been instrumental in studying genetic resistance and susceptibility to infectious diseases. These contributions have been fundamental in advancing our understanding of immunological processes and have had a lasting impact on both veterinary and human medicine. However, the chicken immune system is complex, with unique features such as the bursa of Fabricius and the absence of lymph nodes, which makes it difficult to fully understand the complexity of chicken immune responses according to current advances in human and mammal immune system [<xref rid="B12-vaccines-13-00146" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. This highlights the need for continued research to improve our understanding of the chicken immune system and adaptive immunity.</p><p>The initiation of vertebrate adaptive immune responses is a complex process, involving the interaction result of a large number of innate and adaptive immune cells. Single-cell transcriptome sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a powerful technology for comprehensive elucidation of immune system heterogeneity at single-cell resolution. It has been primarily used to investigate the immune systems of humans and model animals [<xref rid="B13-vaccines-13-00146" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-vaccines-13-00146" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Compared to humans and mice, chickens have significant differences in the composition of the immune system, insufficient genome annotation, and the lack of related databases, which brings difficulties for the application of single-cell omics technology in chickens. Previously, we explored the in vivo heterogeneity of duck blood immune cells in homeostasis and following flaviviral infection using scRNA-seq [<xref rid="B15-vaccines-13-00146" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. This work constructed the first transcriptomic landscape of avian immune cells and highlighted the importance of granulocytes and monocytes in the duck&#x02019;s response to flaviviral infection. In the present study, we monitored the dynamic transition of immune cells in peripheral blood within two weeks post-vaccination with the widely used live attenuated IBV vaccine strain H120 using scRNA-seq, which illustrated the initiation of immune responses in chickens against IBV infection.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-vaccines-13-00146"><title>2.

The IBV strain H120 (G1&#x02013;1 lineage), which has been widely used as a commercial live attenuated vaccine for prime vaccination worldwide, was stored at the HVRI. This strain is propagated in SPF chicken embryos. For live vaccine immunization, chickens received 100 microliters (&#x003bc;L) of virus specimens at 10<sup>4</sup> EID<sub>50</sub> per milliliter (mL) of live H120 through the nasal route.

The levels of antibody specifically recognizing viral N protein, the most plentiful viral protein during viral replication, were determined using a commercial IBV enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (NECVB, Harbin, China). The sample-to-positive (S/P) ratio was calculated. A serum sample with S/P ratios less than or equal to 0.20 was considered negative; a S/P ratio greater than 0.20 was considered positive. The levels of IBV-neutralizing antibody were determined by virus neutralization tests through observing the reduction in viral infectivity based on the absence of cytopathic effects on embryonated eggs.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot5-vaccines-13-00146"><title>2.5.

Experimental Model and Dynamic PBMC Landscapes Responding to Prime Vaccination with Live Attenuated IBV Vaccine</title><p>Thirty-five-day-old specific-pathogen-free (SPF) male chickens were inoculated with the live attenuated vaccine strain H120 (six half-sibs per group). Blood samples were collected at the onset of vaccination and at 4, 7, and 14 days post-vaccination (dpv) as indicated in <xref rid="vaccines-13-00146-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A. Following vaccination, an increase in antibodies specifically recognizing the viral N protein, the most abundant viral protein during replication, was observed from 7 dpv (positive in two of six chickens) and significantly induced in all chickens by 14 dpv (<xref rid="vaccines-13-00146-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>B). Consistently, serum-neutralizing antibodies were only observed at 14 dpv in immunized chickens (<xref rid="vaccines-13-00146-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>C), while neither antibody specifically recognizing viral N protein nor IBV-neutralizing antibody was observed at 0 dpv, suggesting the absence of antiviral antibodies and IBV infection in these SPF chickens before vaccination (<xref rid="vaccines-13-00146-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>B,C). These findings suggest successful vaccination in our in vivo model.</p><p>The four scRNA-seq data from the PBMCs of chickens at the onset of inoculation and 4, 7, and 14 dpv were generated as indicated in <xref rid="vaccines-13-00146-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A. High-quality transcriptomes of 29,846 PBMCs with medians of 1154 UMI reads and 601 genes per cell were obtained based on the following quality control criteria: (i) detected gene number between 200 and 2500; (ii) a proportion of mitochondrial genes in detected genes &#x0003c; 10%; and (iii) all &#x0201c;detected genes&#x0201d; expressed in &#x02265; 3 individual cells at a level of UMI &#x02265; 1. Globally, unsupervised cell clustering using Seurat identified 22 clusters, as shown in the 2D space by UMAP (<xref rid="vaccines-13-00146-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>D). Cells were annotated according to the transcription level of known marker genes manually (<xref rid="vaccines-13-00146-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>E). Four classic erythrocyte markers, HBA1, HBAD, HBBA, and SLC4A1, were expressed at high levels in clusters (C) 8, 16, and 18, suggesting that these three clusters consisted of residual erythrocytes which were removed from subsequent analysis. The thrombocyte markers ITGAV and ITGB3 were expressed at high levels in C1, 2, 4, and 12, which assigned these four clusters as thrombocytes. The genes encoding class II histocompatibility antigens, BLB1 and BLB2, were highly expressed in four clusters, C9, 11, 13, and 21. Among these clusters, the B cell markers BCL11A, SWAP70, PAX5, CD79B, and Bu-1 were expressed at high levels in C9 and C13, which assigned these cells as B lymphocytes. Monocyte markers TLR4 and MAFB were enriched in C11, and dendritic cell markers CADM1, FLT3, and XCR1 were enriched in C21, assigning these two clusters as monocytes and dendritic cells, respectively. C10 and C17 were assigned as CD8+ T lymphocytes, giving the expression of CD8A and CD8BP. C3, 6, and 17 were assigned as CD4+ T lymphocytes, giving the expression of CD4 and CD28. Cluster C5 was considered as &#x003b3;&#x003b4;T lymphocytes, given the high expression of TCR gamma TARP and ZAP70. Giving the high expression of CD3D in C20, this cluster was assigned as T lymphocytes too. Considering the high levels of GNLY, NCAM1 (CD56), BLEC2, and XCL1 in C14 and the high levels of CLSPN, TOP2A, and ASPM in C15, these two clusters highly expressing PTPRC, CD3D, and CD3E were either T lymphocytes or natural killer (NK) cells.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot2-vaccines-13-00146"><title>3.2.

To elucidate the dynamic transition of the cell&#x02013;cell communication network of host PBMCs upon vaccination, the difference in the number of interactions among PBMCs compared to those at the onset of vaccination was calculated and presented in <xref rid="vaccines-13-00146-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>D, with red lines indicating an increase in interaction number and blue lines indicating a decrease. At 4 dpv, T lymphocytes received more abundant signals from the main antigen-presenting cells (APCs), including monocytes and dendritic cells, compared to the cellular communications between T lymphocytes and these APCs before vaccination (<xref rid="vaccines-13-00146-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>D, left panel). This finding aligns with the enhanced MHC class II signal among PBMCs at 4 dpv (<xref rid="vaccines-13-00146-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>E, left panel), suggesting the activation of T lymphocytes by APCs at this early stage post-vaccination. The promoted interactions between T lymphocytes and APCs were quickly replaced by auto-interactions within T lymphocytes at 7 dpv (<xref rid="vaccines-13-00146-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>D, middle panel), along with a reduction in the MHC class II signal (<xref rid="vaccines-13-00146-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>E, middle panel), indicating the subsequent activation and differentiation of specific subpopulations within T lymphocytes upon initial activation by APCs. The signals received by T lymphocytes returned to baseline levels before vaccination at 14 dpv (<xref rid="vaccines-13-00146-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>D, right panel), at which point viral-specific antibodies were significantly induced (<xref rid="vaccines-13-00146-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>B,C). Meanwhile, all signals sent by monocytes were reduced, while all signals received by monocytes were enhanced (<xref rid="vaccines-13-00146-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>D, right panel). Along with the MHC class II signal, the MIF signal was also only promoted at 4 dpv (<xref rid="vaccines-13-00146-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>E). IL-16 and CADM signals were repressed at 4 dpv but consistently promoted after 7 dpv. ANGPT and PECAM1 signals were reduced at 4 dpv but enhanced at 7 and 14 dpv, respectively.</p><p>Given the importance of cell&#x02013;cell communication among PBMCs at 4 dpv in initiating antiviral adaptive immune responses (<xref rid="vaccines-13-00146-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>D, left panel), we compared the intercellular communication patterns of 18 significant ligand&#x02013;receptor pairs between specific types of PBMCs from the onset of vaccination to 4 dpv, as visualized in <xref rid="vaccines-13-00146-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>A. The comparison results are shown in <xref rid="vaccines-13-00146-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>B,C. These ligand&#x02013;receptor pairs belong to 11 signaling pathways, with FN1, APP, and MHC class II identified as the top three strongest signals (<xref rid="vaccines-13-00146-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>B). Monocytes were identified as the main source of these three signals. Thrombocytes were the primary receivers of the FN1 signal, while APP signals could be received by all major APCs. There were five significant receptors in the FN1 signal, but only the communications between FN1 and three of them, namely &#x02018;ITGAV + ITGB3&#x02019;, &#x02018;ITGAV + ITGB1&#x02019;, and &#x02018;ITGAB + ITGB3&#x02019;, were enhanced between monocytes and thrombocytes (<xref rid="vaccines-13-00146-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>C).

Besides monocytes, the MHC class II signal was also sent by other APCs, with T lymphocytes being the only receivers.</p><p>Together, the aforementioned joint analysis facilitates the discovery of significant signaling network changes that may drive the initiation of antiviral adaptive immune responses following inoculation with the IBV live attenuated vaccine.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot3-vaccines-13-00146"><title>3.3. Global Intercellular Communication of Major APCs During the Initiation of Antiviral Adaptive Immune Response</title><p>Given that major antigen-presenting cells (APCs), such as monocytes and dendritic cells, were identified as the dominant communication &#x0201c;hubs&#x0201d; during the initiation of antiviral adaptive immune responses, the intercellular communication networks of monocytes and dendritic cells at 4 dpv were analyzed in detail. Monocytes were reclustered and grouped into six subclusters (MC1&#x02013;6; <xref rid="vaccines-13-00146-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>A). A few dendritic cells were obtained and defined as two subclusters, DCC1 and DCC2 (<xref rid="vaccines-13-00146-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>B). The overview of the cell&#x02013;cell communication network among these clusters and other PBMCs was inferred and analyzed (<xref rid="vaccines-13-00146-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>C). Among these APC subclusters, MC5, MC6, and DCC1 were not involved in the PBMC communication network at 4 dpv. To explore how multiple APC subclusters and signaling pathways coordinate the initiation of antiviral adaptive immune responses, the global communication patterns during this process were analyzed using a pattern recognition method based on non-negative matrix factorization. <xref rid="vaccines-13-00146-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>D presents the communication patterns connecting cell groups with signaling pathways. The cells connected with outgoing signaling or incoming signaling were recognized as senders or receivers, respectively. Two patterns for outgoing signaling (upper panel) and five patterns for incoming signaling (lower panel) were revealed. The outgoing signaling of all monocyte subclusters was characterized by pattern 1, which represents multiple pathways, including but not limited to MHC class II, complement, CD45, TGF-&#x003b2;, and CCL, demonstrating the simultaneous activation of multiple signaling pathways by monocytes during the initiation of antiviral adaptive immune responses. The outgoing signaling of other PBMCs, including DCC2, T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, and thrombocytes, was characterized by pattern 2, representing pathways such as MIF, NOTCH, and IL-16, indicating the coordination of these cells at this stage. On the other hand, the communication patterns of target cells (<xref rid="vaccines-13-00146-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>D, lower panel) showed more homogeneous communication patterns. The incoming monocyte signaling was dominated by patterns 1 and 5, which include signaling pathways such as complement, CD45, C99, NOTCH, and PECAM1. Except for NOTCH signaling, all of these signals were sent out by monocytes themselves, suggesting abundant internal communication among monocyte subclusters and autocrine signal transduction. The signaling pathways of pattern 3, including MHC class II and IL-16, were only received by T lymphocytes, suggesting a unique transduction of MHC class II signaling from monocytes to T lymphocytes. TGF-&#x003b2; signaling was the only signal transduced exclusively among APCs, sent out by monocytes and received by B lymphocytes and DCC2, indicating potential control of B lymphocytes and dendritic cells by monocytes during the initiation of adaptive immunity. Thrombocytes only received ANGPT signaling sent out by monocytes. Similarity measures and manifold learning revealed MC1&#x02013;4 as the common sources of signaling in pattern 1 of outgoing signaling (<xref rid="vaccines-13-00146-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>A, left panel), with high similarity among signaling in pattern 1 (<xref rid="vaccines-13-00146-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>A, right panel). Other major APCs, namely dendritic cells and B lymphocytes, were closely grouped together. For incoming cells and pathways, MC1, 3, and 4 were identified as the main sources of signaling in patterns 1 and 5, while B lymphocytes were shown as a broad but generally weak source of all incoming signaling (<xref rid="vaccines-13-00146-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>B, left panel). The signaling in patterns 1 and 5 exhibited highly coordinated patterns, indicating complex intercellular communication networks among different subclusters of monocytes (<xref rid="vaccines-13-00146-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>B, right panel). Further quantitative analysis of these intercellular communications confirmed monocytes as the predominant source of outgoing signaling during the initiation of antiviral adaptive immunity, as all of the signaling received by other PBMCs was sent out by monocytes (<xref rid="vaccines-13-00146-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>C). Among the four subclusters of monocytes involved in triggering adaptive immune responses, the MHC class II pathway was dominantly secreted by MC3 and MC4 (<xref rid="vaccines-13-00146-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>D).</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot4-vaccines-13-00146"><title>3.4. Global Intercellular Communication of T Lymphocytes During the Initiation of Antiviral Adaptive Immune Response</title><p>To explore the biological significance of APC preference for T lymphocyte activation upon vaccination, T lymphocytes were reclustered, identifying 16 clusters, indicating substantial cellular heterogeneity (TC1&#x02013;16; <xref rid="vaccines-13-00146-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>A). Using 29 known chicken T lymphocyte and natural killer cell markers detectable in our data, combined with developmental clustering using transcriptional profiles, these 16 clusters were defined as CD4+ T lymphocytes (TC1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 11), CD8+ T lymphocytes (TC3 and 13), &#x003b3;&#x003b4;T lymphocytes (TC4, 8, 15, and 16), other T lymphocytes (TC9 and 14), and natural killer cells (TC10 and 12) (<xref rid="vaccines-13-00146-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>A,B). The overview of the cell&#x02013;cell communication network among these subclusters of monocytes, T lymphocytes, and other PBMCs was inferred and analyzed (<xref rid="vaccines-13-00146-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>C). Among the 16 T lymphocyte subclusters, two subclusters of CD4+ T lymphocytes, namely TC5 and TC6, and a subcluster of &#x003b3;&#x003b4;T lymphocytes, TC16, were not involved in the initiation of adaptive immune responses, as there were no signal interactions sent or received by these cells. The cell&#x02013;cell communication network of T lymphocyte activation upon vaccination was elucidated by analyzing the signaling transduction between APCs and each T lymphocyte subcluster (<xref rid="vaccines-13-00146-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>D). Most of the signaling sent by T lymphocytes, including CD45, TGF-&#x003b2;, PARs, CHEMERIN, and CALCR signaling, was transduced to monocytes and dendritic cells. ITGB2 was received by CD8+ T lymphocytes (TC3 and 13), and IL-16 signaling was received by CD4+ T lymphocytes (TC1, 2, 7, and 11). T lymphocyte activation upon vaccination was elucidated by identifying signaling from APCs to T cells via the MHC class II and CD80 (B7) signaling pathways at 4 dpv (<xref rid="vaccines-13-00146-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>D). The MHC class II signaling was sent by both MC3 and MC4 and received by CD4+ T lymphocytes (TC1, 2, 7, and 11) and &#x003b3;&#x003b4;T lymphocytes (TC15) (<xref rid="vaccines-13-00146-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>E, left panel). CD80 signaling was also received by CD4+ T lymphocytes (TC1, 2, 7, and 11) but only sent by MC4 (<xref rid="vaccines-13-00146-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>E, right panel). Considering the pivotal role of CD80 in CD4+ T lymphocyte activation as a coactivator, MC4 may play a central role in the initiation of antiviral adaptive immune responses upon IBV vaccination.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec4-vaccines-13-00146"><title>4. Discussion</title><p>Understanding the initiation of adaptive immune responses by prime vaccination is essential for the rational design of novel, biosafe, and effective vaccines. Despite significant efforts to elucidate host immune responses upon coronavirus infection and vaccination, our comprehensive understanding of coronavirus prime vaccination remains limited, especially for avian coronaviruses. IBV, the first discovered coronavirus, poses a major threat to the global poultry industry and serves as a prototype for coronaviruses. A single immunization with the live attenuated IBV vaccine is sufficient to elicit satisfactory antiviral adaptive immune responses in the host (<xref rid="vaccines-13-00146-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>B,C). Utilizing this model, we constructed in vivo dynamic immune landscapes of prime vaccination with the live attenuated IBV vaccine at single-cell resolution. Vaccination dramatically altered the host immune landscape within the first week post-immunization, reshaping PBMCs into an immune activation composition by two weeks (<xref rid="vaccines-13-00146-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). This rapid and dramatic change is likely the result of the infectious bronchitis virus evading the host&#x02019;s innate immune system through multiple mechanisms via its nonstructural proteins, allowing the virus to replicate quickly without any innate defense from the host [<xref rid="B26-vaccines-13-00146" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. This is beneficial for the rapid initiation of antiviral adaptive immunity and may reflect the superiority of live attenuated vaccines. The immune responses elicited by the live attenuated IBV vaccine correlate with the enhanced interaction between monocytes and T lymphocytes and subsequent T lymphocyte activation, which appears essential for effective prime vaccination in chickens (<xref rid="vaccines-13-00146-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>, <xref rid="vaccines-13-00146-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref> and <xref rid="vaccines-13-00146-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). Our findings underscore the important cell&#x02013;cell communication network and key cell populations during the initiation of successful immune responses in chickens against IBV infection, which may also be valuable for the rational design of safe and effective vaccines against IBV.</p><p>Live attenuated vaccines have been extensively administered for the prevention and control of infectious diseases worldwide due to their superior protection [<xref rid="B8-vaccines-13-00146" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-vaccines-13-00146" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. However, growing evidence has raised concerns about the biosafety risks associated with using live viruses as vaccines for a broad spectrum of viruses, such as polioviruses, coronaviruses, herpesviruses, and influenza viruses, which may lead to the constant emergence of new variants [<xref rid="B8-vaccines-13-00146" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-vaccines-13-00146" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B27-vaccines-13-00146" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Our analysis revealed the transduction of MHC class II signaling from monocytes to CD4+ T lymphocytes at the early initiation stage of antiviral adaptive immune responses upon live IBV vaccination (<xref rid="vaccines-13-00146-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>, <xref rid="vaccines-13-00146-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref> and <xref rid="vaccines-13-00146-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). This capability to elicit antiviral immune responses suggests that the preference for monocytes as APCs may be essential for effective prime vaccination in chickens and indicates the possibility of enhancing the effectiveness of other types of vaccines, such as inactivated IBV vaccines, through APC switching. Many efforts have been made to address why live virus vaccines are more effective than inactivated vaccines in most cases. Most of these studies have focused on differences in lymphocyte composition after vaccination. Contrary to our expectations, our analysis observed monocytes as the preferred APCs at the onset of successful adaptive immune response initiation. Additional analysis of prime vaccination for more pathogens in various species is necessary to determine the universality of our findings.</p><p>In addition to MHC class II signaling sent by monocytes, MIF signaling was also significantly promoted by vaccination at the initiation stage of adaptive immune response activation (<xref rid="vaccines-13-00146-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>E). Further analysis of the &#x02018;MIF &#x02212; (CD74 + CD44)&#x02019; ligand&#x02013;receptor pair revealed that this signaling was sent by dendritic cells and mainly received by other APCs, especially monocytes (<xref rid="vaccines-13-00146-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). MIF &#x02212; (CD74 + CD44) has been previously reported to function as a recruiter of immunosuppressive cells, thus promoting immunosuppression [<xref rid="B28-vaccines-13-00146" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B29-vaccines-13-00146" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B30-vaccines-13-00146" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Considering the important role of peripheral blood monocytic cells during IBV dissemination and kidney infection in chickens [<xref rid="B31-vaccines-13-00146" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B32-vaccines-13-00146" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], the enhanced MIF signaling among APCs may be a strategy for the live IBV vaccine strain H120 to evade immune surveillance during its efficient initiation of antiviral adaptive immune responses.</p><p>To investigate immune dynamics following IBV vaccination, peripheral blood immune cells, which conveniently reflect systemic changes in immune responses, were extensively monitored using scRNA-seq analysis in this study. This approach enabled time series observations under a paired experimental design. However, the results from the analysis of systemic immune dynamics may not accurately represent the primary mechanisms and mediators of effective immune responses against IBV in the mucosal compartment of vaccinated chickens, where antiviral adaptive immune responses are likely initially triggered by the live attenuated vaccine. Given the importance of both mucosal and systemic compartments in effective immune responses against IBV, the parameters identified in the current analysis need to be assessed within the tracheal mucosal immune compartment in future research.</p><p>In an industrial-scale system, all chicks are typically prime vaccinated just after hatching or during the first week of age with live attenuated IBV vaccines, such as the H120 vaccine. Given that all chicks have maternal antibodies, the phenomenon of maternal antibody interference must be taken into account. The presence of maternal antibodies may inhibit the generation of new antibodies by B lymphocytes in chicks through epitope masking, direct binding of maternal antibodies to the H120 vaccine, which prevents it from being recognized by the chick&#x02019;s immune system, and/or B lymphocyte inhibition through the cross-linking of BCR with the Fc&#x003b3;-receptor via the maternal antibody-H120 complex [<xref rid="B33-vaccines-13-00146" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B34-vaccines-13-00146" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="B35-vaccines-13-00146" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="B36-vaccines-13-00146" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. In addition to these maternal antibody feedback mechanisms, the removal of vaccine antigen by macrophages and neutralization of the vaccine virus by maternal antibodies have been hypothesized to play a role in maternal antibody-mediated inhibition of vaccination, but with little experimental evidence and controversial conclusions [<xref rid="B37-vaccines-13-00146" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="B38-vaccines-13-00146" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Despite the inhibition of the humoral immune response, the cell-mediated immune response mediated by T lymphocytes is usually unaffected by maternal antibodies [<xref rid="B37-vaccines-13-00146" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="B38-vaccines-13-00146" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The partial immune response initiated by prime vaccination can still provide some level of protection against IBV, but it may not be as robust as in chicks without maternal antibodies. Thus, in the context of the PBMC landscape, maternal antibodies may affect the activation and proliferation of B lymphocytes, but the landscape of the cell-mediated immune response may not be affected. However, the antiviral adaptive immune responses initiated by vaccination are not only determined by the shift of cellular composition of immune cells but also rely on the reformed immune repertoires. It is possible that maternal antibodies might reshape immune repertoires differently upon prime vaccination through epitope masking. Further single-cell transcriptome analysis in combination with immune repertoire analysis in chicks with or without maternal antibodies upon prime vaccination may address this issue properly.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec5-vaccines-13-00146"><title>5.
