The large-scale statistics on their efficacy and accuracy across different centres, as well as the frequency of abnormalities for each chromosome, will provide a valuable supplement to previous research.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">Patients who had PGT-A or -SR procedures at five reproductive centres from 2018 to 2022 were recruited based on PGT-A/-SR indications. ChromInst and next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based PGT technology were utilised to detect copy number variations in embryos. Sequencing data metrics such as median absolute pairwise difference (MAPD) and detection success rate were analysed to evaluate the robustness of ChromInst. To assess ChromInst&#x02019;s accuracy, the chromosomal results from amniocentesis, abortions, and neonatal blood was as the gold standard for negative PGT results; the fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH), which was performed on embryos that identified as aneuploid through PGT was as the gold standard for positive PGT results. The frequency of abnormalities in each chromosome was also explored in aneuploid embryos.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">A total of 5,730 embryos were tested from 1,015 patients in the study, 391 of whom had PGT-A and 624 of whom had PGT-SR. 99.5% (5,699/5,730) of the embryos had an NGS sequencing MAPD value&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.25, and 99.3% (5,689/5,730) of the embryos achieved successful PGT-A/-SR detection. Compared with the gold standard, the concordance of negative PGT-A/-SR results was 99.8% (506/507), and that of positive results was 99.8% (1,123/1,125). The euploidy rate in the PGT-A population was 45.9% (981/2,135). The proportion of euploid&#x02009;+&#x02009;balanced embryos was highest among couples with non-polymorphic inversions (44.6%, 152/341), followed by those with Robertsonian translocations (39.0%, 293/752), and lowest among those with reciprocal translocations (22.5%, 483/2,143). Chromosomes 16, 22, and 15 had the highest frequency of autosomal trisomies among the embryos from PGT-A patients, while chromosomes 16, 22, and 21 had the highest frequency of monosomies. High-frequency chromosomes with de novo chromosomal abnormalities for trisomies and monosomies were similar in the PGT-SR patients to those in the PGT-A patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">ChromInst-based PGT-A/-SR could accommodate operational variations among different clinical centres, ensuring accurate results through robust and stable detection performance.

Aneuploidy results from errors in gamete meiosis or mitotic errors at different stages of embryonic development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The probability of gametogenesis abnormalities increases in populations with chromosomal abnormalities, advanced maternal age, recurrent miscarriage/implantation failure, and sperm abnormalities, leading to a higher rate of embryonic aneuploidy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Morphological grading is a method for selecting embryos, but it does not reflect the embryos&#x02019; genetic characteristics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Consequently, chromosomal ploidy in embryos for advanced maternal age, recurrent implantation failure, recurrent miscarriage, and severe teratozoospermia is frequently detected clinically using preimplantation genetic testing for aneuploidies (PGT-A) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Preimplantation genetic testing for structural rearrangements (PGT-SR) is used for couples where one or both partners have chromosomal structural abnormalities. These couples frequently have a high rate of natural miscarriages and are prone to an uneven distribution of genetic material during meiosis, which can result in chromosomal abnormalities in embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">Next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based PGT-A/-SR is a complex technical process that involves multiple steps, including embryo biopsy, sample lysis, whole-genome amplification, library preparation, sequencing, and data analysis, to obtain the final results. The embryo biopsy is performed in the embryology laboratory by embryologists under a microscope. All subsequent testing steps are carried out in the molecular testing laboratory by technicians using specific test reagents and following specific operational requirements. Variances in each of these steps can cause fluctuations in the test results. In the real world, there are variations among embryology labs in terms of the embryo culture medium used, the manufacturers and characteristics of embryo biopsy equipment, the individual habits and proficiency of embryologists, and the liquid carryover volumes during biopsy sample tubing. All of these variances pose challenges to achieving high-quality and stable results in PGT-A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Due to the critical and delicate impact of embryo culture techniques and biopsy procedures on the subsequent viability of embryos, an embryology lab, once it has established its own standard operating procedures (SOPs), is usually unwilling to make any alterations for giving in subsequent assays. This requires the PGT-A/-SR protocol to have high robustness to adapt to variances between laboratories and achieve stable and accurate results. A PGT-A protocol called ChromInst was created in the study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. This methodology greatly streamlines the operational processes by integrating NGS library preparation and single-cell whole genome amplification (WGA) into the experimental procedure. In addition to lowering the likelihood of mistakes and omissions, it also improves performance while cutting down on operating time. However, comprehensive evidence confirming its robustness across many centres is still lacking.</p><p id="Par7">Moreover, one of the main issues with the clinical use of PGT in assisted reproduction is false-positives and false-negatives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Viable embryos may be wasted and patients may lose out on implantation opportunities as a result of a false positive PGT result. On the other hand, transferring an embryo with a false negative result may cause unsuccessful implantation, miscarriage, or fetal developmental abnormalities. Zhai et al. conducted NGS-based PGT-SR on embryos from patients with balanced translocations. Amniocentesis was performed on 15 patients who achieved ongoing pregnancies after transferring euploid embryos, and karyotyping results were 100% consistent with PGT-SR results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Nevertheless, the study had a small sample size and did not compare the aneuploid results to the gold standard. A larger sample size and extensive validation of PGT-A/-SR results across several centres are therefore required, particularly for the validation of positive PGT-A/-SR results.</p><p id="Par8">For patients undergoing PGT-A/-SR, the euploidy rate of embryos and the frequency of aneuploidy for each chromosome are critical metrics for assessing embryo development and guiding informed decisions on embryo transfer. Some studies have analysed chromosomal abnormalities in chorionic villus sampling and spontaneous abortions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Ogur et al. analysed 300 couples with structural rearrangements and over 100,000 chromosomal pairs, highlighting the significant impact of rearrangement type, female age (&#x02265;&#x02009;35 years), and carrier sex on transferable embryo rates. The study found negligible evidence of inter chromosomal effect (ICE) and minor differences in aneuploidy rates between carriers and controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. These findings emphasize the need for personalized genetic assessments for structural rearrangement carriers and further large-scale research to refine clinical applications. To evaluate both the value of the genetic and clinical data and the validation of the technique, this study was conducted. A total of 1,150 infertile couples who underwent PGT-A/-SR-assisted reproduction at five reproductive centres between 2018 and 2022 were recruited. Patients who underwent single euploid blastocyst transfers had their clinical results monitored. The robustness of the ChromInst method was evaluated using sequencing metrics, including median absolute pairwise difference (MAPD) values were used to evaluate the robustness of the ChromInst technique. Using the chromosomal findings of amniocentesis, abortions, and neonatal blood as the negative gold standard and the fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) results of embryo biopsy cells as the positive gold standard, the accuracy of PGT-A/-SR results was confirmed. In order to provide more precise data support for genetic counselling, we additionally examined the euploidy rate and the prevalence of specific chromosomal abnormalities in the PGT-A/-SR population.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design and patients</title><p id="Par9">This was a large-scale, multicentre, real-world clinical study.

The sequencing data was used to analyse the ChromInst&#x02019;s robustness. The results from amniocentesis, neonatal blood samples, or abortions, using these as the gold standard for negative PGT results, were gathered. For aneuploidy embryos with PGT results, FISH testing was used as the gold standard. Furthermore, the euploidy rate of embryos was calculated, and statistical analysis was performed on the high-frequency abnormal chromosomes in aneuploid embryos.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>ART treatments</title><p id="Par19">Oocyte retrieval must be performed 36&#x000a0;h (&#x000b1;&#x02009;2) post-hCG administration. Under intravenous anesthesia, oocytes were collected using a 17G aspiration needle guided by transvaginal ultrasound. Post-retrieval, cumulus-oocyte complexes were meticulously identified under a stereomicroscope. The cumulus-oocyte complexes were then collected and washed using a Pasteur pipette and transferred into culture medium.

Firstly, the robustness of the ChromInst technology by analysing the MAPD values from embryo sequencing results across five reproductive centres were validated. Compared to traditional in vitro diagnostics testing, the workflow for PGT-A/-SR testing was significantly more complex, involving steps such as embryo culture, biopsy, whole-genome amplification, NGS sequencing, and result analysis. Biopsy samples from various reproductive centres may differ significantly because there are no established standards for these techniques. Osman and Scott et al. recommended a MAPD value of &#x0003c;&#x02009;0.25 as a quality control standard. 99.5% (5,699/5,730) of the 5,730 embryos had MAPD values&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.25, and the distribution of MAPD values among the samples from the five centres was highly similar. The five centres&#x02019; embryo detection success rates, which ranged from 98.4 to 99.8%, were similar. These indicated that the ChromInst may mitigate the variances in embryo samples brought about by variations in sampling and culture procedures, ensuring the stability and reliability of the sequencing results. PGT-A and PGT-SR based on the ChromInst protocol were well-suited for different centres.</p><p id="Par50">Recent studies have shown that PGT-A based on whole-genome amplification using the MDA method may misdiagnose 17% of euploid embryos as aneuploid or with a high degree of mosaicism (&#x0003e;&#x02009;50%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. In this study, 1,125 embryos diagnosed as aneuploid by PGT-A/-SR were subjected to FISH, the gold standard for validation. Using FISH results as the positive gold standard, the concordance rate of positive PGT-A/-SR results was 99.8% (1,123/1,125), suggesting the ChromInst technique has excellent accuracy and low false-positive rates for PGT-A/-SR. In addition to false positives, false negatives should also be considered, embryos with false-negative results can lead to implantation failure, miscarriage, or fetal developmental abnormalities. To verify the accuracy of negative PGT-A/-SR results, we used CNV results from 507 cases of prenatal diagnosis, neonatal blood, and abortions as the negative gold standard. The concordance rate for negative PGT-A/-SR results was 99.8% (506/507). For 49 patients with miscarriages where the aborted embryos were euploid&#x02009;+&#x02009;balanced, the reason may be attributed to parental age, hormonal, immunological, and environmental factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. There was one case of a false-negative result; however, a further analysis of samples taken from various parts of the miscarriage tissue showed that the TE cells had less than 30% low-level mosaicism. Popovic et al. conducted PGT-A testing on the inner cell mass (ICM) and trophectoderm (TE) cells of 34 donated embryos. Of the 18 embryos with euploid TE results in the first test, 16 had euploid ICM, while one showed mosaicism and another showed segmental abnormalities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Due to the presence of mosaicism in embryos, PGT-A/-SR results may not always reflect the ICM status. However, based on large-scale clinical amniocentesis and miscarriage sample results, the discordance rate was only 0.2% (1/507). The validation of PGT-A/-SR results with such a large sample size is a highlight of our study.</p><p id="Par51">Additionally, for individuals undergoing PGT-A and PGT-SR, the euploidy rate of embryos and the chromosomes with high abnormality rates are critical metrics. In our analysis of chromosomal abnormalities in embryos from the PGT-A cohort, the chromosomes most frequently associated with trisomy are16, 22, 15, 13, and 21, while those most frequently associated with monosomy are 16, 22, 21, 15, and 18. Monosomy X also has a relatively high frequency. Previous studies have reported that trisomy 16 and 22 are most frequent in trophoblast cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. In our study, trisomies of chromosomes 15, 13 and 21 were also found to be highly prevalent, in addition to the chromosomes 22 and 16. Zhang et al. conducted chromosomal analysis on 1,903 miscarriage samples and found high abnormality rates in chromosomes 16, 22, 21, X/Y, 13, and 15, with chromosomes 16, 22, 21, 15, and 13 being the top five in trisomic embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. This is consistent with the highly prevalent trisomic chromosomes observed in embryos. In the PGT-SR cohort, the proportion of embryos with unbalanced chromosomal constitutions was lowest for inversion carriers, followed by Robertsonian translocation carriers, and highest for reciprocal translocation carriers (47.8% vs. 54.2% vs. 69.2%) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). This aligns with previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Although there might be differences due to maternal age, such that, Ogur et al. found transferable embryo rates of 35.8%, 33.2%, and 19.4% for inversion, Robertsonian, and reciprocal translocation carriers, respectively, which were lower than the rates reported in this study (44.6%, 39.0%, 22.5%) possibly due to difference in maternal age between cohorts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Clinical genetic counselling for PGT-A/-SR patients benefited greatly from these useful findings.</p><p id="Par52">In this study, the euploidy rate of embryos in the PGT-A group was 45.9% (981/2135), while in the PGT-SR group, it was 30.9% (1099/3554). Other studies have reported similar results, with euploidy rates ranging from 33.6 to 44.8% for PGT-A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], and from 24.4 to 26.7% for PGT-SR cohorts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. For these populations with high rates of aneuploid embryos, PGT-A/-SR can provide significant benefits by improving the success rate of each embryo transfer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. In a recent large-scale retrospective cohort study, the live birth rate in the PGT-A group, which included patients with indications such as advanced maternal age, recurrent miscarriage, fetal malformations or chromosomal abnormalities, and severe male factor infertility, was significantly higher than in the matched control group (52.6% vs. 34.2%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. However, for non-indicated populations, such as younger women with a good prognosis, where the euploidy rate can be as high as 69.8%, PGT-A did not improve the live birth rate per transfer cycle, particularly the cumulative live birth rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. For couples with chromosomal rearrangements, studies have reported a cumulative live birth rate of 55.8% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. In our study, the cumulative live birth rate in the PGT-SR group was 69.1% (306/443). The higher live birth rate may be associated with the younger age of the female partners in this cohort.</p><p id="Par53">The study has several limitations. First, for patients with miscarriages where the abortions were normal, the cause of miscarriage could not be followed. Second, the technique cannot distinguish normal from balanced embryos, polyploidy, and contamination. This may lead to false-negative results in embryo testing. Third, we did not compare whole genome-amplified products across different platforms. The study results are applicable only to the ChromInst technology based on the MALBAC method.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par54">In conclusion, the study demonstrated that ChromInst-based PGT-A/-SR provided stable and accurate detection of embryonic CNVs, regardless of operational differences between clinical centres.
