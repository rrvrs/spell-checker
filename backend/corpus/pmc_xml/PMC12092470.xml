Electroacupuncture (EA), a treasure of Traditional Chinese Medicine, exerted therapeutic effects against PD to avoid the side effects of dopamine (DA)-based therapies. However, its underlying mechanisms still need to be fully understood.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>MPTP-induced PD mice were treated with EA to evaluate its neuroprotective effects. Behavioral assessments, histopathological analysis of DAergic neurons, and quantification of ferroptosis biomarkers-including malondialdehyde (MDA), 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), iron, glutathione (GSH), and mitochondrial integrity-were performed. Protein expression levels of SLC7A11, GPX4, ferritin heavy chain 1 (FTH1), and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) were analyzed via immunoblotting. To validate pathway specificity, the Nrf2 inhibitor trigonelline (AT) was co-administered with EA.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>EA treatment significantly mitigated MPTP-induced DAergic neuron loss and motor deficits. Mechanistically, EA suppressed ferroptosis by reducing lipid peroxidation and iron accumulation while restoring GSH levels. It upregulated ferroptosis-suppressive proteins SLC7A11, GPX4, FTH1, and Nrf2, alongside ameliorating mitochondrial dysfunction. Crucially, AT administration abolished EA&#x02019;s protective effects, confirming Nrf2 pathway dependency.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>These findings demonstrate that EA exerts neuroprotection in PD by inhibiting ferroptosis through activation of the Nrf2/SLC7A11/FTH1/GPX4 signaling axis. This study not only elucidates a novel mechanism underlying EA&#x02019;s efficacy in PD but also highlights ferroptosis modulation as a therapeutic strategy, bridging traditional medicine with molecular pathophysiology.

Different mechanisms of cell death contribute to PD pathogenesis, including apoptosis, necrosis, pyroptosis, and ferroptosis. Among these mechanisms, ferroptosis is a newly identified non-apoptotic form of regulated cell death and is characterized by Fe<sup>2+</sup>-dependent lethal accumulation of lipid peroxides, and the pathophysiology of ferroptosis has several features that are consistent with that of PD (<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">Stockwell et al., 2017</xref>), which suggests the potential association between PD and ferroptosis (<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">Guiney et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">Hambright et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">Mahoney-Sanchez et al., 2021</xref>). Furthermore, ferroptosis is initiated by abnormal iron metabolism, imbalance between the production and degradation of lipid reactive oxygen species (ROS), loss of glutathione (GSH), and decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) (<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">Dixon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">Ou et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Ferroptosis is driven by the loss of activity of the lipid repair enzyme glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), a GSH-dependent enzyme (<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">Seibt et al., 2019</xref>). GSH acts as a cofactor for GPX4 and maintains the level of GPX4 through the exchange of glutamate and cystine via the cystine/glutamate antiporter system Xc-; thus, Xc- is involved in GSH biosynthesis. GPX4 uses two GSH molecules to safely reduce phospholipid hydroperoxides to their corresponding lipid alcohols, producing H<sub>2</sub>O and glutathione disulfide as byproducts. In addition, GPX4 reduces lipid hydroperoxides to non-toxic lipid alcohols (<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">Crielaard et al., 2017</xref>), thus limiting the propagation of lipid peroxidation within the membrane and preventing the Fe<sup>2+</sup>-dependent production of ROS (<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">Ward et al., 2014</xref>), particularly lipid hydroperoxides. Inhibition of GSH synthesis and system Xc-, or direct inactivation of GPX4, ultimately results in the accumulation of toxic lipid ROS and ferroptotic cell death (<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">Dixon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">Tian et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">Xie et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, ferritin heavy chain 1 (FTH1) can reverse ferroptosis by regulating iron storage, trapping Fe<sup>2+</sup> ions inside the cell, and converting them to Fe<sup>3+</sup>, thus reducing ROS production (<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">Do Van et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2022</xref>). Clinical trials on PD have shown that the anti-ferroptotic iron chelator offers neuroprotective support through slowing the disease progression and improving the motor function, which highlights the key role of iron in ferroptosis (<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, the importance of erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), an antioxidant transcription factor, in ferroptosis is elucidated by the fact that almost all genes that have been implicated to date in ferroptosis are transcriptionally regulated by Nrf2 (<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">Shah et al., 2023</xref>). These genes include genes involved in GSH regulation (synthesis and cysteine supply <italic>via</italic> system Xc-, glutathione reductase, and GPX4), NADPH regeneration, which plays a crucial role in GPX4 activity, and iron regulation (<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">Ou et al., 2022</xref>; <xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">Xu et al., 2023</xref>). Nrf2 knockout results in impaired mitochondrial function, whereas Nrf2 activation enhances mitochondrial function and resistance to stressors (<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">Greco and Fiskum, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">Holmstrom et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">Neymotin et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, Nrf2 plays a crucial role in ferroptosis as it regulates numerous genes that are central to ferroptosis. Enhancing Nrf2 signaling has neuroprotective effects in PD and prevents ferroptosis.</p><p>As discussed earlier, PD can be improved by inhibiting ferroptosis as it reduces the loss of DAergic neurons associated with PD. Electroacupuncture (EA), an invaluable Traditional Chinese Medicine approach, has increasingly become an important choice for patients due to its safe, reliable, and inexpensive therapeutic effects, as well as low use of medication and thus significantly reduced side effects. EA treatment has been shown to resist PD symptoms in multiple ways. This study was carried out to investigate whether EA offers therapeutic effects on PD by inhibiting ferroptosis. The findings of this study indicate that ferroptosis is associated with the loss of DAergic neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) of PD model mice following 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) insult and that EA administration alleviates the motor dysfunction of PD mice by inhibiting ferroptosis. Further results have confirmed that EA increases Nrf2 expression, followed by the upregulation of the key molecules SLC7A11, FTH1, and GPX4 to improve mitochondrial dysfunction, thus relieving PD symptoms by inhibiting the ferroptosis of DAergic neurons. These findings shed light on EA-mediated improvement in PD by inhibiting the ferroptosis signaling Nrf2/SLC7A11/FTH1/GPX4 pathway and provide a clear understanding of the previously unrecognized anti-ferroptotic mechanism of EA in treating PD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec3"><label>2.1</label><title>Materials</title><p>MPTP hydrochloride (catalog no.

The PD model was established by an intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of MPTP (30&#x0202f;mg/kg) once daily for 5&#x0202f;days. The mice in the MPTP + sham EA group were subjected to non-acupoint stimulation for 7&#x0202f;days before MPTP injury. The mice in the MPTP + EA and MPTP + L-DA groups were subjected to EA treatment and L-DA in water intragastrically (20&#x0202f;mg/kg i.g.), respectively, for 7&#x0202f;days before MPTP injury, followed by an additional 5&#x0202f;days of respective treatment. The Ctrl group received an equal volume of saline. The two acupoints Baihui and Fengfu are positioned in the Du Meridian. In particular, Baihui is located at the midpoint of the line connecting the two ear tips, and Fengfu is located at the depression between the occiput and the atlas. Sterile stainless steel needles (0.35&#x0202f;mm diameter, 13&#x0202f;mm long) were inserted into the acupoints and connected to the EA instrument. Then, the acupoints were stimulated at 1&#x0202f;mA intensity and 5&#x0202f;Hz frequency for 30&#x0202f;min per day, for 12&#x0202f;days consecutively. One day after the last treatment, behavioral assessments were carried out using an open field test (OFT), rotarod test, traction test, and pole test. On the 14th day, all animals were euthanized after deep anesthesia for further study. All experiments were conducted in accordance with the principles established for the care and use of laboratory animals by the National Institutes of Health and were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the Fourth Military Medical University.

Mechanically, EA administration ameliorated MPTP-evoked ferroptosis and mitochondrial injury by promoting the survival of DAergic neurons and increasing the neurotransmission of DA to provide symptomatic relief in the MPTP-induced PD model. The activation of the Nrf2/System Xc-/GPX4 pathway was responsible for EA-mediated anti-ferroptosis effects that promoted the survival of DAergic neurons in the SN subjected to the MPTP insult. Furthermore, AT, an inhibitor of Nrf2 activation, abolished the inhibition of ferroptosis and cell mitochondrial injury mediated by EA therapy in PD mice upon MPTP stimulation. These results highlight that MPTP-evoked ferroptosis and mitochondrial injury are responsible for the pathogenesis of the PD model and that EA can be used as a potential therapeutic strategy for PD treatment as it suppresses ferroptosis.</p><p>The primary pathophysiological feature of PD is the degeneration of DAergic neurons in the SN (<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">Dionisio et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">Lu et al., 2023</xref>), and a specific DAergic neuroprotective drug for PD therapy has not been developed. A better understanding of the pathological mechanisms associated with DAergic neuronal loss is required for designing novel therapeutic targets for PD treatment. EA, a modification to conventional acupuncture, offers therapeutic effects to central nervous system diseases, including PD, by promoting neuronal survival; however, the mechanisms involved in EA are still not well understood. Consistent with previous findings, our experimental results revealed that EA significantly alleviates MPTP-induced motor dysfunctions in mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>) by decreasing the loss of DAergic neurons (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). Our findings also showed that ferroptosis is an iron-dependent regulatory cell death driven by lipid peroxidation, which is involved in the loss of DAergic neurons in the pathogenesis of PD. Therefore, developing an effective method for PD treatment against ferroptosis is critical. Our findings showed the therapeutic effects of EA are attributable to anti-ferroptosis, which are manifested as the increased levels of ferroptosis-related proteins Nrf2, SLC7A11, GPX4, and FTH1 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>); decreased levels of intracellular MDA, 4-HNE, and iron; and an increased level of GSH (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). These findings show the association between EA therapy and anti-ferroptosis against PD. Elucidating how ferroptosis provokes PD will reveal new therapeutic opportunities to treat PD.</p><p>Iron plays a crucial role in myelination, neurotransmitter biosynthesis, and energy metabolism (<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">Belaidi and Bush, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">Crichton et al., 2011</xref>); therefore, cellular iron homeostasis plays an important role in neuronal function, which is highly regulated by iron uptake, distribution, and efflux (<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">Ward et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">Weinreb et al., 2013</xref>). A previous study has shown that intracellular iron accumulation has toxic effects in terms of biological function and generates a large amount of oxygen free radicals, which in turn damage intracellular DNA, proteins, and cell organelles, especially mitochondria (<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">Stockwell et al., 2017</xref>). Our study also found that the MMP of SN dopaminergic neurons decreased after the administration of MPTP (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). Iron dysregulation can block mitochondrial electron transport chain activity and generate ROS, which increases oxidative stress. Our results showed an increased iron level and decreased expression of FTH1, the primary iron storage protein, which was involved in iron accumulation in ferroptosis after the MPTP insult (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>), suggesting that abnormal iron homeostasis induces ferroptosis. Furthermore, iron deficiency or accumulation can lead to cellular dysfunction and energy crisis.</p><p>The increased Fe<sup>2+</sup> level is a notable maker for ferroptosis, and intracellular iron accumulation triggers the depletion of GSH, leading to a decrease in GPX4 activity and the inability to metabolize lipid peroxides, thus resulting in free Fe<sup>2+</sup>-oxidizing lipids through the Fenton reaction to produce ROS and leading to ferroptosis (<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">Dixon et al., 2012</xref>). Free Fe<sup>2+</sup> accelerates the aggregation of <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>-synuclein, leading to the death of DAergic neurons (<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">Do Van et al., 2016</xref>). Numerous studies have shown that there is an increase in free iron storage and lipid peroxidation levels in the SN of PD patients. Recent studies have further confirmed that the inhibition of ferroptosis in DAergic neurons attenuates motor dysfunctions in MPTP-induced mice (<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">Guiney et al., 2017</xref>). Consistent with previous findings, our results revealed that EA stimulation at Baihui and Fengfu significantly inhibited ferroptosis and attenuated MPTP-induced motor dysfunctions in mice. In addition, in MPTP-treated DAergic neurons, MPTP caused mitochondrial damage, which was manifested as a decrease in MMP. EA treatment can improve the mitochondrial function of DAergic neurons. Nrf2 is a key regulatory factor for maintaining oxidative stability in cells and is associated with ferroptosis. Genes related to iron overload and lipid peroxidation are the target genes of Nrf2. Previous studies have reported that specific knockout of the Nrf2 gene reduces the expression of SLC7A11, inhibits GPX4 activity, and enhances the sensitivity of erastin-induced ferroptosis in PC12 cells. Regarding whether Nrf2 is involved in regulating the transmission of stimulatory signals at SNc DAergic neurons, our findings further confirmed that the administration of the Nrf2 antagonist AT partially attenuated the EA-triggered increase in MMP. These results further demonstrated that EA stimulation exerts a neuroprotective effect through Nrf2-mediated inhibition of MPTP-induced ferroptosis.</p><p>In conclusion, our results revealed for the first time that EA stimulation at Baihui and Fengfu of MPTP-treated mice inhibited the ferroptosis of DAergic neurons through activation of Nrf2, attenuated oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction, and alleviated MPTP-induced motor dysfunctions. However, the safety and side effects of EA in PD patients should be further emphasized. Although clinical studies have demonstrated the safety and minimal side effects of EA in PD patients, it should be noted that individual differences, such as disease stage and acupoint sensitivity, may affect treatment outcomes. To address this challenge, future clinical studies should standardize EA parameters and stratify patient populations.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><title>Abbreviations</title><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>GPX4, glutathione peroxidase 4; ROS, reactive oxygen species; L-DA, levodopa; TH, tyrosine hydroxylase; GSH, glutathione; MDA, malondialdehyde; MMP, mitochondrial membrane potential; AT, alkaloid trigonelline; Nrf2, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2; JC-1, 5,5,6,6&#x02032;-tetrachloro-1,1&#x02032;,3,3&#x02032;tetraethylbenzimi-dazoylcarbocyanine iodide.</p></fn></fn-group><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="sec25"><title>Data availability statement</title><p>The datasets presented in this study can be found in online repositories.
