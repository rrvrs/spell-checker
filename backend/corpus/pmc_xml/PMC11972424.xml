Humans contract the disease by being bitten by female phlebotomine sandflies carrying the protozoan parasite Leishmania, which is responsible for over 20 forms of the disease. An estimated 700,000 to 1 million new cases are reported worldwide each year, predominantly in tropical and subtropical regions [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>The three primary manifestations of the disease are &#x0201c;visceral&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;mucocutaneous&#x0201d;, and &#x0201c;cutaneous leishmaniasis&#x0201d;. Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is the most prevalent type and is distinguished by skin lesions that have the potential to create lasting scars [<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Mucocutaneous leishmaniasis impacts the throat, mouth, and nose mucous membranes, whereas kala-azar, another name for visceral leishmaniasis, is the utmost critical formation, affecting internal organs [<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Urogenital involvement in leishmaniasis is exceptionally rare. A comprehensive literature review reveals fewer than 10 documented cases of leishmanial urethritis worldwide [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The pathogenesis of urethral involvement likely involves direct invasion of the urethral mucosa by the parasite or extension from adjacent cutaneous lesions [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Previous cases reported&#x000a0;have documented isolated instances of genital leishmaniasis, but the combination of urethral stricture and urethrocutaneous fistula represents an even rarer presentation [<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="cases"><title>Case presentation</title><p>A 42-year-old male, a resident of an endemic region, presented to our urology department with multiple maculopapular nodular lesions predominantly involving the lips, nose, and tongue. The patient also had painful genital ulcers, dysuria, and difficulty in urination for the past three months, which had been progressively worsening to urinary extravasation from a fistulous site on the perineum (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="FIG1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).</p><fig position="anchor" fig-type="figure" id="FIG1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Demonstrating urethrocutaneous fistula in the patient.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="cureus-0017-00000080179-i01" position="float"/></fig><p>He had no history of chronic illnesses, immunosuppressive therapy, or previous genitourinary infections. However, he had a history of frequent outdoor exposure in a rural endemicity area for leishmaniasis. Physical examination revealed multiple non-healing ulcerative lesions on the external genitalia, with active urinary leakage by an abnormal opening through the perineal region consistent with urethrocutaneous fistula. A digital rectal examination was normal, and the external urethral meatus was stenotic. Routine laboratory investigations were normal with mild anemia (Hb: 10.4 g/dL), normal renal function tests, normal liver function tests, and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), suggesting an inflammatory process. Microscopic hematuria and pyuria were found on urinalysis, and the urine culture was sterile. HIV and syphilis were negative by serological tests. The cutaneous lesions were biopsied, and histopathological examination revealed Leishmania amastigotes in macrophages (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="FIG2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).</p><fig position="anchor" fig-type="figure" id="FIG2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Histopathological examination showing Leishmania amastigotes within macrophages (H&#x00026;E stain, 400x).</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="cureus-0017-00000080179-i02" position="float"/></fig><p>Leishmania parasites were demonstrated in a slit-skin smear test.

Medical therapy failed to cure the persistent urinary symptoms, and so there was a need for surgery. A staged urethroplasty was planned. In the first stage, the strictured urethral segment was laid open, and the fistulous tract was carefully excised (Figure <xref rid="FIG4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>).</p><fig position="anchor" fig-type="figure" id="FIG4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Intraoperative picture demonstrating laying open of strictured urethral segment and urethrocutaneous fistula.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="cureus-0017-00000080179-i04" position="float"/></fig><p>After six weeks, in the second stage, the urethra was reconstructed using a buccal mucosal graft.

Early recognition and intervention are important in preventing long-term complications and attaining the best possible outcomes for these patients. In the literature, there are previous reports of leishmaniasis-related urethral involvement, although rare, that may result in significant fibrosis and persistent stricture formation. Leishmania infections are polymorphic; thus, early diagnosis is complicated, particularly in non-endemic regions, as highlighted by Georgiadou et al. (2015) [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Gazerani et al. (2022) also pointed out that genitourinary manifestations of leishmaniasis can mimic other chronic infectious diseases and thus delay appropriate treatment [<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Complications require a combination of antiparasitic therapy and surgical intervention as part of the management strategies. The treatment of choice is still amphotericin B, as recommended by the WHO Expert Committee on Leishmaniasis (1990), but surgical correction is required to resolve urethral stricture&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Similar cases have been documented in parasitic infections by Rodrigues Coura and de Castro (2002), who have shown that staged urethroplasty can restore urethral function and minimize recurrence&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. According to Mann et al. (2021), long-term follow-up studies are required to assess functional outcomes in patients with urogenital complications secondary to leishmaniasis&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. A multidisciplinary approach to the diagnosis and management of such rare presentations as this case represents is also emphasized in this case to ensure timely intervention and optimize patient recovery.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>A multidisciplinary approach to the rare complications of leishmaniasis successfully manages this case. Early diagnosis, based on a high index of clinical suspicion, is essential in areas where atypical presentation may lead to oversight in endemic areas. Systemic antiparasitic therapy followed by staged surgical intervention has proved to be effective in rendering urinary function and preventing a poor, long-term outcome.</p><p>This case also highlights the necessity of additional investigations into the mechanisms of Leishmania persistence in genitourinary tissues and immunomodulation in treatment outcomes. Standardized management protocols for such rare presentations will require long-term follow-up and larger case series. Clinical recognition of the disease is pivotal; medico-surgical improvements have become more precise, and early diagnosis coupled with targeted medical therapy can go a distance in shaping successful patient results and improved quality of life.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group content-type="conflict"><title>Disclosures</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Human subjects:</bold> Consent for treatment and open access publication was obtained or waived by all participants in this study.
