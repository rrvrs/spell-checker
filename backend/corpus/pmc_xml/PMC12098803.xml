An impacted tooth other than third molars should be aligned for reasons of arch length deficiency, pathological conditions, or for its location that does not allow its alignment. Maxillary canine impactions can be palatal or buccal. The incidence of palatal impaction is higher than buccal impaction [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>The etiology of impaction can broadly be classified into local or systemic causes. Local causes include arch length deficiency, genetic causes, or increased bone density. Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) is one of the methods used for the localization of canines. Advantages of CBCT are three-dimensional images, less image distortion, and low radiation dose. There are only a few studies assessing the bone quality of the maxilla on the impacted and contralateral nonimpacted side. This may be due to Hounsfield units of CBCT, which are not reliable for assessing the bone density [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>Fractal analysis is a method used in describing complex shapes and structural patterns and is expressed numerically as the fractal dimension (FD). Fractal analysis is the process of information processing, where the data are uploaded in the form of an image [<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Due to the irregular and random nature of trabecular bone, fractal analysis is a reliable method of assessing bone quality compared to Hounsfield units [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>There are no previous studies comparing the bone density around buccal and palatal impacted canines. The study aimed to determine the bone density around buccally and palatally impacted canines and to assess whether bone density is an etiologic factor contributing to the increased incidence of palatal impaction.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>This retrospective study was done using pretreatment CBCT scans of patients with unilateral or bilateral canine impaction. Twenty CBCT scans (10 buccal and 10 palatal) were selected. Inclusion criteria included CBCT scans with unilateral or bilateral canine impaction, complete eruption of the contralateral canine in unilateral impaction, and no prior history of orthodontic treatment. CBCT scans that included bone pathology, supernumerary teeth, and systemic disease affecting bone health were excluded. The image processing was done using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). The area of interest was the interproximal area adjacent to the impacted canine between the first and second premolar because of the availability of trabecular bone (Figure <xref rid="FIG1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).</p><fig position="anchor" fig-type="figure" id="FIG1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>CBCT image (coronal section) showing maxillary impacted canine, which is selected for checking bone density</title><p>CBCT:&#x000a0;cone-beam computed tomography</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="cureus-0017-00000082761-i01" position="float"/></fig><p>CBCT images were saved in JPEG format.

Palatally impacted canines have been associated with increased dental arch space, and buccally impacted canines are associated with decreased space for eruption [<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>-<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, there are no previous studies comparing bone density between the palatally and buccally impacted canines.</p><p>According to a study conducted by Servais et al., the maxillary alveolar bone area is increased in the impacted side compared with the nonimpacted side [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. A retrospective study conducted by Arvind et al. concluded that the fractal bone density around impacted canines is greater than that of the nonimpacted side when studied in a Dravidian population. This study also addresses the various uses of fractal density, such as the determination of mid-palatal suture maturation and condylar patterns [<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>CBCT is an emerging technique used for localizing canines. Because Hounsfield was not reliable due to varying amounts of gray scale [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], FD was considered for measuring bone density. Previous studies have cited only genetics [<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and the presence of lateral incisors [<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] as etiologic factors for impaction; however, no studies have been conducted to consider bone density as a local etiologic factor for the increased incidence of palatal impaction. The rate of tooth movement is inversely proportional to bone density. Thus, knowing the bone density pattern around impacted canines will help in planning any adjunctive acceleratory procedures during disimpaction, thereby reducing treatment time [<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>The study's only limitation was its limited sample size; however, the strict inclusion and exclusion criteria helped maintain the homogeneity of the sample.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our analysis of the CBCT scans concluded that bone density around palatally impacted canine is greater as compared to buccally impacted canine. FD analysis in orthodontics is a valuable tool for assessing bone density and trabecular patterns around impacted canines. Thus, bone density is a one of the local etiologic factors for increased incidence of palatal impactions. Thus, knowing the bone density helps in planning a tailored treatment approach for disimpaction and thus helps in improving the biomechanics and treatment outcomes.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group content-type="conflict"><title>Disclosures</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Human subjects:</bold> Consent for treatment and open access publication was obtained or waived by all participants in this study.</p><p><bold>Animal subjects:</bold> All authors have confirmed that this study did not involve animal subjects or tissue.</p><p><bold>Conflicts of interest:</bold> In compliance with the ICMJE uniform disclosure form, all authors declare the following:</p><p><bold>Payment/services info:</bold> All authors have declared that no financial support was received from any organization for the submitted work.</p><p><bold>Financial relationships:</bold> All authors have declared that they have no financial relationships at present or within the previous three years with any organizations that might have an interest in the submitted work.</p><p><bold>Other relationships:</bold> All authors have declared that there are no other relationships or activities that could appear to have influenced the submitted work.</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="other"><title>Author Contributions</title><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Concept and design:</bold>&#x000a0; Manish S.
