Thus, gaining insights into the molecular mechanisms of BP circadian variation is essential for comprehending BP regulation. Human genetic analyses suggest that PR domain&#x02013;containing protein 16 (PRDM16), a transcription factor highly expressed in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), is significantly associated with BP-related traits. However, the roles of PRDM16 in BP regulation are largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that BP in VSMC-specific <italic toggle="yes">Prdm16</italic>-KO (<italic toggle="yes">Prdm16</italic><sup>SMKO</sup>) mice was significantly lower than that in control mice during the active period, resulting in aberrant BP circadian variation. Mesenteric artery rings from <italic toggle="yes">Prdm16</italic><sup>SMKO</sup> mice showed a reduced response to phenylephrine. Mechanistically, we identified adrenergic receptor &#x003b1; 1d (<italic toggle="yes">Adra1d</italic>) as a transcriptional target of PRDM16. Notably, PRDM16 exhibited a remarkable circadian expression pattern and regulated the expression of clock genes, particularly <italic toggle="yes">Npas2</italic>, which is crucial for BP circadian variation regulation. Consequently, PRDM16 deficiency in VSMCs caused disrupted BP circadian variation through a reduced response to adrenergic signaling and clock gene regulation. Our findings provide insights into the intricate molecular pathways that govern circadian fluctuations in BP.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical"><p>

Declines in nocturnal BP can be classified into normal dippers (10%&#x02013;20% drop), nondippers (0%&#x02013;10% drop), extreme dippers (&#x02265;20% drop), and reverse dippers (negative percentage change in BP during sleep) (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Abnormalities in BP circadian variations are closely linked to a higher risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Understanding the mechanisms behind BP circadian variation is important for hypertension management.</p><p>The contraction state of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) in blood vessels is critical for the regulation of BP levels (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). VSMC contractility is regulated by neurotransmitters, hormones, and vasoactive factors via GPCRs, leading to myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation and vascular contraction (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). The internal timing system, including the central clock in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), and peripheral clocks, with clock genes (<italic toggle="yes">Bmal1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Clock</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Per</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Cry</italic>), play a crucial role in BP regulation as well (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Disruptions in clock genes such as <italic toggle="yes">Bmal1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Npas2</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Cry</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">Clock</italic> have been shown to change BP circadian rhythms (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).</p><p>PR domain&#x02013;containing protein 16 (PRDM16) is a transcriptional factor known for its role in brown adipocyte determination (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Recent findings have highlighted the crucial functions of PRDM16 in the cardiovascular system, including maintenance of normal heart development and function (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>), sustainment of endothelial functions (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), and regulation of arterial development and vascular integrity (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Importantly, PRDM16 is most highly expressed in the aorta and artery, and single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) analysis in aortas from both humans and mice revealed that PRDM16 is predominantly expressed in VSMCs (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), where it protects against abdominal aortic aneurysm (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS) have linked several single nucleotide polymorphisms, either within or closest to the <italic toggle="yes">PRDM16</italic> gene, to BP-related traits, including diastolic BP (DBP), systolic BP (SBP), hypertension, coronary artery disease (CAD), and stroke (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). However, direct evidence of the role of PRDM16 in BP regulation is lacking. Using RNA-Seq analysis, we discovered that VSMC-specific <italic toggle="yes">Prdm16</italic>-KO mice (<italic toggle="yes">Prdm16</italic><sup>SMKO</sup>) (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) exhibited dysregulated clock genes in the aorta, suggesting a potential link between PRDM16 in VSMCs and BP regulation. We thus hypothesized that PRDM16 in VSMC regulates BP circadian variation. In this study, we demonstrate that loss of function of PRDM16 in VSMCs caused nondipping BP as a result of reduced adrenergic receptor signaling and alterations in clock gene expression.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>PRDM16 expression in vascular cells and its association with BP-related traits.</title><p>The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) Portal dataset indicates that <italic toggle="yes">PRDM16</italic> is predominantly expressed in the aorta and artery compared with other organs.

Our findings revealed that during the active phase (lights-off period), basal BP (both SBP and DBP) in <italic toggle="yes">Prdm16</italic><sup>SMKO</sup> mice was markedly lower than that in control mice (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Interestingly, during the sleeping phase (lights-on period), we detected no significant difference in SBP and DBP between the 2 groups, although <italic toggle="yes">Prdm16</italic><sup>SMKO</sup> mice exhibited a tendency toward lower SBP and DBP (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Meanwhile, we observed a significant decrease in the amplitude range of both SBP and DBP in <italic toggle="yes">Prdm16</italic><sup>SMKO</sup> mice, whereas the circadian wavelength range and phase-shift range remained consistent when compared with those of control mice (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Consequently, BP decline from the active phase to the sleeping phase was less than 10%, indicating a nondipping BP pattern in <italic toggle="yes">Prdm16</italic><sup>SMKO</sup> mice (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>).</p><p>We further used a newly developed <italic toggle="yes">Itga8</italic>-CreER<sup>T2</sup> (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) mouse model to delete PRDM16 in VSMCs.

Consistent with the results from <italic toggle="yes">SMMHC</italic>-CreER<sup>T2</sup>&#x02013;mediated KO of <italic toggle="yes">Prdm16</italic> in male mice, <italic toggle="yes">Itga8</italic>-CreER<sup>T2</sup>&#x02013;mediated <italic toggle="yes">Prdm16</italic> KO in female mice also resulted in hypotension during the active phase and a nondipping BP pattern (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 2</xref>, A&#x02013;C).</p><p>The BP changes observed in <italic toggle="yes">Prdm16</italic><sup>SMKO</sup> mice were not attributable to their heart rate (HR), which was comparable between the 2 groups (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 2A</xref>). The cardiac function parameters such as ejection fraction (EF) and fractional shortening (FS) were also comparable between the 2 groups (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Tables 1 and 2</xref>). Furthermore, the 2 groups of mice exhibited similar levels of locomotor activity (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 2A</xref>) and whole-body metabolism. The energy expenditure, O<sub>2</sub> consumption rate (VO<sub>2</sub>), and CO<sub>2</sub> production rate (VCO<sub>2</sub>) did not show significant differences between <italic toggle="yes">Prdm16</italic><sup>SMKO</sup> and control mice (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 3A</xref>). In alignment with these findings, the body weight, body composition (percentage of fat and lean mass), glucose tolerance, and insulin sensitivity were also similar across the groups (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 3</xref>, B&#x02013;E).

We isolated the first-order branches of superior mesenteric arteries and determined their responses to various vasoconstrictors to discern the contribution of different mechanisms. We found that potassium chloride&#x02013;induced (KCl-induced) contractions of the arterial rings were comparable between <italic toggle="yes">Prdm16</italic><sup>SMKO</sup> and control mice (2.05 &#x000b1; 0.20 mN in <italic toggle="yes">Prdm16</italic><sup>SMKO</sup> mice vs. 2.09 &#x000b1; 0.24 mN in control mice) (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). However, arterial rings from <italic toggle="yes">Prdm16</italic><sup>SMKO</sup> mice showed a significantly decreased contractile response to phenylephrine (PE) compared with those from control mice (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>), while other vasoconstrictors including 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, also known as serotonin), prostaglandin F2&#x003b1; (PGF2&#x003b1;), and U46619 (a thromboxane A2 agonist) induced similar responses in arterial rings isolated from <italic toggle="yes">Prdm16</italic><sup>SMKO</sup> and control mice (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3, C&#x02013;E</xref>). We also evaluated the vasorelaxation of arterial rings to acetylcholine (Ach) and sodium nitroprusside (SNP) and found no significant differences between <italic toggle="yes">Prdm16</italic><sup>SMKO</sup> and control mice (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3, F and G</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>PRDM16 transcriptionally activates the expression of the adrenoceptor Adra1d.</title><p>To further explore the underlying mechanisms mediating the impaired contractile response specifically to PE in <italic toggle="yes">Prdm16</italic><sup>SMKO</sup> mice, we performed qPCR to determine the mRNA expression levels of the related receptors for the above-mentioned vasoconstrictors. PE selectively binds to and activates adrenoceptor &#x003b1; 1 receptors, which consists of adrenoceptor &#x003b1; 1a (encoded by <italic toggle="yes">Adra1a</italic>), adrenoceptor &#x003b1; 1b (encoded by <italic toggle="yes">Adra1b</italic>), and adrenoceptor &#x003b1; 1d (encoded by <italic toggle="yes">Adra1d</italic>). <italic toggle="yes">Adra1d</italic> is the most highly expressed &#x003b1;1-adrenergic receptor in the media, while <italic toggle="yes">Adra1a</italic> is primarily expressed in the adventitia, and <italic toggle="yes">Adra1b</italic> shows negligible expression levels (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 4A</xref>). We found that the mRNA expression of <italic toggle="yes">Adra1a</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Adra1d</italic> in the aorta was significantly reduced in <italic toggle="yes">Prdm16</italic><sup>SMKO</sup> mice compared with control mice (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). Consistent with the comparable responses to 5-HT, PGF2&#x003b1;, U46619, Ach, and SNP in artery rings between <italic toggle="yes">Prdm16</italic><sup>SMKO</sup> and control mice, the mRNA expression levels of serotonin receptor 2A (<italic toggle="yes">Htr2a</italic>), prostaglandin F receptor (<italic toggle="yes">Ptgfr</italic>), thromboxane A2 receptor (<italic toggle="yes">Tbxa2r</italic>), and nitric oxide synthase 3 (<italic toggle="yes">Nos3</italic>) in the aorta were comparable between <italic toggle="yes">Prdm16</italic><sup>SMKO</sup> and control mice (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 4B</xref>). It is well established that adrenoceptor activation leads to phosphorylation of the downstream effector MLC, which is critical for vascular contraction (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). We found that phosphorylation of MLC in the aorta of <italic toggle="yes">Prdm16</italic><sup>SMKO</sup> mice was significantly decreased compared with that in aortas of control mice (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). We further validated that both the mRNA expression levels of <italic toggle="yes">Adra1d</italic> (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>) and the phosphorylation of MLC (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>) in cultured VSMCs were markedly reduced upon <italic toggle="yes">Prdm16</italic> knockdown (KD).</p><p>Considering that PRDM16 is a transcriptional regulator (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), we next performed ChIP-Seq analysis. We identified a binding peak of PRDM16 in the promoter region of <italic toggle="yes">Adra1d</italic> but not of <italic toggle="yes">Adra1a</italic> or <italic toggle="yes">Adra1b</italic> (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). In addition, ChIP-qPCR analysis further confirmed the binding of PRDM16 in the promoter region of <italic toggle="yes">Adra1d</italic> (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>). To investigate whether the binding of PRDM16 to the <italic toggle="yes">Adra1d</italic> promoter regulates its activity, we cloned the promoter surrounding the binding peak region of <italic toggle="yes">Adra1d</italic> to a luciferase reporter vector (pGL4.10) and transfected the reporter vector into NIH/3T3 cells. We found that coexpression of PRDM16 significantly activated the expression of luciferase (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>). All these data demonstrate that PRDM16 transcriptionally activated the expression of the adrenoceptor <italic toggle="yes">Adra1d</italic>, which mediated VSMC contraction induced by PE. PRDM16 deficiency in VSMCs resulted in reduced <italic toggle="yes">Adra1d</italic> expression and a blunted response to the adrenoceptor signaling pathway, particularly during the active phase in which the sympathetic nervous system is active. This led to nondipping BP.</p></sec><sec><title>Loss of the VSMC contractile phenotype upon PRDM16 ablation.</title><p>Our previous study showed that the mRNA levels of <italic toggle="yes">Acta2</italic> (encodes smooth muscle cell &#x003b1; actin [&#x003b1;SMA]) were decreased in the aorta of <italic toggle="yes">Prdm16</italic><sup>SMKO</sup> mice compared with levels in control mice (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). To further explore the functional role of PRDM16 in contractile phenotype, we performed a 3D, collagen-based cell contraction assay, which revealed that KD of <italic toggle="yes">Prdm16</italic> dramatically impeded the contraction of VSMCs (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). We consistently found that <italic toggle="yes">Prdm16</italic> KD markedly reduced mRNA levels of all 4 recognized VSMC marker genes, namely <italic toggle="yes">Myh11</italic> (encodes smooth muscle myosin heavy chain, also known as MYH11), <italic toggle="yes">Acta2</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Tagln</italic> (encodes smooth muscle protein 22&#x003b1; [SM22&#x003b1;]), and <italic toggle="yes">Cnn1</italic> (encodes calponin 1) (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>), and protein expression of &#x003b1;SMA, calponin 1, and SM22&#x003b1; (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). We also used primary VSMCs isolated from rat mesenteric arteries to further confirm that PRDM16 was essential for maintaining the VSMC contractile phenotype in resistance arteries (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5, D and E</xref>). Furthermore, we observed a significant reduction in protein expression of &#x003b1;SMA, calponin 1, and SM22&#x003b1; in the medial layer of thoracic aortas from <italic toggle="yes">Prdm16</italic><sup>SMKO</sup> mice compared with control mice (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>). However, the involvement of PRDM16 in controlling contractile marker gene expression may not have resulted from direct transcriptional regulation, since no binding peaks were found in the promoter regions of these genes (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 5</xref>). Taken together, these data indicate that PRDM16 was essential for maintaining the contractile phenotype of VSMCs.

The <italic toggle="yes">Cry1/Cry2</italic> mRNA levels in the aorta of <italic toggle="yes">Prdm16</italic><sup>SMKO</sup> mice were higher than those in control mice during light-off period (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>), whereas peak mRNA levels of <italic toggle="yes">Per3</italic> at Zeitgeber time 12 (ZT12) were lower in <italic toggle="yes">Prdm16</italic><sup>SMKO</sup> mice (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref>). These data suggest that PRDM16 may control the expressions of clock genes. In addition, we found that the circadian expression pattern of <italic toggle="yes">Adra1d</italic> was almost abolished in <italic toggle="yes">Prdm16</italic><sup>SMKO</sup> mice (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G</xref>).</p><p>From our ChIP-Seq analysis, we identified 11,271 peaks representing putative PRDM16-binding sites across the genome, with 19.5% residing in the promoter, 12.1% in exons, 38.0% in introns, and 20.2% in intergenic regions (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>). Motif analysis of PRDM16 ChIP-Seq peaks revealed that consensus DNA binding motifs for MECOM (also known as PRDM3), which has a binding motif almost identical to that for PRDM16 (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), and several other transcription factors including HAND2 and GATA family transcription factors were highly enriched (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>).

We next developed a strategy of comparing clock genes with both altered 24-hour mRNA oscillations upon PRDM16 KO (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6, D&#x02013;F</xref>), PRDM16 binding signals in the promoter region (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>), and ChIP-qPCR (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref>), and identified <italic toggle="yes">Npas2</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Cry2</italic> as PRDM16 target clock genes (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7E</xref>). In addition, we verified that PRDM16 expression significantly activated <italic toggle="yes">Npas2</italic> promoter&#x02013;driven luciferase expression (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 6</xref>). Although the underlying mechanisms are yet to be fully addressed, <italic toggle="yes">Npas2<sup>mut</sup></italic> mice (with decreased expression of <italic toggle="yes">Npas2</italic>) are hypotensive (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), and <italic toggle="yes">Cry</italic>-null mice are hypertensive upon salt induction (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), these results are consistent with the hypotensive phenotype observed in <italic toggle="yes">Prdm16</italic><sup>SMKO</sup> mice. The gene ontology (GO) analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with PRDM16 binding at their promoters revealed that the upregulated target genes were significantly enriched in the rhythmic process and the circadian rhythm (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 7</xref> and <xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Table 3</xref>), further emphasizing the involvement of PRDM16 in the regulation of clock genes.</p></sec><sec><title>Interactions between the two PRDM16 targets: clock genes and Adra1d.</title><p>We next investigated how these 3 factors, PRDM16, clock genes (primarily NPAS2 and its binding partner, BMAL1), and ADR&#x003b1;1d, collaboratively regulate the BP circadian variation. For this purpose, we first asked whether NPAS2:BMAL1 regulates <italic toggle="yes">Prdm16</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Adra1d</italic> expression. As shown in <xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A</xref>, KD of <italic toggle="yes">Npas2</italic> or <italic toggle="yes">Bmal1</italic> had no effect on <italic toggle="yes">Prdm16</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Adra1d</italic> expression in primary VSMCs. Interestingly, KD of <italic toggle="yes">Bmal1</italic> resulted in a dramatic increase in <italic toggle="yes">Npas2</italic> expression, which could be a compensatory response, as previously indicated (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Next, we investigated whether ADR&#x003b1;1d could regulate <italic toggle="yes">Prdm16</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Npas2</italic> or <italic toggle="yes">Bmal1</italic> expression. As shown in <xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8B</xref>, <italic toggle="yes">Adra1d</italic> KD did not influence <italic toggle="yes">Prdm16</italic> or <italic toggle="yes">Bmal1</italic> expression but markedly reduced <italic toggle="yes">Npas2</italic> expression. It is worth noting that <italic toggle="yes">Adra1d</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Prdm16</italic> double-KD synergistically decreased <italic toggle="yes">Npas2</italic> expression, indicating that the regulation of <italic toggle="yes">Npas2</italic> by ADR&#x003b1;1d and PRDM16 likely occurs through different pathways. Neither <italic toggle="yes">Npas2</italic>/<italic toggle="yes">Bmal1</italic> nor <italic toggle="yes">Adra1d</italic> KD affected <italic toggle="yes">Prdm16</italic> expression (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8C</xref>). Taken together, we found that PRDM16 played a dominant role in regulating the expression of <italic toggle="yes">Adra1d</italic> and clock genes, whereas ADR&#x003b1;1d independently regulated <italic toggle="yes">Npas2</italic> expression.</p><p>In summary, these data indicated that PRDM16 is a critical factor that regulates BP levels and variation by targeting the expression of <italic toggle="yes">Adra1d</italic> and clock genes. These findings extensively expand the critical roles of PRDM16 in the cardiovascular system and provide the translational basis for human studies.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>GWAS and PheWAS have identified several single nucleotide polymorphisms, either within or closest to the <italic toggle="yes">PRDM16</italic> gene, that are closely related to BP and CVD (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). In this study, we provide the first evidence to our knowledge that PRDM16 in VSMCs regulates BP circadian variation by regulating the expression of <italic toggle="yes">Adra1d</italic> and core clock genes in VSMCs. Loss of PRDM16 function in mouse VSMCs resulted in an impaired BP circadian variation, with lower BP during the active phase.</p><p>The contractile function of VSMCs in blood vessels is critical for the regulation of vascular tone and BP levels. PRDM16 has been identified as a single-nucleus assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with high-throughput sequencing (snATAC-Seq) SMC marker gene, showing a positive correlation with traditional SMC markers and a negative correlation with fibromyocyte marker genes (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). In our study, we demonstrated that PRDM16 deficiency in VSMCs markedly reduced the expression of contractile marker genes and impaired collagen-based contraction in vitro. Interestingly, our ChIP-Seq analysis revealed that PRDM16 did not directly bind to the promoter regions of these contractile marker genes, indicating that its regulatory effects were likely mediated through indirect mechanisms. One potential pathway involves the TGF-&#x003b2; signaling cascade. Previous research has shown that PRDM16 can negatively regulate <italic toggle="yes">Tgfb2</italic>, a key upstream ligand of the TGF-&#x003b2; pathway, possibly by binding to the promoter region of <italic toggle="yes">Tgfb2</italic> (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Additionally, in gastric cancer cells, PRDM16 has been found to inhibit TGF-&#x003b2; signaling by interacting with Ski oncogene, a known repressor of TGF-&#x003b2; signaling (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). These findings suggest a model in which PRDM16 indirectly modulates contractile gene expression in VSMCs by altering TGF-&#x003b2; signaling dynamics. The TGF-&#x003b2; signaling pathway is well known for its pleiotropic regulatory effects on VSMC phenotype and function. Maintaining homeostasis within VSMCs requires a balanced activation of TGF-&#x003b2; signaling (neither deficient nor excessive activation is beneficial). Thus, PRDM16 in VMSCs may indirectly affect the expression of contractile marker genes and the contraction of blood vessels by modulating TGF-&#x003b2; signaling.</p><p>Sympathetic hormones, including epinephrine and norepinephrine, induce VSMC contraction by binding to &#x003b1;1-adrenergic receptors. Our data indicate that PRDM16 bound to the promoter region and transcriptionally activated <italic toggle="yes">Adra1d</italic> expression in VSMCs, although <italic toggle="yes">Adra1a</italic> expression was also reduced in the arteries of <italic toggle="yes">Prdm16</italic><sup>SMKO</sup> mice. However, our ChIP-Seq analysis did not reveal any PRDM16 binding peaks in the promoter region of <italic toggle="yes">Adra1a</italic>, implying that the reduced <italic toggle="yes">Adra1a</italic> mRNA expression may have been a secondary effect of <italic toggle="yes">Adra1d</italic> downregulation. Other important vasoconstriction factors such as angiotensin II (Ang II) (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>) may not contribute to PRDM16-mediated vascular tone regulation. Expression levels of the Ang II receptor <italic toggle="yes">Agtr1a</italic> in the aorta were not different between <italic toggle="yes">Prdm16</italic><sup>SMKO</sup> mice and control mice (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 4B</xref>). Therefore, these findings collectively suggest that PRDM16 played a crucial role in BP regulation by modulating the expression of &#x003b1;1-adrenergic receptors, particularly <italic toggle="yes">Adra1d</italic>. Consistent with our data, a previous study showed that <italic toggle="yes">Adra1d</italic> expression was decreased in the right ventricle of cardiomyocyte-specific <italic toggle="yes">Prdm16</italic>-KO mice (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). The cardiac-null mutation of <italic toggle="yes">Prdm16</italic> causes hypotension in female mice (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). As a result, mice lacking PRDM16 function in VSMCs exhibit lower BP during the active phase due to a blunted response to sympathetic stimulation, resulting in a blunted BP elevation.</p><p>Additionally, previous studies documented that clock genes regulate vascular tone and BP circadian variation by modulating both catecholamine production and responsiveness through adrenergic receptors in the aorta. For instance, global KO of <italic toggle="yes">Bmal1</italic> or <italic toggle="yes">Npas2</italic> mutation in mice reduces BP, especially during the active phase (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). <italic toggle="yes">Bmal1</italic> deletion reduces plasma norepinephrine and epinephrine levels and increases the expression of catechol-<italic toggle="yes">O</italic>-methyltransferase (<italic toggle="yes">Comt</italic>), an enzyme responsible for catecholamine clearance, in the aorta (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Similarly, endothelium-specific <italic toggle="yes">Bmal1</italic> deletion reduces BP during the active phase without altering plasma catecholamines (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). VSMC-specific <italic toggle="yes">Bmal1</italic> deletion also reduces active-phase BP, although the plasma catecholamine levels and adrenoceptor expression levels in VSMCs remain unclear (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). However, expression of the <italic toggle="yes">Cry</italic> gene is regulated by <italic toggle="yes">Bmal1</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">Cry</italic> plays a role in circadian BP regulation by modulating &#x003b1;-adrenergic receptor&#x02013;mediated vasoconstriction. Global <italic toggle="yes">Cry</italic>&#x02013;deficient mice show diminished catecholamine-mediated vasoconstriction due to reduced &#x003b1;-adrenoceptor expression in the aorta (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). In addition to the crosstalk between clock genes in &#x003b1;-adrenergic receptor signaling, the regulation of BP variation by clock genes and <italic toggle="yes">Adra1d</italic> may occur through different pathways. BMAL1 directly activates <italic toggle="yes">Rock2</italic> expression in VSMCs, regulating MLC phosphorylation and vascular contraction through a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent pathway (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). In contrast, ADR&#x003b1;1d signals through Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent pathways involving the Gq/11 family of G proteins, leading to MLC phosphorylation, actin polymerization, and vascular contraction (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Moreover, <italic toggle="yes">Bmal1</italic> KO compensatorily increased <italic toggle="yes">Npas2</italic> expression in the aorta (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), which might be a compensatory way to correct the disrupted clock. And <italic toggle="yes">Npas2</italic> is a target gene of PRDM16 (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). In this study, we comprehensively explored the relationship between PRDM16, clock genes, and the newly identified PRDM16 target gene <italic toggle="yes">Adra1d</italic>. PRDM16 functions as a master regulator that governs the expression of both <italic toggle="yes">Npas2</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Adra1d</italic>. On the one hand, ADR&#x003b1;1d responds to sympathetic nervous system activation by inducing adrenergic receptor signaling pathway transduction to trigger Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent vascular contraction. On the other hand, the NPAS2:BMAL1 complex functions in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent manner (or via other pathways yet to be defined) to induce vascular contraction. These 2 arms thus collaboratively result in blunted BP elevation in the active phase in <italic toggle="yes">Prdm16</italic><sup>SMKO</sup> mice.</p><p>Consistent with expression in adipose tissues and whole eyes (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>), our data showed that PRDM16 expression in the aorta had a circadian pattern. However, little is known about the upstream regulator of PRDM16. Previous studies have suggested that BMAL1 might regulate PRDM16, yet conclusions vary across different tissues. For example, in <italic toggle="yes">Bmal1</italic>-KO mice, <italic toggle="yes">Prdm16</italic> expression is significantly reduced in the olfactory bulb (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>), whereas it is markedly increased in brown adipocytes differentiated from preadipocytes (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). It has also been shown that <italic toggle="yes">Per3</italic>-KO mice have reduced <italic toggle="yes">Prdm16</italic> expression in whole eyes (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>), and the homozygous staggerer mutant mouse, which carries a deletion within the nuclear receptor ROR alpha gene, shows increased <italic toggle="yes">Prdm16</italic> expression in inguinal and epididymal adipose tissue (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). In our study, we did not observe any differences in <italic toggle="yes">Prdm16</italic> mRNA expression upon <italic toggle="yes">Bmal1</italic> or <italic toggle="yes">Npas2</italic> KD in cultured VSMCs. Additionally, PRDM16 has been shown to undergo posttranslational modifications (PTMs), including acetylation, polyubiquitination, and SUMOylation, which modulate its protein stability and functions (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). Notably, S-nitrosylation is an oxidative PTM that a nitric oxide (&#x02022;NO) group is reversibly added to cysteine residues (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). The production of endogenous &#x02022;NO by NOS varies according to the circadian rhythm (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). S-nitrosylation of proteins has been linked to the regulation of vascular tone and BP (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). Through computational tools such as GPS-SNO (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>) and iSNO-PseAAC (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>), it has been predicted that PRDM16 can undergo S-nitrosylation at the Cys587 residue (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>). Therefore, PRDM16 might regulate BP circadian variations through its NO-dependent S-nitrosylation, which needs further studies in the future.</p><p>In summary, our research elucidates a previously unknown mechanism by which PRDM16 in VSMCs regulates BP circadian variation. This finding has critical implications for understanding the pathogenesis of hypertension and related cardiovascular disorders. By linking PRDM16 to the regulation of clock genes and &#x003b1;-adrenergic receptor signaling, our study identifies a potential target for therapeutic interventions aimed at restoring normal BP circadian rhythms. Such treatments could be particularly beneficial for patients with hypertension, or sleep apnea and for those who work night shifts, all of whom commonly experience disrupted BP patterns. Furthermore, targeting PRDM16 might offer a new avenue for personalized medicine. The identification of PRDM16-linked single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with BP traits suggests that genetic screening could help identify individuals at higher risk for circadian BP disruptions and related cardiovascular events. Early intervention in these high-risk populations could improve clinical outcomes and reduce the burden of CVD. In conclusion, our study not only advances the understanding of BP regulation but also opens new pathways for translational research and clinical applications aimed at mitigating hypertension and its consequences.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Sex as a biological variable.</title><p>Our study examined male and female animals, and similar findings are reported for both sexes.</p></sec><sec><title>Animals.</title><p>Male VSMC-specific <italic toggle="yes">Prdm16</italic>-KO (<italic toggle="yes">Prdm16</italic><sup>SMKO</sup>) mice were obtained by crossbreeding <italic toggle="yes">Prdm16</italic><sup>lox/lox</sup> floxed mice (strain number 024992, The Jackson Laboratory) (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>) with <italic toggle="yes">Myh11</italic>-CreER<sup>T2</sup> mice (strain number 019079, The Jackson Laboratory) (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>), and female <italic toggle="yes">Prdm16</italic><sup>SMKO</sup> mice were generated by crossbreeding <italic toggle="yes">Prdm16</italic><sup>lox/lox</sup> mice with <italic toggle="yes">Itga8</italic>-CreER<sup>T2</sup> mice (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>).

The signals were captured and quantified using Image Studio, version 3.1 (Odyssey CLx).</p><p>To determine the phosphorylation levels of MLC, thoracic aorta was dissected and equilibrated in PSS for 20 minutes at 37&#x000b0;C. Thirty minutes after 3 consecutive KCl (60 mM in PSS) responses for wakeup, the thoracic aorta was treated with vehicle and PE (0.1 mM) for 3 minutes. The tissues were then snap-frozen in liquid N<sub>2</sub> and homogenized in RIPA buffer supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail 3 (catalog P0044, MilliporeSigma). Following sonication (Branson Sonifier SLPe, 15 seconds of 35% amplification, 3 times), the lysates were cleared by centrifugation for 2 minutes at 10,000<italic toggle="yes">g</italic> at 4&#x000b0;C. The protein concentrations of the supernatants were determined using Pierce BCA protein assay kits (catalog 23227, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Equal amounts of protein lysates were analyzed by Western blotting as described above. The following primary antibodies were used: anti&#x02013;phosphorylated MLC2 (Ser19) (1:1,000; catalog 3671, Cell Signaling Technology) and anti-MLC2 (1:1,000; catalog 3672, Cell Signaling Technology).</p></sec><sec><title>Luciferase assay.</title><p>The promoter region was amplified with PCR and subcloned into the pGL4.11[luc2P] vector (catalog E6661, Promega) using the In-Fusion HD Cloning Plus Kit (catalog 638910, TaKara Bio). All PCR products were validated by Sanger sequencing. The luciferase plasmids along with the PRDM16 expression vector or empty controls were then cotransfected into NIH/3T3 cells (catalog CRL-1658, American Type Culture Collection [ATCC]) using Lipofectamine 2000 (catalog 11668019, Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were harvested in passive lysis buffer, and luciferase activity was determined by dual luciferase assay (catalog E1910, Promega).

In brief, 2.3 mg/mL collagen (catalog A1048301, Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific) solution was prepared according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s protocols and was mixed with the cell suspension (3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> cells/mL) at a volume ratio of 4:1. The collagen-cell mixture was then seeded into a 24-well plate and incubated for 30 minutes at 37&#x000b0;C, followed by addition of 0.5 mL Opti-MEM I to the gel lattice. After 24 hours, the gel was released, and its size was measured and analyzed using ImageJ software (NIH).</p></sec><sec><title>RNA-Seq analysis.</title><p>RNA samples from the thoracic aorta of mice with a RNA integrity number (RIN) of greater than 7 were submitted to the Advanced Genomics Core of the University of Michigan for RNA-Seq, as we previously described (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>ChIP assay.</title><p>A ChIP assay was performed with the SimpleChIP Enzymatic Chromatin IP Kit (catalog 9003, Cell Signaling Technology), according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. Briefly, mouse fibroblasts were infected with lentivirus carrying PRDM16 or vector (as the control) for 48 hours and were selected with 2 &#x003bc;g/mL puromycin for 1 week. Cells were then incubated with 1% paraformaldehyde (catalog 158127, MilliporeSigma) for 10 minutes at room temperature to crosslink proteins with DNA, followed by neutralization with glycine for 5 minutes at room temperature. The nuclei were prepared and digested with Micrococcal Nuclease for 20 minutes at 37&#x000b0;C, followed by sonication (Branson Sonifier SLPe, 20 seconds of 35% amplification, 3 times). The purified sheared chromatin was immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag antibody (1 &#x003bc;g, catalog 14793, Cell Signaling Technology), anti-PRDM16 antibody (2 &#x003bc;g, catalog ab106410, Abcam), or an equal amount of normal IgG (catalog 2729, Cell Signaling Technology) overnight at 4&#x000b0;C with gentle rotation. The precipitated DNA was extensively washed with low-salt buffer and high-salt buffer, and the eluted protein-DNA complexes were reversed with proteinase K for 2 hours at 65&#x000b0;C. Purified DNA was used for qPCR analysis. ChIP-qPCR data are expressed as a percentage of the input, which was calculated using the following equation: [percentage input = 2% &#x000d7; 2<sup>[Ct(2% input sample] &#x02013; Ct[IP sample])</sup>].</p></sec><sec><title>ChIP-Seq.</title><p>Purified DNA as described above was subjected to ChIP-Seq as previously described (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>). The DNA library preparation and sequencing were performed by the Advanced Genomics Core of the University of Michigan. Briefly, the DNA library was prepared with the NEB Next Ultra II DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (New England Biolabs [NEB]) and sequenced on a NovaSeq 6000 platform (Illumina) to generate pair-end 101 bp reads. An average of 25 million paired reads was generated for each sample (IgG and anti-Flag groups). The reads were mapped to the mouse genome (NCBI GRCm38) with bowtie2. The peak calling was done with MACS2 (with the following settings: -f BAMPE &#x02013;g hs &#x02013;B --SPMR &#x02013;q 0.01). Peaks were aligned to the nearest transcription start site (TSS) with HOMER, version 4.11 (<ext-link xlink:href="http://homer.ucsd.edu/homer/" ext-link-type="uri">http://homer.ucsd.edu/homer/</ext-link>).
