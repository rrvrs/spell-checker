A growing body of research documents the benefits of contact with nature for children and families, such as improved mental health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], birth outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], obesity management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], socioemotional function and development, and physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In educational settings, teachers have suggested that school garden curriculums provide rich sensory experiences that support cognitive development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In the healthcare setting, clinical trials discuss how medical offices that promote nature contact, referred to as &#x0201c;park prescriptions,&#x0201d; impact patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. We see these diverse adaptations to school and health-care delivery as under a common approach we have defined as &#x0201c;ecology-focused.&#x0201d; Briefly, this term is defined as an approach which centers the cultural relevance of the human-nature interaction and the various interrelationships which it encompasses. Creative modalities to incorporate ecology-focused interventions into educational and healthcare settings continue to be of interest to clinicians.</p><p id="Par7">Group well-child care (GWCC) may allow for further refinement of ecology-focused interventions in the pediatric setting. GWCC, CenteringParenting&#x000ae; being one common model, brings together a small group of parents with similarly aged children for well-child visits with developmentally appropriate individual screenings, vaccination, and assessment by a clinician coordinated with facilitated group discussion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Emerging research, including a randomized trial of GWCC, has demonstrated its effectiveness in enhancing vaccination timeliness, appointment attendance, and overall satisfaction with care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Evidence suggests that children in lower-income families receive insufficient developmental and behavioral screenings and preventive services and that GWCC models may address these limitations, increase access to health services, and provide opportunities for social connection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The flexibility in the delivery of GWCC allows it to be tailored to unique populations and communities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Adaptations to GWCC have previously involved modifications to teach positive parenting, encourage home safety, and promote primary obesity prevention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">Ecology-focused clinicians are striving to integrate novel interventions into pediatric clinical practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. GWCC offers an innovative approach to preventive care that has the potential to incorporate diverse content. Concurrently, a seasoned cohort of parent-graduates of GWCC models and a passionate community of expert pediatric GWCC clinicians have been demonstrating the scalability of the model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. To date, the potential synergy between these models remains unexplored. This is the first study to investigate both clinician and parent perspectives on the acceptability and feasibility of integrating ecology-focused content into GWCC. These findings fill a critical gap in the literature by exploring diverse stakeholder perspectives and strategies to improve the integration of holistic care within GWCC settings.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p id="Par9">Interview questions were developed through formative pilot research engaging parent and clinician community partners of Vital Village Networks, a Boston-based community engagement network, in a series of scoping interviews. These interview guides were piloted with a parent-advisor who had experience with GWCC, as well as with clinicians familiar with GWCC (CB).</p><p id="Par10">Initial engagement revealed a broad range of topics that parent and clinician partners believed were at the intersection of nature and preventive pediatric care. Consequently, the scope of the discussion was defined by the term &#x0201c;ecology-focused.&#x0201d; This term was used to describe experiences/concepts where human-nature interaction and its interconnected relationships was perceived to be important to parents and pediatric clinicians due to social and cultural relevance.</p><p id="Par11">For clinician interviews, a literature review (methodologic details provided in Appendix <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">D</xref>) was conducted to more fully characterize the domains where ecology-focused material demonstrated relevance to pediatric anticipatory guidance as identified in the American Academy of Pediatrics Bright Futures guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Seven domains arose from this iterative process. The goal of the study was to seek out clinicians that as a group had expertise that encompassed these domains. The parent experience in GWCC adaptations was also of interest. Parents with experiences in GWCC are a unique population who may have additional expertise on clinical care redesign due to their firsthand participation in a unique care model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].

In this qualitative study, we aimed to explore perspectives of clinicians and parents on the integration of ecology-focused components into GWCC. Study recruitment and interviews took place between June 2022 and September 2023. Ecology-focused child clinicians were purposively sampled based on expertise at the intersection of nature and pediatrics and recruited via email. For parent participants, inclusion criteria required participation in GWCC with a previous child. GWCC parent-graduates were recruited through social media announcements that were co-designed by a parent and clinician champion (EL) who has experience with GWCC. Recruitment announcements were shared by a parent and clinical champion to internal Facebook groups with parents who have previously participated in GWCC in Maryland and Boston. Semi-structured interviews, conducted virtually using videoconferencing software, were administered by trained researchers (NH, ITS) and participants were provided with a $40 gift card upon completion.</p><p id="Par13">A total of 24 ecology-focused child clinicians were identified through an online search of publicly-facing academic profiles. Of the 24 clinicians invited, 9 were interviewed between September 2022 and July 2023. A total of 15 GWCC parent-graduates contacted the research team after seeing a social media post in their GWCC Facebook group. Of those who initially responded, nine were interviewed between June 2022 and September 2023. Interviews lasted approximately 33&#x02013;57 (average&#x02009;=&#x02009;45.2) minutes for parents and 35&#x02013;61 (average&#x02009;=&#x02009;50.6) minutes for clinicians.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Parent semi-structured interview protocol</title><p id="Par14">The semi-structured interview protocol for GWCC parent-graduates consisted of three parts: asking about (1) experiences with children and families in nature, (2) intersections between pediatric healthcare and nature, and (3) the feasibility and acceptability of incorporating ecology-focused themes into GWCC. Each section took approximately 20&#x000a0;min to complete.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Clinician semi-structured interview protocol</title><p id="Par15">Each semi-structured interview with an ecology-focused child clinician consisted of three distinct 20-minute sections. First, the interview protocol invited clinicians to select one of the following seven domains: Socio-Emotional Wellbeing; Built Environment and Environmental Toxins; Play and Learning; Nutrition and Diet; Microbes; Language and Reading; and Technology. Second, clinicians in the study were invited to discuss professional familiarity with GWCC practices and approaches. Finally, the interview evaluated feasibility and acceptability of integrating domain-specific activities into the framework of GWCC. This structured approach allowed for comprehensive exploration of both the clinicians&#x02019; expertise and their perspectives on the potential integration of ecology-focused activities into the GWCC model. [Interview guides for parents and clinicians are available in Appendix <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">E</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Analysis</title><p id="Par16">Two parallel coding and thematic analysis processes were used for the clinician and parent interviews. For both samples, interviews were recorded, transcribed, and uploaded to Dedoose software (version 9.0, SocioCultural Research Consultants, LLC, Los Angeles, CA) for analysis. Three investigators (ITS, NH, RBJ) collaborated to develop a unique and comprehensive code dictionary for each sample [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Each transcript was independently coded using an inductive thematic approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Following individual coding, investigators (ITS, NH, RBJ) reviewed coding outcomes and reconciled disparities to achieve consensus, thus facilitating identification of themes through iterative analysis. This process ensured a rigorous exploration of the data and the identification of nuanced themes. Following independent thematic analysis processes for clinician and parent interviews, consensus themes were categorized into overarching domains.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Results</title><p id="Par17">Three parent and four clinician themes were constructed from the iterative process. From these themes, four domains were synthesized across parent and clinician interviews. These four domains were: (1) appropriateness of ecology-focused interventions in the GWCC clinical setting, (2) educational supports desired by parents and clinicians to conduct and participate in group visits, (3) clinician commentary on perceptions and understanding of nature, and (4) parents&#x02019; desire for independence and exploration.

There was a perceived benefit to mental health and sense of wellbeing when taking a visit outdoors. There were many suggestions from parents and clinicians to &#x0201c;bring outside inside&#x0201d; with other developmentally appropriate activities that bring plants and other organic elements into the clinical space. Some clinicians suggested world building experiences with immersive language-centered or audiovisual activities. Some activities that were suggested have already been explored in a group medical visit setting and some were novel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. [Appendix <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">A</xref> includes documentation of GWCC-related activity suggestions from parents and clinicians.]</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par50">This study explored the integration of ecology-focused content into GWCC by examining the perspectives of parents and clinicians. Four primary domains emerged from the iterative process: the appropriateness of ecology-focused interventions in the GWCC clinical setting, the educational support desired by parents and clinicians, clinician commentary on perceptions and understanding of nature, and parents&#x02019; desire for independence and exploration. Our findings provide information on diverse perspectives regarding the acceptability, feasibility, and implementation strategies for ecology-focused GWCC adaptations.</p><p id="Par51">Both GWCC parent-graduates and ecology-focused child clinicians felt that ecology-focused GWCC activities may be feasible to incorporate in the clinical setting. Similar to past research, clinicians recognize that there are wide disparities in access to economic resources as well as natural environments that feel safe and accessible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Clinicians felt strongly about ensuring ecology-focused GWCC redesign centers equitable healthcare delivery, which also was found in past research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. While clinicians were worried about being inclusive to parents from diverse backgrounds in clinical care settings, GWCC parent-graduates already had frustrations about the status quo of individual WCC that they felt GWCC addressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Parent-graduates are supportive of WCC redesign and innovation as the status quo of WCC already brings many of its own challenges. The change in relationship between clinician and patient in group medical visits versus individual medical visits has been previously suggested as a significant mediator of outcomes in the perinatal and postnatal setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. There may be significant motivation from patients to better understand their clinicians&#x02019; opinions and perspectives on activities in their daily lives, be part of more low-stress environments, and feel more comfortable in the medical setting. An ecology focus may facilitate some of these changes and build on barrier-shifting that GWCC has already achieved.</p><p id="Par52">Both parents and clinicians are interested in different forms of educational support around how to go out and do more ecology-focused activities. Clinicians were interested in bringing educational resources to their curricular redesign with topic specialists as well as coordination with other education-focused community entities. The desire for specialized support alongside community coordination speaks to the potential of problem-based or affinity-based groups in GWCC just as research has shown in GPNC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Clinicians and parents in GWCC may benefit from being connected to teaching kitchens, environmental educators, community gardens and/or transportation safety professionals that aid in facilitating one problem-based GWCC visit inside a visit curriculum that addresses many topics over multiple longitudinal visits.</p><p id="Par53">Parents largely welcomed the idea of incorporating ecology-focused activities into GWCC, viewing it as a beneficial addition to clinical care. They expressed a need for more guidance on child safety and risk assessment when interacting with nature. Unintentional injury prevention counseling has been a staple of pediatric preventive care and has been standardized through the implementation of TIPP (The Injury Prevention Program), a program which was recently formally evaluated in a cluster-randomized trial and found to reduce parent-reported injuries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Surveys of pediatricians have revealed that 40% of children receive injury prevention counseling at a WCC. GWCC clinicians may want to consider how an ecology-focused GWCC approach can introduce environmental injury prevention counseling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>].</p><p id="Par54">Clinicians, while supportive of this curricular alteration, recommended a personalized approach to accommodate diverse family backgrounds and emphasized the importance of leveraging local resources to design activities. Desires from clinicians to tailor GWCC as a place-based intervention raises the question of how to envision such a heterogeneous intervention at a scale which would encourage others to consider an ecology-focused GWCC model in their own communities. The RECETAS project to study nature-based social prescribing in the EU and GROWBABY research network for CenteringParenting&#x000ae; demonstrate how practices in different locations can share research infrastructure, outcomes, and protocols that make their models easier to translate to other local contexts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>].</p><p id="Par55">Conceptualizations of nature can be different among clinicians and parents based on their cultural backgrounds. These differences in understanding of nature may influence clinician curricular design and family responsiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Previous research on conceptualizations of nature across languages, worldviews, and cultures has identified one way to categorize how nature is broadly understood by humans: (1) humans as part of nature, (2) humans as separate from nature, and (3) nature as experienced within a spiritual dimension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. This categorization may be a useful ontologic tool to understand different approaches clinicians may use when designing GWCC preventative counseling with ecology-focused curricula. Previous research has explored how perceptions, beliefs, and attitudes about topics as diverse as cigarette smoking, vaccination programs, and child health policy has shaped the counseling behaviors of pediatric clinicians [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. Differences in conceptualizations of nature among parents and clinicians may also influence counseling behaviors of clinicians by invoking the existential experience. The existential experience has been previously understood as a sensation of understanding life and mortality on a time course that goes beyond the individual experience [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. In the fields of palliative care, attending to the existential experience has been argued to be essential to providing whole-person care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. Bringing an ecology-focus into group well-child care may shift some well-child visit conversations from pragmatic, disease-focused, or guideline-directed towards a speculative, experiential, or philosophical direction. Clinicians may want to plan for facilitation in a way that creates space for the potential shared existential experience alongside the guideline-directed and practical advice focused activities and discussions.</p><sec id="Sec19"><title>Limitations and strengths</title><p id="Par56">Limitations of this study include the absence of clinician participants that had experience facilitating GWCC. Clinicians with such experience may offer a different perspective on the feasibility of ecology-focused adaptations to GWCC, considering competing priorities and resource constraints [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. Another limitation is that the opinions of GWCC parent-graduates were obtained via a convenience sample. Parents who are more systematically sampled, with GWCC experience or not, may provide a different perspective on ecology-focused adaptations in GWCC, particularly if they were imagining a first experience with GWCC with a new child. The convenience sampling strategy used to select both clinician and parent participants may have led to selecting highly motivated candidates and more effort may be required to search for more generalizable perspectives on an ecology-focused approach. Among the strengths of this study is that this is the first study to provide comparative perspectives of clinicians and parents with experience in GWCC on GWCC redesign. Our qualitative approach allows the paper to engage in a nuanced discussion about integrating this ecology-focused approach in GWCC, highlighting diverse perspectives from parents and clinicians on topics pertinent to pediatric anticipatory guidance including physical activity, diet &#x00026; nutrition, and the home environment.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par57">Overall, the study underscores the potential for ecology-focused GWCC to enhance pediatric anticipatory guidance by fostering connections between nature and child health. Parents and clinicians endorsed the importance of this approach, expressed unique preferences for participating in this model, and suggested a variety of feasible activities that may be appropriately replicated in the GWCC setting. Future research can incorporate the practical suggestions by parents and clinicians for reasonable ecology-focused GWCC activities into a structured curriculum that can be assessed in a pilot implementation trial that measures developmental outcomes and parent self-efficacy, social support, and emotional wellbeing. More importantly ecology-focused GWCC redesign can account for parent and clinician preferences including strong desires for integration of local resources, interest in risk-based counseling for &#x0201c;nature exposures,&#x0201d; and diverse relationships parents and clinicians may have with the perceived natural world. Complex parent and clinician preferences can be more deeply outlined in larger, more systematic qualitative studies that tailor curricular implementation to community needs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.</p><p>
