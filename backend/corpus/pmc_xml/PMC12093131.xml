AI includes fields such as machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and data science (DS), and aims to replicate human cognitive functions like problem-solving, perception, and language understanding [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. While AI provides significant breakthroughs, it also presents ethical challenges, particularly in the field of dentistry, where decisions can significantly impact patient care [<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>AI technology has revolutionized medical practice by providing support in complex case decision-making processes and other areas [<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The first FDA-approved AI-based medical imaging application was introduced in 2017, with the first AI system for detecting diabetic retinopathy being approved in 2018 - without requiring any human assistance or interpretation [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>-<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Healthcare professionals are increasingly relying on AI to provide accurate diagnoses, eliminate examiner variability, and minimize subjectivity. AI also has the potential to improve the effectiveness of care and reduce costs by eliminating certain routine examinations and tests [<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], as well as by better analyzing X-ray images for more precise responses and diagnoses [<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In this study, we will explore the various applications of AI in the field of dentistry.</p><p>AI has a significant and diverse impact on medicine and dentistry [<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In medical imaging, AI algorithms enhance the accuracy of diagnoses from X-rays, MRIs, and CT scans, enabling early detection of conditions like cancer and cardiovascular diseases [<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>-<xref rid="REF14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In dentistry, AI helps identify dental caries and periodontal diseases, leading to better patient outcomes [<xref rid="REF15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. AI also plays a vital role in treatment planning, where it can create personalized plans based on a patient's genetic profile and analyze biological data to predict drug efficacy in the development of new drugs [<xref rid="REF16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Moreover, AI is useful in patient education and engagement, where chatbots and virtual assistants can provide information and support to improve the healthcare experience [<xref rid="REF17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>The integration of AI in healthcare presents significant ethical challenges. Concerns regarding data privacy, informed consent, and potential biases in AI algorithms must be addressed [<xref rid="REF18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>-<xref rid="REF20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Moreover, utilizing AI for diagnostic and treatment decisions adds complexity to the ethical landscape, casting doubt on professional judgment, autonomy, and the importance of the human touch in patient care [<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="REF21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. This study aims to explore the potential uses of AI in the field of dentistry, including its benefits and the ethical dilemmas that may arise. Through careful analysis of various clinical cases, the responses of AI systems, and the perspectives of dental professionals, we seek to gain a deeper understanding of how AI can support decision-making in dental practice - while also accounting for the ethical considerations involved.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Study setting and design</p><p>This is a cross-sectional study that utilized a web-based survey to explore the perceptions of dental professionals on ethical challenges associated with the use of AI in dentistry. Dentists' perspectives were then compared to responses generated with ChatGPT-4.0 (OpenAI, San Francisco, CA, USA), a state-of-the-art large language model (LLM), to evaluate its potential to guide dentists through ethical dilemmas. The study was approved by the Department of Medical Ethics at the Faculty of Medicine, Universit&#x000e9; Paris-Saclay.</p><p>Data collection</p><p>Data was collected between June and August 2023. A total of around 122 survey invitations were sent via email to a pool of dentists. Those who agreed to partake in the study were asked to click the web-based survey link, which prompted them to complete an electronic informed consent form before filling out the questionnaire. The survey was administered using the LimeSurvey platform on a dedicated server, thereby ensuring a secure and confidential environment for participants. Data was collected using various sources: social media, instant messaging groups, personalized emails, and direct contacts, to reach a broad spectrum of dental professionals. The survey was made available in English to accommodate a wider audience. Participants were assured of the confidentiality and anonymity of their responses to encourage candid answers. They were also informed that only aggregate data would be shared and disseminated.</p><p>As for the LLM, ChatGPT-4.0 used at the time was trained only up to 2021, as indicated by OpenAI. Therefore, all prompts containing information published on the web were selected exclusively from after 2022 to avoid training bias.</p><p>Measurements</p><p>The survey was comprised of three primary parts: demographics, ethical scenarios, and inquiries about AI's role in dentistry. The survey was designed to be completed within 15 minutes. The demographic inquiries encompassed age, gender, country of practice, education level, and the type of practice setting, whether private or public. Regarding knowledge of ethics in the dental office, participants were asked about common ethical practices, including whether written consent was mandatory for each patient, whether patients had the right to decide who could be informed of their medical condition, whether dentists were obligated to emphasize ethical concerns when discussing confidential information with their team members, and whether confidential patient information could be stored on personal devices. Additionally, practice attitude toward patients was evaluated, as participants were presented with a series of scenarios and asked to indicate whether they agreed or disagreed with them.</p><p>The questionnaires were constructed by a panel of four experts in the fields of dentistry, data science, and medical ethics. Questionnaire items were inspired by existing literature and expertise; some items were directly reproduced, with modifications, from existing literature, such as Razavi et al. (2023) and Alkhalifah et al. (2022) [<xref rid="REF22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="REF23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>Knowledge and attitude indices</p><p>As previously stated, dentists' knowledge of medical and dental ethics was evaluated using a set of five questions. To analyze knowledge in a unidimensional approach, the responses were scored as 0 for incorrect answers and 1 for correct answers, with a maximum possible score of 5 and a minimum of 0. Additionally, the attitude scale, consisting of 18 questions, was used to measure ethical attitudes. Responses were rated on a scale of 1 to 4, with 4 indicating the best ethical attitude and 1 indicating the most negative attitude. The maximum score achievable on this scale was 72. The scale used is similar to the Likert scale and provides a more useful measurement of perceptions, attitudes, and opinions than a simple binary answer.</p><p>Data analysis</p><p>Data were analyzed using the R Statistical Framework 2023.03.0/RStudio 1.4.17 software (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). Continuous variables were presented as mean and standard deviation, while categorical variables were represented by their frequency and percentage. A t-test was used to compare average knowledge and attitude scores.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Out of the 122 invitations sent, 88 responses were recorded.

Only 28 (52%) respondents felt well-acquainted with dental AI, with a mere eight (16%) participants incorporating AI into their daily operations. Interestingly, four (6%) were uncertain about using AI-based software in their practices. The majority (n = 38, or 71%) of participants believed that the main advantage of AI is the automation of routine tasks to save time. Additionally, 31 (59%) recognized AI's potential to enhance diagnostic precision and effectiveness, while 29 (54%) saw its value in improving treatment and care planning. Notably, 18 (34%) participants believed that AI grants access to a broader range of dental skills.</p><p>Only 33 (62%) participants expressed concern over the potential biases and impacts of AI algorithms on care outcomes, with 7 (13%) unconcerned and 13 (25%) undecided. Furthermore, 31 (58%) of dentists felt ill-equipped to tackle the ethical challenges AI introduces to dentistry; nevertheless, 46 (86%) showed interest in training programs on its ethical application. About 25 (48%) practitioners believed AI would influence the dentist-patient relationship; 64% foresaw both positive and negative effects, 13 (24%) predicted solely negative consequences, and six (12%) anticipated exclusively positive outcomes.</p><p>A fraction of 12 (22%) of practitioners consider AI a useful tool for ethical decision-making, providing objective, data-driven insights. However, 21 (39%) doubted AI's utility in such sensitive matters, attributing this skepticism to the nuanced, emotional, and contextual aspects of ethical issues that AI might not fully grasp, and 22 (41%) reported being unsure of AI's role in ethical decision-making. Regarding liability for medical errors involving AI, there is a consensus among dentists that the ultimate responsibility should not lie with AI software, with only three (6%) attributing blame to AI.</p><p>Analysis of the knowledge index revealed that ChatGPT-4 achieved a score of 5, which demonstrates a robust understanding of ethical guidelines and decision-making frameworks in dentistry (Table <xref rid="TAB4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). This score was significantly higher than the average score of 3.9 achieved by human participants, indicating that the AI has a strong understanding of the technical and ethical knowledge necessary for practice (Figure <xref rid="FIG1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

This research has highlighted the intricacy of incorporating AI into dental practice, emphasizing the significance of a well-balanced approach that neither dismisses AI altogether nor overestimates its abilities. Our findings revealed that there is a consensus on the crucial role of human oversight in AI-assisted decision-making. This reflects a wider concern about the possibility of AI operating independently, without taking into account the essential clinical expertise of dentists.</p><p>Although AI has the potential to improve diagnoses and treatment planning, dentists prefer its use as a supplementary tool rather than a substitute for human judgment. This preference highlights the invaluable worth of professional expertise and the nuanced understanding of patient care that AI is currently unable to replicate [<xref rid="REF24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Our findings also shed light on a crucial element of medical practice: informed consent. The AI&#x02019;s adherence to the ethical and medical guidelines of informed consent underscores the importance of engaging patients in their care choices. This adherence not only upholds ethical norms but also cultivates a relationship of trust between dentists and patients, ensuring that care decisions are made with the patient&#x02019;s informed consent.</p><p>Another important ethical consideration that we can infer from this study is the safeguarding of patient information. The unanimous agreement between AI-generated responses and dental experts on the importance of maintaining medical confidentiality highlights the ethical duty to uphold patient privacy. This responsibility is particularly crucial, given the delicate nature of health-related data and the possible consequences of its unauthorized exposure [<xref rid="REF23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Medical confidentiality is considered a central tenet of the healthcare system, as it plays a vital role in protecting the privacy and autonomy of patients [<xref rid="REF25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Information pertaining to an individual's health is highly personal and must be treated with the utmost care and confidentiality, except in situations where the law permits or mandates the disclosure of medical information [<xref rid="REF25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The principle of medical confidentiality is not only a legal obligation but also an ethical one, reflecting the importance of respecting the privacy, autonomy, and dignity of patients [<xref rid="REF25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>To uphold the principle of medical confidentiality, healthcare providers are expected to maintain a high level of professionalism and discretion in handling patients' medical information [<xref rid="REF26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="REF27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. This includes ensuring that confidential information is only disclosed on a need-to-know basis to authorized individuals, such as other healthcare providers involved in the patient's care [<xref rid="REF25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Healthcare providers are also obligated to take adequate measures to safeguard patients' medical information against unauthorized access, theft, or misuse [<xref rid="REF25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Failure to comply with the principle of medical confidentiality can result in serious legal and ethical repercussions, including litigation, disciplinary action, and loss of professional reputation [<xref rid="REF25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Furthermore, it can have a detrimental impact on the trust and confidence of patients in the healthcare system, which is critical for the effective delivery of healthcare services [<xref rid="REF28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. As such, healthcare providers must remain vigilant in upholding the principle of medical confidentiality, while also balancing the competing interests of patient privacy and public safety.</p><p>Our findings revealed a unanimous agreement that patients have the right to be fully informed about their diagnoses and treatment options, highlighting the ethical responsibility of transparency in dental practice [<xref rid="REF29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The Code of Ethics laid down by the American Dental Association underscores the significance of patient autonomy and informed consent, which aligns with our investigation, highlighting the necessity of transparency and honesty in patient communication [<xref rid="REF30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p>Additionally, the ethical concerns surrounding financial incentives in patient referrals necessitate a re-evaluation of practices that could potentially compromise the objectivity of clinical decision-making. It is imperative to underscore that the practice of offering a commission or a percentage of the fees to a dentist in exchange for referring patients to a radiology center is fraught with ethical concerns and can pose significant problems [<xref rid="REF31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. While this approach may have potential drawbacks, there are valid concerns regarding the dentist's impartiality in directing patients to radiology centers [<xref rid="REF31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. There is a risk that personal financial gain may sway the dentist's decision-making, rather than prioritizing the patient&#x02019;s actual needs [<xref rid="REF31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="REF32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Additionally, there may be a temptation to over-prescribe radiological tests to increase profits from the radiology center [<xref rid="REF31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="REF32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Such behavior could be seen as a violation of ethical standards in the dental profession, which prioritize the patient&#x02019;s best interests and require the dentist to provide optimal care without being influenced by financial motives [<xref rid="REF31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="REF32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. It is of utmost importance that medical decisions, such as guiding patients toward radiology services, are grounded in sound clinical practices, medical ethics, and the patient&#x02019;s best interests [<xref rid="REF31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="REF32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Should a radiology center appoint a dentist to establish a comparable practice, AI can serve as an impartial source of information, offering unbiased guidance to promote the highest quality and most ethical medical practices.</p><p>Moreover, our findings regarding the use of antibiotics and X-rays further highlight the ethical complexities of integrating AI into dental practice. These findings serve as a reminder of the importance of prioritizing medical necessity and ethical considerations when making clinical decisions, rather than simply adhering to routine practice or succumbing to patient demands [<xref rid="REF33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. It is crucial to understand that the prescription of antibiotics for oral health purposes must be based on a thorough assessment of the patient&#x02019;s medical background and relevant considerations [<xref rid="REF33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Antibiotics are not routinely prescribed after every dental cleaning and polishing, as this can contribute to antibiotic overuse, leading to antibiotic resistance and other health complications. If a patient has specific concerns or requests regarding antibiotics or any other medication, it is essential to have an open discussion with their dentist. The dentist will consider the patient&#x02019;s medical history, oral health, and other relevant factors before deciding to prescribe antibiotics. Dentists are healthcare professionals who follow established protocols and best practices to ensure patient safety and treatment effectiveness [<xref rid="REF34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Responsible medical decision-making is crucial for optimal dental care and long-term patient health [<xref rid="REF35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Therefore, it is important to note that medication should not be prescribed to a patient unless their medical situation requires it, and the decision should be made by a qualified medical professional. Moreover, it is imperative to inform the patient of the reasons behind any additional X-rays and to secure their informed consent before proceeding with the examination [<xref rid="REF36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. While multiple X-rays may be necessary to document a case accurately, it is crucial to approach this in a responsible and medically justified manner, taking into account the patient&#x02019;s ethical and safety concerns [<xref rid="REF37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Effective communication and collaboration between the dentist and the patient are critical in making informed decisions about the use of X-rays [<xref rid="REF36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p><p>Our research supports and expands upon existing literature regarding the integration of AI in healthcare. Our findings concur with existing literature that views AI as a tool for automating routine tasks, improving diagnostic and treatment outcomes, and accessing a broader range of dental skills [<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="REF37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. However, these studies also share our concerns regarding the ethical implications of AI, including issues of responsibility, data privacy, bias, and the impact on the dentist-patient relationship. Another study by Smith et al. (2024) on the use of AI in medical diagnostics found that healthcare professionals hold a cautious optimism regarding AI, stressing the need for it to complement, rather than replace, human expertise [<xref rid="REF37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Our study concurs with these findings and indicates that dentists perceive AI as a supportive tool and recognize the importance of professional judgment in clinical decision-making. Additionally, our findings concur with those of Patel et al. (2022), which identified ethical concerns surrounding patient privacy and data security regarding the use of AI [<xref rid="REF38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. We also emphasize the significance of informed consent and transparency in dental practice, which is in line with Zhang et al.'s (2021) argument that patient autonomy and participation are critical in the age of AI [<xref rid="REF39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. However, our study offers unique insights into the specific challenges and opportunities presented by AI in dentistry, highlighting the nuanced understanding of patient care and the ethical implications of technology adoption [<xref rid="REF40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Comparing our findings to those of other healthcare disciplines, it is evident that while ethical challenges are common, the context of dental practice provides a distinct perspective on how to navigate these challenges for the benefit of patient care.</p><p>The tension between adhering to a strict schedule and responding to acute patient needs, even at the expense of disrupting scheduled appointments, highlights the importance of professional ethics and patient care [<xref rid="REF41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Clear communication and transparency with all patients involved are essential in such situations, as they demand a delicate balance, guided by the dentist's ethical duty to alleviate suffering and the practical considerations of clinic management [<xref rid="REF41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].</p><p>Our survey revealed another ethical issue related to the nondisclosure of endodontic instrument breakage during treatment, with a small fraction of dentists believing in withholding such information from patients. This practice raises significant ethical concerns, as the principle of informed consent and the obligation to disclose any complications during treatment are foundational to medical ethics and patient trust [<xref rid="REF42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The majority stance, supported by AI, advocates for transparency and honesty, reinforcing the ethical imperative to inform patients about all aspects of their care, including potential complications.</p><p>Additionally, the survey highlights the importance of ethical considerations surrounding patient requests for unnecessary or unsuitable treatments. The overwhelming consensus among dentists and AI, against acquiescing to patient demands that contravene scientific principles, underscores the importance of professional judgment and ethical responsibility in dental practice [<xref rid="REF43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. This finding highlights the importance of dentists acting in the best interest of their patients, guided by evidence-based practice and ethical standards, rather than yielding to patient requests that may not be in their best health interest [<xref rid="REF43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].</p><p>One issue that arose during the survey was professional integrity and how to handle perceived substandard care by colleagues. It seems that many dentists are hesitant to directly confront or report questionable decisions made by their peers. This is likely due to a complex interplay of professional solidarity, patient trust, and ethical accountability. Dentists often prefer indirect communication strategies when discussing treatment options with colleagues, in order to maintain professional relationships while still prioritizing patient care [<xref rid="REF43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].</p><p>Additionally, the survey also revealed that dentists have concerns about the role of AI in ethical decision-making and clinical practice. While there is interest in the potential of AI to support clinical decisions, there is also significant skepticism about its ability to navigate the complex ethical landscapes of dental practice [<xref rid="REF43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. As a result, many dentists are cautious about integrating AI recommendations into their practice, and emphasize the irreplaceable value of human judgment and the ethical complexities inherent in dental care.</p><p>This disparity between the knowledge and attitude index scores provides valuable insights into the role of AI in dentistry. While ChatGPT-4's perfect score on the knowledge index underscores its potential as a powerful tool for navigating complex ethical guidelines, its lower score on the attitude index, compared to human dentists, emphasizes a significant limitation: the inability of AI to fully replicate the empathetic and nuanced ethical reasoning that is essential in patient care. These findings suggest that although AI can enhance the technical aspects of dental practice, the human element remains irreplaceable. Human dentists not only apply ethical knowledge but also interpret and adjust it according to the emotional and moral contexts of each patient interaction. Therefore, it is crucial that AI is used as an adjunct tool that supports, but does not replace, the dentist&#x02019;s judgment, ensuring that patient care is both technically sound and compassionately delivered [<xref rid="REF44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>].</p><p>Strengths and limitations</p><p>The strengths of our study are depicted in several aspects. First, to our knowledge, this study is among the very few that compare medical ethics knowledge and attitudes between a commercial, widespread AI model and human experts. Since AI is being integrated more and more in medicine and dentistry, such studies are warranted to better understand the use and limitations of this integration. Second, a crucial point in AI-related clinical studies that deserves highlighting is the training bias of the AI model. The model performs better when facing data already included in its training. Hence, in our study, we made sure the literature used to develop the questionnaire was more recent than the date of ChatGPT 4.0's initial training. Therefore, ChatGPT 4.0 was blind to the specific questions that were adapted from existing literature.</p><p>Our study should be considered in light of its limitations. Our study focused on the integration and impact of AI in dental practice. While our sample included practitioners from diverse backgrounds with varying levels of experience and practice locations, we observed a notable geographic concentration, with over 60% of respondents practicing in Lebanon, where the adoption of AI in dental clinics may not be as advanced as in other regions, such as Europe or the United States. This geographical skew limits the generalizability of our findings, as responses from practitioners in countries with more widespread use of AI could have provided additional insights into its integration and impact on dental practice. Moreover, our study did not include interviews with dental students, both those in specialized programs and those yet to obtain their dental degrees, which represents a missed opportunity to explore students' concerns and expectations regarding AI's place in their field and education. Engaging with this demographic could have enriched our understanding of AI's role and perception within the academic sphere, offering a forward-looking perspective on how AI is shaping the future of dental education and practice. Lastly, we did not survey patients, a significant limitation, considering their central role in the dental care ecosystem. Patient feedback on their experiences with AI in dental settings and its perceived impact on the dentist-patient relationship would have added valuable dimensions to our findings. Understanding patient perspectives could have provided a more holistic view of AI's integration into dental care and its implications for patient satisfaction and trust.</p><p>Future recommendations&#x000a0;</p><p>Given the high knowledge of AI models, areas like empathy and a positive attitude in practice need further scrutiny. Future studies may delve deeper into studying the necessary ethical guidelines for the integration of AI in clinical practice, as well as establishing frameworks for the cooperation of human-AI experts. Ultimately, the aim is to improve the patient experience with positive outcomes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study underscores the nuanced interplay between AI and the field of dentistry, revealing both the promising potential and the ethical complexities of integrating AI into dental practice.
