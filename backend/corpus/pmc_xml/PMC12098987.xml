The dataset presented here encompasses signals from two domains. Ambient environment signals and physiological responses are captured to provide context for well-being assessment. Cardiac activity and electrodermal activity were selected as health indicators, while indoor ambient conditions were characterized by parameters such as temperature, humidity, light, sound, pressure and air quality as determined by Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) and Particulate Matter (PM). Data collection involved 14 participants, with each participant contributing approximately 48 minutes of data. This process resulted in a total of over 600 minutes of data, recorded under varied indoor ambient conditions. This dataset was utilized for classifying ambient environment risks concerning long-term cardiac health and for estimating physiological responses exclusively from ambient environment parameters. The compiled dataset provides opportunities for examining the connections between indoor climates and individuals&#x02019; well-being states in diverse environments, thereby enabling additional investigations and applications in the domain of context-aware technology.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Scientific data</kwd><kwd>Occupational health</kwd><kwd>Technology</kwd><kwd>Predictive markers</kwd><kwd>Lifestyle modification</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer Nature Limited 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background &#x00026; Summary</title><p id="Par2">The well-being and health of individuals can be significantly influenced by environmental conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. According to the World Health Organization, nearly one in every four deaths can be linked to adverse environmental factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. The conventional approach to acquiring physiological responses, also noted as physiological health indicators, has been tethered to physical connections, providing limited insights into the factors influencing these indicators and posing user comfort and compliance issues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Our study addresses the challenge of monitoring health indicators without the need for direct physical connections to medical devices or wearable sensors, as well as, the challenge to determine with precision how the indoor ambient environment affects one&#x02019;s health and well-being. In recent studies, physiological responses have served as predictive variables for various health related applications such as assessing cognitive load<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, stress detection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, thermal comfort estimation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, emotion classification based on cardiac and electrodermal signals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> or fatigue detection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Despite their application in predicting these outcomes, there is a notable absence of substantial research focused on predicting the physiological indicators themselves. This gap hinders efforts to identify the root causes of health conditions, restraining the transition towards a proactive or preemptive approach to health and well-being.</p><p id="Par3">Datasets have been developed to explore the relationship between emotion classification and physiological signals. One such dataset captures features like skin temperature, electrocardiography, electrodermal activity, impedance signals, blood pressure, cardiac output, and total peripheral resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Another study expands on this by collecting electrocardiography, electrodermal activity, respiration, electromyography, and motion data, correlating these physiological parameters with emotions such as calmness, tiredness, tension, excitement, and arousal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Furthermore, physiological parameters including activity, heart rate, respiratory rate, and others have been collected and analyzed to facilitate remote healthcare monitoring for dementia patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Another dataset provides continuous biometric data such as electrodermal activity, heart rate, and skin temperature, alongside contextual information about stress events<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Recent research efforts have been directed towards exploring the relationship between PM10 levels and diverse environmental parameters, encompassing temperature, wind speed, humidity, and aerosol optical depth. These investigations also aim to quantify the potential health benefits associated with mitigating air pollution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Furthermore, analyses of temperature datasets in conjunction with mortality rate data have yielded insights into the correlation between extreme temperatures and mortality rates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>.

It includes measurements such as ambient light intensity, sound levels, atmospheric moisture, temperature, and barometric pressure. The dataset<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> also incorporates metrics for indoor air quality, assessing factors like pollutants and ventilation. Airborne particle counts of varying sizes contribute to air quality evaluation. Additionally, physiological variables such as skin resistance, reflecting stress or arousal levels, and heart rate, a vital indicator of cardiovascular health and stress, further enrich the dataset. We termed our dataset<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> &#x02018;Health-spa&#x02019;, an acronym representing the signals it includes: Heart, Electrodermal Activity, Light, Temperature, Humidity, Sound, Pressure, and Air Quality. The name also implies its intended use in the context of well-being and wellness, rather than clinical healthcare. A pilot study to determine the feasibility of using indoor ambient conditions to estimate physiological health indicators<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> was performed on data collected from the principal investigator. Three ML algorithms were trained with 5-fold cross-validation and the results obtained indicated that ambient conditions alone can be utilized to accurately estimate health indicators, as long as the constrains set during data collection are respected.</p><p id="Par5">The value of our dataset<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> stems from the simultaneous and continuous recording of ambient environment factors and physiological health indicators. One can explore various intelligent analysis objectives, such as regression, classification, or clustering, applied to either joint or individual heart rate and skin resistance data. The raw ECG signal, collected at a sampling frequency of 128Hz, can be processed to extract various features including R-peaks, Q and S waves, the onset and offset points of QRS complex, P and T waves and their onset and offset points<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Additionally, more metrics can be derived from ECG signal features, including heart rate variability, fragmented QRS complex, early repolarization, ventricular late potential, index of cardio-electrophysiological balance, heart rate turbulence or T wave alternans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Given the amplitude of the ambient environment factors collected, individual features, subsets of specific features or the entire set of features can be considered as independent or predictor variables.</p><p id="Par6">In summary, our study pioneers a novel methodology for estimating health indicators from indoor ambient data, presenting a paradigm shift towards context-aware monitoring. The implications of this dataset<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> extend beyond mere observation, by uncovering the intricate links between environmental conditions and physiological responses, we can begin to develop proactive interventions that optimize indoor environments for improved health and well-being. Personalized recommendations for adjusting lighting, temperature or ventilation based on an individual&#x02019;s real-time physiological responses become attainable. This proactive approach has the potential to mitigate stress, improve cognitive function, and even prevent adverse health outcomes associated with poor indoor environment conditions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par7">This section contains details regarding the procedures employed in acquiring and processing the physiological and ambient environment data collected within our extreme environments chamber. The experiment design, sensor based data acquisition and subsequent computational processing steps are described to ensure the transparency and repeatability of our research.

All participants were given an information sheet and a consent form outlining the study&#x02019;s goals, methods, data collection process, and commitment to participant privacy and secure data storage. All participants provided written informed consent for their involvement in the study and the subsequent publication of anonymized data derived from this research.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Participants</title><p id="Par9">The study included a cohort of 14 participants, selected to represent diverse demographic characteristics within the constraints of its privacy-preserving design. As shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, participants spanned multiple age groups and both male and female participants were included. The lack of participants outside the presented age groups and an unbalanced gender representation arose unintentionally due to recruitment biases toward accessible populations. While these demographic gaps may limit analyses of individual differences linked to age or sex, the dataset provides a standardized framework for investigating environmental interactions under controlled yet ecologically valid conditions. Additionally, the cohort comprised individuals from distinct ethnic backgrounds. It is pertinent to note that while these demographic details are pivotal for contextualizing the diversity within our participant pool, it is emphasized that such identifying metadata has not been recorded in the dataset<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, safeguarding participant anonymity and adhering to ethical research practices.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Participant cohort demographic variance.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41597_2025_5051_Fig1_HTML" id="d33e410"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Scenarios</title><p id="Par10">Participants were seated at a workstation in the centre of the extreme environments room and were instructed to limit their speech and movements for the duration of the recording, in order to avoid artefacts that would undermine the correlation between ambient environment signals and physiological health indicators. The workstation featured a single board computer connected to an array of sensors for humidity, temperature, pressure, air quality, light, and skin resistance measurements, a mobile device with an application for sound level recording, an embedded board for ECG acquisition, a speaker for noise level adjustment, a laptop and peripheral devices for the single board computer.</p><p id="Par11">Sixteen measurement scenarios were designed, as detailed in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, based on 4 controlled variables. These scenarios represent all unique combinations of values for the chosen controlled variables, calculated using the rule of product. This full factorial design (2<sup>4</sup> = 16 scenarios) ensures systematic testing of all possible interactions between environmental factors, critical for hypothesis generation and avoiding oversight of potentially relevant correlations. While a fractional factorial design could have improved efficiency, it would sacrifice higher-order interactions&#x02013;a trade-off incompatible with our exploratory focus on ambient environmental effects. The controlled variables selected were temperature, humidity, light and sound. We did not exert any control on pressure and air quality since the extreme environments chamber was not equipped with the technology necessary, however variations in these signals appeared naturally as a consequence of temperature and humidity adjustments.<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Data collection scenarios.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left">Artificial Lightening</th><th align="left">Noise</th><th align="left">Humidity</th><th align="left">Temperature</th><th align="left">Time</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>off</td><td>45 dBA</td><td>40%</td><td>25&#x000b0;C</td><td>180 seconds</td></tr><tr><td>off</td><td>45 dBA</td><td>40%</td><td>35&#x000b0;C</td><td>180 seconds</td></tr><tr><td>off</td><td>45 dBA</td><td>65%</td><td>25&#x000b0;C</td><td>180 seconds</td></tr><tr><td>off</td><td>45 dBA</td><td>65%</td><td>35&#x000b0;C</td><td>180 seconds</td></tr><tr><td>off</td><td>85 dBA</td><td>40%</td><td>25&#x000b0;C</td><td>180 seconds</td></tr><tr><td>off</td><td>85 dBA</td><td>40%</td><td>35&#x000b0;C</td><td>180 seconds</td></tr><tr><td>off</td><td>85 dBA</td><td>65%</td><td>25&#x000b0;C</td><td>180 seconds</td></tr><tr><td>off</td><td>85 dBA</td><td>65%</td><td>35&#x000b0;C</td><td>180 seconds</td></tr><tr><td>on</td><td>45 dBA</td><td>40%</td><td>25&#x000b0;C</td><td>180 seconds</td></tr><tr><td>on</td><td>45 dBA</td><td>40%</td><td>35&#x000b0;C</td><td>180 seconds</td></tr><tr><td>on</td><td>45 dBA</td><td>65%</td><td>25&#x000b0;C</td><td>180 seconds</td></tr><tr><td>on</td><td>45 dBA</td><td>65%</td><td>35&#x000b0;C</td><td>180 seconds</td></tr><tr><td>on</td><td>85 dBA</td><td>40%</td><td>25&#x000b0;C</td><td>180 seconds</td></tr><tr><td>on</td><td>85 dBA</td><td>40%</td><td>35&#x000b0;C</td><td>180 seconds</td></tr><tr><td>on</td><td>85 dBA</td><td>65%</td><td>25&#x000b0;C</td><td>180 seconds</td></tr><tr><td>on</td><td>85 dBA</td><td>65%</td><td>35&#x000b0;C</td><td>180 seconds</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p id="Par12">Each scenario lasted for approximately 3 minutes summing to a total 48 minutes of active participation in the experiment required from each participant, excluding the time needed to adjust the environmental conditions within the extreme environments chamber. The time taken to adjust temperature and humidity from one scenario to another was between 15 and 25 minutes depending on the direction of the adjustment, increment or decrement. These gradual transitions replicate real-world environmental dynamics and the response of ventilation systems. In contrast, noise and light were adjusted instantly using a speaker and artificial lighting, simulating abrupt natural changes such as entering a brightly lit room or encountering sudden loud noise.</p><p id="Par13">The sequence of scenario execution was determined by the duration required to stabilize the controlled variables. Given the relatively prolonged adjustment periods for humidity and temperature, we devised four subsets of measurements. Each subset maintained consistent temperature and humidity levels while introducing variations in sound and light parameters. Consequently, participants were tasked with adhering to the experimental protocols continuously for a duration of 12 minutes, constituting one subset of scenarios. Subsequently, they were allotted a relaxation period lasting between 15 to 25 minutes to facilitate adjustments in temperature or humidity levels.</p><p id="Par14">The specific values for the controlled variables were determined following recognized standards and guidelines. For instance, temperature values adhered to the moderate and high recommendations from ISO 7730 standard as identified by<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, while humidity range aligned with values used in previous studies with comparable temperatures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Noise levels were set in accordance with both UK regulations for workplace noise control<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> and World Health Organization guidance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Light intensity values were determined during measurements, reflecting ambient lighting conditions in the absence and presence of artificial lighting.</p><p id="Par15">While some residual coupling effects between consecutive scenarios may occur due to the ordering, explicitly documenting the sequence and stabilization intervals allows potential users to consider these dependencies in their analyses, ensuring a robust interpretation that aligns with the study&#x02019;s real-world-inspired constraints. Our study design aimed to mitigate variability in physiological responses through controlled environmental conditions and a consistent experimental protocol for all participants. This approach helps standardize the context in which physiological signals were recorded and ensures comparability across participants. However, no dedicated effort test or baseline measurement was performed prior to data collection. Depending on the intended application, researchers could perform baseline corrections, normalization techniques, or other post-processing methods to address individual differences. While the controlled conditions and standardized protocol ensure a high degree of consistency in the recorded signals, future studies could benefit from incorporating baseline measurements to further extend the dataset&#x02019;s applicability.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Equipment and Facility</title><p id="Par16">The experimental apparatus employed for data collection includes a state-of-the-art extreme environments chamber designed for the precise manipulation of environmental conditions.

In the heart rate estimation model, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9b</xref>, pressure, temperature and light emerged as the top three dominant factors, indicating that variations in these parameters have a measurable impact on physiological responses. Similarly, for the skin resistance estimation model, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9c</xref>, pressure, humidity and temperature were found to be the most influential features. This result highlights the role of atmospheric conditions in modulating skin conductivity, a factor that is well-established in physiological studies. Although some of the top contributing features overlap across tasks, a closer inspection reveals that their importance scores vary significantly between models. This difference in scores demonstrates that ambient factors exert different levels of influence depending on the modeling task, further reinforcing the dataset&#x02019;s value for enabling tailored analyses across diverse application domains.<fig id="Fig9"><label>Fig. 9</label><caption><p>Ambient factors contribution scores for classification and estimation models.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41597_2025_5051_Fig9_HTML" id="d33e1484"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Usage Notes</title><p id="Par37">The dataset<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> we propose includes measurements for indoor temperature, humidity, pressure, light, sound, air quality, cardiac activity and electrodermal activity. One csv file per participant, synchronized by timestamp and with all the signals concatenated, is available in the repository for direct analysis. The aggregated dataset is suitable for training and evaluating ML or DL models for tasks such as classification, clustering, and regression. We introduced linear and Decision Tree based models for tasks like classifying increased heart rate risk and estimating heart rate and skin resistance. Nevertheless, we encourage peers to delve deeper into these tasks by considering different model approaches.</p><p id="Par38">The raw data files that contain sound measurements, ambient environment and electrodermal activity data and cardiac activity data are also available. Furthermore, additional metrics or features can be extracted from the raw data. For instance, heart rate variability can be readily computed from ECG data, while various ratios between ambient environment features can enhance the dataset&#x02019;s informational value. We want to emphasize that the raw ECG data was collected at a sampling frequency of 128 Hz, ensuring sufficient temporal precision for heart rate and heart rate variability analysis. Similarly, sound data was recorded at approximately 11 kHz, preserving its detailed temporal structure. The raw data files can be used independently for trend analysis of any of the signals recorded. Investigators have the flexibility to integrate these files using their preferred methods. If a higher sampling rate is needed, interpolation can be applied to increase the resolution of ambient and skin data rather than downsampling the ECG signal.</p><p id="Par39">The 180 seconds recording window in this dataset may not be optimal for all health-related applications, especially those requiring long-term physiological monitoring. However, this duration is well-suited for short-term assessments of stress and physiological responses to environmental conditions.</p><p id="Par40">Given the fact that physiological responses can vary among different individuals and that our dataset<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> was collected from a number of 14 participants, the influence of sample size on the generalizability of findings should be acknowledged when exploring potential applications. For researchers primarily interested in individual differences, future studies could expand on this work by integrating calibration techniques to account for variability or employing targeted recruitment strategies to fill demographic gaps. Nonetheless, the dataset&#x02019;s significant range of recorded signals and data points provides a strong foundation for application discovery and hypothesis testing.</p><p id="Par41">Overall the data we provide could contribute to advancements in fields such as environmental science and public health. Employers could use the dataset to optimize indoor workspaces for employee comfort and productivity. Insights from the dataset could inform decisions about lighting, temperature control, acoustic design, and layout to create more comfortable and efficient work environments. The dataset could be leveraged for smart home automation systems to dynamically adjust environmental conditions based on occupants&#x02019; preferences and physiological responses. For example, the system could automatically adjust lighting, temperature, and air quality based on user feedback or measured stress levels.</p><p id="Par42">The software packages we used for processing and analysing the data include python programming language, Pycharm and Spyder IDEs and various python libraries. While any programming language and IDE could suffice for data analysis, we especially recommend Spyder for its effectiveness in concatenating raw data files. Spyder offers a notably beneficial Variable Explorer feature, enabling interactive browsing and management of the objects and data structures produced by the code.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#x02019;s note</bold> Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><p>C.A. and M.Z.S. designed the study.
