The penton base, hexon, and fiber genes were identified as P33H28F71, designating this virus as a novel type, subsequently named HAdV-D116 by the Human Adenovirus Working Group. Recombination analysis suggested that HAdV-D116 is a recombinant strain derived from HAdV-D33, HAdV-D28, and HAdV-D71.

To date, over 100 genotypes have been identified, classified into seven species (A-G) (<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">Mennechet et al., 2019</xref>). HAdVs associated with central nervous system (CNS) diseases are rarely reported and typically occur in infants or immunocompromised patients, most frequently involving species B or C (<xref rid="ref58" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al., 2022</xref>; <xref rid="ref51" ref-type="bibr">Tunkel et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">Okamoto et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">Chatterjee et al., 2000</xref>). Although adenovirus infections of the CNS are rare, they pose significant clinical challenges, particularly in immunocompromised patients, where they can result in substantial mortality rates and cause long-term neurological sequelae in survivors (<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">Echavarria, 2008</xref>). Persistent HAdV infections in immunocompromised individuals, such as those with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), can result in severe clinical outcomes (<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">Lion, 2014</xref>). Currently, therapeutic options for adenovirus infections in immunocompromised individuals remain severely limited, with no regulatory approved antiviral agents specifically targeting adenoviruses. Management typically relies on supportive care measures, while the absence of standardized treatment protocols and limited understanding of adenovirus infection mechanisms in the central nervous system further complicates clinical decision-making (<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">Matthes-Martin et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>HAdVs contribute to a variety of disease conditions, including respiratory, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and ocular infections. Compared to HAdV-A, B, C which were commonly associated with acute respiratory infections, HAdV-D caused gastrointestinal tract infections and epidemic keratoconjunctivitis more often (<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">Ismail et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">Mao et al., 2022</xref>; <xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">Mundy et al., 2023</xref>). HAdV-D is the most genetically diverse and exhibits a higher tendency for recombination compared to other species (<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">Fujimoto et al., 2014</xref>). Certain types, including HAdV-D8, HAdV-D37, HAdV-D53, HAdV-D54, HAdV-D56, and HAdV-D64, have been linked to epidemic keratoconjunctivitis (<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">Ismail et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">Rajaiya et al., 2021</xref>). Moreover, newly emerging members of HAdV-D have been identified in patients with AIDS and other immunocompromised conditions, suggesting that impaired host immune responses may facilitate the recombination and evolution of novel HAdV strains (<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">Alissa Alkhalaf et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">Kajon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">Hage et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>HAdVs were initially classified by serological methods, with types 1 to 51 identified through this approach (<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">Ishiko et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">Jones et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">Ghebremedhin, 2014</xref>). In 2011, the Human Adenovirus Working Group<xref rid="fn0001" ref-type="fn"><sup>1</sup></xref> recommended using whole-genome sequencing for the characterization and naming of human adenoviruses (<xref rid="ref47" ref-type="bibr">Seto et al., 2011</xref>). Prior to this recommendation, HAdV-G52, HAdV-D53, HAdV-D54, HAdV-B55, and HAdV-D56 had already been classified using whole-genome sequencing and bioinformatic analysis, with HAdV-G52 being the first type identified through these methods (<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">Jones et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="ref47" ref-type="bibr">Seto et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">Robinson et al., 2011a</xref>; <xref rid="ref53" ref-type="bibr">Walsh et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="ref52" ref-type="bibr">Walsh et al., 2009</xref>). Since then, all newly identified types from HAdV-52 to the current HAdV-116 have been characterized by DNA sequencing and bioinformatics. Recombination is a recognized feature of HAdV evolution, and new recombinant types are classified based on significant genomic, biological, or pathogenic differences from existing types, as determined by analysis of the penton base, hexon, and fiber genes (<xref rid="ref47" ref-type="bibr">Seto et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>The HAdV capsid is composed of three major proteins: hexons, penton bases, and fibers. Several attachment receptors for HAdVs have been identified, including the Coxsackie and Adenovirus Receptor (CAR), CD46, desmoglein-2 (DSG-2), and the glycans GD1a and polysialic acid (<xref rid="ref49" ref-type="bibr">Stasiak and Stehle, 2020</xref>; <xref rid="ref57" ref-type="bibr">Zhang and Bergelson, 2005</xref>). Typically, HAdV entry into host cells involves the fiber knob anchoring the virus to primary cellular receptors, while the penton base engages secondary co-receptors to facilitate viral entry (<xref rid="ref49" ref-type="bibr">Stasiak and Stehle, 2020</xref>; <xref rid="ref57" ref-type="bibr">Zhang and Bergelson, 2005</xref>). Recently, a direct interaction between the hexon protein and CD46 has also been reported as an alternative entry mechanism, particularly for species D adenoviruses (<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">Persson et al., 2021</xref>). The diversity of HAdV receptors contributes to the broad tropism of these viruses (<xref rid="ref49" ref-type="bibr">Stasiak and Stehle, 2020</xref>). For example, HAdV-D26, a known causative agent of epidemic keratoconjunctivitis (EKC), utilizes sialic acid-bearing glycans as a primary entry receptor via the fiber knob (<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">Metsky et al., 2019</xref>). In contrast, HAdV-D56, which is associated with neonatal respiratory fatality and adult EKC, enters host cells through a direct interaction between the hexon protein and CD46 (<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">Persson et al., 2021</xref>). Moreover, at least 16 different HAdV-D types, including HAdV-D26 and HAdV-D28, have been shown to interact directly with CD46 through the hexon protein (<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">Persson et al., 2021</xref>). Despite these findings, the mechanisms by which HAdV-D binds to receptors and mediates cell entry during CNS infections remain unexplored.</p><p>In this study, we report the identification of a novel human adenovirus, HAdV-D116, detected in the cerebrospinal fluid of a patient with encephalitis and X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) using metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS). A combined genomic and bioinformatic approach was employed to elucidate the evolutionary characteristics of this novel adenovirus.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec3"><title>Metagenomic next-generation sequencing</title><p>Cerebrospinal fluid and blood samples from the patient were collected for mNGS. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Peking Union Medical College Hospital. Written informed consent was obtained from the patient. CSF was collected via standard lumbar puncture under aseptic conditions. Approximately 5&#x0202f;mL of CSF was collected in sterile tubes and immediately transported to the laboratory on ice.

The supernatant was aliquoted and stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C until further processing. For blood samples, 5&#x0202f;mL of peripheral blood was collected in EDTA tubes and processed within 2&#x0202f;h of collection. Plasma was separated by centrifugation at 1,600&#x0202f;&#x000d7;&#x0202f;<italic>g</italic> for 10&#x0202f;min to remove cells and debris. The processed plasma was stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C until DNA/RNA extraction. Microbial DNA was extracted using the QIAamp<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> UCP Pathogen DNA Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s protocol. Total RNA from these samples was extracted using QIAamp&#x000ae; Viral RNA Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA), then subjected to human rRNA depletion by application of Ribo-Zero rRNA Removal Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA), following the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. After removing the contaminating DNA via DNase I, cDNA was generated using reverse transcriptase and dNTPs. Subsequently, both DNA and cDNA preparations were combined, and libraries were constructed using the Nextera XT DNA Library Prep Kit (Illumina) and their quality was evaluated with the AGILENT Qubit dsDNA HS Assay kit on an Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer. Once library quality was confirmed, sequencing was performed on the Illumina NextSeq 550 platform using a single-end 75&#x0202f;bp sequencing strategy. For targeted metagenomic sequencing, an additional hybrid capture step was employed post-library construction. Specifically, 750&#x0202f;ng of each library was subjected to hybrid capture-based enrichment of microbial probes (SeqCap EZ Library, Roche, USA), with probes designed via the CATCH pipeline (<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">Metsky et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>Quality control and microbial identification</title><p>The obtained sequencing data were subjected to quality control using fastp (v0.20.0) (<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">Chen, 2023</xref>), which included adapter trimming, removal of low-quality reads, low-complexity reads, and sequences shorter than 40&#x0202f;bp. Subsequently, human reads were removed by aligning the reads to the human reference genome (hg38) using BWA (v0.7.17-r1188) (<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">Li, 2013</xref>). The remaining reads were then aligned to a microbial database curated from the NCBI RefSeq, which includes representative genomes of bacteria, viruses, fungi, and protozoa. Taxonomic classification of species was determined by reads specifically mapped to the reference genomes with over 96% (92% for virus) in nucleotide identity. The aligned reads were further validated through a BLASTn search against the NCBI nucleotide (nt) database. Additionally, after the removal of human reads, the remaining reads were assembled using SPAdes (v3.13.0) (<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">Prjibelski et al., 2020</xref>), and the resulting contigs were identified by conducting a BLASTn search against the nt database.<xref rid="fn0002" ref-type="fn"><sup>2</sup></xref></p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>Phylogenetic tree analysis and genome annotation</title><p>An assembled sequence, identified as human adenovirus through BLASTn, along with 112 known HAdV genomes obtained from NCBI, were used to construct a phylogenetic tree.

Using mNGS of CSF from a patient with encephalitis and XLA, we identified a novel human adenovirus. Whole-genome phylogenetic analysis classified this adenovirus within the HAdV-D species. Further phylogenetic and recombination analyses of the penton base, hexon, and fiber proteins indicated that this virus is a recombinant, derived from HAdV-D28, HAdV-D33, and HAdV-D71, with the genotype designated as P33H28F71. Of note, it harbors a large ~2000&#x0202f;bp deletion in the E3 region. This novel adenovirus was subsequently confirmed and designated as HAdV-D116 by the Human Adenovirus Working Group.</p><p>High read counts for HAdV-D116 were detected in the patient&#x02019;s CSF, with additional but substantially lower levels observed in the blood. These findings were further validated by qPCR, confirming that HAdV-D116 originated in the CSF, effectively ruling out contamination from blood (<xref rid="SM5" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S5</xref>). No other viruses or potentially pathogenic microorganisms were detected by mNGS, and traditional microbiological and serological screenings yielded negative results.

We attempted to isolate the virus from samples collected during the patient&#x02019;s lifetime, however, the viral culture was unsuccessful, likely due to suboptimal sample preservation or extended storage duration. Further sampling was not feasible, thus limiting the potential for more in-depth studies that require an isolated viral strain.</p><p>To determine whether HAdV-D116 arose from a mixed infection involving HAdV-D28, HAdV-D33, and HAdV-D71 or represents a single viral strain, we realigned non-human reads to the HAdV-D116 genome and conducted variant analysis. The absence of heterozygous variants&#x02014;expected in the case of a mixed infection due to genomic differences among HAdV-D28, HAdV-D33, and HAdV-D71&#x02014;ruled out a mixed infection, confirming HAdV-D116 as a single recombinant strain (data not shown).

Adenoviruses utilize a wide range of cellular receptors, which are closely tied to their tropism. Unfortunately, all three parental strains of HAdV-D116 (HAdV-D28, HAdV-D33, and HAdV-D71) lack well-documented clinical cases or tissue tropism studies, which limits our understanding of their pathogenic potential (<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">Ismail et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">Kahl et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">Robinson et al. 2011b</xref>). Generally, adenovirus species enter host cells through interactions between the fiber-knob protein and specific cellular receptors (<xref rid="ref49" ref-type="bibr">Stasiak and Stehle, 2020</xref>). For example, HAdV-D26 engages sialic acid-bearing glycans via the fiber-knob for cell entry (<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">Baker et al., 2019</xref>). Recent studies also indicate that several HAdV-D types, including HAdV-D26, HAdV-D28, and HAdV-D56 can enter cells through a direct interaction between the hexon capsid protein and CD46 (<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">Persson et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Structural predictions and alignments show that HAdV-D116 shares a high TM-score of 0.94 with HAdV-D26 in the fiber-knob region, suggesting substantial similarity (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>). Additionally, the electrostatic potential of the fiber-knob trimer is nearly identical between HAdV-D116 and HAdV-D26. This structural resemblance suggests that HAdV-D116 may utilize a similar cell entry mechanism, potentially engaging sialic acid-bearing glycans as receptors. Sialic acid-bearing glycans are highly abundant on various cell types, with the brain possessing some of the highest sialic acid content in mammals (<xref rid="ref46" ref-type="bibr">Schnaar et al., 2014</xref>), which may account for HAdV-D116&#x02019;s ability to infect the CNS.</p><p>CD46, which is also broadly expressed in human tissues, including the brain (<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">Persson et al., 2010</xref>), may represent an additional receptor for HAdV-D116. Due to the lower confidence in the hexon protein structure prediction (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>), it remains uncertain if HAdV-D116 shares structural or functional properties with HAdV-D56&#x02019;s hexon. However, the hexon gene of HAdV-D116, derived from HAdV-D28, has previously been shown to mediate cell entry through CD46 binding (<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">Persson et al., 2021</xref>). Given that CD46 serves as a receptor for numerous HAdV-D types (<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">Persson et al., 2021</xref>), it is plausible that HAdV-D116 may employ both fiber-knob binding to sialic acid and hexon interactions with CD46 for cell entry. This dual receptor potential could explain its altered tropism, possibly facilitating infection of CNS tissues.</p><p>The penton base protein plays a crucial role in adenovirus internalization through its interaction with cellular integrins. Following the initial attachment mediated by fiber or hexon proteins, the RGD motif in the penton base engages with &#x003b1;v integrins, triggering viral internalization via clathrin-mediated endocytosis (<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">Madisch et al., 2007</xref>). Our structural analysis of HAdV-D116&#x02019;s penton base revealed conservation of the RGD motif, implying that HAdV-D116 likely shares similar entry mechanisms with other HAdV-D types. However, the role of penton base in determining HAdV-D tissue tropism remains unclear, as studies examining this relationship within the HAdV-D species are limited. Further investigation is needed to understand whether penton base variations contribute to the distinct tissue specificity observed among HAdV-D.</p><p>The HAdV-D genome exhibits substantial genetic diversity and is the most populous adenovirus species, with many new types emerging through recombination (<xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">Robinson et al., 2013</xref>).

Notably, HAdV-D showed the highest degree of polymorphism in the E3 region, with the large deletion (~2000&#x0202f;bp) observed in the E3 gene of HAdV-D116 likely related to this diversity.

The large deletion in HAdV-D116&#x02019;s E3 gene did not impair its replication, as evidenced by high read counts in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) detected by mNGS, indicating extensive replication in the patient&#x02019;s CSF. Large deletions in the E3 gene have been reported in HAdV-B (<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">Marinheiro et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="ref50" ref-type="bibr">Su et al., 2011</xref>), and our study is the first to document such a deletion in HAdV-D. The approximately 2000&#x0202f;bp deletion in the E3 gene led to the complete loss of CR1-gamma and RID-alpha and truncation of CR1-beta, which fused with the complete RID-beta to form a novel ORF of 870&#x0202f;nt. Despite the deletion, the complete RID-beta ORF remained, potentially allowing for normal protein expression. CR1-gamma may play a role in the later stages of the viral replication cycle and in modifying host proteins (<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">Robinson et al., 2011c</xref>). RID-alpha is a multifunctional protein that promotes viral infection and replication by regulating cell surface receptor expression, inhibiting apoptosis, and modulating immune responses. These functions make RID-alpha a key factor in helping adenoviruses evade the host immune system and establish persistent infections (<xref rid="ref55" ref-type="bibr">Windheim et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">Horwitz, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">Krajcsi et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">Fessler et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">Lichtenstein et al., 2004</xref>). The CR1-beta (E3/49K) protein, unique to HAdV-D, is a highly glycosylated type I transmembrane protein that binds CD45, leading to CD45 dimerization, which inhibits T-cell and natural killer cell activation, thereby mediating immune regulation within the host (<xref rid="ref55" ref-type="bibr">Windheim et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="ref56" ref-type="bibr">Windheim et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>These findings suggest that while the absence of CR1-gamma, RID-alpha, and CR1-beta did not impair HAdV-D116&#x02019;s replication capacity, it may have substantially modified the virus&#x02019;s interactions with the host immune system and influenced certain biological traits, such as tissue tropism and virulence. There was a possibility that the patient&#x02019;s fatal encephalitis had been a result of HAdV-D116&#x02019;s potential CNS tropism and enhanced virulence.</p><p>The novel ORF identified in HAdV-D116 lacks homologs in the nucleotide database, and it remains unconfirmed whether this ORF encodes a functional protein. The predicted protein is 290 amino acids in length, consisting of the first 163 amino acids from CR1-beta, two additional residues (164&#x0202f;N and 165&#x0202f;M) derived from six nucleotides upstream of RID-beta&#x02019;s start codon, followed by the full-length RID-beta (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>).</p><p>Structural predictions indicate local similarities between this novel protein and the CR1-beta and RID-beta proteins of HAdV-D60, suggesting that the fusion did not disrupt original protein domains or create new ones, possibly allowing it to retain partial functions of both CR1-beta and RID-beta (<xref rid="SM2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figures S2A&#x02013;D</xref>). The complete CR1-beta protein of HAdV-D60, however, is 414 amino acids long and functions through proteolytic processing. It is initially synthesized as an 80&#x02013;100&#x0202f;kDa type I transmembrane protein and then cleaved into a large N-terminal fragment (~90&#x0202f;kDa) and a C-terminal fragment (10&#x02013;13&#x0202f;kDa), with the large ectodomain (sec49K) secreted to bind CD45 (<xref rid="ref55" ref-type="bibr">Windheim et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="ref56" ref-type="bibr">Windheim et al., 2013</xref>). Even if the novel ORF is expressed as a protein, its truncated CR1-beta segment may be insufficient for processing and secretion, potentially preventing it from forming a&#x0202f;~&#x0202f;90&#x0202f;kDa&#x0202f;N-terminal fragment. The specific function of this novel ORF remains unknown, and experimental validation is needed to confirm this hypothesis.</p><p>Adenoviruses are widely used as vectors in vaccine and gene therapy trials due to their broad tissue tropism and ease of manipulation, with HAdV-D, including HAdV-D26, serving as a preferred vector in vaccine development (<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">Baker et al., 2019</xref>). Given HAdV-D116&#x02019;s potential CNS tropism, it could be evaluated as a candidate vector for therapies targeting CNS-related diseases or vaccines aimed at CNS pathogens. Unfortunately, we were unable to isolate a live strain of HAdV-D116. Many HAdV-D types, particularly newly discovered strains, appear to be incidental infections, as they have not been consistently detected in multiple patients, suggesting that they may only affect isolated individuals without further spread. However, if HAdV-D116 is detected again in future surveillance or clinical cases, its unique genomic features would make it an important subject for further research. Such studies would allow us to confirm its potential CNS tropism and examine the role of its E3 gene deletion in greater detail. Moreover, HAdV-D116 could serve as a valuable tool for gene therapy and vaccine development or provide insights for optimizing other adenovirus vectors.</p><p>In the post-COVID era, the importance of monitoring emerging pathogens, including adenoviruses, has increased, especially with respect to potential &#x0201c;Disease X&#x0201d; scenarios. Adenoviruses have caused notable outbreaks, such as EKC, underscoring their potential to drive emergent diseases. Our study suggests that recombination events and large deletions in the E3 gene could give rise to novel adenoviruses with altered tissue tropism and potentially increased virulence, posing a particular threat to immunocompromised individuals and potentially leading to wider outbreaks of &#x0201c;Disease X&#x0201d; in the general population. Continuous surveillance and research on novel adenoviruses are therefore essential.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn0001"><p>

PCR amplification was performed using four primer sets (P1-P4) on CSF samples (left panel) and no-template negative controls (NC, right panel), with molecular weight markers (M, 100&#x02013;2000&#x0202f;bp) indicated on both ends. The primers were designed to validate the deletion: P1 primers (Forward: GCCAGTTACATGGCTTGGTG; Reverse: GCAGGAGCAGACCATGACTA) were designed to flank the deletion site, with an expected product of 205&#x0202f;bp if the deletion is present. This amplicon was used for subsequent Sanger sequencing validation. P2 primers (Forward: TCCTCGCTGATGATTACTCTAAAT; Reverse: AACTGATTTCTGCGGGGAGG) feature a forward primer designed at the deletion junction, expected to generate a 262&#x0202f;bp product only if the deletion exists. P3 primers (Forward: CCTGCGCCAAAAACCAGAAA; Reverse: TGCATTTAGAGTAATCATCAGCGAG) utilize a reverse primer designed at the deletion junction, with an expected product of 196&#x0202f;bp specifically amplifying in the presence of the deletion. P4 primers (Forward: ACTGCAAATTTAACTTCGCTTGC; Reverse: AGGAAGAACCTAGGAATCATGGC) target a conserved region of HAdV-D within the predicted deletion region, with an expected product of 290&#x0202f;bp that should only amplify if the deletion is absent. Analysis of CSF samples revealed distinct bands of expected sizes for P1-P3 (205&#x0202f;bp, 262&#x0202f;bp, and 196&#x0202f;bp), confirming successful amplification across the deletion region. The absence of amplification with P4 primers in CSF samples corroborates the deletion of this conserved region. No amplification was observed in any negative control reactions, confirming the absence of contamination.
