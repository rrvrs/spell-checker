Sinensetin (SEN) is a plant-derived polymethoxylated flavone with anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative activities. However, the hepatoprotective effect of sinensetin in HIRI pathogenesis have not been fully explored.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We constructed the HIRI model in mice, with blood and liver samples collected at 6 and 24&#x000a0;h after reperfusion to evaluate liver injury. We also evaluated the protective effect of sinensetin in mice liver I/R injury through histopathological observation, enzyme activity, immunofluorescence, Western blot, molecular docking, and molecular pharmacology experiments.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In our study, we have successfully established the mouse HIRI injury model, and the liver function indicators such as ALT, AST and LDH were significantly increased in the HIRI model group, while SEN pretreatment could lead to a significant decrease in these enzymatic activities, especially perfusion at 6&#x000a0;h. In addition, hepatocytic necrosis and lipid deposition were significantly improved under SEN pretreatment conditions compared to the HIRI group alone. Meanwhile, HIRI can significantly increase the expression of genes related to liver injury and inflammation, while SEN pretreatment can lead to a concentration-dependent decrease in these genes. Besides, the level of liver apoptosis and apoptosis-related genes such as BAX and Bcl-2 were significantly reduced especially in the high concentration SEN pretreatment group, and antioxidant enzyme activities such as CAT and GSH-Px also showed similar changes. Moreover, the HIRI model and SEN pretreatment could lead to dynamic changes in key genes involved in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress signaling, while the expression and distribution of GRP78 and CHOP proteins in liver cells also showed significant decrease in HIRI + L-SEN and HIRI + H-SEN groups. Molecular docking simulation showed theoretical binding between SEN-GRP78 and SEN-IRE1&#x003b1; in three-dimensional structures. Ultimately, the use of 4-PBA to pharmacologically inhibit ER stress may substantially reduce liver damage caused by HIRI in mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Taken together, our results suggested that sinensetin could alleviate HIRI injury through suppressing GRP78/CHOP-mediated ER stress, which may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for treating liver ischemia-reperfusion injury in clinical practice.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>sinensetin</kwd><kwd>HIRI injury</kwd><kwd>ER stress</kwd><kwd>liver apoptosis</kwd><kwd>oxidative stress</kwd><kwd>4-PBA</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001"><institution-wrap><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China

The HIRI process is characterized by a complex interplay of cellular and molecular mechanisms that lead to liver damage upon the restoration of blood flow after a period of ischemia (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Mao et al., 2023</xref>). The pathophysiology of HIRI involves a cascade of inflammatory responses, oxidative stress, and apoptosis, which can ultimately result in hepatocyte necrosis and dysfunction and significantly impact the prognosis of patients (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). Previous studies have shown that liver reperfusion injury can be divided into two main stages: the acute phase, from the beginning of reperfusion to 6 h, characterized by oxidative stress and inflammatory cytokine induced hepatocyte apoptosis and necrosis (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Gao et al., 2022</xref>); The second stage is mainly chronic damage, involving the fibrosis process of liver cells (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Chullo et al., 2024</xref>). Currently, the treatment drugs for liver ischemia-reperfusion injury include antioxidants such as N-acetylcysteine and superoxide dismutase (SOD), as well as drugs that alleviate ischemic injury such as levorotatory sugar and glycine (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Xu et al., 2024</xref>). However, these drugs may have some negative effects such as allergic reactions, liver and kidney dysfunction, gastrointestinal discomfort, etc (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Krzywonos-Zawadzka et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, understanding the potential pathophysiological mechanisms of HIRI and identifying effective treatment strategies are urgent issues that need to be addressed.</p><p>The fruits that are high in phytochemicals has been clearly demonstrated to possess both nutritional and therapeutic benefits, offering possibilities for preventing a range of diseases, such as liver damage (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Direito et al., 2024</xref>; <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Fitzgerald et al., 2024</xref>). Sinensetin is a polymethoxylated flavonoid found abundantly in citrus fruits and almost harmless to the human body, which possess a number of pharmacological properties such as anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative and anti-tumor (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Zhi et al., 2021</xref>). Previous studies have found that many natural drugs play a protective role in liver I/R injury. For example, cordycepin pretreatment ameliorated hepatocyte injury caused by HIRI, which inhibited apoptosis, autophagy and inflammatory response via regulation of the MAPK/NF-&#x003ba;B signaling pathway (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Ding et al., 2022</xref>). Celastrol protected against cerebral I/R injury through inhibiting glycolysis via the HIF-1&#x003b1;/PDK1 axis (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2022</xref>). The ellagic acid is a polyphenolic compound that could ameliorate hepatic I/R injury by inhibiting pyroptosis and the Caspase-1/GSDMD axis (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2022</xref>). Melatonin inhibited the NF-&#x003ba;B signaling pathway, alleviated the inflammatory response, and protected the liver from ischemia-reperfusion injury in rats (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Gao et al., 2021</xref>). However, the potential protective effects of sinensetin against liver ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury in mice remains to be elucidated.</p><p>During the process of liver ischemia-reperfusion conditions, the large amount of ROS produced after reperfusion and could cause endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2023</xref>). ER stress arises when the balance between protein synthesis, folding, and transport is disrupted <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2012</xref>). In hepatic I/R injury, the accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins within the ER lumen activates ER stress and these sensors include PERK, IRE1&#x003b1; and ATF6 (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Ajoolabady et al., 2023</xref>; <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2023</xref>). GRP78 serves as a chaperone protein and signaling regulator for the endoplasmic reticulum, while CHOP protein acts as a key transcription factor in stress response, playing a crucial role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and combating ER stress (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Arab et al., 2023</xref>; <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Ding et al., 2024</xref>). Previous studies found that C/EBP&#x003b1; overexpression ameliorated IR-induced hepatic injury, manifesting with reduced ALT/AST, oxidative stress and ER stress (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2024</xref>). Salidroside attenuates myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury via AMPK-induced ER stress inhibition (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Tian et al., 2022</xref>). Dexmedetomidine attenuates hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury-induced apoptosis via reducing oxidative stress and ER stress (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2023</xref>). However, whether ER stress signaling is involved in the protective effect of sinensetin against HIRI-induced liver injury is largely unknown.</p><p>Therefore, we constructed the hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury model in mice, and we revealed that sinensetin pretreatment provided the significantly protective effect in liver I/R injury of mice by molecular experiments. In addition, we demonstrated that sinensetin could greatly inhibit ER stress in HIRI model. Overall, these findings provide new therapeutic potential of sinensetin in liver ischemia-reperfusion injury during surgical procedures and improving patient outcomes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>2 Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>2.1 Drugs and reagents</title><p>Sinensetin (Cas no. 2306-27-6) was purchased from ChemFaces Bio-Technology Co., Ltd.

(MCE, United States).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>2.2 Experimental animals and study approval</title><p>The healthy male ICR/CD-1 mice (n = 60, weighing 18&#x02013;22&#x000a0;g and aged 6&#x02013;8&#x000a0;weeks) were obtained from GemPharmatech Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (Nanjing, China). All mice were kept in sterilized cages within a laboratory animal room that met SPF standards, maintained under regulated conditions (a 12 hlight/dark cycle, humidity at 60% &#x000b1; 10%, and temperature set to 24&#x000b0;C &#x000b1; 2&#x000b0;C), and provided with unrestricted access to food and water. All mice were acclimated in the animal room for at least 1&#x000a0;week prior to the experiment.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>2.3 Establishment of the HIRI model</title><p>The HIRI animal model was established by nonlethal segmental (70%) hepatic warm ischemia surgery that described in previous studies. Briefly, the mice were deprived of food for 24&#x000a0;h and only access to water prior to this surgery. After that, the mice were anesthetized by 1.25% sodium pentobarbital through an intraperitoneal injection. Next, we cut and opened the abdominal cavity along the center of the mice abdomen with scissors, while carefully isolating the structure of hepatic portal. Then, sterile microarterial clamps were used to block the blood vessels in the left and middle lobes of the liver, immediately causing partial hepatic ischemia. The abdomen was then covered with saline-soaked gauze, and constant temperature heater provided warmth to the mice. After a duration of 60&#x000a0;min, the arterial clamps were removed to restore blood flow and initiate reperfusion for 6&#x000a0;h or 24&#x000a0;h, respectively. Ultimately, the surgical incision in the abdomen was carefully sutured closed, and the mice were maintained at a body temperature of 36.5&#x000b0;C &#x000b1; 1&#x000b0;C throughout the procedure before being returned to their cages until they fully regained consciousness.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>2.4 Experimental grouping and drug treatment</title><p>The 60 mice were randomly assigned to one of four groups: 1) a sham surgery group (n = 15; the abdominal cavity was opened to separate the first hepatic portal and quickly closed, without HIRI surgery); 2) HIRI group (n = 15; HIRI without sinensetin pre-treatment); 3) HIRI + L-sinensetin group (n = 15; pre-treatment with sinensetin at 25&#x000a0;mg/kg by intraperitoneal injection once daily for 7&#x000a0;days before surgery); 4) HIRI + H-sinensetin group (n = 15; pretreatment with sinensetin at 50&#x000a0;mg/kg by intraperitoneal injection once daily for 7&#x000a0;days before surgery). After surgery and drug treatment, seven to eight mice from each group were randomly chosen at 6&#x000a0;h and 24&#x000a0;h following the start of reperfusion. Both of the blood samples and liver tissues were promptly collected and preserved at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C for additional biochemical analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>2.5 Serum biochemical analysis</title><p>Biochemical index analysis were conducted according to our lab&#x02019;s previous methods with minor modifications (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Xiong et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Xiong et al., 2024a</xref>). Briefly, the blood samples in each group was collected from mice eyeballs and then centrifuged at 4,500&#x000a0;rpm for 10&#x000a0;min to obtain the supernatant. The serum ALT, AST and LDH levels and the antioxidant enzyme activities of CAT and GSH-Px were measured using the test kits of microplate method in Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions (Nanjing, China). In brief, the collected serum was reacted with a microplate, and placed it into an automatic biochemical analyzer (SpectraMax iD3, MD, United States), and the OD value in each group was detected under the specified wavelength conditions. Each enzyme activity was calculated using a specific formula and expressed as units per litre from three biological replicates (n = 4).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>2.6 Histopathological analysis</title><p>Sections of liver lobe tissues were rapidly submerged and preserved in 4% PFA overnight at 4&#x000b0;C. Following this, the samples underwent dehydration through a series of ethanol and xylene at varying concentrations before being embedded in paraffin. After that, the liver samples were cut into 5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m-thick sections using the ultra-thin semiautomatic microtome (Leica RM2235, Germany). Next, the slices were dried at 37&#x000b0;C, deparaffinized, rehydrated through a series of xylene-alcohol solution, finally rinsed with deionized water. Then, the samples in each group were performed with hematoxylin and eosin (H&#x00026;E) staining kit (Solarbio Cas no. G1120, China) and modified Oil Red O staining kit (Solarbio Cas no. G1261, China) according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions.

Subsequently, reverse transcription was carried out and the resulting cDNA was quantified using the SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Biosharp BL698A, China). The final relative levels of gene expression were determined using the 2<sup>&#x02212;&#x00394;&#x00394;Ct</sup> method.

Briefly, the samples were dehydrated using a gradient of ethanol. After the antigen retrieval process, the slices were immersed in a sodium citrate solution for 10&#x000a0;min at 95&#x000b0;C. After washed with 1x PBS, the samples were hybridized with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA), and the slices were probed with primary antibodies against GRP78 and CHOP (1:500 dilution) for overnight. Next day, the samples were incubated with Goat Anti-Rabbit IgG H&#x00026;L (Alexa Fluor<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> 488, Abcam ab150077) and Goat Anti-Rabbit IgG H&#x00026;L (Alexa Fluor 647, Abcam ab150079) for 1&#x000a0;h, respectively.

When liver cells undergo inflammation or necrosis, alanine transaminase (ALT) will be released into the bloodstream and caused an increase in serum ALT levels. Our results indicated that the enzyme activity of ALT was significantly increased in the HIRI model group, while treatment with sinensetin could significantly reduce its activity level, whether under HIRI + L-SEN or HIRI + H-SEN conditions (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Aspartate transaminase (AST) is mainly present in the mitochondria of liver cells, and when serum AST levels increase, it generally indicates damage to liver cell mitochondria. The results also suggested that AST levels significantly increased in the HIRI model group, while sinensetin showed a concentration-dependent decrease in AST levels under HIRI + L-SEN or HIRI + H-SEN conditions (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). It is worth mentioning that the levels of ALT and AST increased more significantly at 6&#x000a0;h of perfusion than at 24&#x000a0;h, suggesting that the cell damage caused by liver ischemia mainly plays a role in the early stages. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is an important enzyme in the process of glycolysis, and an increase in LDH may be related to impaired liver function. Our results found that LDH levels have also increased in the HIRI model group and sinensetin treatment can lead to significant decrease, but unlike ALT or AST, the 24&#x000a0;h of perfusion are more significant than the 6&#x000a0;h, suggesting that this enzyme activity may play a role in the late stage (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>).

We have demonstrated for the first time that sinensetin extracted from citrus fruits have attenuated the HIRI effects while having smaller negative effects.</p><p>The &#x003b1;SMA, MMP9 and CYP450-3A41 genes have unique functions in liver injury, and our results have shown that sinensetin can significantly reduce the increased expression of these genes induced by HIRI in mice. Meanwhile, sinensetin reduced the expressions of TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-6 and TGF-&#x003b2; in a dose-dependent manner, indicating that SEN can protect the liver by reducing the release of inflammatory mediators. Apoptosis of liver cells is a complex process involving the regulation of multiple genes, mainly involving promoting apoptotic genes such as Bax and inhibiting apoptotic genes such as Bcl-2 and Caspase family genes (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Chu et al., 2021</xref>). In this study, we observed a significant decrease in the number of TUNEL-positive cells in the groups that received sinensetin pretreatment, as indicated by TUNEL staining. An analysis of apoptosis-related genes revealed that pretreatment with sinensetin resulted in lower expression levels of BAX and Bcl-2, while promoting an increase in the expression of Caspase3. From the results of antioxidant enzyme activity detection, high concentration SEN pretreatment also led to a significant decrease in HIRI-induced injury including CAT and GSH-Px enzyme activity levels. In consistent with previous studies, the extent of liver injury was significantly attenuated in mice that were orally administered with tea polyphenols (TP), which the I/R-induced liver cell apoptosis is inhibited by TP pretreatment (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Tao et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>In recent years, ER stress is a newly identified pathway significantly contributing to liver I/R injury (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Zhu and Zhou, 2021</xref>). ER stress can induce cell apoptosis, regulate unfolded protein response and activate inflammatory response (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Xu et al., 2015</xref>). Our results indicated that the key genes of the ER signaling pathway were dynamically regulated during HIRI and SEN pretreatment in qRT-PCR analysis. Immuno-fluorescence and Western blot experiments showed that GRP78 and CHOP proteins were significantly increased under HIRI conditions, while HIRI + SEN treatment could lead to a significant decrease in them. At the same time, the expression levels of other proteins such as ATF6 and IRE1&#x003b1; were further increased under SEN pretreatment conditions. Moreover, molecular docking analysis showed theoretical binding between SEN-GRP78 and SEN-IRE1&#x003b1; proteins in spatial structure, suggesting that sinensetin may play a role in resisting HIRI-induced liver injury by regulating ER stress signaling pathway. In accordance with previous studies, rapamycin markedly protected livers from HIRI and ER stress markers were markedly upregulated by HIRI treatment, whereas they were downregulated by rapamycin pretreatment (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Zhu et al., 2015</xref>). Ischemic preconditioning attenuates endoplasmic reticulum stress-dependent apoptosis of hepatocytes in liver I/R injury and hydrogen-rich saline ameliorates HIRI through regulation of ER stress and apoptosis (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Lu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Kong et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>Based on the previous studies, we revealed that ER stress may be involved in the liver damage induced by HIRI in mice. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the role of the GRP78/IRE1&#x003b1; signaling pathway in the liver injury caused by HIRI. Our results demonstrated that pharmacological inhibiting the ER stress signaling by 4-PBA pretreatment could decrease the expressions of GRP78 and CHOP, together with significantly reduce the key liver function indicator ALT and AST levels. Meanwhile, 4-PBA pretreatment partially ameliorated the degree of hepatocyte necrosis and liver apoptosis induced by HIRI in mice. Finally, the expression of liver injury and inflammatory related genes also partially rescued after inhibiting ER stress, exhibiting liver protective effect similar to sinensetin treatment. In conclusion, sinensetin presents a promising therapeutic avenue for protecting against the liver from ischemia/reperfusion injury. This effect may be derived from its anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic properties, as well as the regulation of GRP78/IRE1&#x003b1; ER stress signaling pathway. Further research is needed to comprehensively clarify its mechanisms of action and explore its potential clinical applications.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="s5"><title>5 Conclusion</title><p>In summary, the current study proved that sinensetin could ameliorate liver apoptosis, inflammatory response and histopathological damage following hepatic schemia-reperfusion injury I/R injury in mice. The molecular mechanism of this hepatoprotective effect may be related to the inhibition of ER stress through targeting the GRP78/CHOP proteins. Our results provided experimental evidence that sinensetin may be a potential candidate for the treatment of hepatic schemia-reperfusion injury in clinic practice.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors wish to thank the staff at the Key Laboratory of Embryo Development and Reproductive Regulation of Anhui Province in the Fuyang Normal University for their expert and most caring technical assistance in helping with the mice and individual experiments.</p></ack><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s6"><title>Data availability statement</title><p>The original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/<xref rid="s13" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Material</xref>, further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding authors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="ethics-statement" id="s7"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>The animal study was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Fuyang Normal University (License number: FYNU-IACUC-2023-0023).
