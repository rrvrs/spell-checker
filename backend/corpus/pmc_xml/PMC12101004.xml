To address this gap, the self-COMPAssion-based online group psyChoTherapy for bereavement-related grief (COMPACT) feasibility trial was developed; it showed promising participant engagement and potential effectiveness. This study aimed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the impact, contextual factors, and implementation considerations of the COMPACT programme.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">Online semi-structured interviews were conducted and analysed using a deductive reflexive thematic analysis guided by the UK Medical Research Council process evaluation framework. The interviews involved 21 participants and 10 intervention personnel from the COMPACT feasibility trial. The Helpful Aspects of Therapy Form (HATF) was used to guide the interviews, ensuring a focus on identifying mechanisms of impact, contextual factors, and implementation considerations.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">Four main &#x0201c;mechanism of impact&#x0201d; themes were identified: common humanity and self-awareness, perceived importance of self-care, deepening self-insights and personal growth, and amplified self-compassion. Two associated &#x0201c;contextual factor&#x0201d; themes (group therapy and a secure programme environment) were highlighted. Additionally, two &#x0201c;implementation consideration&#x0201d; themes (barriers and facilitators) were found, with related contextual themes of group therapy and online delivery.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">The core impact mechanisms of the COMPACT programme included accessible online delivery, group work enhancing common humanity, and a safe, supportive environment deepening self-insight, self-care, and self-compassion.

Bereavement-related grief, while a natural response, can significantly increase the risk of prolonged grief disorder (PGD)&#x02014;characterised by persistent grief that impairs daily functioning for an extended period following bereavement&#x02014;along with depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Despite the widespread occurrence of bereavement-related grief and prolonged grief disorders, there remains a notable absence of standardised care approaches to address these challenges effectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par14">Individuals with higher levels of self-compassion experience lower levels of grief, indicating that self-compassion-focused therapies are a promising approach for this population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Self-compassion, rooted in Buddhist philosophy, comprises three key elements: kindness towards oneself, recognition of common humanity, and mindfulness of suffering [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Gilbert posits that interactions with compassionate caregivers foster a sense of safety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], which can be particularly beneficial for bereaved individuals. Self-compassion may mitigate self-criticism and guilt, facilitating emotion regulation. This is particularly relevant in the Japanese cultural context, where individuals tend to exhibit a strong self-critical tendency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], underscoring the need for self-compassion-based interventions.</p><p id="Par15">Online programmes have garnered increasing attention as a means of providing psychological support owing to their ability to mitigate geographical limitations and mental health stigma, while enhancing accessibility and anonymity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]; however, online bereavement support incorporating the concept of self-compassion remains largely unexplored.</p><p id="Par16">Previously, we reported on a feasibility trial of COMPACT, an online group psychotherapy intervention based on self-compassion for bereavement-related grief [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. COMPACT was designed to mitigate geographical limitations and stigma under the premise that self-compassion can alleviate the psychological burden of grief [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Sixty participants were enrolled, with 83.1% (54/60) completing at least four out of five sessions. Secondary outcomes indicated potential improvements in grief, depression, anxiety, and self-compassion, although resilience scores remained unchanged [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. However, the mechanisms underlying the intervention's effectiveness and its mediators need further investigation.</p><p id="Par17">The UK Medical Research Council(MRC)guidance suggests evaluating complex interventions based on three key themes: mechanism of impact, context, and implementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Guided by this framework [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], this study aimed to understand the mechanisms through which the intervention impacted grief symptoms, the contextual factors influencing its effectiveness, and the challenges encountered during the implementation of COMPACT. By examining qualitative data that complements the quantitative results of the COMPACT feasibility trial, this process evaluation seeks to address these gaps, contribute to the growing evidence base for self-compassion-based interventions, and provide practical insights for broader implementation in clinical and community settings.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par18">This qualitative study included participants and intervention personnel from the COMPACT feasibility trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and received ethical approval from the Kyoto University Graduate School and Faculty of Medicine Ethics Committee (Approved ID: C1565) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].

Psychotherapy, delivered by trained psychologists (intervention personnel), included psychoeducation, self-compassion enhancement, and resilience building (see Additional file 1 for details on intervention content). The 5-week intervention comprised weekly 2-h online sessions, integrating individual and group work, with assignments provided after each session (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Ten intervention personnel led one to two programmes each, with one psychologist working with 5&#x02013;6 participants per session alongside an assistant facilitator [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Furthermore, the study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] incorporated quantitative follow-up assessments at 1 and 3&#x000a0;months to evaluate the stability of the intervention's effects.

Participants were recruited from among the COMPACT trial participants who indicated their willingness to be interviewed on a post-session questionnaire. Participants were selected to ensure a balanced sample based on gender and age. Intervention personnel then confirmed the feasibility of interviewing each selected participant, excluding those for whom the interview would be overly burdensome. This convenience sampling approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] resulted in a final sample of 21 participants (7 from each cohort). Intervention personnel were recruited via email by HT, targeting all personnel involved in each cohort. The number of participating personnel was 4, 5, and 4 for cohorts 1, 2, and 3, respectively. As four personnel participated in multiple cohorts, the final sample consisted of 10 intervention personnel.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Procedure</title><p id="Par21">The author YK developed interview guides for participants (Additional file 2) and intervention personnel (Additional file 3) based on the HATF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. All interviews were conducted within 56 days of completion of the intervention to enhance participants'recall of the intervention content and their experiences. Participant interviews (45&#x02013;60 min) involved individual, semi-structured interviews focused on identifying the helpful aspects of the trial. Intervention personnel group interviews (2&#x02013;2.5 h) were conducted as focus groups to explore their experiences, approaches, perceived effectiveness, and key learning points.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Analysis</title><p id="Par22">We employed reflexive thematic analysis, which acknowledges the researchers'own perspectives and biases in the interpretation of the data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. This analysis was conducted deductively according to the UK MRC&#x02019;s process evaluation guidance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The approach facilitated a systematic investigation of the intervention's mechanisms of impact, contextual factors, and implementation, allowing us to identify shared understandings related to the intervention. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim by professional transcribers, and anonymised for confidentiality. Initial coding was performed by two researchers, HT and MY (both clinical psychologists). Prior to commencing initial coding, we created a preliminary code list (the initial version of the codebook) based on the research objectives. Initial coding applied codes to relevant segments based on the categories defined by the UK MRC (mechanisms of impact, contextual factors, and implementation). Coding primarily focused on phrases and short utterances, placing emphasis on the subjective emotional experiences of interviewees. HT and MY divided the data for coding and subsequently cross-verified the applied codes to enhance consistency. They evaluated the clarity of code definitions and their suitability to the data, refining the initial version of the codebook by adding, merging, and renaming codes. Following the revision of the initial codebook, a third researcher, SS (a clinical psychologist), joined HT and MY in the collaborative analysis. Themes derived from individual thematic analyses were shared and examined to verify whether the framework-derived themes were supported by the data. The codebook was revised and expanded as the analysis progressed, aiming to capture the data in a manner that preserved participant subjective and emotional experiences.</p><p id="Par23">The final themes were confirmed through consensus discussions among the research team (HT, MY, SS, YK: Psychotherapist, and YU: Internist). This collaborative and iterative analytical approach generated both explicit and latent themes. Focus group interviews followed a similar thematic analysis process.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Results</title><p id="Par24">The mean age of the 21 participants interviewed was 51.6 years (<italic>SD</italic>&#x02009;= 13.8 years), and 85.7% (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;= 18) were female.

These factors offer insights into potential adjustments needed for the intervention itself. Two contextual themes emerged from the analysis: Group Therapy and a Safe and Secure Programme Environment.

</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec31"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="Sec32"><title>Main findings</title><p id="Par91">This study elucidated the mechanism of impact, contextual factors, and implementation considerations of the COMPACT intervention. COMPACT was found to alleviate grief symptoms in participants by fostering recognition of common humanity to reduce loneliness, promoting the practice of self-care to deepen self-insight, and amplifying self-compassion. These mechanisms were reinforced by intervention personnel who provided a safe and secure environment. Implementation challenges were also identified, including interpreting non-verbal cues in the online format and developing strategies to enhance resilience.</p></sec><sec id="Sec33"><title>Mechanism of impact in COMPACT</title><p id="Par92">Analysis of interview data using reflexive thematic analysis suggests that the COMPACT process unfolded in a generally stepwise manner. Initially, by encountering fellow participants and intervention personnel and sharing their experiences, participants experienced a reduction in feelings of isolation and gained reassurance that they were not alone in their suffering (Common Humanity and Recognition). Subsequently, through learning and practicing self-care techniques such as breathing exercises and reframing, some participants recognised the importance of self-care and began incorporating it into their daily routines (Recognition of the Importance of Self-Care). Building upon these experiences, a subset of participants appeared to undergo a shift in perspective, deepening their understanding of themselves (Deepening Self-Insight and Personal Growth). Ultimately, through these cumulative experiences, participants seemed to recognise and embrace the significance of self-compassion, fostering a greater sense of kindness towards themselves (Amplification of Self-Compassion). These stages are not strictly demarcated but rather are considered to be mutually influential and interact synergistically to produce the overall effect of COMPACT.</p><p id="Par93">However, it is crucial to acknowledge that this proposed mechanism remains hypothetical. It may not apply uniformly to all individuals, and variations in the extent and manifestation of its effects are to be expected. This hypothesised mechanism, derived from interview data focusing on participants'emotional experiences, necessitates further validation through quantitative data and long-term follow-up studies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec34"><title>Interrelationship between participants and intervention personnel</title><p id="Par94">The aforementioned themes illuminate the interrelationship between participants and intervention personnel. COMPACT appears to have been effective in enabling most participants to recognise common humanity, reduce feelings of loneliness, deepen their understanding of self-compassion, promote the practice of self-compassion, and provide an experience that alleviated emotional distress. Intervention personnel emphasised that COMPACT fostered a warm and accepting atmosphere where participants felt safe to engage in self-disclosure. Intervention personnel warmly supported participants as they gained a sense of security and became capable of discovering new solutions. Participants indicated that the compassion (encompassing consideration, empathy, and ingenuity) demonstrated by the intervention personnel enabled them to engage with the programme within a safe and secure environment. Thus, COMPACT can be understood as having a therapeutic effect, wherein participants'self-reflection and the compassion of the intervention personnel who warmly observed and supported this introspection synergistically promoted participants'psychological growth and facilitated their recovery from grief.</p></sec><sec id="Sec35"><title>Sense of safety and security and expertise of intervention personnel</title><p id="Par95">The mechanism of impact in the COMPACT trial may have been reinforced by the contextual factor of a sense of safety and security. Participants reported feeling safe and secure, which they attributed to the exceptional creativity and care of intervention personnel that extended beyond the programme manual. This report aligns with Gilbert&#x02019;s theory that interactions with compassionate caregivers foster a sense of safety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], reduce vigilance for threat, and encourage exploration. The strong connection between participants and intervention personnel appeared to enable participants to explore their inner selves safely and confidently, which is crucial for personal growth. This study reaffirmed the importance of high-quality interventionist skills for programme effectiveness, a finding consistent with prior research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec36"><title>Sense of connection with others</title><p id="Par96">Throughout the COMPACT programme, participants encountered others with similar experiences during group therapy, fostering a sense of common humanity and connection&#x02014;key components of self-compassion. The mechanism of impact revealed that participants'experience of common humanity served as a catalyst for subsequent experiences. Grief-related distress includes feelings of loneliness, anxiety, and hopelessness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Even without malice, casual remarks from others can hurt bereaved individuals and make them feel misunderstood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. For participants who often feel isolated and trapped, discovering that others share their pain was likely a profound experience. Discovering that others share their pain offered solace and mitigated potential hurts from casual and unintentional remarks. Furthermore, while previous research has highlighted the role of shared humanity in peer support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], this study underscores the unique potential of group therapy to cultivate such meaningful connections.</p></sec><sec id="Sec37"><title>Practical benefits of self-care</title><p id="Par97">The mechanism of impact suggested that experiencing common humanity and the sustained practice of programme exercises, such as breathing exercises and mindfulness, may have led to self-insight and self-growth. This indicates that while incorporating new practices into daily life can be challenging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], the flexible homework assignments in the programme, designed to be completed at a convenient time, facilitated the development of routines. The benefits and importance of self-care have been previously described, and our study aligns with previous research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p id="Par98">Future implementation should focus on enhancing participants&#x02019; self-efficacy, ensuring that exercises are simple and easy to understand, and minimising psychological barriers to practice.</p></sec><sec id="Sec38"><title>Identified future challenges</title><p id="Par99">While our previous quantitative report showed no significant improvement in resilience [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], qualitative data suggest a pressing need to prioritise this aspect. Imagery training, intended to enhance resilience, sometimes amplified distress as participants focused on images of the deceased [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], highlighting the potential for triggering painful memories. Additionally, participants encountered challenges in applying learned skills to personal experiences, such as imagining a safe place, which for some was associated with the deceased. These challenges underscore the need to tailor interventions more closely to individual grief experiences. One participant poignantly stated,"Since my husband passed away, there is no safe place left in this world."Further refinement of resilience-enhancing methods is needed. Future research could explore alternative approaches to resilience training that minimise emotional distress, such as adaptive imagery techniques or personalised coping strategies tailored to individual grief experiences.</p><p id="Par100">Additional areas for improvement include participant assessments during recruitment to determine suitability for online psychotherapy, enhanced training for intervention personnel, and the evaluation of the long-term stability of intervention effects. The online format presents challenges in perceiving non-verbal cues, and the group setting can limit individualised attention. The introduction of a supervisor could address these challenges, support intervention personnel, and ultimately enhance programme effectiveness. Future research should consider incorporating qualitative or quantitative follow-up at 3, 6, or 12 months to evaluate the long-term stability of the intervention effects.</p><p id="Par101">Furthermore, when applying the findings of this study to other countries, it is imperative to consider cultural and healthcare system differences. While Japan exhibits a cultural background characterised by a strong tendency toward self-criticism, this may not apply in other cultural contexts. Additionally, although bereavement care is not widely covered by social insurance in Japan, the situation may differ in other nations. Implementing COMPACT in different countries would necessitate adapting the programme to account for these disparities.</p></sec><sec id="Sec39"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p id="Par102">This qualitative study explored the mechanisms and effects of the intervention through participant experiences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Interviews with both participants and intervention personnel provided a multifaceted understanding of the intervention.</p><p id="Par103">However, several limitations warrant consideration. First, while the MRC guidelines and the HATF provided valuable guidance in research design, data collection, and analysis, we also acknowledge the inherent limitations of adhering to pre-existing frameworks. For instance, the MRC process evaluation guidelines may not fully capture elements unique to the COMPACT intervention. The HATF did not allow for in-depth exploration of participants'bereavement experiences. Future research should incorporate inductive approaches and develop more tailored evaluation methods to capture elements specific to COMPACT.</p><p id="Par104">The second limitation concerns the generalizability of the findings. Reliance on participant consent for interview participation may have introduced bias towards a positive perception of the programme. Additionally, while participants presented diverse backgrounds in terms of bereavement experiences, age, and gender, the utilisation of reflexive thematic analysis resulted in the generation of common themes. Consequently, the inability to capture the individuality of bereavement experiences represents a limitation of this study. Future research is encouraged to pursue narratives that explore the experience of intervention, starting from the bereavement period.</p><p id="Par105">The third limitation is the low number of male participants in the COMPACT trial (7 out of 60 participants). This may be influenced by the cultural stigma surrounding men's mental health in Japan. Future research should explore strategies to increase male participation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec40"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par106">The COMPACT programme's core mechanisms of impact and associated contextual factors included easy access through online delivery, enhancement of a sense of common humanity through group work, and deepening of self-insight, self-care, and self-compassion within a safe and secure programme environment. Addressing issues related to programme implementation is essential for successfully conducting a randomised controlled trial and achieving broader social implementation of the intervention. These findings contribute to the broader evidence base for online psychological interventions, particularly in addressing bereavement-related grief and fostering emotional resilience in diverse populations.</p></sec><sec id="Sec41" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>
