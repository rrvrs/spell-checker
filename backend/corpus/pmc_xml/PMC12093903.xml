Ninety-eight participants (21-44 years old) were included in a cross-sectional study, with 17 ECIG users, 52 non-smokers, and 29 smokers. In the four-week clinical trial, 30 non-smokers were randomly assigned to use nicotine-free, flavorless ECIG or no use. A panel of 75 quantifiable lipid species and 7 lipid classes were assessed in the BAL using two tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) platforms. Ten cytokines and lipid-laden macrophages (LLM) were analyzed using the V-PLEX Plus Proinflam Combo 10 panel and Oil Red O staining, respectively. </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">In the cross-sectional study, 43 lipids were associated with smoking status at FDR&#x0003c;0.1, including two between ECIG and non-smokers (PC(14:0/18:1) and PC(18:0/14:0)) in pairwise follow-up analyses (Bonferroni-adjusted p&#x0003c;0.017). Associations between lipid species and cotinine, inflammatory markers, including IL-1&#x003b2; and IL-8, and LLM were also identified, as well as differences in lipid classes between smokers and the other groups. Smokers had higher saturated lipids, including ceramide (CER), sphingomyelin (SM), and diacylglycerol (DAG) than that of non-smokers and ECIG users. No significant associations were identified in the 4-week clinical trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">Smoking was associated with altered lipid levels, as compared to both non-smokers and ECIG users; the majority were downregulated and ECIG effects tend to be smaller in magnitude than smoking effects, although some were different than those in the smokers group.

However, ECIGs may have unique toxicities for both smokers and non-smokers. The primary solvent carriers of ECIG liquids are propylene glycol (PG) and vegetable glycerin (VG). While the Food and Drug Administration generally recognizes them as safe for oral use, studies show potential adverse effects in the lungs when heated and aerosolized. Recent studies, including ours, indicate an ECIG toxic effect on the lung, including an altered lung immune response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par13">Exposure to ECIG aerosols disrupts normal lung lipid homeostasis in laboratory animals and humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].

Our previous cross-sectional study of smokers, ECIG users, and non-smokers showed higher levels of LLM in almost all smokers and half of the ECIG users, while none was found in non-smokers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Interestingly, we observed LLM to be significantly associated with cytokines such as IL-4 and IL-10 in ECIG users only [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par14">Lipids are essential for lung biology by playing a role in cell membrane structure integrity, signaling transduction, surfactant synthesis, and inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].

For example, smokers from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey had lower serum high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and higher serum triglycerides compared to non-smokers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].

Notably, there is a wide diversity of lipid abundance and species across tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Thus, it is essential to evaluate comprehensive lipidome profiles in the target organ, such as the lung in order to provide insights into the direct effects of cigarette smoking and ECIG use on lipids. Considering the potentially important role of lipids in respiratory diseases and the lack of understanding of target organ effects on lipid metabolism for cigarette smoking and ECIG, we examined the lung lipidome of smokers, ECIG users, and non-smokers in a cross-sectional study and a clinical trial of non-smokers trained to vape nicotine-free, flavorless ECIGs. Also, we examined how these lipids are associated with smoking and EC use intensities to examine dose-dependent effects using urinary biomarkers of exposure and further related to LLM and inflammatory responses to understand potential biological implications of smoking/ECIG use-related lipids. We hypothesize that smoking and ECIG use disrupt the lung lipidome, impacting immune responses and potentially heightening the risk for pulmonary immune responses.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Participants and design</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Cross sectional study</title><p id="Par16">Participants (n=98; 17 ECIG users, 52 non-smokers, 29 smokers; age range: 21&#x02013;44 years old) underwent bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL).

ECIG users were those who used ECIGs daily for at least a year with no cigarette smoking for at least 5 months. Fourteen out of 17 of the ECIG users were former smokers.

Additional human subject details have been previously published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. One week post baseline bronchoscopy, the ECIG randomized participants were provided with nicotine-free, flavorless Innokin iTaste VV 4.0 refillable tank ECIG device (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.innokin.com/">https://www.innokin.com/</ext-link>) and e-liquids that contained 50% PG and 50% VG (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ecblendflavors.com/flavorless-eliquid/">http://www.ecblendflavors.com/flavorless-eliquid/</ext-link>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].

Power for the clinical trial was calculated prior to the beginning of the study: Considering a significance threshold corresponding to one expected false discovery per 1000 tests (p=0.001), a two-sided, paired t-test achieves 80% power to detect a mean of paired differences equal to 0.8 standard deviations of those paired differences.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Cytokines</title><p id="Par22">Cytokines were measured in the BAL with the V-PLEX Plus Proinflam Combo 10 panel (Meso Scale Discovery, Rockville, MD) following manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions, which measured IFN-G, IL-1B, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-13, and TNF-a.

Both methods employed a one-pot, dry-pellet extraction in a 96-wellplate format. For the quantification of phospholipids (PL), 20 &#x000b5;L of BAL fluid was used. For LC-MS/MS analysis of FC and CE, 50 &#x000b5;L of 100x diluted plasma and 50 &#x000b5;L of AF4-separated plasma fractions were used, or 50 &#x000b5;L of 5x diluted CSF and 200 &#x000b5;L of AF4-separated CSF fractions. One deuterium-labeled analog per lipid class (phosphatidylcholine (PC), lyso-phosphatidylcholine (LPC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylinositol (PI), and sphingomyelin (SM)) was used as the internal standard (Avanti Polar Lipids, AL, USA). LC-MS/MS peak area ratio-based calibration and quantification were accomplished using a value-assigned plasma pool diluted into the linear range of the instrument, with calibrator dilution factors ranging from approximately 30 to 3000. The limits of quantification in BAL fluid were 369 ng/mL for PC, 81 ng/mL for SM, 29 ng/mL for PE, and 9 ng/mL for PI. A targeted LC-MS/MS approach with unit resolution was applied to monitor PL species commonly found in human plasma (19 for PC, 19 for PE, 8 for LPC, 15 for PI, and 16 for SM). The LC separation was HILIC mode, where lipids are separated largely by head-group, with fatty-acids having little impact on retention. Thus, lipid class peaks could be generated by summing individual species signals and quantified separately from the individual species. Individual PL species with total FA carbon chain lengths and total double bonds were identified based on species-specific molecular ions and generic head group daughter ions. Note that this approach does not allow experimental verification of fatty acyl chains that belong specifically to the sn1 and sn2 positions. PC(32:0), the most abundant lipid in lung surfactant, was separately reported with a limit of quantification of 1.3 ng/mL.</p><p id="Par25">For LC-MS/MS analysis of nonpolar lipids cholesteryl ester (CE), triacylglycerol (TAG), and free cholesterol (FC), 50 &#x000b5;L of BAL fluid was used. A single deuterated internal standard was employed for each lipid class (CE and TAG), as well as for unesterified (free) cholesterol (FC). Calibrators and QCs were prepared by diluting the human serum pools of NIST SRM-1951c into the linear range of the instrument, with dilution factors ranging from approximately 30 to 3000. The LC separation was in the normal-phase mode, which also separates lipids by class (head-group) rather than fatty-acid species. Atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) coupled with in-source fragmentation was employed in the mass spectrometer prior to MS/MS, allowing the CE and TAG classes to be quantified as a single signal (as well as FC), however species information for CE and TAG is not available with this approach.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Flow-Injection differential mobility scanning tandem mass spectrometry (FIA-DMS-MS/MS) lipidomics</title><p id="Par26">Lipids from BAL samples were extracted using a modified Bligh/Dyer method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. 2.0 mL methanol, 1.0 mL dichloromethane (DCM), 0.6 mL water, and 25 &#x000b5;L internal standard mixture (AB Sciex, P\N 5040156) were added to 0.4 mL BAL and vortex mixed. Samples were allowed to stand for 30 min, followed by another addition of 1.0 mL DCM and 1.0 mL water. To enhance phase separation, samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 1200 rpm, followed by removal of the lipid-containing bottom layer. An additional 2.0 mL DCM was added to each sample and a second extraction was performed with the lower lipid-containing portion combined with the first extraction. Samples were evaporated to completion under a stream of nitrogen and reconstituted in 0.3 mL of 50:50 (v:v) DCM:methanol containing 10 mM ammonium acetate.</p><p id="Par27">A targeted lipidomics analysis was conducted using the Lipidyzer platform. A 50 &#x000b5;L aliquot was infused into the mass spectrometer twice using two different methods. The first method uses a SelexION Differential Mobility Spectrometry (DMS) analyzer with 1-propanol as a gas modifier to separate and analyze species in the phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), sphingomyelin (SM), lyso-phosphatidylcholine (LPC), and lyso-phosphatidylethanolamine (LPE) lipid classes. A second method disables the DMS and analyzes lipid species in the cholesteryl ester (CE), ceramide (CER), diacylglycerol (DAG), free fatty acid (FFA), and triacylglycerol (TAG) classes.

A quality control serum sample was included with each batch to ensure instrument reliability and establish method reproducibility. Data processing was conducted using the Lipidyzer Lipidomics Workflow Manager software, including lipid species identification and concentration calculation in nmol/mL.

All underwent a second bronchoscopy after 4 weeks of ECIG use or no use. As in the cross-sectional analyses, a left-censored log-normal model was employed. For these models, follow-up lipid measurement was used as the dependent variable, baseline lipid measure was included as a covariable, and intervention group was the main effect. ECIG use was not associated with any changes in lipid features (FDR &#x0003e; 0.8; Table S7). PG data were available for all 30 clinical trial subjects at both baseline and follow-up.

We identified differences in lipid species in the cross-sectional study, including two lipids that differed between ECIG users and non-smokers. We also found many lipids that were different between smokers vs. ECIG users and non-smokers, which provides some evidence that cigarette smoking potentially leads to changes in lung lipid profiles. Associations between lipid species and inflammatory markers were also identified, including lipid*group interactions, indicating different lung inflammatory states by smoking status (ECIG vs. smoker vs. non-smoker). Additionally, smokers had a higher saturation ratio in CER, DAG, and SM than non-smokers and ECIG users. Taken together, these findings indicate that smoking may have a larger effect on lipid levels in the lung than ECIG use, which may have a much smaller, and in some cases different effect. This is similar to our previous findings with different biomarkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>], which found that molecular differences associated with smoking are typically large compared to ECIG users and non-smokers, whereas differences between ECIG users and non-smokers are more modest where they exist. In our clinical trial of ECIG use among non-smokers, significant differences between groups were not identified, likely because of the short treatment duration (4 weeks), smaller numbers of puffs per day compared to the number of daily puffs for exclusive ECIG users (40 from the trial vs 160 from the cross-sectional study), and the more modest effects seen between ECIG users and non-smokers.</p><sec id="Sec25"><title>Cross-sectional study</title><sec id="Sec26"><title>Primary comparison</title><p id="Par42">Of lipids that differed by smoking status with the omnibus test, most were significant or suggestive of associations in the pairwise tests between smokers versus the other two groups, indicating potential global lipid disruption in the lung from smoking cigarettes. In ECIG users compared to non-smokers, we identified two significantly different lipids, PC(14:0/18:1) and PC(18:0/14:0), which may be unique ECIG-related lipids and differ from smoking associations.</p><p id="Par43">For the omnibus significant lipids, lipid levels in smokers were lower than that of non-smokers and ECIG users. This is consistent with prior findings showing lower levels of lung lipids, including surfactant lipids in COPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Specifically, sphingolipids, a primary component of pulmonary surfactant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], were lower present in COPD and former smokers. Despite an older study population of their study (vs young adults in the current study), consistent reductions were also replicated in a smoke-exposed mouse model, indicating this observation may not be age-specific. Further, their study additionally found that lower lipid levels correlated with lower lung function, a hallmark of COPD, implicating a potential clinical contribution of lower lung lipids to pulmonary diseases.</p><p id="Par44">Three PCs appeared to be elevated in ECIG use, namely PC(14:0/18:1), PC(18:0/14:0), and PC(18:1/20:4) that were significantly or marginally associated (p &#x0003c; 0.05) with both ECIG users vs. smokers and ECIG users vs. non-smokers, but not for smokers vs. non-smokers. Other PCs, in general, were higher in ECIG users than in non-smokers. PC is a major phospholipid that makes up to 80% of surfactant lipids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>], which are involved in reducing surface tension in the lungs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. ECIGs have previously been shown to increase PCs, as well as other phospholipids, in BAL cells from ECIG-exposed mice, and to upregulate the expression of PC-synthesizing enzyme genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Additionally, PC metabolism has been implicated in cancer/immune cell cross-talk in the tumor micro-environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. For example, LysoPC can modulate immune cell recruitment and activation, be involved in inflammatory signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>], and inhibit lung cancer proliferation within the tumor micro-environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. This supports further research on potential ECIG-related health effects, specifically in immune responses and cancer.</p></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Inflammatory markers</title><p id="Par45">Much evidence exists that lipids affect inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. In the current study, many lipids (~17% of the lipid/inflammatory marker combinations) were significantly associated with inflammatory markers after adjusting for smoking group, along with significant interactions within smoking groups, indicating that the relationship between the lipids and inflammation differs by smoking group. The top associations were found primarily with IL-1&#x003b2; and IL-8. Studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>], including ours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], showed IL-1&#x003b2; levels were higher in smokers&#x02019; BAL compared to non-smokers&#x02019; BAL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. Moreover, we reported significantly higher levels of IL-1&#x003b2; in ECIG users compared to non-users (59% higher), using a subset of study participants from this study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. IL-1&#x003b2; is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that plays a key role in initiating the inflammatory response in pulmonary diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. Given the critical role of IL-1&#x003b2; in tumor growth and metastasis in lung cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>], IL-1&#x003b2; inhibitor is being evaluated as an anti-inflammatory therapy in lung cancer patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. IL-8 is also a pro-inflammatory cytokine that plays a role in lung defense [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. The subset of samples from this study showed a significantly higher level of IL-8 in the BAL of smokers compared to non-smokers. Separately, higher amounts of IL-8 are found in the BAL, sputum, and lung tissue of those with chronic lung diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. Given that our study participants are young adults with no history of pulmonary diseases, our cross-sectional findings highlight the need to investigate how smoking- and potentially ECIG-altered lipids may drive lung inflammation and predispose to pulmonary diseases.</p></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Lipid-Laden macrophages</title><p id="Par46">The ECIG or Vaping Product Use-Associated Lung Injury (EVALI) outbreak was discovered to be caused by adulterated cannabis vaping containing vitamin E acetate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. LLMs were initially thought to be involved in the pathology of EVALI but were later identified in both smokers and ECIG users [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Importantly, our group reported a unique link between ECIG use and LLM, suggesting a novel lipid-driven pathway of ECIG-related pulmonary health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. Moreover, an ECIG-exposed mouse model showed lipid accumulation in alveoli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>], supporting further systematic assessment of the airway&#x02019;s lipidome in the lungs of ECIG users. Therefore, we investigated whether lipids were associated with LLMs in BAL of smokers, ECIG users, and non-smokers. While ten lipid features were associated with LLMs, none of the lipids were significant in within-group analyses, indicating a smoking effect. Given the cross-sectional study design, further studies are warranted to define a potential relationship between smoking-related lipids and accumulating alveolar macrophages.</p></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Saturated/Unsaturated</title><p id="Par47">For the analysis of saturation of lipids, significant differences were only observed in comparisons with the smoking group. For each of the significant lipids (CER, DAG, and SM), saturation was significantly higher in the smoking group, with non-smokers and ECIG users being similar. This is in contrast to a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>] of mice exposed to ECIGs, where an increase in lipid saturation was observed in the ECIG-exposed mice.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec30"><title>Clinical trial</title><p id="Par48">In the clinical trial of ECIG use among non-smokers, no significant changes with ECIG use were identified, even when assessing in the context of ECIG use (measured by urinary exposure biomarkers, including PG or cotinine). Thus, the clinical trial was not able to replicate the cross-sectional analyses. Given that most of the significant associations in the cross-sectional study were results of differences from the smoker's group, this does not contradict the cross-sectional results. Additionally, this ECIG use trial was only performed for four weeks of ECIG use with much smaller numbers of puffs per day compared to the number of daily puffs for exclusive ECIG users (40 from the trial vs 160 from the cross-sectional study). Thus, exposure was likely not long enough to observe long-term exposure effects that might be identified in the cross-sectional study.</p><p id="Par49">Although some effects specific to ECIG use were noted in the cross-sectional analyses, overall, ECIG users appear to be more similar to non-smokers than to smokers when considering the lipidomics data as a whole, as we have seen previously with other biomarkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. However, two lipids, (PC(14:0/18:1) and PC(18:0/14:0), were significantly different between ECIG users and non-smokers in pairwise follow-up tests. These PCs have been shown to have a similar gel-to-liquid melting temperature as PC(16:0/16:0), the major constituent of lung surfactant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. However, PC(14:0/18:1) and PC(18:0/14:0) are asymmetrical in the length of the esterified FAs, which may promote protein anchoring on cell walls, extracellular vesicles, and lipid droplets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. Whether these properties of PC(14:0/18:1) and PC(18:0/14:0) are relevant to the physiology and pathology of the lung in ECIG use requires further study.</p><p id="Par50">One of the main strengths of our study is that the samples were obtained from the target organ of smoking and ECIG exposure and lung diseases. Additionally, we employed a censored log-normal model to account for LOD values, rather than using imputation. Both cross-sectional and clinical trial data (clinical trial for ECIG) were included in the study. However, there are also some important limitations to our study. All of the significant associations identified were in the cross-sectional study. Causal inferences cannot be concluded from cross-sectional studies. In the current study, multivariable models were conducted using gender, THC positivity, and age as covariables. It is possible that other, currently unknown or unrecorded covariables could alter or mediate the associations herein. Numbers for the current study were modest (especially the ECIG group). Larger studies are needed to validate these results and to obtain more precise estimates.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec31"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par51">In summary, this novel study of target organ (lung) exposure found smoking to be associated with altered lipid levels as compared to both non-smokers and ECIG users, and ECIG-specific associations were also identified. As lipids have been identified as having potential roles in inflammation and cancer, the results herein in the lungs are important for identifying additional potential means through which cigarette smoking and ECIG use alter the lung. Furthermore, because ECIG use may serve as a risk reduction strategy for some smokers, the identified lipidome differences between smokers, ECIG users, and non-smokers suggest the need for future studies characterizing the role of smoking and ECIG-related lipid alteration in pulmonary disease.</p><sec id="Sec32"><title>Disclaimer</title><p id="Par52">The findings and conclusions in this manuscript are those of the authors and do not necessarily represent the official position of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
