Particularly in younger children, caries in the posterior teeth can result in extensive structural loss, necessitating full-coverage restorations.</p><p>Traditionally, stainless steel crowns (SSCs) have been the gold standard for restoring extensively decayed primary molars due to their durability and ease of placement. However, esthetic limitations and growing parental demand for natural-looking restorations have led to increased use of prefabricated zirconia crowns (PZCs)&#x0200b; [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. These crowns provide superior esthetics, high fracture resistance, and biocompatibility, making them a favorable alternative in pediatric restorative dentistry&#x0200b; [<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The longevity and retention of PZCs depend not only on crown adaptation but also on the mechanical interaction with the underlying luting cement. Various cements - including zinc phosphate (ZPC), zinc polycarboxylate (PC), glass ionomer cement (GIC), and resin cements(RC) - are used to lute PZCs, each with unique physical properties influencing stress distribution &#x0200b;[<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Improper stress distribution may lead to microfractures in the crown or dislodgement over time, compromising clinical success.</p><p>Finite element analysis (FEA) is a well-established computational method that allows simulation of mechanical behavior within complex dental structures, enabling assessment of stress and strain patterns in a highly controlled virtual environment&#x0200b; [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Previous FEA studies have evaluated crown and cement interactions in adult teeth; however, biomechanical data specific to primary molars restored with zirconia crowns remain limited.</p><p>Given the increasing popularity of PZCs and the variability in cement selection, it is essential to understand how different luting agents affect stress distribution at the crown-tooth interface in pediatric applications. Unlike prior studies that focused on molars or cement thickness, our study compares four distinct cements using a validated pediatric crown model. This study aims to evaluate and compare the stress distribution patterns in pediatric zirconia crowns luted with four different cements using finite element analysis. The insights gained from this study may assist clinicians in selecting the most biomechanically favorable luting cement for prefabricated zirconia crowns in pediatric patients, thereby potentially enhancing crown longevity and minimizing structural failures.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Ethical approval</p><p>The study received ethical clearance from the Institutional Ethical Committee (IEC), reference number CSP/22/SEP/116/498.</p><p>Finite element model development</p><p>A three-dimensional model of a primary mandibular second molar was reconstructed using high-resolution cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) data (Planmeca ProMax 3D, Planmeca, Helsinki, Finland), previously validated in a pediatric molar finite element analysis study (Kirthiga et al., 2018) [<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The scan was converted to a stereolithographic (STL) file and segmented using MIMICS 19.0 (Materialise, Leuven, Belgium), followed by anatomical reconstruction in SolidWorks 2021 (Dassault Syst&#x000e8;mes, Cedex, France), isolating enamel, dentin, pulp, periodontal ligament (PDL), cortical bone, and cancellous bone layers. Tooth dimensions were consistent with average morphometric values of mandibular second primary molars reported in pediatric anatomical datasets. To simulate a full-coverage restoration, standardized tooth reduction of 1.5 mm occlusally and 0.8 mm axially was performed virtually, followed by adaptation of a prefabricated zirconia crown (NuSmile ZR, NuSmile Ltd., Houston, TX, USA) modeled with a uniform wall thickness of 0.78 mm using Abaqus 6.14 (Dassault Syst&#x000e8;mes, Cedex, France). A uniform cement layer of 50 &#x000b5;m thickness was applied between the tooth and crown interfaces in all models [<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>-<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].

This study focused exclusively on the primary mandibular second molar, as it plays a pivotal role in mastication, space maintenance, and arch integrity during the mixed dentition phase. Moreover, due to its anatomical similarity to permanent molars and frequent indication for full-coverage restorations, it provides a relevant and clinically significant model for evaluating stress behavior in pediatric zirconia crowns. The results clearly indicated that zinc polycarboxylate cement (PC) consistently transmitted the lowest von Mises stress across all evaluated dental structures, whereas zinc phosphate cement (ZPC) demonstrated the highest stress concentration, particularly within the cement layer and inner crown interface.</p><p>Our findings align with the conclusions reported by Waly et al. (2021), who observed that stiffer cements like ZPC elevated stress levels within the tooth structure while reducing deformation in the crown itself&#x0200b; [<xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. This trade-off is critical in pediatric dentistry, where preserving dentin and minimizing pulpal trauma is a priority. The observed minimal stress in pulp tissues across all cement types in our study reinforces previous claims that PZCs, when properly adapted, are biomechanically safe for pediatric use.</p><p>Interestingly, the present study further supports the findings of Chung et al. (2022), who demonstrated through FEA that cement type had a greater influence than cement thickness on overall stress distribution in PZCs&#x0200b; [<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Our results also confirm their assertion that resin-based cements, while offering high retention, may exhibit higher stress values than polycarboxylate alternatives. In our model, resin cements showed intermediate stress levels, suggesting a balance between strength and flexibility.</p><p>The performance of zinc polycarboxylate cement (PC) in minimizing stress transfer could be attributed to its modulus of elasticity, which more closely resembles that of natural dentin. This allows for more favorable stress dispersion under occlusal loads. This observation is supported by the systematic review conducted by Alzanbaqi et al. (2022), which noted the biocompatibility and marginal integrity benefits of tooth-colored restorations like PZCs when paired with appropriate cements&#x0200b; [<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>From a clinical perspective, these findings reinforce the recommendation to individualize cement selection based on the biomechanical needs of the restored tooth. While resin cements are widely advocated for their bonding capabilities and retention strength, zinc polycarboxylate may offer a biomechanical advantage, particularly in young children with minimal remaining dentin in high-stress areas.</p><p>Moreover, Iampinitkul et al. (2024) highlighted that microleakage and long-term cement degradation remain critical concerns for PZCs, especially due to their prefabricated, non-customizable design&#x0200b; [<xref rid="REF14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Our study, while not directly evaluating microleakage, indirectly supports this concern by showing that higher stress values in the cement layer (e.g., ZPC group) may correlate with higher risks of marginal failure.</p><p>Strength of this study</p><p>This study presents several noteworthy strengths. First, it utilizes a validated three-dimensional finite element model of the primary mandibular second molar, which closely mimics the anatomical complexity and clinical conditions encountered in pediatric restorative dentistry. Second, by evaluating four commonly used luting cements, zinc phosphate, zinc polycarboxylate, resin, and glass ionomer, the study offers a comprehensive comparison of stress behavior under clinically relevant masticatory loads. The simulation includes vertical, oblique, and lateral forces, reflecting real-world functional conditions in mixed dentition. Additionally, the methodology incorporates precise material properties, standardized cement thickness, and rigorous mesh validation to enhance the accuracy and reproducibility of the results. By focusing on von Mises stress distribution across various tooth structures, the findings provide meaningful biomechanical insights that can aid clinicians in selecting luting agents for zirconia crown placement in pediatric patients.</p><p>Limitations</p><p>However, the study also has notable limitations. The simulation assumes that all materials are homogeneous, isotropic, and linearly elastic, which does not fully represent the complexity and variability of biological tissues. Real-world variations in tooth anatomy, cement layer thickness, and dynamic occlusal forces are not incorporated, limiting direct clinical generalizability. Furthermore, the FEA results have not been validated through experimental or clinical studies, which may reduce the external validity of the findings. Lastly, while masticatory loading conditions were modeled in three directions, the boundary conditions may not fully mimic the range of forces encountered in pediatric mastication, warranting cautious interpretation of the results.</p><p>Future directions</p><p>Further in vitro and clinical studies should explore the long-term performance of these cements, including microleakage analysis over time, retention under cyclic loading, and thermocycling. PZC failure modes across different cement types. Additionally, incorporating CAD/Computer Aided Manufacturing (CAM)-based custom zirconia crowns, as suggested in recent literature, may help address adaptation variability and further optimize stress distribution&#x0200b;.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Within the limitations of this finite element study, zinc polycarboxylate cement exhibited the most favorable stress distribution pattern, transmitting lower stresses to the tooth structure compared to other luting agents. In contrast, zinc phosphate cement consistently demonstrated higher von Mises stress concentrations, particularly within the cement and inner crown layers. These findings suggest that the choice of luting cement may influence the biomechanical behavior of prefabricated zirconia crowns in pediatric applications. However, as this study is based on computational modeling using idealized, isotropic material properties and static loading conditions, the results should be interpreted as predictive simulations rather than definitive clinical outcomes. Further in vitro or clinical validation is warranted to substantiate these findings and guide evidence-based material selection in pediatric restorative dentistry.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Mr. Ramkumar Murugan, CAE specialist, for helping us with the finite element model set up and analysis.
