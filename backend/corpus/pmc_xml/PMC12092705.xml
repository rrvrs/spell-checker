This study investigates alkaline treatment to improve the acoustic and thermal behavior of bagasse fibers for sustainable insulation applications. Chemical modification through alkaline treatment was performed using sodium hydroxide at concentrations of 1&#x02013;4% and immersion times ranging from 2 to 24&#x000a0;h. Experimental designs were based on a factorial approach, and the data were analyzed using Design Expert software (version 11). Additionally, after conducting the experiments, analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to develop models describing the relationships between the investigated parameters and response variables to predict optimal conditions. The results indicated that the concentration of sodium hydroxide and immersion time significantly influenced the fiber structure and its sound absorption coefficient. Specifically, a 3% concentration and 8-hour immersion time improved the sound absorption coefficient, whereas concentrations above 4% caused fiber deformation due to excessive reaction. Additionally, the peak sound absorption was observed in the frequency range of 1000 to 2000&#x000a0;Hz. The impact of alkaline treatment on thermal conductivity was minimal, with values ranging from 0.091 to 0.127&#x000a0;W/(m<sup>2</sup>&#x000a0;K). Although the reference value for effective thermal insulators is typically considered to be 0.065&#x000a0;W/(m<sup>2</sup>&#x000a0;K), and the measured values for treated bagasse were higher than this threshold, they remain too small to qualify bagasse as a strong thermal insulator. However, alkaline treatment increased the Sound Absorption Average (SAA) by 94.11% at low frequencies, 18.44% at mid frequencies, and 35.3% at high frequencies. Considering the economic and environmental advantages of these fibers and their growing application in polymer composites, this optimized process serves as an efficient method to enhance the compatibility of natural fibers with polymer matrices and improve the acoustic and mechanical properties of building composites.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Bagasse fibers</kwd><kwd>Chemical modification</kwd><kwd>Sodium hydroxide</kwd><kwd>Sound absorption coefficient</kwd><kwd>Thermal insulation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Environmental sciences</kwd><kwd>Planetary science</kwd><kwd>Health occupations</kwd><kwd>Engineering</kwd><kwd>Materials science</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Gonabad University of Medical Sciences</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Zanjan University of Medical Sciences</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer Nature Limited 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">In recent decades, the increase in awareness about sustainable development and environmental protection has brought attention to the use of renewable resources and agricultural waste as sustainable alternatives to synthetic materials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Natural fibers, due to their unique properties and easy accessibility, have gained special attention in various industries, including the construction industry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Incorporating plantain peel and ramie-luffa fibers into bio-based composites has shown notable improvements in tensile strength, water resistance, and biodegradability during storage. These findings support the importance of fiber selection and treatment, which this study extends by optimizing the acoustic and thermal performance of alkali-treated bagasse fibers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Chemical surface treatments have been shown to significantly improve the performance of natural fibers. Alkaline&#x02013;silane modification has enhanced the thermal stability of Hibiscus fibers, while liquid smoke treatment improved the tensile strength and crystallinity of Sansevieria fibers. These support the potential of using NaOH-treated bagasse, as investigated in this study, for thermal and acoustic applications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. One of the agricultural wastes with high potential is bagasse, a byproduct of sugarcane processing. This material, rich in cellulose and lignin, is considered an ideal option for producing sustainable sound and thermal insulators<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Recent studies demonstrate that natural fibers can be effectively transformed into eco-friendly acoustic and thermal insulation materials. These materials exhibit excellent sound absorption and insulation properties, with optimized density and thickness enhancing their performance as validated by advanced predictive models. Such advancements not only mitigate noise pollution and improve energy efficiency but also promote the sustainable use of renewable resources in modern construction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. The chemical processing and modification of bagasse, especially through alkaline methods, can enhance its properties and enable its use in diverse applications in the construction industry. Alkali&#x02013;silane treatment of waru bark fibers has shown significant improvements in crystallinity (63.02%) and tensile strength (243.94&#x000a0;MPa), reinforcing their potential in polymer composites&#x02014;an approach that aligns with the NaOH-based treatment explored in this study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Nowadays, the industrialization of societies has caused the workforce to encounter equipment that can pose various health threats. One of these threats is noise pollution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> caused by the operation of machinery and equipment, which has become a problem in various spaces, particularly in-built environments such as buildings and industrial facilities. Sound, as a harmful physical factor, can have many negative impacts on individuals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. These impacts include hearing impairment, reduced concentration, increased stress, cardiovascular problems, and sleep disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. In industrial environments and residential and commercial buildings, in addition to existing sound sources, the reflection of sound from various surfaces can also increase the intensity of noise pollution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Prolonged exposure to noise, especially in noisy industrial environments, creates numerous problems that not only lead to hearing loss but can also increase accidents, absenteeism, and reduce the productivity of exposed workers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Research has shown that exposure to noise, particularly at specific frequencies, can have severe negative effects on the health and well-being of individuals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. These effects may include mental and cognitive disorders, reduced workplace productivity, and an increase in industrial accidents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">To mitigate these negative impacts, the use of various sound control materials and techniques, including sound absorbers, has gained significant importance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. To reduce noise pollution and manage workplace noise, various methods are available, including technical and engineering controls, administrative controls (such as exposure time management), training, and awareness-raising<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. One effective method for noise pollution control involves the use of porous materials and resonant-based sound absorbers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Porous materials are particularly effective at absorbing sound at mid-to-high frequencies. Due to their internal structure, which contains tiny pores, these materials can absorb acoustic energy through thermal and viscous losses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. The fundamental principle of these absorbers is internal resonance effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> which enable them to achieve good sound absorption coefficients at low frequencies, although their sound absorption frequency range is typically limited<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Porous materials, containing numerous pores, dissipate the energy of sound waves entering them through internal friction via thermal and viscous losses. Due to this principle, porous materials generally exhibit sound absorption across a broader frequency range<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Porous materials are classified into three categories based on their microscopic structure: cellular, fibrous, and granular<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. Currently, natural materials such as plant fibers, wood, jute, and hemp have emerged as suitable options for sound absorbers. Due to characteristics like low density, suitable mechanical properties, easy accessibility, and cost-effectiveness, these materials are gradually replacing synthetic materials such as fiberglass and polyester. Moreover, the use of these materials in buildings can help reduce environmental impacts, enhance the quality of living and working environments, and contribute to sustainability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup> .</p><p id="Par6">The use of natural and recycled materials is not only economically viable but also has significantly lower environmental impacts. Natural materials regulate indoor air humidity, and their distinctive aroma has a positive psychological effect on humans. An experiment conducted in a straw house in Germany, where several important features were systematically measured, demonstrated promising results for healthy living conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. Many of these materials are readily available as agricultural or industrial waste and can be easily utilized in the production of sound absorbers. In this regard, various studies have been conducted on the application of natural fibers such as straw, reeds, hemp, and even industrial waste like tea leaves and sugarcane bagasse.</p><p id="Par7">In recent years, natural fibers have been specifically considered as reliable materials for producing sound-absorbing panels at lower costs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup> These fibers often possess excellent sound and thermal insulation properties<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>, have no harmful effects on health, are widely available, and are frequently produced as waste from other manufacturing processes. Several studies have investigated the role of plants and leaves as sound absorbers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. With the growing interest in using natural and recycled materials, as well as by-products from other production processes, the use of green and sustainable products with low environmental impact in the construction industry is increasing.</p><p id="Par8">Given the wide variety of these materials across different countries, further research is needed to thoroughly examine their acoustic and thermal behavior. In Iran, due to the abundance of agricultural waste such as wool and sugarcane bagasse, these materials can serve as valuable resources for producing sound absorbers and thermal insulators.

Utilizing agricultural waste like bagasse not only reduces agricultural waste but also leads to the development of innovative materials for managing noise and thermal pollution.</p><p id="Par10">Natural sound absorbers, leveraging the physical and chemical properties of agricultural fibers, can help reduce sound reflections and improve acoustic quality in industrial and building environments. The chemical and mechanical modification of these materials, including through alkaline treatment methods, can enhance their sound absorption and thermal insulation properties. These methods not only improve material efficiency but also reduce dependency on non-renewable resources.</p><p id="Par11">The present study aims to evaluate and enhance the performance of modified bagasse fibers in producing sound absorbers and thermal insulators for building environments. This approach represents an effective step toward reducing environmental impacts, improving sustainability in the construction industry, and increasing the productivity of agricultural materials. By focusing on the potential of natural fibers, this research seeks to offer optimized solutions for utilizing renewable resources in managing noise and thermal pollution. Unlike previous studies that have typically addressed either the acoustic or thermal characteristics of natural fibers separately, this study presents a combined experimental and statistical approach to evaluate both properties simultaneously in sodium hydroxide-treated bagasse fibers.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methodology</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Sample preparation</title><p id="Par12">Bagasse, a dry fibrous residue obtained from the sugarcane refining process, is extracted in the form of small, compressed chips. In this study, the bagasse used was sourced from the Sugarcane Cultivation and Development Research Center in Khuzestan Province, Iran, and transferred to the laboratory approximately three months after harvest, following an initial natural drying period. Bagasse was first converted into fine particles in two stages using a shredder and then dried at ambient temperature for 15 days. Afterward, the shredded bagasse was sieved to separate wood fragments of suitable dimensions, which were stored in plastic bags to prevent moisture absorption.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Chemical treatment procedure</title><p id="Par13">In this study, an alkaline treatment method using sodium hydroxide (manufactured by Merck, Germany) was employed as one of the common chemical modification techniques for natural bagasse fibers. The experiments were designed following a factorial design approach based on two main parameters: sodium hydroxide concentration and immersion time. The experiments were conducted on 50gram bagasse samples with initial sodium hydroxide concentrations of 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10% and immersion times of 2, 8, 13, 18, and 24&#x000a0;h. Laboratory tests revealed that using a combination of sodium hydroxide and PVA adhesive (manufactured by Sigma company) at concentrations above 4% resulted in the destruction of the bagasse fiber structure, making it impossible to prepare suitable samples. To prepare sodium hydroxide solutions at concentrations of 1, 2, 3, and 4%, the precise amount of sodium hydroxide was weighed using a precise Prezisa scale and the SMA-FR 262 model from Switzerland, and then dissolved in 1&#x000a0;L of distilled water; to ensure complete dissolution, the solution was stirred with a magnetic stirrer at 80&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for 3&#x000a0;h. Subsequently, the 50gram bagasse samples were immersed in the specified solutions for the designated times, and after the immersion period, the bagasse was filtered and dried at ambient temperature for 20 days. Finally, to produce samples suitable for acoustic and thermal testing, the treated bagasse was bonded with polyvinyl alcohol adhesive into molds of specified dimensions, and after 10 days of final drying at ambient temperature, the samples were sent to the acoustic and thermal laboratory.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Composite fabrication</title><p id="Par14">The required amount of bagasse for each specimen was calculated based on the target density and thickness, and the fiber&#x02013;binder mixture was thoroughly blended before molding.

The samples were then dried at room temperature (25&#x02013;30&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C) and transferred to the laboratory for further testing of their acoustic and thermal properties. A 6 wt% solution of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) was used as a binder relative to the dry mass of bagasse.</p><p id="Par15">

This process disrupts hydrogen bonds in the fiber network, removing lignin, waxes, and oils from the outer surface of the cell wall, ionizing the hydroxyl groups in the fibers, and polymerizing cellulose into alkoxide. The results of this study showed that sodium hydroxide alters the structure of bagasse fibers, and there is a direct relationship between NaOH concentration and fiber diameter. According to studies, alkaline treatment with sodium hydroxide reduces fiber diameter, improves adhesion and fungal resistance, and enhances the quality of the fibers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par48">According to the results of this study, the peak sound absorption of bagasse composites occurs in the frequency range of 1000 to 2000&#x000a0;Hz. The findings of Somaei et al. showed that alkaline treatment, by increasing surface roughness, enhances the amount of cellulose on the fiber surface and improves fiber interlocking. This increases the number of possible reaction sites, which, in turn, enhances the mechanical properties of lignocellulosic natural fibers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par49">As mentioned earlier, removing materials from the fiber surface reduces fiber diameter. A smaller fiber diameter provides a larger contact surface and a more tortuous path, which increases airflow resistance through the composites made of natural fibers. This, in turn, enhances sound absorption in the low-frequency range. Increased resistance to airflow also dissipates sound energy through friction between sound waves and air molecules, further improving sound absorption at low frequencies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. Accordingly, the results of the present study are consistent with those of the study by Somaii et al.</p><p id="Par50">The results indicate that NaOH solution at concentrations above 4% destroys the parenchyma tissue of bagasse. Parenchyma is the simplest plant tissue, characterized by thin and uniform cell walls. Parenchyma tissues contain cells with thin, permeable primary cell walls that are metabolically active. Parenchyma is defined by its thin, uniform primary cell walls and the absence of secondary cell walls, whereas sclerenchyma is distinguished by thick secondary cell walls within the primary cell walls. Due to this feature, sclerenchyma cells are easily identifiable. Sclerenchyma tissues have thick cell walls that provide structural rigidity and elasticity to plants.</p><p id="Par51">The primary difference between parenchyma and sclerenchyma is the presence of secondary cell walls in sclerenchyma cells. The primary cell wall, due to its permeability, allows small molecules to enter the cell and facilitates the extraction of chemically modified substances from the cell body. These cells are often referred to as chlorenchyma because of their ability to perform photosynthesis, a process in which water, carbon dioxide, and light easily enter the cells to produce sugars that plants use as an energy source. Additionally, parenchyma cells are adapted for storing specific substances in plants.</p><p id="Par52">Sclerenchyma cells produce lignin, a substance that hardens the matrix of the cell wall, resulting in a highly rigid secondary wall that resists decay. Lignin prevents water from penetrating the cell walls, which can lead to cell death if the entire cell is covered. To prevent this, the secondary cell walls of sclerenchyma have small tunnels connecting neighboring cells. These pits act as pathways for water and nutrients.</p><p id="Par53">The chemical structure and morphology of bagasse and sugarcane fibers are different. Fibers have thick cell walls that contribute to tissue strength, whereas parenchyma cells are very small and have extremely thin walls, which reduce their mechanical strength.

However, further increases in sodium hydroxide concentration and immersion time reduce the sound absorption coefficient, and at concentrations above 4%, producing an absorbent material becomes infeasible, as the composite takes on a doughy consistency.</p><p id="Par55">This phenomenon might be due to the reaction between PVA adhesive and sodium hydroxide, which destroys the fibrous structure of bagasse. Therefore, the SAC index reaches its maximum when the sodium hydroxide concentration is around 3% and the immersion time is approximately 7.5&#x000a0;h. This result aligns with the findings of the study conducted by Somaii et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par56">As demonstrated in this study, chemical modification (alkaline treatment) using sodium hydroxide increases the sound absorption coefficient of natural composites made from bagasse fibers within the one-third octave band frequency range.

The study also revealed that increasing the thickness of the absorbent material enhances the sound absorption coefficient. This increase in sound absorption may result from the extended dissipation process through thermal conductivity and viscosity interactions between air and the absorbent materials within the composite, which is amplified by the greater thickness of the composite.</p><p id="Par57">Additionally, the findings showed that as the thickness of the absorbent material increases, the peak frequency shifts to lower frequencies.

The findings of this study emphasize the potential of NaOH-treated bagasse fibers in residential, commercial, and industrial environments, where their lightweight nature, affordability, and eco-friendly properties can be beneficial.

In industrial environments, bagasse-based composites can function as acoustic panels for noise control in manufacturing plants and factories. Thermal insulation remains limited but could improve by combining bagasse with foams, multilayer systems, or other bio-based reinforcements.

Additionally, due to the reduction in sound absorption coefficients at immersion times exceeding 8&#x000a0;h, it is advisable to avoid immersing fibers in sodium hydroxide solutions for durations longer than this in subsequent research.</p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#x02019;s note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><p>All authors contributed to the conception and design of the study.
