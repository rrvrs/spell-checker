Introduction</title><p>Diphtheriae, a once-common, potentially fatal infection of the upper respiratory, is usually caused by <italic toggle="yes">Corynebacterium diphtheriae</italic> (<italic toggle="yes">C diphtheriae</italic>). The symptoms of systemic infection caused by diphtheria toxin are more complex. Its forms include skin and invasive infections.<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup> The causative agent of diphtheria is <italic toggle="yes">C diphtheriae</italic>, which belongs to the phylum Actinobacteria. The tox gene is carried by lysogenized corynephages encoding diphtheria toxin located within the chromosome of some <italic toggle="yes">C diphtheriae</italic> strains.<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup> However, there is little research on the microevolutionary dynamics between tox-positive and tox-negative strains. <italic toggle="yes">C diphtheriae</italic> has a high genetic diversity and differences in its pathogenic properties. Although 4 major biovars are classified, including Mitis, Gravis, Intermedius and Belfanti, their phylogenetic relationship is unclear.<sup>[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup></p><p>Because <italic toggle="yes">C diphtheriae</italic> spreads among susceptible populations, mortality is high in unvaccinated young children. Although vaccines against <italic toggle="yes">C diphtheriae</italic> have existed for a long time and infants can be combined with other vaccines, such as Diphtheria-Tetanus-Pertussis vaccine, sporadic cases or small diphtheria outbreaks are inevitable, especially in areas with low or no vaccine coverage.<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup> Typical diphtheria is often caused by strains producing diphtheria toxin. Nontoxigenic <italic toggle="yes">C diphtheriae</italic> strains can be recovered from a variety of infections, including respiratory infections, skin infections, and bacteremia. Recently, the <italic toggle="yes">C diphtheriae</italic> biovar Belfanti isolate was considered to represent a novel species named <italic toggle="yes">C belfantii</italic>.<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup> Different <italic toggle="yes">C diphtheriae</italic> can be distinguished by means of biochemical characteristics. Whereas biovars Mitis and Gravis contain the diphtheria toxin gene, biovar Belfanti is rarely described as toxigenic, and intermediate bacteria is rarely isolated.<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup> The biovar Belfanti is not easy to be found, and there are few pathogenic reports. Transmission in the population is easily overlooked.</p><p>The aim of the study is to analyze the possible clinical symptoms and genomic characteristics of the biovar Belfanti through this case combined with whole genomic technology to provide a reference for subsequent laboratory diagnosis and preventive treatment research.</p></sec><sec sec-type="cases"><title>2.

Discussion and conclusions</title><p>In this case, a patient with rheumatoid arthritis had cough without obvious inducement, and computed tomography indicated pulmonary interstitial fibrosis. In order to identify whether fibrosis was caused by autoimmune system disease or other infectious factors, Pathogenic Metagenomic Detection was performed for the patient. Among them, the non-toxigenic <italic toggle="yes">C diphtheriae</italic> biovar Belfanti strain was isolated. In the culture identification experiment, the mass spectrum of this bacterium was <italic toggle="yes">P vulgaris</italic>, which was different from that of Pathogenic Metagenomic Detection. The reason may be that &#x02460; the biovar Belfanti is not capable of nitrate reduction, unlike the other strains of <italic toggle="yes">C. diphtheriae</italic><sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup>; &#x02461; <italic toggle="yes">P vulgaris</italic> has a growth advantage over <italic toggle="yes">C diphtheriae</italic>. During the verification of the PCR method, it was also found that this bacterium did not have common diphtheriae virulence genes, so there is the possibility of missing detection in the culture identification and PCR link. Because the bacterium is sensitive to penicillin, macrolides and other drugs, so it is difficult to be found and isolated. <italic toggle="yes">C diphtheriae</italic> was effectively inhibited after antibiotic treatment.<sup>[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup> In this case, pulmonary interstitial fibrosis was thought to be associated with autoimmune disease and was not associated with <italic toggle="yes">C diphtheriae</italic> infection. However, the detection of this case indicates the spread of the <italic toggle="yes">C diphtheriae</italic> biovar Belfanti strain in the Chinese population. Although there are no clear virulence genes and drug resistance genes, and the pathogenicity is not strong, the strain has high transposing activity and strong infectivity. However, the possibility of development into pathogenic strains cannot be ruled out and is worthy of attention.</p><p>Historically, the exotoxin produced by <italic toggle="yes">C diphtheriae</italic> has been recognized as the primary pathogenic factor in diphtheria, with toxigenic strains typically manifesting as gray-white pseudomembranes in the pharynx, larynx, and nasal cavity. However, recent studies increasingly report infections caused by non-toxigenic strains, which frequently present as bacteremia or endocarditis with high case-fatality rates. Concurrently, the isolation rate of non-toxigenic strains has shown an upward trend. Notably, in countries with high diphtheria vaccination coverage, infections attributable to non-toxigenic strains have become significantly more prevalent. In this case, the patient exhibited neither pseudomembranous lesions nor bacteremia, demonstrating a subclinical presentation with high potential for diagnostic oversight. Fortunately, the isolated strain exhibited attenuated virulence and limited invasive potential, resulting in no significant clinical harm to the patient.</p><p>During etiological diagnosis, given that <italic toggle="yes">C diphtheriae</italic> biovar Belfanti is nitrate reduction-negative and lacks virulence genes, it is recommended to integrate culture-based identification with molecular methods (e.g., PCR or sequencing) for comprehensive evaluation. Molecular diagnostic results should be prioritized to some extent, particularly for detecting virulence determinants. Molecular diagnostic results should be prioritized to some extent in clinical decision-making.</p></sec><sec><title>Author contributions</title><p><bold>Conceptualization:</bold> Huajie Xie, Wanlin Na, Youde Liu, Qin Jia, Wei Sun, Yanyan Wang, Yuan Liu.</p><p><bold>Data curation:</bold> Huajie Xie, Youde Liu, Qin Jia, Wei Sun, Yanyan Wang.</p><p><bold>Formal analysis:</bold> Wanlin Na.</p><p><bold>Funding acquisition:</bold> Kai Chang.</p><p><bold>Investigation:</bold> Kai Chang, Huajie Xie, Ming Liu.</p><p><bold>Methodology:</bold> Ming Liu.</p><p><bold>Writing &#x02013; original draft:</bold> Kai Chang.</p><p><bold>Writing &#x02013; review &#x00026; editing:</bold> Kai Chang, Yanyan Wang, Yuan Liu.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><fig id="s001" position="anchor"><media xlink:href="medi-104-e42467-s001.docx"/></fig></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>
