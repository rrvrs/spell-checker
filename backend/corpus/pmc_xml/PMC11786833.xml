The Real-SIRTCCA study retrospectively assessed the benefit of adding SIRT to chemotherapy in this setting within the French nationwide observational cohort ACABi-GERCOR-PRONOBIL.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Inclusion criteria were advanced iCCA with limited or no extrahepatic disease, treated with first-line gemcitabine plus platinum chemotherapy&#x000a0;+/- concurrent SIRT. All patients treated with chemotherapy and concurrent SIRT were included. To ensure groups&#x02019; similarity, a rigorous selection was applied to the chemo-only group, with exclusion of patients with liver involvement &#x0003e;50% and extrahepatic metastases. The primary outcome was progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary outcomes were overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR) and tumor resection rate. Propensity score and inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) propensity approaches were used to address confounding factors between groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Between July 2007 and December 2023, 277 patients met the Real-SIRTCCA inclusion criteria, with 88 in the chemo-SIRT group and 189 in chemo-only group.

An improvement of progression-free survival, overall survival, tumor response and secondary surgical resection rate was observed in favor of chemo-SIRT, before adjustment and after inverse probability of treatment weighting propensity score analyses. Even though prospective randomized data would be needed to confirm these findings, we believe that this study constitutes new evidence of the potential benefit of combining SIRT with chemotherapy. The safety and efficacy of this strategy whether as a bridge to intent-to-cure strategies or in a palliative setting, should encourage its adoption in a larger panel of clinical centers, or at very least, prompt clinicians to refer their patients to centers where SIRT is performed.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical trial number</title><p>NCT04935853.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical" id="abs0015"><title>Graphical abstract</title><p><fig id="undfig1" position="anchor"><alt-text id="alttext0010">Image 1</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="ga1"/></fig></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="author-highlights" id="abs0020"><title>Highlights:</title><p><list list-type="simple" id="ulist0010"><list-item id="u0010"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0010">SIRT is a local treatment option for unresectable locally advanced iCCA.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0015"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0015">Real-SIRTCCA retrospectively compares chemotherapy&#x000a0;+/- SIRT in iCCA within the ACABi/PRONOBIL cohort.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0020"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0020">In Real-SIRTCCA, SIRT leads to better outcomes with longer PFS and OS.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0025"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0025">SIRT intensification improves objective response rate and rates of secondary tumor resection.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0030"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0030">Adding SIRT to first-line chemotherapy is feasible for locally advanced iCCA.</p></list-item></list></p></abstract><kwd-group id="kwrds0010"><title>Keywords:</title><kwd>cholangiocarcinoma</kwd><kwd>biliary tract cancer</kwd><kwd>SIRT</kwd><kwd>radioembolization</kwd><kwd>CISGEM</kwd><kwd>GEMOX</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0035">Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA) is the second most common malignant primary liver cancer, accounting for 10-15% of cases.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> Its incidence is rising worldwide, particularly in Western countries, due to the increasing prevalence of chronic liver diseases.

In the chemo-SIRT group, all patients meeting the inclusion criteria and treated with chemotherapy and concurrent SIRT were included. Concurrent SIRT was defined as a procedure performed up to 2 months before starting chemotherapy, at the same time, or within a maximum of 2 months post-chemotherapy. Patients with SIRT performed between 2 and 6 months after chemotherapy were excluded to minimize confounding bias while cases with SIRT beyond 6 months after L1 could be included in the chemo-only group, as this might not represent an intent-to offer SIRT as first-line treatment.</p><p id="p0065">To limit bias from selecting patients with poorer prognosis, a more rigorous selection process was applied to the control group to ensure the inclusion of patients who would be theoretically good candidates for SIRT. Thus, in the chemo-only group, patients with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status greater than 1, liver involvement exceeding 50%, or the presence of extrahepatic metastatic spread beyond distant lymph nodes were excluded. In contrast, these criteria did not exclude patients in the chemo-SIRT group, as the study aimed to evaluate the combination chemotherapy and SIRT in a real-life setting. Intra- and extrahepatic spread work-up comprised a contrast-enhanced thoraco-abdomino-pelvic CT scan with or without additional liver MRI and/or a PET scan.</p><p id="p0070">The study was conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice and the Declaration of Helsinki<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> and was registered on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrial.gov" id="intref0010">ClinicalTrial.gov</ext-link> (NCT04935853).</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><title>Outcomes</title><p id="p0075">The primary objective was to compare PFS between chemotherapy with SIRT and chemo-alone in the real-life setting. PFS was defined as the time between the initiation of first-line treatment (chemotherapy or SIRT, whichever was initiated first) and the date of disease progression or death, whichever occurred first. Patients alive without progression were censored at the date of their last follow-up. Secondary outcomes included OS, defined as the time between the initiation of first-line treatment and the date of death, the ORR, defined as the proportion of patients with complete or partial response as their best response during treatment according to RECIST 1.1 criteria, the secondary surgical resection rate, defined as the rate of surgeries performed after the initiation of first-line treatment, and safety, assessed according to NCI CTCAE v 5.0 criteria.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="p0080">Patient characteristics were described for the overall population with medians and interquartile ranges (Q1-Q3) for continuous variables, and frequencies and percentages for categorical variables. Baseline characteristics were compared between the chemo-SIRT and chemo-only groups with the Wilcoxon test for continuous variables and the chi-square test or Fisher&#x02019;s exact test for categorical variables. Follow-up was estimated with the reverse Kaplan-Meier method. PFS and OS were estimated with the Kaplan-Meier method, described with medians and 95% CIs. Association between groups and survivals was estimated with univariable Cox proportional hazards regression models, providing hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% CIs. The proportionality assumption in Cox regression models was tested using Schoenfeld residuals. For analyses where this assumption was violated, the difference in restricted mean survival between the treatment groups was estimated. Sensitivity analyses of PFS and OS were run in patients with early SIRT defined as a SIRT performed within 1 month before or after the first chemotherapy cycle. To finish, landmark analyses of OS at 3 and 6 months were run including patients still alive and followed at 3 and 6 months, respectively, after the initiation of the treatment. The ORR and the secondary surgical resection rates were compared according to SIRT administration with a Wilcoxon test. An univariable logistic regression model was used to estimate the probability of achieving a response (partial or complete) and of undergoing surgical resection. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% CIs were provided.</p><p id="p0085">A propensity score method was used to limit potential bias due to confounding parameters between chemo-SIRT and chemo-only patients for survival, ORR and resection rate outcomes. Univariable logistic regression was first used to model the probability of receiving SIRT and variables with <italic>a p</italic> value &#x0003c;0.1 were introduced into the multivariable model. The AUC and Hosmer&#x02013;Lemeshow test statistic were estimated to assess model fit. Two approaches using the propensity score were used. Firstly, the inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) method was applied in a Cox regression model to assess the association between treatment and survival, and in a logistic regression model to evaluate treatment response and surgical resection. Secondly, a 1:1 matching population was selected using the caliper method. Covariate balance was calculated using standardized differences before and after propensity score matching, and survival curves were estimated for the matched population.</p><p id="p0090">To identify other prognostic factors for survival, a Cox multivariable regression model was performed.

The addition of concurrent SIRT to first-line chemotherapy improved efficacy outcomes in patients with locally advanced or limited extrahepatic tumor burden. Univariate analysis showed a significant increase of mPFS for the chemo-SIRT group, which was confirmed by IPTW propensity score analysis (HR 0.55, <italic>p &#x0003c;</italic>0.0001). Although OS was not statistically significantly longer in the chemo-SIRT group before adjustment, the combination significantly improved this outcome after IPTW adjustment (HR 0.70, <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;= 0.0004). This benefit in OS was confirmed by landmark analyses at 3 and 6 months after IPTW (3-month HR 0.75, <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;= 0.005; 6-month HR 0.81, <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;= 0.05). Additionally, local tumor control and ORR were significantly better with chemo-SIRT (<italic>p &#x0003c;</italic>0.0001). These results reinforce the assumption that intrahepatic locoregional treatment through multi-modal strategies improve patient survival outcomes, likely due to better control of the liver tumor burden, which can impair prognosis.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> Furthermore, the improved tumor response suggests that chemo-SIRT may help downstage patients and make them eligible for more aggressive treatments, such as intent-to-cure surgery, as evidenced by the significant higher rate of secondary tumor resection or liver transplantation in the chemo-SIRT group (18.7% <italic>vs.</italic> 8.8%) before and after adjustment. Besides, the safety profile of the combination was comparable, with both groups receiving a median of six chemotherapy cycles and no additional toxicity related to SIRT.</p><p id="p0150">To date, there are only retrospective or non-randomized data suggesting the potential benefit of hepatic intra-arterial strategies for iCCA. A large meta-analysis, which included 1,232 patients treated with SIRT from 27 non-controlled, retrospective cohorts, reported mPFS and mOS of 7.8 and 14.1 months, respectively. These outcomes did not differ from survival rates in patients with locally advanced iCCA who did not have access to SIRT.<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> However, this meta-analysis noted considerable heterogeneity in technique, systemic therapies, and the lack of systematic personalized dosimetry. Although only 63 patients from four different cohorts received concurrent chemotherapy with SIRT, pooled analyses of all intra-arterial treatments suggested a greater benefit in OS, PFS, and response rate when these procedures were performed combined with first-line systemic therapy.<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> The only randomized phase III trial to date that evaluated SIRT in iCCA is SIRCCA (NCT02807181), which compared SIRT followed by CISGEM to CISGEM alone. Nonetheless, this trial was stopped prematurely due to insufficient recruitment rate, and no results have been reported yet. The single-arm phase II MISPHEC trial provided significant insights into the efficacy of the chemo-SIRT combination for iCCA. This study showed potential benefits for patients with locally advanced iCCA, with a 3-month ORR (primary outcome) of 39% (95% CI 26%-53%), mPFS of 14 months (95% CI 8-17 months), and mOS of 22 months (95% CI 14-52 months).

This meta-analysis showed that combining first-line chemotherapy with SIRT significantly improved PFS (8.4 <italic>vs.</italic> 4.3 months; HR 0.52 95% CI 0.31-0.89, <italic>p &#x0003c;</italic>0.001) and OS (21.7 vs 15.9 months; HR 0.59 95% CI 0.34-0.99, <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;= 0.049) compared to chemo-alone.<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> This pooled analysis was the first study to demonstrate the benefit of the combination over systemic therapy alone. However, due to the scarcity of prospective data specific to locally advanced iCCA, the results were based on a limited number of patients (n&#x000a0;= 84), with selection biases in the control arm potentially arising from the ineligibility of patients for SIRT. Furthermore, none of these trials offered a direct, face-to-face comparison of the two strategies.<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> Our study confirmed these findings in a larger cohort of patients treated in a real-life setting across France. Nevertheless, due to its retrospective nature, some limitations remain, such as selection biases between the two treatment groups. These biases stem from the challenge of ensuring that control patients would have been eligible for SIRT, which requires a systemic pre-SIRT work-up phase, combining arteriography and dosimetry studies. To limit these biases, we implemented a robust selection strategy for the control group, systematically excluding patients with an ECOG performance status &#x0003e;1, visceral extrahepatic spread, or liver involvement &#x0003e;50% as these do not align with typical SIRT candidates. Patients with missing data related to these criteria were also excluded. In the chemo-SIRT group, the eligibility criteria were less strict, in accordance with MISPHEC&#x02019;s criteria,<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> to allow a real-life assessment of SIRT outcomes based on routine care practice from participating centers. This differential selection may have let to the inclusion of more advanced cases, such as those with liver tumor involvement &#x0003e;50% or limited extrahepatic visceral metastases, as well as more underlying cirrhosis in the chemo-SIRT group (27.3% <italic>vs.</italic> 12.8%). The overrepresentation of cirrhosis in the chemo-SIRT group might also be explained by the fact that hepatocellular insufficiency and/or portal hypertension made locoregional therapies combined with chemotherapy preferable to upfront major surgery, leading to a higher proportion of potentially resectable disease with cirrhosis. The groups were comparable in terms of prognostic markers such as lymph-node extension, multifocal, bilobar disease, and macrovascular invasion, all of which could influence intrahepatic treatments. Moreover, the same proportion of centro-hepatic tumors was observed in the two groups even though this type of disease might favor the chemo-SIRT strategy. Besides, ECOG performance status of 0 was significantly more frequent in the chemo-SIRT group, which might potentially affect the comparability of groups before adjustment. Since SIRT is routinely performed in only a few expert centers in France and is not yet a standard treatment, it was unlikely that control patients were those initially considered for SIRT but later deemed ineligible. Additionally, most control patients were from centers that did not perform SIRT or were treated before SIRT reimbursement began in&#x000a0;2018.</p><p id="p0155">As Real-SIRTCCA is a real-life observational study, there was potential heterogeneity in treatment schedules. First, regarding systemic therapy, CISGEM was used more in the chemo-SIRT group (76.1 <italic>vs.</italic> 57.1% of patients). GEMOX was an alternative in the first-line setting<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> before the validation of FOLFOX (folinic acid, fluorouracil and oxaliplatin) in the second-line setting in 2020.<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> Although no differences in the inclusion period were observed between groups (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Fig.&#x000a0;S7</xref>), CISGEM might have been more often preferred in the chemo-SIRT group due to the influence of the MISPHEC French trial, which started in 2013 and was published in 2020.<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> The low number of patients receiving CISGEM-durvalumab, due to its recent availability in France (November 2022), did not allow for statistical comparison. Moreover, the SIRT procedure was not standardized, and there was no systematic personalized dosimetry, which might have decreased the efficacy of SIRT due to an insufficient dose delivered to the tumor, potentially affecting its safety. Indeed, the median dose delivered to the tumor in Real-SIRTCCA was lower to that in MISPHEC (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Table&#x000a0;S1</xref>). The timing between the initiation of chemotherapy and SIRT was also not standardized, but with a median of 20.1 days, it was close to the MISPHEC schedule, where SIRT was performed during the first CISGEM cycle. Additionally, 75% of patients in Real-SIRTCCA had SIRT within the first 3 months of chemotherapy, which is pragmatic, as SIRT organization usually takes place during the first months of chemotherapy. This also presents a limitation, as some patients might have had their first computed tomography scan assessment under chemotherapy before SIRT, potentially modifying their treatment strategy and compromising the similarity between groups due to retrospective selection. However, sensitivity analyses in the 50 patients receiving early SIRT defined as a SIRT within 1 month before or after the first chemotherapy cycle confirmed the benefit of the strategy with better survival outcomes. Another limitation due to the retrospective collection of some data, is the proportion of missing baseline biological characteristics, as well as the comparison of treatment safety, since adverse events are usually less well-documented in this type of cohort. Yet, no differences were observed among patients for whom these data were available. Finally, although it should not interfere with group comparability, cohorts such as PRONOBIL often suffer from reporting bias, with an overrepresentation of expert centers, making them less representative of the nationwide therapeutic landscape. Indeed, these findings need to be viewed in the context of the fact that SIRT requires sophisticated technique platforms and remains inaccessible to many patients, even in Western countries.</p><p id="p0160">To date, the use of SIRT in iCCA remains controversial as guidelines such as EASL-ILCA<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> consider it as an alternative to systemic therapy in unresectable diseases, while ESMO recommends it as a first-line treatment standard.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> However, AASLD considers it as a technique with insufficient data to be broadly recommended.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> Prospective randomized data are urgently needed to advance the field, but it is unlikely that such data will become available. Indeed, to properly assess SIRT benefit, a phase II or III randomized trial should be run comparing CISGEM plus immunotherapy with or without SIRT in non-resectable iCCA. Liver-only and oligometastatic diseases should be included and stratified with less strict inclusion criteria than in SIRCCA to ensure a sufficient recruitment and correspond to real-life need. However, such a trial should be international and would be complex to run due to the risk of drop-out after the SIRT work-up phase and the scarcity of the disease.</p><p id="p0165">The strengths of this cohort include its multicentric, ambispective character, supported by the PRODIGE intergroup, offering a nationwide overview of practices in iCCA treatment. This is the largest cohort to date of patients treated with the chemo-SIRT combination compared with control patients selected through a robust process. Given that Real-SIRTCCA demonstrated a great improvement in survival outcomes, tumor response and secondary tumor resection rates in favor of chemo-SIRT, we believe that SIRT should be considered for selected patients with locally advanced, unresectable iCCA who are eligible for first-line chemotherapy with CISGEM-immunotherapy and have limited or no extrahepatic tumor burden. The safety and potential efficacy of SIRT, combined with systemic chemotherapy, whether as a bridge to intent-to-cure strategies or in a palliative setting, should encourage the adoption of this therapeutic strategy in a larger panel of clinical centers, or at very least, prompt clinicians to refer their patients to centers where SIRT is performed.</p><p id="p0170">Real-SIRTCCA suggests that concurrent SIRT with standard first-line chemotherapy improves survival outcomes, with longer PFS and OS, as well as provides better ORRs and rates of secondary tumor resection, without additional toxicity in patients with unresectable iCCA who have limited or no extrahepatic tumor burden. Although these findings ideally require confirmation through prospective randomized trials, this study constitutes new evidence supporting the potential benefit of this strategy in selected patients.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>Abbreviations</title><p id="p0175">CISGEM, cisplatin-gemcitabine; ECOG, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group; GEMOX, gemcitabine-oxaliplatin; HR, hazard ratio; iCCA, intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma; IPTW, inverse probability of treatment weighting; OR, odds ratio; ORR, objective response rate; OS, overall survival; PFS, progression-free survival; SIRT, selective internal radiation therapy.</p></sec><sec id="sec9"><title>Financial support</title><p id="p0195">The GERCOR G-115 PRODIGE 83 ACABi-PRONOBIL study was supported by <funding-source id="gs1">GERCOR</funding-source> and the <funding-source id="gs2">ARCAD foundation (Aide et Recherche en Cancerologie Digestive)</funding-source> and funded by <funding-source id="gs3">ACABi (Association pour l'&#x000e9;tude des Cancers et Affections des voies Biliaires)</funding-source>.</p></sec><sec id="sec6"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p id="p0180">Study concept and design: NA, JH, DV, GR.
