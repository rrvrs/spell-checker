However, its concentrations can be substantially increased by anthropogenic activities, presenting considerable environmental challenges. One effective remediation strategy is soil bioremediation, which employs indigenous bacteria to mitigate contamination. This study aimed to identify Cd-resistant bacteria and assess their potential for bioremediating Cd-contaminated soil. Two Cd-resistant bacterial strains, designated C9 and C27, were isolated from Cd-contaminated soil at concentrations ranging from 100 to 500&#x0202f;mg/L. Morphological analysis and 16S rDNA sequencing identified both strains as <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic>. The strains&#x02019; capacity to adsorb and remove Cd from solutions was assessed, as well as their resistance to other heavy metals, including Zinc (Zn) and Thallium (Tl). Optimal Cd adsorption was observed at 36&#x0202f;h for strain C9 and at 48&#x0202f;h for strain C27, with maximum removal rates achieved at a Cd concentration of 70&#x0202f;&#x003bc;M. Both strains demonstrated substantial resistance to heavy metals in the order Zn&#x0202f;&#x0003e;&#x0202f;Cd&#x0202f;&#x0003e;&#x0202f;Tl on solid media. Additionally, they exhibited strong salt tolerance, starch hydrolysis, citrate utilization, and ammonia production capabilities. Notably, both strains produced significantly higher levels of siderophores compared to the model bacterium <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> 3,610, with strain C9 exhibiting superior siderophore production. This enhanced siderophore activity is hypothesized to contribute to Cd resistance. Collectively, these findings suggest that strains C9 and C27 have significant potential for the bioremediation of Cd-contaminated environments. Future research will focus on elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying heavy-metal resistance and optimizing their application in large-scale bioremediation strategies.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><italic>Bacillus cereus</italic></kwd><kwd>Cd resistance</kwd><kwd>bioremediation</kwd><kwd>siderophore production</kwd><kwd>heavy metal tolerance</kwd><kwd>Cd adsorption</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>The author(s) declare that financial support was received for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.

The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classifies Cd as a Group 1 carcinogen, associating it with an increased risk of prostate, kidney, and lung cancers, as well as chromosomal aberrations and other health issues (<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">Nogawa et al., 2022</xref>; <xref rid="ref51" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2022</xref>). <xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">Nishijo et al. (2004)</xref> conducted a prospective epidemiological survey on the population in Kakehashi, Japan, which is contaminated by Cd, for 15&#x0202f;years. The results found that individuals living in Cd-contaminated areas had a higher probability of death from malignant tumors compared to those living in non-Cd-contaminated areas. Industrial processes such as mining, smelting, electroplating, along with agricultural practices involving phosphate fertilizers and sewage sludge application, are the main sources of cadmium pollution in the environment (<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">Dong et al., 2022</xref>; <xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">Feng et al., 2022</xref>; <xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">Khan et al., 2022</xref>). The soil environmental issues triggered by Cd have progressively deepened, attracting considerable attention around the world (<xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">Shi et al., 2022</xref>). Therefore, the remediation of Cd-contaminated soil is urgent. Remediation methods for heavy metal-contaminated soil can be categorized into physical remediation, chemical remediation and microbial remediation techniques (<xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">Shuang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">Sajjad et al., 2024</xref>). Microbial remediation, an advanced remediation technology developed under the guidance of modern scientific and technological advancements, is distinguished by its extremely low cost, easy operation and non-pollution (<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">Sajjad et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">Dhaliwal et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">Peng et al., 2018</xref>). The persistent nature of cadmium, coupled with its inability to biodegrade, results in its retention in soil systems. Subsequently, plants uptake this toxic metal from contaminated soils, facilitating its entry and accumulation throughout the food chain (<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">Benavides et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Recently, the environmental pollution problem caused by Cd has gradually worsened (<xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">Shi et al., 2022</xref>). The vast majority of Cd intake in the human body is ingested through grains and vegetables (<xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">Sindhu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref rid="ref1008" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2022</xref>). Therefore, how to efficiently reduce the Cd content in soil has become a widespread concern. Currently, there have been numerous studies on the removal of Cd from Cd-polluted soil using microbial techniques. The remediation of heavy metal contamination through traditional approaches such as excavation, solidification, and chemical treatments presents significant challenges, including substantial financial costs, intensive labor requirements, and detrimental environmental consequences (<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">Sajjad et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">Dhaliwal et al., 2020</xref>). In response to these limitations, microbial-based remediation strategies have gained attention as an environmentally sustainable and economically viable alternative. <xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">Junpradit et al. (2021)</xref> found that strains capable of stimulating the growth and Cd uptake in <italic>C. comosum</italic> could remove Cd from aqueous solutions and survive in Cd-contaminated soil. <xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">Sch&#x000fc;tze et al. (2014)</xref> reported that microbial-assisted phytoremediation had a positive effect on phytoremediation performance of heavy metal-contaminated soils. The isolation and screening experiment conducted by <xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">Khanthom et al. (2021)</xref> showed that <italic>E. cloacae</italic> CdRR1 could promote shoot and root elongation. These beneficial microorganisms exhibit remarkable capabilities in heavy metal detoxification through multiple cellular processes, including adsorption, precipitation, and binding mechanisms. Additionally, they contribute to ecosystem health by facilitating plant growth through enhanced nutrient uptake and improved soil quality (<xref rid="ref48" ref-type="bibr">Verma and Kuila, 2019</xref>; <xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">Priyadarshini et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>However, the mechanism of Cd resistance in Cd-resistant strains and the mechanism for removing Cd from soil are less studied. It has been found that heavy metal-resistant microorganisms can reduce the bioavailability of Cd through adsorption, precipitation, and binding fixation to alleviate Cd contamination. They can also promote the uptake of Cd<sup>2+</sup> by hyperaccumulator plants through dissolving and activating processes to remove Cd from the soil (<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">Carlot et al., 2010</xref>). Consequently, isolating heavy metal-resistant bacteria in soil is important for advancing the application of microorganisms in environmental remediation and protection. Despite the promising potential of microbial remediation, significant research gaps persist in elucidating the fundamental mechanisms of microbial adaptation to cadmium stress and optimizing their implementation in practical soil restoration efforts. The <italic>Bacillus</italic> genus is renowned for its adaptability to extreme conditions and its capacity to resist and detoxify heavy metals (<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">Saxena et al., 2020</xref>). Species such as <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic> have been widely investigated for their bioremediation potential, attributed to their production of biofilms, siderophores, and extracellular enzymes, which improve metal adsorption and resistance (<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">Sajjad et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">Mishra et al., 2022</xref>; <xref rid="ref52" ref-type="bibr">Zada et al., 2024</xref>). Recent research highlights the crucial role of siderophores in alleviating metal toxicity by chelating metal ions and promoting their uptake or immobilization (<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">Roy et al., 2022</xref>). In addition, <xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al. (2019)</xref> discovered that the differential gene expression enriched in the KEGG pathway, which mitigates Cd toxicity, is associated with starch and sucrose metabolism. This metabolic process reduces Cd toxicity by enhancing the activity of antioxidant and transport systems. Sucrose and starch metabolism also activate the expression of related genes and the phosphorylation of proteins, thus alleviating the damage caused by Cd to plants (<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">He et al., 2021</xref>). Cd and citric acid can also prevent plant toxicity by forming thermodynamically assisted complexes. These complexes dissociate Cd from the weak bonds adsorbed in the soil particle structure, facilitating the removal of Cd from soil cation exchange sites (<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">Adeniji et al., 2010</xref>). Citric acid also plays a crucial role in reducing the effectiveness of Cd on plants. It forms chelates that prevent the transport of Cd<sup>2+</sup> in the cytoplasm, thereby impeding its entry into plant roots in the free form (<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">Mench and Martin, 1991</xref>; <xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>This study seeks to address the urgent need for effective cadmium (Cd) remediation by isolating and characterizing Cd-resistant bacterial strains from contaminated soils. Two strains, identified as <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic> (C9 and C27), were examined for their Cd adsorption and removal capabilities under different environmental conditions. Their resistance to other heavy metals, including zinc (Zn) and thallium (Tl), was also evaluated, alongside physiological traits such as salt tolerance, starch hydrolysis, citrate utilization, ammonia production, and siderophore production. By uncovering the factors underlying their Cd resistance, this research provides a basis for developing sustainable microbial remediation strategies and enhances understanding of <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic> as a potential solution to heavy metal contamination in agricultural and industrial soils.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec3"><label>2.1</label><title>Soil samples and experimental strains</title><p>Soil samples (collected in Lanmuchang, Guizhou) were collected from a mining area with Cadmium (Cd) contamination exceeding regulatory limits (100&#x02013;500&#x0202f;mg/L).

The genus <italic>Bacillus</italic> is one of the predominant bacterial genera found in soil, and several species within this genus have been reported in diverse ecological niches (<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">Saxena et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="ref53" ref-type="bibr">Zada et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">Qian et al., 2022</xref>). The findings align with previous research that highlights the potential of <italic>Bacillus</italic> species in remediating heavy metal contamination through multiple mechanisms, including adsorption, metal binding, and siderophore production (<xref rid="ref50" ref-type="bibr">Wr&#x000f3;bel et al., 2023</xref>; <xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">Alotaibi et al., 2021</xref>). The mechanisms underlying the cadmium resistance of these strains are multifaceted. <xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">Renu et al. (2022)</xref> reported that cell wall modifications also play a crucial role. The cell walls of <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic> strains C9 and C27 might be modified to bind cadmium ions more effectively, preventing them from entering the cytoplasm and causing damage.</p><p>Strains C9 and C27 achieved peak Cd adsorption at moderate concentrations (70&#x0202f;&#x003bc;M) and acidic pH (4.5), with strain C9 demonstrating a slightly higher adsorption efficiency than strain C27. These results are consistent with previous studies, which reported optimal Cd adsorption for <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic> in acidic conditions (pH 4.5&#x02013;5.0), due to the protonation of functional groups on the bacterial surface, enhancing electrostatic attraction to Cd ions (<xref rid="ref46" ref-type="bibr">Todorova et al., 2019</xref>). However, adsorption efficiency declined at higher concentrations (90&#x0202f;&#x003bc;M), possibly due to site saturation and competitive interactions, a phenomenon also noted by <xref rid="ref54" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al. (2017)</xref>. Compared to <italic>Bacillus megaterium</italic>, which reached a maximum Cd adsorption of 1.3&#x0202f;mg/g (<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">Fang et al., 2016</xref>), strain C9 exhibited higher adsorption (1.8&#x0202f;mg/g), highlighting its potential as a more effective bioremediator. The adsorption kinetics also mirrored findings in <italic>Bacillus thuringiensis</italic>, where extended incubation improved Cd removal rates up to 36&#x02013;48&#x0202f;h, as reported by <xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">&#x000c7;olak et al. (2011)</xref>. Moreover, the decline in adsorption efficiency could also be related to the cadmium resistance mechanisms of the strains. When cadmium concentrations are extremely high, the strain may activate additional detoxification mechanisms such as the production of stress proteins (<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">Khan et al., 2016</xref>). These proteins can bind to cadmium ions in the cytoplasm, reducing their free concentration and toxicity. This process, however, might divert the strain&#x02019;s resources from the adsorption process, leading to a decrease in adsorption efficiency. Both strains displayed a metal resistance hierarchy with Zn&#x0202f;&#x0003e;&#x0202f;Cd&#x0202f;&#x0003e;&#x0202f;Tl, and strain C9 showed remarkable Zn tolerance up to 1,600&#x0202f;mg/L, exceeding the Zn tolerance reported for <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic> (800&#x0202f;mg/L) (<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">Fang et al., 2016</xref>), indicating the strains&#x02019; resilience under heavy metal stress. Similar resistance patterns were observed in <italic>Bacillus</italic> sp., which adapted to multiple metals through mechanisms such as efflux systems and extracellular polymeric substances (EES) (<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">Nair et al., 1993</xref>). Microorganisms can rapidly interact with extracellular metals and play an important role in metal tolerance through metal dispersion, transport, immobilization, and transformation (<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">Lu et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>The effect of initial pH on cadmium uptake by strains C9 and C27 was studied within the pH range of 4.0 to 7.0. Cd uptake significantly decreased as pH increased, with strain C9&#x02019;s uptake falling from 3.31&#x0202f;mg/g to 0.11&#x0202f;mg/g and strain C27&#x02019;s from 2.02&#x0202f;mg/g to 0.08&#x0202f;mg/g. The maximum Cd removal for both strains was observed at pH 4.5, suggesting it as the optimal pH for biosorption. This trend is consistent with previous research showing the best metal removal efficiency in similar pH ranges (4.5&#x02013;5.0) (<xref rid="ref46" ref-type="bibr">Todorova et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="ref47" ref-type="bibr">Valero et al., 2003</xref>). The reduction in Cd uptake with increasing pH is attributed to the competition between metal ions and hydroxide ions (OH<sup>&#x02212;</sup>), which can result in the precipitation of metal hydroxides and decrease the availability of Cd. At lower pH, the increased concentration of hydrogen ions (H<sup>+</sup>) enhances metal ion binding, improving biosorption (<xref rid="ref49" ref-type="bibr">Wen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">Pan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">&#x000c7;olak et al., 2011</xref>). These results highlight the importance of optimizing pH for effective bioremediation applications, with strain C9 showing superior Cd removal at pH 4.5. Meanwhile, by integrating the previous studies, it was found that the strains had superior cadmium removal ability when the pH was 4&#x02013;5 (<xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S1</xref>) (<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">Chi et al., 2024</xref>; <xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">Sandrin and Maier, 2002</xref>). Further research is needed to explore the mechanisms behind this enhanced biosorption.</p><p>The impact of adsorption time on cadmium removal by strains C9 and C27 revealed a significant growth in Cd uptake with time, particularly for strain C27. Cd adsorption by strain C9 increased sharply initially, reaching a peak at 36&#x0202f;h, after which it stabilized, signifying that the adsorption equilibrium had been achieved. This pattern, with rapid initial adsorption followed by stabilization, is typical of biosorption processes, as seen in other studies like those on Pb<sup>2+</sup> by <italic>Bacillus</italic> species (<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">&#x000c7;olak et al., 2011</xref>). The initial rapid uptake is driven by the availability of binding sites, while the stabilization reflects the exhaustion of these sites and the attainment of equilibrium.</p><p>Strains C9 and C27 exhibited substantially greater siderophore production compared to the model bacterium <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> 3,610, implying that siderophores play a critical role in Cd resistance by complexing metal ions and diminishing their bioavailability (<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">Roy et al., 2022</xref>). Siderophore activity has been similarly implicated in heavy metal tolerance in <italic>Pseudomonas fluorescens</italic>, where increased siderophore production enhanced Cd adsorption efficiency (<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">Khan et al., 2020</xref>). The higher siderophore activity observed in strain C9 (57.96 SU) compared to strain C27 (45.72 SU) likely explains its superior Cd tolerance. Both strains displayed traits beneficial for plant growth and soil remediation, including salt tolerance, ammonia production, starch hydrolysis, and citrate utilization. Their capacity to thrive in saline conditions (up to 13% NaCl) indicates their suitability for remediating Cd-contaminated saline soils, a feature shared with <italic>Enterobacter</italic> sp., as noted by <xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">Pramanik et al. (2018)</xref>. Moreover, the ammonia production of strain C9 was significantly higher than strain C27 and <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>, indicating its potential to augment soil fertility in contaminated areas.</p><p>While many studies have reported Cd resistance and adsorption capabilities in <italic>Bacillus</italic> species, strains C9 and C27 exhibited unique advantages, including higher adsorption capacities, significant siderophore activity, and robust salt tolerance. For instance, <xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">Junpradit et al. (2021)</xref> reported Cd removal efficiencies of up to 24% in <italic>E. cloacae</italic>, which is lower than the maximum removal rate of 32.27% observed for strain C27. Moreover, <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic> strains studied by <xref rid="ref55" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al. (2024)</xref> showed comparable resistance to Cd but lacked the broad-spectrum resistance to Zn and Tl observed in the current study. These results highlight the competitive edge of strains C9 and C27 for application in bioremediation, particularly in multi-metal contaminated environments. Additionally, their physiological versatility makes them suitable for diverse ecological conditions, further expanding their practical utility.</p><p>The Cd tolerance observed in strains C9 and C27 can be attributed to a combination of factors, including surface adsorption, siderophore production, and biofilm formation. While biofilms provide a protective barrier against Cd toxicity, their contribution was less pronounced in these strains compared to siderophores. This aligns with findings by <xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">Hao et al. (2013)</xref>, who emphasized siderophores as a primary resistance mechanism in heavy metal-tolerant bacteria. The findings of this study underscore the potential of <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic> strains C9 and C27 for sustainable bioremediation of Cd-contaminated soils. Future research should focus on unraveling the genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying their metal resistance and optimizing their application in field-scale remediation projects. Incorporating these strains into phytoremediation systems could further enhance their efficacy by leveraging plant-microbe interactions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec33"><label>5</label><title>Conclusion</title><p>Strains C9 and C27, both of which exhibit high Cd resistance, were isolated. Based on the characterization of these strains and comparisons of their 16S rDNA sequences, both strains were identified as <italic>Bacillus cereus.</italic> The removal of Cd<sup>2+</sup> by strains C9 and C27 occurred at a Cd<sup>2+</sup> concentration of 70&#x0202f;&#x003bc;M, at 26.75 and 32.27%, respectively. The optimal initial concentrations for Cd<sup>2+</sup> adsorption were 70&#x0202f;&#x003bc;M and 90&#x0202f;&#x003bc;M. According to the growth curves based on adsorption time, the optimal adsorption time was 36&#x0202f;h for strain C9 and 48&#x0202f;h for strain C27.</p><p>In addition to Cd resistance, strains C9 and C27 also demonstrated tolerance to other metals such as Zn and Tl on solid media plates. The order of resistance of these strains to metals was found to be Zn&#x0202f;&#x0003e;&#x0202f;Cd&#x0202f;&#x0003e;&#x0202f;Tl. Both the Cd-resistant strains exhibited high salt tolerance, starch hydrolysis ability, citrate utilization, and ammonia production. Strains C9, C27, and model bacterium 3,610 were capable of producing IAA, biofilms, and iron carriers. However, strains C9 and C27 were more adept at producing iron carriers than the model bacterium 3,610, with C9 being even more proficient than C27. It was hypothesized that the production of iron carriers might be the reason for the Cd tolerance of strains C9 and C27.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="sec34"><title>Data availability statement</title><p>The datasets presented in this study can be found in online repositories.
