However, an effective vaccine remains undeveloped. SIRT1, a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+)-dependent enzyme, plays a key role in cellular metabolism, but its interaction with NAD+ during viral infections is not well understood. In this study, through a metabolomics analysis, we demonstrate that EV-D68 infection influences cellular metabolism. Additionally, we show that NAD+ inhibits EV-D68 infection both in vivo and in vitro. EV-D68 reduces cellular NAD+ levels by regulating the expression of enzymes involved in NAD+ consumption and synthesis. Moreover, the infection increases the expression of sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), which inhibits EV-D68 replication in turn. Mechanistically, SIRT1 suppresses EV-D68 5&#x02032;UTR-mediated translation, and the antiviral effect of SIRT1 on EV-D68 replication is enhanced by NAD+. Collectively, our findings highlight the critical role of NAD+ metabolism in EV-D68 infection and reveal the antiviral potential of SIRT1, providing valuable insights for the development of antiviral strategies.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>SIRT1</kwd><kwd>NAD+</kwd><kwd>EV-D68</kwd><kwd>replication</kwd><kwd>metabolism</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>National Natural Science Foundation of China</funding-source><award-id>31600139</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>Chongqing Science and Technology Commission</funding-source><award-id>cstc2016jcyjA0020</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>Yuzhong District Science and Technology Commission</funding-source><award-id>20190123</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>Chongqing Municipal Education Commission</funding-source><award-id>KJQN202300415</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>the Project of Undergraduates Innovating Experiment and the Project of Tutorial System of Excellent Medical Undergraduates</funding-source><award-id>202211</award-id><award-id>S202410631068</award-id><award-id>LTMCMTS202310</award-id><award-id>LTMCMTS202311</award-id><award-id>LTMCMTS202312</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>Chongqing Science and Technology Bureau</funding-source><award-id>2024NSCQ-KJFZMSX0114</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>Program for Youth Innovation in Future Medicine, Chongqing Medical University</funding-source><award-id>W0160</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31600139), the Chongqing Science and Technology Commission (cstc2016jcyjA0020), the Yuzhong District Science and Technology Commission (20190123), the Chongqing Municipal Education Commission (KJQN202300415), the Project of Undergraduates Innovating Experiment and the Project of Tutorial System of Excellent Medical Undergraduates in the Lab Teaching and Management Center of Chongqing Medical University (202211, S202410631068, LTMCMTS202310, LTMCMTS202311, and LTMCMTS202312), Chongqing Science and Technology Bureau (2024NSCQ-KJFZMSX0114), and Program for Youth Innovation in Future Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Grant: W0160.</funding-statement></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-viruses-17-00175"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Enterovirus D68 (EV-D68), a non-enveloped virus with a positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome, belongs to the <italic toggle="yes">Enterovirus</italic> genus within the <italic toggle="yes">Picornaviridae</italic> family. It primarily infects the upper respiratory tract, causing outbreaks of asthma-like respiratory diseases and clusters of cases of acute flaccid myelitis (AFM), a paralytic polio-like condition [<xref rid="B1-viruses-17-00175" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. These impacts underscore the importance of understanding the mechanisms underlying EV-D68&#x02019;s pathogenesis and developing effective therapeutic strategies.</p><p>Metabolomics is a powerful tool for assessing the global metabolic response of cells to external stimuli by detecting the levels of low-molecular-weight metabolites in real-time processes [<xref rid="B2-viruses-17-00175" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Viruses, which lack their own metabolic machinery and enzyme systems, are intracellular parasites that rely on host cells to replicate [<xref rid="B3-viruses-17-00175" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Various viruses, including HBV, HSV-1, DENV, and ZIKV, have been shown to hijack the host cell metabolism, reprogramming it to promote viral replication [<xref rid="B4-viruses-17-00175" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-viruses-17-00175" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-viruses-17-00175" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-viruses-17-00175" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. These metabolic alterations involve pathways such as glycolysis, lipid synthesis, nucleotide biosynthesis, and glutamine metabolism, which vary between different viruses. To effectively combat viral infections, cells must carefully manage the metabolic changes induced by the virus, though this process is not yet fully understood. Furthermore, targeting viral-induced metabolic pathways presents a novel strategy for reducing viral threats. For example, the use of difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) to inhibit polyamine biosynthesis has been shown to negatively affect the replication of various RNA viruses, including VSV, ZIKV, and EV-A71 [<xref rid="B8-viruses-17-00175" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Therefore, understanding how viral proteins interact with the host cell machinery to induce widespread metabolic alterations, and elucidating how cells mediate viral clearance, is crucial for elucidating the mechanisms of virus&#x02013;host interactions and providing new insights into the therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating viral activity.</p><p>Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) is a vital coenzyme and substrate in all living cells, playing a pivotal role in energy metabolism, immunoinflammatory responses, and adaptation to oxidative stress. It serves as an essential component for various enzymes, including sirtuins, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs), and cluster of differentiation 38 (CD38) [<xref rid="B9-viruses-17-00175" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Emerging evidence indicates that viral infections can lead to a significant depletion of NAD+ levels [<xref rid="B10-viruses-17-00175" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-viruses-17-00175" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Consequently, pharmacological strategies to sustain cellular NAD+ levels may provide a promising approach for preventing certain viral-associated diseases. For instance, supplementation with NAD+ or its precursors has been shown to enhance the activity of antiviral PARP isoforms and inhibit the replication of coronaviruses in vitro [<xref rid="B12-viruses-17-00175" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. While NAD+ supplementation does not prevent Zika virus replication, it protects Zika virus-infected cells from cell death [<xref rid="B10-viruses-17-00175" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The sirtuin family consists of seven members (SIRT1 to SIRT7), with SIRT1 being a key regulator of various cellular pathways, including energy metabolism, stress responses, senescence, cancer, and longevity [<xref rid="B13-viruses-17-00175" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. And it features a highly conserved catalytic domain and belongs to class III NAD+-dependent histone deacetylases (HDACs) [<xref rid="B14-viruses-17-00175" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. SIRT1 has been shown to mitigate the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) following spinal cord injury, thereby protecting the blood&#x02013;spinal cord barrier (BBB) and promoting repair [<xref rid="B15-viruses-17-00175" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Additionally, SIRT1 plays a critical role in modulating the innate immune response by regulating the deacetylation of interferon regulatory factors 3 and 7 (IRF3/7), which are essential for type I interferon (IFN-I) production and maintaining immune system homeostasis [<xref rid="B16-viruses-17-00175" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>In this study, we demonstrate significant changes in the metabolite profiles following EV-D68 infection and uncover the antiviral effects of NAD+ both in vivo and in vitro by identifying these altered metabolites. EV-D68 infection modulates the expression of NAD+-consuming and NAD+-synthesizing enzymes, leading to a reduction in cellular NAD+ levels. Furthermore, we observed that viral infection induces the expression of SIRT1, which inhibits EV-D68 replication by suppressing 5&#x02032;-UTR-mediated translation, an effect that is further enhanced by NAD+ supplementation.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-viruses-17-00175"><title>2.

EV-D68 Infection Influences Cellular Metabolism</title><p>Viruses are known to alter the host cell metabolism to facilitate their replication, making the identification of virus-induced metabolic reprogramming crucial for understanding host&#x02013;virus interactions.

Using an orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA), we identified differential metabolites, with VIP &#x0003e; 1 and <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 as the screening criteria. EV-D68 infection resulted in significant changes in 93 metabolites, with 87 downregulated and 6 upregulated (<xref rid="viruses-17-00175-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>b). VIP analysis showed the top 30 differential metabolites after EV-D68 infection and some of the downregulated metabolites participated in the redox reactions, which may indicate the significance of redox balance during EV-D68 infection (<xref rid="viruses-17-00175-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>c). For example, NAD(H) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), essential cofactors in metabolic redox reactions, play critical roles in the TCA cycle and the biosynthesis of lipids, nucleotides, and amino acids. Other metabolites, such as glutathione, citric acid, L-Cystathionine, acetylcarnitine, and 8-Hydroxyguanosine, also directly or indirectly influence cellular redox homeostasis. Further analysis categorized the differential metabolites using the Human Metabolome Database (HMDB). Over 80% of the altered metabolites belonged to the categories &#x0201c;Lipids and lipid-like molecules&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;Organic acids and derivatives&#x0201d;, and &#x0201c;Nucleosides, nucleotides, and analogues&#x0201d; (<xref rid="viruses-17-00175-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>d). To pinpoint the key metabolic pathways affected by EV-D68 infection, we performed a KEGG pathway enrichment analysis. The results showed significant enrichment in pathways including taurine and hypotaurine metabolism, glycerophospholipid metabolism, glutathione metabolism, cysteine and methionine metabolism, alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism, and nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism (<xref rid="viruses-17-00175-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>e). Taken together, these findings indicate that EV-D68 infection induces extensive metabolic reprogramming.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot2-viruses-17-00175"><title>3.2. NAD+ Suppresses EV-D68 Proliferation In Vitro</title><p>To investigate the anti-EV-D68 effects of the significantly altered metabolites identified above, we selected five downregulated compounds&#x02014;nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), acetylcarnitine (ALCAR), L-Cystathionine (L-Cth), flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), and 8-Hydroxyguanosine (8-OHG)&#x02014;for further validation. RD cells were treated with different concentrations of these compounds or mock-treated and subsequently infected with EV-D68. Our results revealed that only NAD+ significantly inhibited viral protein expression, as evidenced by a dose-dependent reduction in VP1 protein levels with increasing concentrations of exogenous NAD+ (0.5 mM to 2 mM). A cell viability assay confirmed that NAD+ exhibited no significant cytotoxicity at concentrations up to 4 mM. In contrast, the other compounds showed no notable inhibitory effects on EV-D68 replication at non-cytotoxic concentrations (<xref rid="viruses-17-00175-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>a,b). Furthermore, viral titers decreased significantly following NAD+ treatment (<xref rid="viruses-17-00175-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>c).

NAD+ Suppresses EV-D68 Proliferation In Vivo</title><p>To evaluate the antiviral effect of NAD+ in vivo, we used a neonatal mouse model of EV-D68 infection. Mice less than one day old were intracranially injected with EV-D68, followed by the intraperitoneal administration of NAD+. NAD+ therapy was continued daily for seven days. On day three post-infection, viral loads in various tissues were measured, and histopathological changes were assessed. Survival rates were recorded from day 1 to day 14 post-infection (<xref rid="viruses-17-00175-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>a). After 7 days, we observed hind limb paralysis in the pups, which was likely due to nerve damage associated with acute flaccid myelitis (AFM) caused by EV-D68 infection (<xref rid="viruses-17-00175-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>b). Compared to the EV-D68-infected group, the NAD+ treatment group had fewer signs of morbidity (<xref rid="viruses-17-00175-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>c). Furthermore, our results showed that, compared to the EV-D68 infection group (n = 22), mice treated with NAD+ (n = 23) exhibited significantly lower levels of viral nucleic acids and VP1 protein in the heart, brain, spleen, lungs, kidneys, spinal muscles, and hind limb muscles (<xref rid="viruses-17-00175-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>d,e). HE staining analysis revealed that EV-D68 infection significantly exacerbated pathological tissue damage. In muscle tissues, EV-D68 infection led to pathological changes such as the vacuolar degeneration of muscle cells, cartilage necrosis, and prominent lymphocyte infiltration. In the NAD+ treatment group, lesion scores were reduced, although the difference did not reach statistical significance, potentially due to the limited duration of the NAD+ treatment. In spinal cord tissues, EV-D68 infection induced neuronal shrinkage, necrosis, and glial cell proliferation, whereas in the NAD+ treatment group, only minor neuronal shrinkage and alleviated pathological damage were observed (<xref rid="viruses-17-00175-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>f). Moreover, no significant pathological changes were observed in other tissues. This may be due to the short infection duration or the tissue-specific tropism of EV-D68. These findings suggest that NAD+ treatment partially mitigates the pathological damage caused by EV-D68 infection, particularly demonstrating significant protective effects in spinal cord tissue. By comparing the days of initial paralysis from both groups, the EV-D68 with NAD+ treatment group showed a more dispersed onset of paralysis, extending from day 3 to day 6 (<xref rid="viruses-17-00175-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>g). Infected mice which were injected with NAD+ also showed higher survival rates, with three mice surviving beyond 14 days, accounting for a survival rate of 13%, while all mice in the control group had died at 8 days post-infection (<xref rid="viruses-17-00175-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>h). These results suggest that supplementation with NAD+ may confer a protective effect against the paralysis and mortality induced by EV-D68 infection in mice, as evidenced by the increased survival rate and reduced number of mortalities. Collectively, the results above suggest that NAD+ suppresses virus proliferation both in vivo and in vitro.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot4-viruses-17-00175"><title>3.4. Viral Infection Regulated the Expression of Enzymes in the NAD+ Salvage Pathway, Leading to a Reduction in NAD+ Level</title><p>Given that NAD+ levels were downregulated following EV-D68 infection, as indicated by the metabolomics analysis, and NAD+ exhibited antiviral activity both in vivo and in vitro, we further quantified NAD+ levels in EV-D68-infected RD cells (<xref rid="viruses-17-00175-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>a). The results showed a significant decline in NAD+ levels after infection. To investigate the underlying mechanism, we assessed the expression of genes involved in NAD+ synthesis and consumption using RT-qPCR. The results revealed that, upon viral infection, the mRNA levels of NAD+-consuming enzymes, including Sirt1-7, Parp1, Parp10, Parp12, Parp14, and CD38, were substantially upregulated. Similarly, the NAD+-synthesizing enzymes Nmnat1&#x02013;3 and Nampt also showed an increased expression (<xref rid="viruses-17-00175-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>b,c). These findings suggest that the reduction in NAD+ levels during EV-D68 infection may result from an imbalance, where NAD+-consuming enzymes outweigh the activity of NAD+-synthesizing enzymes. The results in A549 cells demonstrated that most NAD+ synthesis and consumption genes were significantly upregulated at the mRNA level as well (<xref rid="viruses-17-00175-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>d,e). Based on these findings, we selected five genes&#x02014;Nampt, Nmnat2, Sirt1, Sirt2, and CD38&#x02014;that were consistently upregulated in both RD and A549 cells, to evaluate their protein expression levels after viral infection (<xref rid="viruses-17-00175-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>f). The results confirmed that the protein levels of these genes increased in parallel with their mRNA levels. Collectively, our data highlight the significant alterations in NAD+ metabolism during EV-D68 infection, likely driven by the dysregulation of metabolic enzymes within the NAD+ pathway.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot5-viruses-17-00175"><title>3.5. NAD+-Consuming Enzyme SIRT1 Inhibits EV-D68 Replication</title><p>Considering our results and the demonstrated antiviral effects of SIRT1 against multiple viruses, we focused on the role of SIRT1 during EV-D68 infection. The results showed that SIRT1 expression increased proportionally with the multiplicity of infection (MOI) and the duration of post-infection time (<xref rid="viruses-17-00175-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>a), indicating that EV-D68 infection induces SIRT1 expression. Immunofluorescence results showed that EV-D68 infection induced SIRT1 subcellular translocation from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (<xref rid="viruses-17-00175-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>b,c).</p><p>Given the observed upregulation and translocation of SIRT1, we next evaluated its effect on viral replication. Plasmids expressing SIRT1 (pBudCE4.1-SIRT1) or a control plasmid (pBudCE4.1) were transfected into 293T cells, followed by infection with EV-D68. The results showed that the overexpression of SIRT1 significantly reduced EV-D68 VP1 protein expression and decreased viral titers compared with the control group (<xref rid="viruses-17-00175-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>d,e). After that, we constructed a mutant SIRT1 plasmid (pBudCE4.1-mtSIRT1) lacking the nuclear localization signal (NLS). Interestingly, the mutant SIRT1 exhibited similar antiviral effects to wild-type SIRT1 (<xref rid="viruses-17-00175-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>f,g), indicating that SIRT1 inhibited viral replication independent of its transcriptional activity.</p><p>Furthermore, the siRNA-mediated knockdown of SIRT1 was performed following EV-D68 infection. The knockdown of SIRT1 significantly increased EV-D68 VP1 protein expression and viral titers compared to the si-NC group (<xref rid="viruses-17-00175-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>h,i). Additionally, the effects of SIRT1 modulation were assessed using the SIRT1 agonist Resveratrol and the inhibitor Sirtinol. Resveratrol treatment reduced VP1 expression in a dose-dependent manner (<xref rid="viruses-17-00175-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>j), while Sirtinol treatment had the opposite effect, increasing VP1 expression (<xref rid="viruses-17-00175-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>k). These findings collectively demonstrate that SIRT1 functions as an inhibitor of EV-D68 replication.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot6-viruses-17-00175"><title>3.6. NAD+ Augments the Antiviral Effect of SIRT1</title><p>Since NAD+ is a substrate of SIRT1, we investigated the role of NAD+ in the antiviral effects of SIRT1. The siRNA-mediated knockdown of SIRT1 (si-Sirt1) led to a significant increase in viral replication. However, this effect was mitigated by NAD+ supplementation, which suppressed viral replication and reduced viral titers in the si-Sirt1-treated groups (<xref rid="viruses-17-00175-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>a&#x02013;d). Conversely, 293T cells were transfected with pBudCE4.1-SIRT1 or the control vector pBudCE4.1. After 48 h, the cells were treated with NAD+ for 8 h, followed by infection with EV-D68. The results showed that the addition of NAD+ significantly enhanced the antiviral effect of SIRT1, as evidenced by reduced viral replication and viral titers compared to cells overexpressing SIRT1 alone (<xref rid="viruses-17-00175-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>e,f). These findings suggest that NAD+ enhances the antiviral activity of SIRT1.</p><p>Considering that SIRT1 exerts antiviral effects by exiting the nucleus, immunofluorescence results show that the exogenous addition of NAD+ did not affect the subcellular localization of SIRT1 (<xref rid="viruses-17-00175-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>g). Therefore, to investigate the mechanism of NAD+ in augmenting the antiviral effect of SIRT1, we constructed an EV-D68 5&#x02032;UTR dual-luciferase reporter plasmid, p5Ferm (<xref rid="viruses-17-00175-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>h) [<xref rid="B17-viruses-17-00175" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. 293T cells were co-transfected with p5Ferm and either pBudCE4.1-SIRT1 or the control vector. The exogenous addition of NAD+ and the overexpression of SIRT1 both significantly suppressed the luciferase activity driven by the EV-D68 5&#x02032;UTR, suggesting that NAD+ and SIRT1 inhibit EV-D68 5&#x02032;UTR-mediated translation. Notably, the overexpression of SIRT1 with the addition of NAD+ further strengthened this inhibitory effect (<xref rid="viruses-17-00175-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>i), underscoring its ability to enhance the antiviral action of SIRT1.These findings demonstrate that NAD+ synergistically enhances the antiviral effects of SIRT1 by suppressing EV-D68 replication and inhibiting 5&#x02032;UTR-mediated translation.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec4-viruses-17-00175"><title>4.

Specifically, SIRT1, SIRT2 and SIRT5 have been shown to exhibit potent pro-viral activity by facilitating the replication of a range of viral pathogens [<xref rid="B32-viruses-17-00175" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B33-viruses-17-00175" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B34-viruses-17-00175" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="B35-viruses-17-00175" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], while in certain viral infections, SIRT1, SIRT5, and SIRT6 display anti-viral properties [<xref rid="B36-viruses-17-00175" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="B37-viruses-17-00175" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="B38-viruses-17-00175" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Our study found that EV-D68 can induces SIRT1 expression, which consequently inhibits viral replication, similar to the effects observed during EV71 infection [<xref rid="B39-viruses-17-00175" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target for combating EV-D68 infection.</p><p>Our study further demonstrated that NAD+ treatment enhanced the antiviral activity of SIRT1. Sirtuins, including SIRT1, utilize NAD+ as a cofactor to facilitate the binding and deacetylation of specific target proteins, leading to effects such as promoting DNA repair, regulating inflammation, and exhibiting antioxidant properties [<xref rid="B40-viruses-17-00175" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. As an NAD+-dependent protein deacetylase, the activity of SIRT1 is largely influenced by the intracellular NAD+/NADH ratio. An increase in the NAD+/NADH ratio enhances SIRT1 activity [<xref rid="B41-viruses-17-00175" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Our findings underscore the role of NAD+ in enhancing SIRT1&#x02032;s antiviral effects.</p><p>Furthermore, our results showed that SIRT1 inhibited the expression of reporter genes controlled by the IRES in the 5&#x02032;UTR region of EV-D68 in reporter plasmids. These findings are consistent with an earlier report that SIRT1 binds to the IRES of the EV-A71 5&#x02032;UTR to attenuate viral RNA translation [<xref rid="B39-viruses-17-00175" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. As an RNA virus, EV-D68 replicates primarily in the cytoplasm. Notably, we observed that SIRT1 translocated from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in EV-D68-infected cells. The overexpression of both wild-type and mutant SIRT1 significantly enhanced the antiviral capabilities of cells, suggesting that SIRT1 may inhibit the IRES of EV-D68 5&#x02032;UTR through nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. Additionally, studies have reported that SIRT1 regulates the transcriptional factor REST, which has been shown to bind the REST1/NRSE sequence between the promoter of HSV-1 immediate early genes ICP4 and ICP22, thereby inhibiting the transcription of these genes. It can be speculated that SIRT1, by regulating REST, may in turn affect the regulation of HSV-1 lytic cycle genes by REST. Therefore, another mechanism by which SIRT1 inhibits enterovirus replication may be through regulating the Repressor Element of viral promoter transcription [<xref rid="B42-viruses-17-00175" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].</p><p>The role of SIRT1 in viral infection is complex. In our study, we observed a significant upregulation of SIRT1 levels during EV-D68 infection. Regardless of whether wild-type Sirt1 or mtNLS-Sirt1 was supplemented, both demonstrated robust antiviral activity. Previous studies on EV-A71 infection have reported a decrease in SIRT1 levels, accompanied by an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) [<xref rid="B39-viruses-17-00175" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Conversely, other findings suggested that SIRT1 expression is upregulated following infection, and supplementation with large amounts of mtNLS-Sirt1 significantly inhibits viral replication [<xref rid="B40-viruses-17-00175" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. These conflicting observations highlight the complexity of SIRT1&#x02019;s role in EV-A71 infection. In other studies, the early stage of EV-D68 infection indicates no significant change in SIRT1 levels, with only minimal nuclear translocation observed, while the transfection of wild-type Sirt1 appeared to enhance viral titer. We proposed that the initially low cytoplasmic SIRT1 levels during early infection may limit its ability to counteract viral replication, potentially facilitating viral processes such as vesicular release [<xref rid="B41-viruses-17-00175" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. However, as SIRT1 levels increase, ROS levels are reduced, which may contribute to enhanced antiviral effects. Moreover, SIRT1 is involved in the regulation of multiple signaling pathways [<xref rid="B43-viruses-17-00175" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="B44-viruses-17-00175" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], though the precise mechanism by which SIRT1 activates or modulates specific pathways in response to EV-D68 infection requires further exploration.</p><p>In conclusion, our study revealed that NAD+ treatment effectively suppresses EV-D68 infection both in vivo and in vitro. Additionally, the protective effect of SIRT1 appears to be linked to its enhanced activity, facilitated by the consumption of NAD+. These findings suggest that NAD+ holds promise as a potential therapeutic strategy for combating EV-D68 infection (<xref rid="viruses-17-00175-f007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>).</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p><xref rid="viruses-17-00175-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>a and <xref rid="viruses-17-00175-f007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref> were generated using BioRender.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclaimer/Publisher&#x02019;s Note:</bold> The statements, opinions and data contained in all publications are solely those of the individual author(s) and contributor(s) and not of MDPI and/or the editor(s).
