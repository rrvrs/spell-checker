<xref rid="ref-38" ref-type="bibr">Sharrow
<italic toggle="yes">et al.,</italic> 2022</xref>;
<xref rid="ref-53" ref-type="bibr">WHO, 2022</xref>). Health gains have been achieved due to greater investment in maternal and child health, leading to greater access to ante-natal care and increased facility-based deliveries. The increased uptake and availability of HIV and malaria testing and treatment methods have also significantly reduced child deaths (
<xref rid="ref-3" ref-type="bibr">Black
<italic toggle="yes">et al.,</italic> 2019</xref>;
<xref rid="ref-18" ref-type="bibr">Hemingway
<italic toggle="yes">et al.,</italic> 2016</xref>;
<xref rid="ref-40" ref-type="bibr">UNAIDS, 2022</xref>).</p><p>Malawi, a landlocked East-African country with a population of 19 million, has made significant gains in reducing deaths among children under five, achieving the child mortality-related Millennium Development Goal four ahead of schedule (
<xref rid="ref-50" ref-type="bibr">WHO, 2016</xref>). Between 1990 and 2020, infant mortality rates decreased from 143 to 29 per 1,000 live births, and neonatal mortality reduced from 50 to 19 per 1,000 live births (
<xref rid="ref-19" ref-type="bibr">Kanyuka
<italic toggle="yes">et al.,</italic> 2016</xref>). Yet, for Malawi to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) targets of neonatal and under five mortality rates, set at 12 and 25 per 1,000 live births respectively, further improvements are needed (
<xref rid="ref-39" ref-type="bibr">UN, 2022</xref>). The COVID-19 pandemic and climate shocks have added to Malawi&#x02019;s challenges. Although COVID-19 is not thought to have affected under-five mortality significantly, increased levels of poverty due to &#x02018;lock downs&#x02019;, localised droughts and recent severe weather events are exacerbating Malawi&#x02019;s already high levels of malnutrition, undernutrition, and stunting, which have all been identified as contributing to child mortality (
<xref rid="ref-41" ref-type="bibr">UNICEF, 2018</xref>;
<xref rid="ref-53" ref-type="bibr">WHO, 2022</xref>). Encouraging the adoption of optimal infant nutrition practices, especially six months of exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) from birth, is therefore crucial. National legislation to curb non-compliance with the International Code of Marketing of Breast Milk Substitutes is among a range of steps countries can take to promote EBF (
<xref rid="ref-8" ref-type="bibr">Forsyth, 2013</xref>). EBF for the first six months of a baby&#x02019;s life greatly increases their wellbeing and can avert sickness and ill health. Worldwide, the scaling up of exclusive breastfeeding to near universal levels could prevent 823,000 annual deaths in young children (
<xref rid="ref-45" ref-type="bibr">Victora
<italic toggle="yes">et al.,</italic> 2016</xref>).</p><p>EBF is strongly promoted in Malawi&#x02019;s nutrition policies, which aim to prevent weaning before the age of six months, as recommended by the World Health Organisation (
<xref rid="ref-52" ref-type="bibr">WHO, 2021</xref>). In accordance with Malawi&#x02019;s health and nutrition policies, pregnant women should attend at least four ante-natal care (ANC) visits at their nearest health facility, and the ANC curriculum should cover breastfeeding and the benefits of EBF (
<xref rid="ref-13" ref-type="bibr">GoM, DNHA, 2018</xref>). At the facility where women deliver, it is expected that women receive support with breastfeeding and are informed of the benefits of EBF, especially if it is their first baby (
<xref rid="ref-15" ref-type="bibr">GoM, MoH, 2009</xref>). Part of the duties of Malawi&#x02019;s community-level health workers, the Heath Surveillance Assistants (HSAs) is visiting of all mothers within three days after they have arrived home with their newborn baby (
<xref rid="ref-17" ref-type="bibr">Guenther
<italic toggle="yes">et al.,</italic> 2019</xref>), during which time it is expected that breastfeeding support will be provided and the benefits of EBF will be discussed. In addition, different volunteer cadres, including care group volunteers, are expected to actively support EBF at community level, as part of their promotion of key messages contained in Malawi&#x02019;s health and nutrition policies.</p><p>The Care Group approach is a peer-to-peer learning model often used to promote good family health and child health practices at community level (
<xref rid="ref-30" ref-type="bibr">Perry
<italic toggle="yes">et al.,</italic> 2015</xref>). In 2011, Malawi joined the Scaling Up Nutrition (SUN) movement and used its SUN membership to leverage support for the implementation of its National Nutrition Policy and Strategy Plan 2007&#x02013;2015, which focused on broad-based nutrition interventions implemented at community level (
<xref rid="ref-36" ref-type="bibr">SUN, 2014</xref>). Malawi adopted the Care Group model &#x02018;in order to roll out the Nutrition Education Communication Strategy (NECS) as an operational framework for the SUN strategy&#x02019; (
<xref rid="ref-12" ref-type="bibr">GoM, DNHA, 2017</xref>, p. 3). The Care Group model thus became a key community-level policy instrument in 2012, creating an &#x0201c;integrated, multi-sectoral approach to support communities and families&#x0201d; (
<xref rid="ref-48" ref-type="bibr">World Bank, 2019</xref>, p. 7).</p><p>The Care Group approach was originally designed in 1995 by staff of a non-governmental organisation (NGO) facing a significant lack of healthcare providers in the aftermath of the civil war in Mozambique. The Care Group&#x02019;s peer-to-peer learning approach equipped mothers with basic hygiene and nutrition knowledge, and access to treatment for common illnesses, averting infant morbidity and mortality (
<xref rid="ref-7" ref-type="bibr">Davis
<italic toggle="yes">et al.,</italic> 2013</xref>). The Care Group approach continues to be used by NGOs in locations where simple changes in behaviour (often improved day-to-day childcare and nutrition practices) can prevent adverse child health outcomes. The model works on the principle that in target localities, all women with children under two are enlisted into neighbourhood groups, and that per group of 10&#x02013;12 women, one woman per group is elected Care Group volunteer. In the commonly used Care Group structure, as seen in
<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>. the care group volunteers (CGVs) receive monthly lessons (in groups of 10&#x02013;12 CGVs) from a paid NGO staff member called a promoter. The CGVs pass these monthly lessons on to their 10&#x02013;12 neighbourhood women&#x02019;s group members. Well-implemented Care Group interventions ensure that all women with children under two in a certain target area receive the same guidance (on hygiene, nutrition, vaccinations, breastfeeding, weaning) at the same time, creating community-wide positive peer pressure to adopt new behaviours (

<xref rid="ref-32" ref-type="bibr">Pieterse
<italic toggle="yes">et al.,</italic> 2021</xref>), which informed the interview guides that were used during the empirical research described in this paper. The main question that was addressed in this paper was: &#x0201c;What are the mechanisms and contexts by which care groups achieve social and behavioural change in low- and middle-income countries?&#x0201d; The main findings of the study centres around how those who volunteer as leaders of Care Groups, and how mothers who are committed members of the Care Groups are motivated to remain engaged. The study found that there were different types of motivation that drove the set up, and later the sustainability of the Care Groups; at the inception stage, NGOs tend to provide resources for volunteers to get involved, these vary from T-shirts to training, which bestow the volunteers with a certain social capital. Subsequently, it was found that both volunteers and group members were motivated by the group dynamics and mutual support. Support and recognition from the wider community and the community leadership often also helped to sustain efforts.</p><p>Finally, in successful groups, volunteers and group members alike became self-motivated by their experience of being involved in group activities. The literature suggests that lifelong friendships develop, and cohesive groups are sometimes found to jointly engage in other activities, sometimes accessing microfinance loans or community lands for farming.</p><p>The Care Group approach has been adopted in over 28 countries, and &#x02018;Care Group-like&#x02019; adaptations have been implemented in additional LMICs, including interventions whereby the approach has been integrated into Ministry of Health systems (
<xref rid="ref-46" ref-type="bibr">Weiss
<italic toggle="yes">et al.,</italic> 2015</xref>).</p><p>The Care Group model, as adopted into national policy by Malawi&#x02019;s Department of Nutrition, HIV and AIDS (
<xref rid="ref-11" ref-type="bibr">GoM, DNHA, 2012</xref>), was similarly modified to fit within the national structures, see
<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>. Malawi&#x02019;s adoption of the care group model as a component of their national nutrition strategy, was inspired by the successful implementation of care group interventions by NGOs in Malawi in the early 2000s (
<xref rid="ref-48" ref-type="bibr">World Bank, 2019</xref>). In Malawi&#x02019;s &#x02018;modified Care Group&#x02019;-policy, key responsibility for the training and supervision of the community-based volunteers, for example, rests with &#x0201c;frontline workers&#x0201d; according to the national Care Group guidelines (
<xref rid="ref-12" ref-type="bibr">GoM, DNHA, 2017</xref>, p. 5). While Malawi&#x02019;s Care Group policy does not explicitly mention HSAs as the nominated frontline workers to support the Care Groups at community level, HSAs are the only cadre available at community-level, which makes their role and interaction with Care Groups important to examine (

Dedza District is located in the Central Region of Malawi. Poverty remains widespread in Malawi, where 61.7% of the population was reported to be multi-dimensionally poor, according to a 2021 research report (
<xref rid="ref-24" ref-type="bibr">NSO
<italic toggle="yes">et al.,</italic> 2021</xref>). 20% of the country&#x02019;s population live in extreme poverty, defined as an inability to satisfy basic food needs, while 70.3% live below the international poverty line of $1.90 a day (
<xref rid="ref-49" ref-type="bibr">World Bank, 2020</xref>). Food insecurity is high, and a significant portion of Malawi&#x02019;s population require food assistance annually, with malnutrition remaining a challenge nationally as a major contributor to preventable child deaths in Malawi (
<xref rid="ref-42" ref-type="bibr">UNICEF, 2019</xref>). Dedza District has higher than the average mortality rates for the Central Region with a neo-natal mortality rate of 33 deaths per 1,000 live births and an infant mortality rate of 53 deaths per 1,000 live births, compared to national rates of 19 and 29. In Dedza, 18% of children are born with a low birth weight (below 2.5kg), compared with national average of 12.3% (

<italic toggle="yes">et al.,</italic> 2002</xref>;
<xref rid="ref-70" ref-type="bibr">Hesse-Biber &#x00026; Leavy, 2010</xref>). Using focus group discussions was ruled out to reduce the risk of COVID-19 and associated restrictions in place at the time of data collection. Therefore only one-to-one interviews were conducted. The research focused primarily on mothers with children under two, who were likely to have recently received breastfeeding and infant feeding support. A total of 36 mothers with children under two were interviewed. Among them were eight women who had a premature or low-birth-weight baby (weighing less than 2500 grams at birth), these women were assumed to have received extra attention after they brought their babies home.</p><p>To examine the role that healthcare providers, community leaders and district health officials&#x02019; play in supporting and integrating Care Groups into the communities, we interviewed village headmen (n=6), HSAs (n=5) and a number of district- level health officials (n=3), as well as an NGO representative. A total of nine Care Group leaders active in the community were also interviewed.</p><p>We made efforts to identify Care Group interventions that were established without the support of an international NGO or donor-funded intervention but were unable to find any that we could include in our research. A report commissioned by the Department of Nutrition, HIV and AIDS conducted at the time of our research, demonstrated that very few Care Groups have been started without external support in Malawi (

The research team were to arrive at a study site, find and interview the Village Headman, ask to be introduced to a HSA, interview the HSA, and then ask the HSA to bring them to houses of women who had a child under two years of age. The number of women who fitted the research participant criteria and were willing to be interviewed at each location, determined the total number of interviews conducted. The HSAs were also interviewed, as were any Care Group volunteer staff.</p><p>The interviewees at district-level were identified by the District Medical Officer, to whom the research team first reported to introduce themselves at the start of the data gathering visit in Dedza District.</p><p>Each of the women was interviewed using semi-structured interview guides, which were prepared in English and then translated into Chichewa by the researchers who conducted the interviews. The guides were developed from our aims and objectives and drew on a realist synthesis of Care Group literature (

The original interview guides were shortened, and some language was simplified after two members of the research team (MC and JM) used them to interview five women with children under two, in two villages close to Blantyre. The interview guides in English and Chichewa can be accessed via the open access data repository established for this research:

</p><p>All data were collected by three members of our research team (EC, MC and CM), who were joined by two additional research assistants (JM and JC). All five researchers were Malawian and used Chichewa to conduct the interviews, using the Chichewa version of the interview guides. Interviews were audio recorded and later transcribed and translated into English. The audio recordings were deleted after transcription. The translations were conducted by all Malawian research team members, who double checked each other&#x02019;s translations against the Chichewa transcriptions.

The key themes that emerged from the responses are discussed below.</p><sec><title>Sources of breastfeeding support</title><p>All 36 women who were interviewed reported delivering their baby at a health facility. On the question regarding where, or from whom, women received breastfeeding support (excluding support from family and friends), all women reported receiving some support at the facility where the baby was born. &#x02018;Support&#x02019; was often no more than an instruction from somebody at the health facility that a mother should breastfeed her newborn infant; this was interpreted as support: &#x0201c;At that time, they the nurses said the baby was hungry and needed to feed; she also said that the baby was cold so I needed to warm her.&#x0201d; [04MCA].</p><p>Only eight out of 36 women with children under two, reported receiving breastfeeding support from Care Groups (CG). Those who received CG support reported anything from having been encouraged to breastfeed exclusively during a group meeting, to home visits whereby CG volunteers engaged with a mother and her newborn baby on a one-to-one basis &#x0201c;They [CG volunteers] had books; the books had pictures which they could show us and there were some explanations below to tell us what we can do with our babies when breastfeeding.&#x0201d; When asked how often they visited, the same interviewee responded: &#x0201c;Since my baby was born, they visited me twice. They first visited me when the baby had just born to advise me on how I can exclusively breastfeed my baby until she reached 6 months.&#x0201d; [03MCA].</p><p>Two-thirds of all women interviewed noted that they had been advised to exclusively breastfeed (EBF) their baby for the first six months during the health talks provided while they attended ante-natal care check-ups. One interviewee mentioned that frequent breastfeeding was advised: &#x0201c;[The health worker said] &#x02026;that we should exclusively breastfeed; if the baby is sleeping, when she wakes up we should breastfeed her and after some time we should breastfeed the baby again so that the baby should grow healthy she should not become malnourished.&#x0201d; [35PLBWB].</p><p>Seven women mentioned receiving EBF support during the &#x02018;under-five clinics&#x02019; (monthly baby check-ups usually conducted by a health facility out-patient team that provides vaccinations, growth monitoring, etc.) and six women reported receiving support from a HSA. From the responses it appears that the HSAs tended to be the individuals who conducted the under-five check-ups at the local clinics, so it is hard to know whether &#x02018;receiving support from the HSA&#x02019; means during the under-five check up at the local clinic, or during a home visit. When an interviewee was asked about her interaction with the HSAs, she suggested that she and other women with babies and toddlers only saw HSAs and received BF advice when they brought their babies for vaccinations and check-ups [29PLBWA].</p></sec><sec><title>Care Group activities</title><p>The Care Groups in Dedza work with NGO-funded promoters, who train CG volunteers. CG volunteers pass on the promotors&#x02019; health and nutrition lessons on to so-called &#x02018;cluster leaders&#x02019;, who are tasked with home visits. Findings show that 18 interviewees mentioned interactions with Care Groups. Home visits were mentioned, as were group activities. The group activities, especially cooking demonstrations, appear to have been well received by the women who were interviewed. Several women credited Care Group cooking demonstrations for teaching them how to add nourishing ingredients to the porridge they feed their small children. Some linked this to their infants&#x02019; improved growth [18MCB] and mentioned learning &#x0201c;from the group&#x0201d;.</p><p>Group meetings that involved cooking and sharing food appeared to live up to some mothers&#x02019; expectations of what NGO-supported interventions do, while receiving breastfeeding counselling, or other advice and information, without any material benefits was not always appreciated in the same manner. A CG volunteer recounted being told by a family &#x0201c;we don&#x02019;t see a reason why you come to visit us because there is nothing that you give us&#x0201d; [52CGVA], while several mothers explained during our interviews that they had received &#x02018;no support&#x02019; from Care Groups, which later turned out to mean no material support, while the same women further expressed their satisfaction about the advice they have received from Care Group cluster leaders or volunteers [e.g. 02MCA].</p></sec><sec><title>Care Group interaction with HSAs and district officials</title><p>The second area of focus of the study was the examine how the Care Groups function and whether any of the relationships and interactions, as described by the policy document&#x02019;s &#x02018;Harmonised Care Group Model&#x02019; exist in practice.</p><p>The CG volunteers and promoters interviewed for this research did not make any references to HSAs. There was a strong sense that the entire Care Group structure was operated by the NGO, with little or no integration into the local healthcare structures. Even though Malawi&#x02019;s integrated care group policy
<sup>17</sup> suggests that the volunteers should receive monthly behaviour change lessons from local frontline service providers, this was clearly not happening in Dedza. The NGO coordinator explained why:</p><p>&#x0201c;Because we [NGO staff] support the volunteers to work with the communities on the ground, with the Care Group structure, the HSAs are taking it as the NGO&#x02019;s program and not
<italic toggle="yes">their program</italic>. So that mind-set also affects the sustainability&#x02026; What I mean is, for example, if there is no incentive for the HSAs like the ones that are available for the volunteers, they would not be willing to work. So there should always be something like a soft drink, then they will go to work with us. They should understand that it is
<italic toggle="yes">their model</italic> and we, the NGO, are just supporting them.&#x0201d; [61DISTRICT].</p><p>At a higher level, it was clear that District Health Officials were aware that the Care Groups were supposed to be integrated in the district health and nutrition activities. Supervising the Care Group activities should be an integral, and motivational, part of the District Authorities&#x02019; responsibilities. However, the resources to support these activities are often lacking, which means that district officials have to rely on the NGOs to facilitate the monitoring of the NGO-supported Care Groups. When asked whether these monitoring visits happen, a district official admitted that &#x0201c;Since this is my 8
<sup>th</sup> month in this job and since I came here it has never happened&#x0201d;. One of the reasons appears to be that &#x0201c;at District Council level, nutrition is not funded.&#x0201d; [59DISTRICT].</p><p>The interview data contained just one reference from a mother that Care Groups worked with HSAs in her area [17MCB], which demonstrates that on an ad hoc basis, Care Group volunteers and HSAs do work together at community level. Most of the interviewees, however, did not indicate seeing HSAs and Care Group members together or appeared to associate HSAs and Care Groups.</p><p>Even among the women with preterm or low-birthweight babies, there was no evidence of a coordinated follow up by Care Groups, which could have been directed by a concerned HSA. Only two out of the nine women with preterm or low-birthweight babies had received EBF support from Care Groups, and in one case this was because the local Care Group volunteer was also an aunt of the new mother who was interviewed. None of the Care Group team (paid or unpaid staff) made any reference to coordination or collaboration with HSAs or other Ministry of Health staff at District level. One of the HSAs, who described himself as a HSA supervisor, gave an elaborate description of newborn mother support provided by a mixture of HSAs and Care Group members:</p><p>&#x0201c;When a pregnant woman delivers, we visit the woman to see if she had any complications&#x02026; When she delivers we visit her to monitor the health of the baby&#x02026; if the baby or the mother has a problem, we also refer them to the hospital. From there, we explain to her how she can exclusively breastfeed her baby. So if we leave the mother, we also refer her to Care Groups&#x02026; So they go and find those people in their homes and teach them how they can take care of their babies.&#x0201d; [40HSAB].</p><p>Yet during the interviews with the mothers, none of them appear to have received the integrated care or the referrals from HSAs to the CGVs as is described by this HSA.</p><p>Our research showed that the HSAs were not always fully informed of what was happening in the community, especially if they do not live there, but in the nearest town. It is therefore not surprising, according to HSAs, that events such as twin or triplet births, or preterm babies brought home to a village after delivery, do not automatically come to a HSA&#x02019;s attention:</p><p>&#x0201c;What happens at this facility is that mostly preterm babies are referred to X Hospital; that is where they are managed. And when they are being discharged they are told to pass through this health centre so that they can be linked up with a HSA from their community for follow up. So if they follow this process, they are followed up. However, there are others when they are told to pass through this health centre, they don&#x02019;t, so it is difficult to follow them up.&#x0201d; [41HSAC].</p><p>From the perspective of the local hospitals where mothers deliver their babies and where vulnerable newborns such as premature babies or twins may spend several weeks before they are discharged, the referral system appears to be equally unclear, according to a District level interviewee: We have HSAs in the community who help us with that. We do refer the babies to the HSAs. If we have their numbers, we call them but if we don&#x02019;t have their contact numbers, that is now where the challenge comes in, because we don&#x02019;t know what they the mothers with premature babies are really doing at home, whether they are really breastfeeding the baby or not&#x0201d; [60DISTRICT].</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The Care Group model has been implemented in Malawi for the past 20 years and has been officially adopted as part of Malawi&#x02019;s nutrition strategy since 2012. Yet, drawing on our findings in one district and further published evidence, NGOs that utilise the Care Group model for community-based peer learning and behaviour change interventions continue to struggle with a lack of engagement at district level. This appears to result in Care Groups being less integrated in the established healthcare structures than they should be, as per the existing strategy.</p><p>Our research showed that the women who were interviewed received little or no dedicated support to exclusively breastfeed their babies for their full first six months. Women with vulnerable babies, born preterm or with a low birth weight, were not routinely followed up after facility discharge and only visited if a community-level HSA found out about their need for support. Where Care Groups did actively engage with women to support them with EBF and infant feeding advice, this appears to have been useful and much appreciated.</p><p>The research highlighted that women received minimal levels of support to exclusively breastfeed their newborn babies for the first six months of their lives, and mothers with vulnerable babies were not supported in this regard. Even though Malawi is known to have high average rates of EBF among children under six months of age (
<xref rid="ref-25" ref-type="bibr">NSO &#x00026; ICF, 2017</xref>), the reduction of EBF when babies are around four to five months of age, usually combined with the introduction of weaning foods (
<xref rid="ref-35" ref-type="bibr">Salim &#x00026; Stones, 2020</xref>), is worrisome, as infants that young are still extremely vulnerable, and illnesses associated with contaminated water or weaning foods can have significant adverse effects.</p><p>Our research highlighted that women with children under two mainly received professional advice on EBF at health facilities where women attended ante-natal care, where they delivered their baby(ies) or attended for post-natal check-ups, under-five/vaccination purposes. This level of support means that there may be little room to encourage women to continue breastfeeding until their baby is six months old. For women with premature or low-birthweight babies, little at-home support is available to support the breastfeeding of a very small or sick child when it is at its most vulnerable.</p><sec><title>Do Care Groups play a role in breastfeeding support?</title><p>Our research focused on whether or not women had received breastfeeding support from members of the Care Groups working in their community, given that the Care Group members were mandated to engage with all pregnant women and women with children under two, and focus on spreading key nutrition messages, including the promotion of exclusive breastfeeding. Finding that only eight out of 36 of the women participants had received EBF support from Care Group members meant that their performance was well below expectations. Care Group interventions have often been successful in bringing women together and promoting important behaviour change messages such as those regarding breastfeeding and handwashing, which are no- or low-cost interventions that can be adopted by the large majority of women who live within the reach of Care Group activities (
<xref rid="ref-7" ref-type="bibr">Davis
<italic toggle="yes">et al.,</italic> 2013</xref>;
<xref rid="ref-10" ref-type="bibr">George
<italic toggle="yes">et al.,</italic> 2015</xref>). The same level of success does not seem to have been achieved and sustained by the interventions focused on during this research.</p><p>Where Dedza&#x02019;s Care Groups were active, they were reported to have reinforced all-important EBF messages, but overall, it appears that breastfeeding support was not a priority for the Care Group interventions we studied. 18 out of the 36 women in areas with Care Groups reported receiving support of some kind (other than EBF) from Care Group members. In most cases this related to cooking demonstrations. Such cooking demonstrations were done in groups, as opposed to &#x02018;passing on/receiving Care Group messages&#x02019;, which the Care Group volunteers were expected to deliver by going house-to-house. This is a huge workload for volunteers, much greater than it would have been in the &#x02018;normal Care Group model&#x02019;. Several references to what the community&#x02019;s expectations Care Group support entails, might explain why some volunteers were reluctant to engage in visiting households empty-handed with &#x02018;just advice&#x02019;.</p><p>While volunteer attrition is an issue that is highlighted by most researchers and practitioners of Care Groups, it was noted that the NGO that implemented the Dedza-based interventions reported high numbers of drop-out rates, in the earlier (pre-2019) phases of the Care Group interventions we studied; between 32% and 16% of the trained CGVs and/or cluster leaders reportedly becoming inactive before the end of the programme (
<xref rid="ref-43" ref-type="bibr">United Purpose, 2022</xref>). Given that this reported high attrition rate predated the COVID-19 pandemic (during which a lot of Care Group activities, including motivational visits and training sessions, had to be cancelled), we suspect that the lack of integration into the community-based HSA system may have undermined the Care Groups&#x02019; perceived legitimacy and standing within the community, thereby demotivating the volunteers.</p><p>A lack of budget for supportive supervision by the district health authorities also deprived Care Group volunteers of the validation such exposure to higher level officials would bring. Research into HSA motivation shows that attrition is also a challenge among HSAs. Finding high drop-out rates is therefore not surprising (
<xref rid="ref-17" ref-type="bibr">Guenther
<italic toggle="yes">et al.,</italic> 2019</xref>), yet, the budget shortage at district level that leads to a lack of opportunity to supervise and motivate both cadres is regrettable, as HSAs could potentially delegate the important role of visiting newborns and supporting EBF to Care Group volunteers, potentially saving lives.</p></sec><sec><title>A lack of collaboration between HSAs and Care Groups</title><p>Overall, the level of support for EBF provided by any member of a professional or volunteer health workers cadre, was found to be limited, especially considering that a one in four of our interviewees were mothers of vulnerable babies, who included those in need of support with expressing breastmilk and managing this hygienically, whilst their babies needed the protection and nourishment from EBF all the more.</p><p>Summary numerical responses were included in the findings to illustrate patterns and variations related to where (exclusive) breastfeeding support was obtained, and the role of HSAs in the support for mothers with newborn babies, including in terms of HSA interaction with Care Group structures. In addition, the analysis of the data gave an impression of how Care Group interventions &#x02018;sit&#x02019; within the wider system of local-level healthcare support structures in Dedza District. It demonstrated that, despite a Harmonised Care Group Design being put in place by Malawi&#x02019;s Department of Nutrition, HIV, and AIDS in 2012 (which should allow for an integration of the NGO-supported Care Groups into the community-level government health system), such integration does not seem to be realised.</p><p>The evident absence of communication and collaboration between HSAs and Care Group members can only be perceived as a missed opportunity. Given that one HSA explained in detail how a system of integrated and delegated care for women with newborn babies should have worked, there appears to be an intention on part of the HSA structures to collaborate more closely with Care Groups, but that these plans were simply not followed through on. The NGO&#x02019;s programme documents also suggest that greater engagement with government structures was wished for, at District level specifically, but that government officials&#x02019; heavy workloads made scheduling meetings with the relevant individuals challenging. Similar challenges have been noted in other Care Group interventions in Malawi (
<xref rid="ref-54" ref-type="bibr">World Relief, 2004</xref>). It appears to be difficult to receive district-level buy-in for a well-integrated Care Group intervention, which translates into a lack of higher-level facilitation of the HSA-Care Group relationship that could have created the types of linkages that Malawi&#x02019;s national Care Group strategy called for.</p><p>HSAs have been lauded with significantly expanding Malawi&#x02019;s vaccine coverage, women&#x02019;s access to antenatal and post-natal care and growth monitoring (
<xref rid="ref-20" ref-type="bibr">Kok &#x00026; Muula, 2013</xref>;
<xref rid="ref-22" ref-type="bibr">Mziray
<italic toggle="yes">et al.,</italic> 2017</xref>). However, the expanding list of demands placed on HSAs have exacerbated the pressure on their time, which appears to have increased the risk of HSAs not being able to carry out all the tasks that are expected of them (
<xref rid="ref-17" ref-type="bibr">Guenther
<italic toggle="yes">et al.,</italic> 2019</xref>;

<xref rid="ref-26" ref-type="bibr">Ngwira
<italic toggle="yes">et al.,</italic> 2021</xref>). This context, whereby HSAs are overburdened and a substantial volunteer cadre (which the Care Group volunteers effectively are) has been in place since 2012, could have lent itself to task sharing and, for example, the delegation of &#x02018;mother and newborn baby home visits&#x02019; to Care Group volunteers in Malawi. There has been no evidence of this in the literature to date. Instead, the NGO staff implementing the Care Group intervention clearly struggled to convince HSAs (and those in charge of managing the HSA programme) that proper integration of the CGVs would be to the benefit of the HSAs, in terms of workload reduction, and to the benefit of women and their infants, who do currently not receive sufficient EBF and infant feeding support.</p><p>The lack of integration of the Care Group members into the community-based healthcare system in Malawi means that overburdened HSAs have not been given the opportunity to systematically delegate some of their home visiting responsibilities to the Care Groups, which results in a continued lack of check-ups and support for newborn babies and their mothers at community-level. In Burundi, where a randomised-controlled trial showed that Care Group-inspired interventions can be successfully adapted to be managed by Ministry of Health staff, the key to its success appears to have been the active involvement of the HSAs (or their equivalents) at community-level from the outset. This allowed the HSAs to clearly see that there were potential advantages for them, in terms of being able to delegate certain time-consuming responsibilities (
<xref rid="ref-46" ref-type="bibr">Weiss
<italic toggle="yes">et al.,</italic> 2015</xref>).</p><p>Our targeted search for, and reading of, all of the Government of Malawi&#x02019;s health and nutrition-focused policy and strategy documents and key aid donor reports, led us to the identification of just three documents that reference Malawi&#x02019;s national Care Group strategy (
<xref rid="ref-11" ref-type="bibr">GoM, DNHA, 2012</xref>;
<xref rid="ref-12" ref-type="bibr">GoM, DNHA, 2017</xref>;
<xref rid="ref-48" ref-type="bibr">World Bank, 2019</xref>). These include the strategy document that first included the Care Group approach, the national guidelines (in English and Chichewa, counted as one document) and a World Bank report. More than ten years after its adoption into Malawi&#x02019;s national policy, it is timely to reflect on this nutrition policy component and suggest ways that can improve the efficacy of Malawi&#x02019;s adapted Care Group approach. Updating and improving Malawi&#x02019;s national Care Group strategy and guidance could increase the chance of community-level integration that could see Care Group members develop into a more established volunteer cadre, similar to Community Health Workers (CHWs) in many other LMICs. According to the World Health Organisation, worldwide health workforce shortages are leading many low-income countries to consider ways in which CHWs can be adopted into national human resources for health strategies, inspired by examples from countries where this has been successful, for example the two-tier CHW model from Ethiopia (

The Malawi government&#x02019;s efforts to integrate the Care Group approach into national policy is one of the few examples where a clear intention exists to integrate lay or volunteer health worker systems into the existing community-level healthcare structures, yet until now, this approach had not been evaluated and written up in detail. More research is needed into ways in which national-level or sub-national level efforts are made to integrate volunteer, lay and &#x02018;stipended&#x02019; community-level healthcare providers in LMICs (such as

While this limits transferability to other Care Group interventions in Malawi, the authors of this study did further consider at least five published programme reviews and two peer reviewed articles on Care Groups in Malawi programme reviews (

<italic toggle="yes">et al.,</italic> 2021</xref>) in our interpretation of these findings. The focus of our study was breastfeeding, which meant that we examined the efficacy of the interventions through that specific lens, although we did consider all other mentions of our interviewees&#x02019; interactions with Care Groups. Finally, we acknowledge that we have examined interventions that are based on group interactions and people learning from face-to-face meetings to pass on behaviour change messages, in the middle of a pandemic that necessitated the cancellation of many Care Group activities. It can therefore be assumed that overall efficacy of the examined interventions would have been better than what we recorded, had this not been the case. However, we managed to draw most of our conclusions from a mix of field research, as well as existing programme design, policy guidelines, and pre-COVID-19 Malawi-focused research reports, on which the pandemic had no bearing.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The women included in our study received relatively little support for breastfeeding, and while the terms exclusive breastfeeding was commonly repeated by the interviewees, not all women were entirely sure what it meant. Most breastfeeding information from professionals or trained volunteers was provided when the women were at a health facility for pre- or post-natal care, delivery or with their babies, while family, neighbours and friends supported women at community level. Women with vulnerable babies did not seem to receive any additional support, were often not noted after they were discharged from health facilities and some women discussed struggling to breastfeed their small or sick child.</p><p>This research has highlighted several areas in which Malawi&#x02019;s policy in relation to Care Groups could benefit from updating to reflect what really happens at community level. Our study revealed that little or no integration or collaboration happened between the government health workers, including the community-based HSAs, and the Care Group volunteers. The Care Group volunteers could, with the right motivation and integration, provide that &#x02018;last mile&#x02019; support a limited number of households each, whist integrated within, and supervised by, a professional community-level cadre, Malawi&#x02019;s HSAs. Given that community-based health worker strategies are gaining prominence in many LMICs countries, policy adaptations should be considered within this context. This policy change also needs to be managed to ensure it is embraced by MoH staff at district level, who may come to see Care Group volunteers as an asset in an otherwise resource constrained work environment.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors would like to acknowledge and thank all the participants who gave up their time to be interviewed for this research.</p></ack><sec sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><sec><title>Underlying data</title><p>The transcripts of interviews for this study are restricted to protect personal data under the approval of the ethics committee of Dublin City University and the College of Medicine Research Ethics Committee (COMREC) of Malawi.

The authors conducted 60 qualitative interviews with various stakeholders and mothers. They found that, although the intention of the volunteer Care Groups is to provide mothers with cost-effective peer-to-peer support for breastfeeding and infant feeding, very few mothers reported receiving such support. Moreover, mothers generally indicated that this type of support was less acceptable from peers compared to Health Surveillance Assistants. Another finding was that coordination between the support provided by Health Surveillance Assistants and volunteer Care Groups was almost non-existent.</p><p>
<bold>General remarks:</bold>
</p><p> The research study is important on multiple levels. Supporting breastfeeding is crucial, especially in countries like Malawi, where weaning foods may be contaminated and pose a risk to infants. Employing volunteer support is also significant, particularly in less affluent countries. The findings from this study have the potential to inform future enhancements in breastfeeding support and care. It is essential to highlight the need for strengthening breastfeeding support and focusing on the integration and coordination of healthcare provided by lay/volunteer workers and healthcare professionals.</p><p> The manuscript may benefit from restructuring, especially in the introduction section, and a general shortening by combining paragraphs into more concise ones. I urge the authors to cut unnecessary text from the somewhat lengthy manuscript. Additionally, ensure overall consistency in spelling (e.g., programme vs. program, Care Groups vs. care groups).</p><p>
<bold>Abstract:</bold>
</p><p> In the background section, I propose the following alterations:</p><p> Promoting exclusive breastfeeding is a key policy objective in Malawi. The &#x02018;Care Group&#x02019; model, a peer-to-peer learning approach, was adopted in 2012 as a community-level policy instrument to create an integrated, multi-sectoral approach to support communities and families. Its role within community-level infant feeding support remains under-researched. This study explores the role that Care Group Volunteers (CGVs) play in providing infant feeding support at the community level.</p><p> Due to inconsistencies in the use of assess/evaluate/explore, I propose sticking to "explore," as I believe the present study is neither an assessment nor an evaluation, but an initial exploration. However, I recommend choosing the term that best fits your study and using it consistently.</p><p> In the findings section, I recommend revising the last sentence to reflect the qualitative nature of your empirical data. Additionally, I would refrain from stating "no evidence," as this is a stretch. Your empirical data suggested that there was little to no coordination between Health Surveillance Assistants (HSAs) and CGVs.</p><p> I believe the conclusion can be made clearer by summarizing your findings regarding your two research objectives.</p><p>
<bold>Introduction:</bold>
</p><p> The introduction contains a lot of detailed information that goes in different directions. See if you can consolidate the information to create a better overview. Much of the information could benefit from being made more concise. It is clear that you want to include everything, but I recommend keeping only the essential details to provide the reader with a better flow. For instance, shorten the listing of infant and neonatal mortality rates so that you don&#x02019;t have to state &#x02018;per 1,000 live births&#x02019; each time.</p><p> I suggest mentioning breastfeeding earlier, preferably at the very beginning, to make the reader aware that this is a key topic of the paper.</p><p> Since you state in the &#x02018;Recommendations for further research&#x02019; section that the integration of the Care Group approach has not been evaluated and written up in detail, it might make sense to collate the information about the Care Group approach, including the mandate and implementation, in a table instead of including a lot of detail in the introduction. For me, all this information made the introduction confusing, and I would prefer a table format to ensure an easy overview of the approach, also for future referencing.</p><p> The last paragraph of the introduction before the Aims and Objectives section needs amendment. Currently, it reads as if your paper evaluates the integration and efficacy of Care Groups, which is not the case in my perspective. First, it is sufficient to say that this has not been investigated (or published?) instead of stating that it has not been researched and published. Second, reconsider your statement about this paper addressing this knowledge gap, since your study is not an efficacy trial and does not inform about the efficacy of the Care Groups. An easy solution might be to include the word &#x02018;part&#x02019; in the sentence.</p><p> The paragraph &#x02018;Study location&#x02019; should, in my opinion, be moved to the Methods section and renamed &#x02018;Setting&#x02019;.</p><p> Unless it is required by the authors&#x02019; guidelines to address ethics (Ethical Statement) at the end of the introduction section, I would move this to the very end of the Methods section.</p><p>
<bold>Methods:</bold>
</p><p> There is some overlap between the first two sections, &#x02018;Study design&#x02019; and &#x02018;Sampling and data collection&#x02019;. I suggest consolidating the description of study participants under a single heading, such as &#x02018;Study participants and sampling&#x02019;. This will allow for a separate &#x02018;Data collection&#x02019; heading to describe the procedures, starting with the sentence &#x02018;The interviewees at district-level &#x02026;&#x02019;.</p><p> The last paragraph under the data collection heading could be shortened. For example, there is no need to mention that you deleted the audio recordings after translation.</p><p>
<bold>Findings:</bold>
</p><p> I note the quantitative approach to the reporting of qualitative data, and it is difficult to see the themes listed in Table 2 reflected in the findings. While the data analysis is stated to have followed inductive reasoning, and this is reflected in Table 2, the reporting of findings seems to follow a more deductive reasoning approach. I would like to see the findings reflect the themes in a revised version.</p><p> There is a typo in the first sentence following the &#x02018;Care Group interaction with HSAs and district officials&#x02019; heading: &#x02026; was the examine how &#x000e0; was to examine how.</p><p> Under the same heading, the fifth paragraph on p. 9 includes the same phrasing about &#x02018;no evidence&#x02019; as I have noted in the abstract. Again, I suggest to clarify that your empirical data indicate no coordination between HSAs and CGVs.</p><p>
<bold>Discussion:</bold>
</p><p> Is lengthy but sums up the findings nicely and puts them into context. I suggest to take a little time to see if you can make this section more concise.</p><p> In two instances (once in the discussion and once in the conclusion) the word whilst is misspelled whist.</p><p> Conclusion:</p><p> Typo in the second line &#x02013; terms -&#x0003e; term</p><p>
<bold>Figures</bold>
</p><p> Generally, the figures are hard to read due to the low resolution. I might be the version I have, however, if it is not, I suggest to remake them using Powerpoint or another program that can accommodate nice figures.</p><p>
<bold>Figure 2:</bold> Some of the content is illegible due to the resolution.

<bold>Abstract</bold>
</p><p> We note the removal of intervention related terminology in the methods section, however the results sections does not report the themes as recommended.</p><p>
<bold>Introduction</bold>
</p><p> There is greater clarity in the introduction in terms of providing context to the study. Similarly, there is a coherence between Figure 1 and 2, in describing the input of the national care groups and where they fit within national health policy. There is a much better integration between the content in the introduction culminating in the aim of the study.</p><p> Aims and objectives are clearly articulated and description of the study location including relevant statistics is very useful. As no data were presented on rates of breastfeeding, please comment on whether they do not exist or provide for this area.</p><p>
<bold>Methods </bold>
</p><p> &#x000a0;We recommended that It would be good to have an explanation as to why the village headmen were included but no changes in this regard were noted and does require a comment.</p><p>
<bold>Sampling and data collection</bold>
</p><p> As per our previous feedback, purposive and randomization were mentioned in the abstract and the latter is more commonly used in quantitative studies. Thus, the rationale and a supporting defense of their use for qualitative research is required. Furthermore, convenience sampling is referred to under sampling and requires explanation and amendment. Table would benefit from interpretive comment after the Table so the reader is guided to the key points.</p><p>
<bold>Data Analysis</bold>
</p><p> Reference to Taguette software needs greater clarity as either was ort was not used as opposed to &#x02018;could&#x02019; be used. The &#x02018;themes&#x02019; as described in Table 2, column 1 are not sufficiently labelled to be described correctly as a theme. This challenge would explain the theme names were not inserted into the abstract as recommended. For example, the first one contain &#x02018;experience&#x02019;, &#x02018;challenges&#x02019; and &#x02018;problems&#x02019;. The references are used incorrectly in the title of the Table.</p><p>
<bold>Findings</bold>
</p><p> The opening sentence is not appropriate under the heading findings., please revise. The sentence starting &#x02018;key themes, should list the themes as recommended above instead the first theme appears to be drawn from Row 2 of column one of Table 2. Revisit and revise for all other themes. While the authors have made attempts to present more thematically rather than by objectives, further substantial revision is necessary if the study is to align with typical thematic analysis.</p><p>
<bold>Discussion</bold>
</p><p> The previous recommendation regarding the structure of discussion has not yet been realized. An opening statement on the sample and who they represent is necessary. This should be followed by signposting on the direction of the discussion, e.g. it could be organized around the themes as previously recommended.</p><p>Is the work clearly and accurately presented and does it cite the current literature?</p><p>Partly</p><p>If applicable, is the statistical analysis and its interpretation appropriate?</p><p>Not applicable</p><p>Are all the source data underlying the results available to ensure full reproducibility?</p><p>Partly</p><p>Is the study design appropriate and is the work technically sound?</p><p>Partly</p><p>Are the conclusions drawn adequately supported by the results?</p><p>Partly</p><p>Are sufficient details of methods and analysis provided to allow replication by others?</p><p>Partly</p><p>Reviewer Expertise:</p><p>Prof Leahy-Warren has a h-index of 22 (Scopus)/30, with over 100 peer review publications and in excess of &#x020ac;4.5 M funding as Pi, co-PI, particularly focused on breastfeeding research and maternal and infant health generally.&#x000a0; &#x000a0; &#x000a0; &#x000a0; &#x000a0; &#x000a0; &#x000a0; &#x000a0; &#x000a0; &#x000a0; &#x000a0; &#x000a0; &#x000a0; &#x000a0; &#x000a0; &#x000a0; &#x000a0; &#x000a0; &#x000a0; &#x000a0; &#x000a0; &#x000a0; &#x000a0; &#x000a0; &#x000a0; &#x000a0; &#x000a0; &#x000a0; &#x000a0; &#x000a0; &#x000a0; &#x000a0; &#x000a0; &#x000a0;Dr Helen Mulcahy is senior lecturer community health and has very strong educational and clinical backgrounds specific to qualitative research, parental concern, breastfeeding, primary care, community and public health nursing.</p><p>We confirm that we have read this submission and believe that we have an appropriate level of expertise to confirm that it is of an acceptable scientific standard, however we have significant reservations, as outlined above.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reviewer-report" id="report40619"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.21956/hrbopenres.15229.r40619</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer response for version 2</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Tan</surname><given-names>May Loong</given-names></name><xref rid="r40619a1" ref-type="aff">1</xref><xref rid="r40619a2" ref-type="aff">2</xref><role>Referee</role><contrib-id contrib-id-type="orcid">https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5917-5049</contrib-id></contrib><aff id="r40619a1">

It is a very interesting study and has a direct local impact and lessons for the broader community.&#x000a0; I appreciate the complexity of the study, particularly the diversity of the participants, and the area where the study was conducted. It was very easy to get confused while reading the paper because of this. Therefore, it is important that reporting is clear. Most of my comments revolve around this.

It is not clear what are the 2 interventions.&#x000a0;</p><p> Sampling&#x000a0; and data collection: In the abstract it was stated that the sampling of mothers was random. This needs to be described in the methods with more details of&#x000a0; the random sampling was done. From the current description, we know that the Village headman was first approached, who then introduced the team ti the HSA, and the HSA led the team to the mothers.

Table 1 is not very intuitive; additional text is needed to explain why is this important and relevant to the study.</p><p> 4. Results:</p><p> In general, the results were presented like a quantitative study. There were no themes shown as one would expect from a qualitative study using thematic analysis.&#x000a0;Sectioning the results per objective, while systematic, loses the qualitative value of the study.</p><p> I understand the authors' intention to show the numbers, but these numbers need to be interpreted with much caution. The study wasn't designed as such therefore, the quantitative results should be limited.</p><p> Figure 1: While it does complement the paper, it should not be the star.</p><p> The themes were not clearly presented. The qualitative analysis was thematic analysis but results did not present the themes.</p><p> 5. Discussion:</p><p> This section was able to draw together the findings presented in the results section. The section could start with a summary of the findings (see my comment in Conclusion). One thing missing from the discussion is the potential changes to be implemented if CGs are still relevant to the community. What further actions has been taken or should be taken?</p><p> 6.

</p><p> Table 1: Spelling error: &#x000a0;&#x0201c;audit trail&#x0201d; instead of &#x0201c;trial&#x0201d;. Table 1 is not very intuitive; additional text is needed to explain why is this important and relevant to the study.</p><p>
<italic toggle="yes">[
<bold>response:</bold> We were asked to include this table to demonstrate that we had done enough to ensure the trustworthiness of this study. It has been moved to a more appropriate location and we have uploaded an image of the table rather than a word file, which did not download well when we tried]</italic>
</p><p> 4. Results:</p><p> In general, the results were presented like a quantitative study. There were no themes shown as one would expect from a qualitative study using thematic analysis.&#x000a0;Sectioning the results per objective, while systematic, loses the qualitative value of the study.</p><p>
<italic toggle="yes">[
<bold>response:</bold> we agree, a table of key themes has now been added to the findings, and the findings chapter has been reworked to remove some of the focus on the numbers, and to bring out the themes and responses]</italic>
</p><p> I understand the authors' intention to show the numbers, but these numbers need to be interpreted with much caution. The study wasn't designed as such therefore, the quantitative results should be limited.</p><p> Figure 1: While it does complement the paper, it should not be the star.</p><p>
<italic toggle="yes">[
<bold>response:</bold> the table has now been removed]</italic>
</p><p> The themes were not clearly presented. The qualitative analysis was thematic analysis but results did not present the themes.</p><p>
<italic toggle="yes">[
<bold>response:</bold> a table with the themes has now been added at the end of the data analysis section and the themes have now been given more prominence in the text]</italic>
</p><p> 5. Discussion:</p><p> This section was able to draw together the findings presented in the results section. The section could start with a summary of the findings (see my comment in Conclusion). One thing missing from the discussion is the potential changes to be implemented if CGs are still relevant to the community. What further actions has been taken or should be taken?</p><p>
<italic toggle="yes">[
<bold>response: </bold>Thanks, this will be added (even though it is a difficult question to answer)]</italic>
</p><p> 6. Conclusion: This section is too long. The first paragraph is a summary of the results and would fit better as the first paragraph of the discussion.</p><p> The conclusion here must match the conclusion in the abstract.</p><p>
<italic toggle="yes">[
<bold>response: </bold>Thanks, we have taken these comments on board also, and moved the first paragraph to the discussion section. The abstract has been rewritten and does now match better with the conclusion]</italic>

<bold>The abstract</bold>
</p><p> The title, aim and design of study need to be made explicit and be consistent throughout. The abstract provides too much irrelevant details in the methods section and should instead state the design, the setting and the final sample, without providing confusing numbers.&#x000a0;</p><p> The results need to describe the themes identified. Furthermore,&#x000a0;given the current title relates to evaluation, it is unclear why you would select an area where the intervention had not started.</p><p> In general, it is best to use language relevant to qualitative inquiry rather than numbers and the conclusion needs to reflect the findings.</p><p>
<bold>Introduction</bold>
</p><p> In terms of up to date literature, the authors' previous realist synthesis was cited but it would have been useful to have a summary within this paper to have context for the reader. It would be useful to introduce how many African mothers are undermined in relation to the value of EBM by the lack of legislation in relation to the marketing of infant formula. This could be positioned&#x000a0;after the reference Guenther et al., 2019.</p><p> On page 3 and throughout,&#x000a0;your underlining needs to be explained to the reader. Consider editing page 3 to be more succinct and focused on breastfeeding. The final paragraph leading into the Aim, would suggest that a systematic review is following so this requires revision to lead in to the study.</p><p> The section entitled 'aims and objectives' needs to be revised as there needs to be coherence between the title, aim and study design. The findings of this review (Pieterse et al., 2021) needs to be integrated into the above literature/background.&#x000a0;</p><p>
<bold>Methods</bold>
</p><p> A 'qualitative approach'&#x000a0;is a research paradigm and a specific research design needs to be explained, and rationalized with supporting references.</p><p> It would be good to have an explanation as to why the village headmen were included.</p><p> The&#x000a0; two paragraphs preceding 'research setting' should be edited and integrated into the background section.</p><p> Within the section starting with '... 20% up to ...19 to 29', should be revised and edited and placed appropriately within the background.</p><p> The sentence beginning '...In Dedza, 18%...' needs to be made explicit in the context of sampling.</p><p>
<bold>Sampling and Data Collection</bold>
</p><p> The first sentence from '...to explore how and from....to '...most recent baby/ies...'&#x000a0;needs to be revised for clarity.</p><p> This section needs to include: who are the population of interest, what is the sampling strategy and how is it defended, how many were recruited and how &#x000a0;many participated. Purposive and randomization were mentioned in the abstract and the latter is more commonly used in quantitative studies. Thus the rationale and a supporting defense of their use for qualitative research is required.</p><p> Data collection needs to more succinctly described and summarized, including the interview guide rather than referring the reader to another paper. The reader needs to know what were they asked.</p><p>
<bold>Data Analysis</bold>
</p><p> The first lengthy sentence requires clarity as does the use of brackets.</p><p> The order in which data analysis was done is not clear.&#x000a0;Describe data analysis as per the process and end with leading into key themes. The Table in terms of trustworthiness is inappropriately positioned within the paper and also requires text of description and interpretation.&#x000a0;</p><p>
<bold>Results</bold>
</p><p> Use of the term findings are more applicable to qualitative studies and you may consider changing. This&#x000a0;section needs to have an opening sentence to present the characteristics of the sample followed by the themes and how they addressed the objectives of the study. Rather than presenting in question and answer format, the themes need to be used to better effect to summarize and interpret the data from the themes rather than the objectives. What does the underlining of some text mean for the reader? Reference to policy within the results section causes confusion and should be integrated within the discussion.&#x000a0;&#x000a0;</p><p>
<bold>Discussion</bold>
</p><p> This section would benefit from an opening statement on the sample and who they represent. This should be followed by signposting on the direction of the discussion, e.g. it could be organized around the themes.</p><p> Reference to numerical responses at the discussion stage needs to be presented earlier and it needs to be clarified here in the discussion. Then specify the patterns and variations that were found and how these compare to previous literature or are these novel findings. The concept of efficacy in this context needs to be explained earlier in the paper and also how this was measured. The discussion needs to be edited to focus on the themes and your findings. Then compare and contrast these with previous literature. Highlight novel results from this study in making an important contribution to the body of knowledge.&#x000a0;</p><p> The paragraph immediately prior to recommendations seems inappropriately placed and like above all findings need to be discussed in the context of empirical and also relevant grey literature&#x000a0; (e.g. Malawi's Department of Health). Recommendations need to start with your study findings so that they are specifically emerging from your findings.&#x000a0;</p><p> Prof Patricia Leahy-Warren</p><p> Dr Helen Mulcahy&#x000a0;</p><p> School of Nursing and Midwifery, University College, Cork</p><p>Is the work clearly and accurately presented and does it cite the current literature?</p><p>Partly</p><p>If applicable, is the statistical analysis and its interpretation appropriate?</p><p>Not applicable</p><p>Are all the source data underlying the results available to ensure full reproducibility?</p><p>Partly</p><p>Is the study design appropriate and is the work technically sound?</p><p>Partly</p><p>Are the conclusions drawn adequately supported by the results?</p><p>Partly</p><p>Are sufficient details of methods and analysis provided to allow replication by others?</p><p>Partly</p><p>Reviewer Expertise:</p><p>Prof Leahy-Warren has a h-index of 22 (Scopus)/30, with over 100 peer review publications and in excess of &#x020ac;4.5 M funding as Pi, co-PI, particularly focused on breastfeeding research and maternal and infant health generally.&#x000a0; &#x000a0; &#x000a0; &#x000a0; &#x000a0; &#x000a0; &#x000a0; &#x000a0; &#x000a0; &#x000a0; &#x000a0; &#x000a0; &#x000a0; &#x000a0; &#x000a0; &#x000a0; &#x000a0; &#x000a0; &#x000a0; &#x000a0; &#x000a0; &#x000a0; &#x000a0; &#x000a0; &#x000a0; &#x000a0; &#x000a0; &#x000a0; &#x000a0; &#x000a0; &#x000a0; &#x000a0; &#x000a0; &#x000a0;Dr Helen Mulcahy is senior lecturer community health and has very strong educational and clinical backgrounds specific to qualitative research, parental concern, breastfeeding, primary care, community and public health nursing.</p><p>We confirm that we have read this submission and believe that we have an appropriate level of expertise to confirm that it is of an acceptable scientific standard, however we have significant reservations, as outlined above.</p></body><sub-article article-type="response" id="comment3620-36637"><front-stub><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Pieterse</surname><given-names>Pieternella</given-names></name><aff>Science and Health, Dublin City University, Glasnevin, Dublin, Ireland</aff></contrib></contrib-group><author-notes><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>

<bold>The abstract </bold>
</p><p> The title, aim and design of study need to be made explicit and be consistent throughout.

<bold>Introduction</bold>
</p><p> In terms of up to date literature, the authors' previous realist synthesis was cited but it would have been useful to have a summary within this paper to have context for the reader.</p><p>
<italic toggle="yes">[response: a summary has now been added]</italic>
</p><p> It would be useful to introduce how many African mothers are undermined in relation to the value of EBM by the lack of legislation in relation to the marketing of infant formula. This could be positioned&#x000a0;after the reference Guenther et al., 2019.</p><p>
<italic toggle="yes">[response: we agree and have added a reference to this, in the paragraph before the one you indicated just before the reference by Victora et al 2016]</italic>

<italic toggle="yes">[response: the underlining has been removed]</italic>
</p><p> Consider editing page 3 to be more succinct and focused on breastfeeding. The final paragraph leading into the Aim, would suggest that a systematic review is following so this requires revision to lead into the study.</p><p>
<italic toggle="yes">[response: The wording has now been changed]</italic>
</p><p> The section entitled 'aims and objectives' needs to be revised as there needs to be coherence between the title, aim and study design.</p><p>
<italic toggle="yes">[response: the study title and the aim are now the exact same]</italic>
</p><p> The findings of this review (Pieterse et al., 2021) needs to be integrated into the above literature/background.&#x000a0;</p><p>
<italic toggle="yes">[response: a summary of this study has now been added]</italic>
</p><p>
<bold>Methods</bold>
</p><p> A 'qualitative approach'&#x000a0;is a research paradigm and a specific research design needs to be explained, and rationalized with supporting references.</p><p>
<italic toggle="yes">[response: agreed, we have done so]</italic>
</p><p> It would be good to have an explanation as to why the village headmen were included.</p><p>
<italic toggle="yes">[response: the text already included the following text: &#x0201c;To examine the role that healthcare providers, community leaders and district health officials&#x02019; play in supporting and integrating Care Groups into the communities, we interviewed village headmen, HSAs and a number of district- level health officials, as well as an NGO representative.&#x0201d; Our Malawi-based research team designed the data collection protocol, which started with a curtsey call to the village headman in each community, then an introduction to the HSAs, etc. - we included the data collected from all individuals.&#x000a0;</italic>
</p><p> The&#x000a0; two paragraphs preceding 'research setting' should be edited and integrated into the background section.</p><p>
<italic toggle="yes">[response: we agree and this has move been moved.]</italic>
</p><p> Within the section starting with '... 20% up to ...19 to 29', should be revised and edited and placed appropriately within the background.</p><p> The sentence beginning '...In Dedza, 18%...' needs to be made explicit in the context of sampling.</p><p>

<bold>Data Analysis</bold>
</p><p> The first lengthy sentence requires clarity as does the use of brackets.</p><p>
