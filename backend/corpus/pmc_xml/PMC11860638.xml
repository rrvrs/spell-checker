Introduction</title><p>Cadmium (Cd) is a highly toxic heavy metal that exists in the natural environment. It cannot be biodegraded and is prone to long-term accumulation in the body, thereby damaging tissues and organs [<xref rid="B1-toxics-13-00129" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Despite various measures taken by many countries to control Cd pollution, it still exists in many regions. Cd has wide-ranging applications in industry and agriculture, such as printing and dyeing, electroplating, insecticides, fungicides, paints, and other industries. The sources of Cd pollution in the environment are very complex. The first type is natural sources, such as rock weathering caused by natural activities, and the second type is anthropogenic sources. For example, Cd primarily originates from industrial production (e.g., the smelting of copper, lead, and zinc), the production of aviation materials, and the manufacturing of electrical appliances. It may also come from the discharge of Cd-containing wastewater, the widespread use of Cd containing fertilizers and pesticides in agricultural production, and the non-professional disposal of cadmium batteries. Cd in the environment enters human or animal bodies through biological enrichment, including the food chain, leading to the occurrence of Cd-poisoning-related diseases [<xref rid="B2-toxics-13-00129" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>Cd accumulation in the body is caused by inhalation, ingestion, and even direct contact with contaminated air, water, and food. Cd is transported into various parts of the body after entering it, easily accumulating in multiple organs. Cd is difficult to eliminate for a long time due to its long half-life, leading to diseases in tissues or organs such as the kidneys, blood, liver, and testes. Renal injury is usually caused by chronic exposure to Cd, and the condition is difficult to reverse or may even be irreversible.</p><p>The kidneys are the main metabolic and target organs of Cd poisoning [<xref rid="B3-toxics-13-00129" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. When Cd poisoning occurs, the Cd metallothionein complex in tissue cells enters the bloodstream due to the filtering effect of the glomerulus. It further reaches the kidneys, where it is reabsorbed by the renal tubules and continuously accumulates after chronic Cd exposure [<xref rid="B4-toxics-13-00129" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Long-term exposure to Cd can lead to metabolic disorders and the excessive accumulation of Cd in the kidneys, as well as calcium loss in the body. Cd damages the kidneys, manifesting as changes in the renal function indicators: uric acid (UA), creatinine (Cre), or blood urea nitrogen (BUN). It can even induce renal cell death [<xref rid="B5-toxics-13-00129" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-toxics-13-00129" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The mechanism of action of Cd primarily involves activating the endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) pathway, leading to cell apoptosis in chicken kidney [<xref rid="B7-toxics-13-00129" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Fish treated with CdCl<sub>2</sub> experienced oxidative stress that altered Nrf2-Keap1 signaling and triggered piscine head kidney macrophage apoptosis [<xref rid="B8-toxics-13-00129" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the core of the eukaryotic cell membrane system, accounting for approximately 50% of the cell membrane. According to whether ribosomes are attached to the lumen surface, ER can be divided into the rough endoplasmic reticulum or smooth endoplasmic reticulum. The rough ER has a large number of ribosomes attached to its surface, presenting a granular appearance and mostly large flat membrane vesicles arranged neatly. The surface of the smooth ER is relatively smooth, without ribosome attachment, and is usually small and tubular or vesicular [<xref rid="B9-toxics-13-00129" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Excessive accumulation of nonfolding proteins in the ER can cause an imbalance in the ER environment, leading to ERS. Short-term or mild ERS can enhance protein folding ability, promote the degradation of abnormal proteins, and re-establish the balance of the ER environment. However, strong or sustained ERS can lead to an unfolded protein response (UPR), thereby promoting the activation of caspase-12-dependent apoptotic pathways in cells, leading to cell apoptosis and even cell death [<xref rid="B10-toxics-13-00129" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-toxics-13-00129" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. UPR activation is mediated by three stress sensors: inositol dependent enzyme 1 alpha (IRE1&#x003b1;), transmembrane receptor protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase (PERK), and activated transcription factor 6. These stress sensors are combined with ER partner GRP78 under nonstress conditions. ERS such as stress caused by the accumulation of unfolded proteins activates UPR by separating the stress sensor from GRP78 [<xref rid="B12-toxics-13-00129" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Apoptosis is the autonomous and orderly death of cells controlled by genes. UPR can lead to cell apoptosis caused by ER overload when ERS is excessive and steady-state reconstruction fails. ERS activates apoptosis as follows [<xref rid="B13-toxics-13-00129" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-toxics-13-00129" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. (1) In the IRE1&#x003b1;/XBP1 pathway, activated IRE1&#x003b1;-activating enzyme activity further cleaves the mRNA of XBP to produce transcription factors encoding XBP1, causing a large accumulation of unfolded proteins in the cell. These abnormally accumulated proteins activate the UPR through the IRE1&#x003b1;/XBP1 pathway and induce cell apoptosis. (2) In the PERK pathway, PERK undergoes biochemical processes such as autophosphorylation, leading to the phosphorylation of eIF2 &#x003b1; and expression of ATF4. (3) The ATF6 apoptosis pathway involves the dissociation of ATF6 from GRP78 protein and its transfer to the Golgi apparatus. It is cleaved by S1P and S2P to form cleaved ATF6, which enters the nucleus and activates CHOP gene expression, inducing cell apoptosis.</p><p>Quercetin (Que) is a flavonol compound with multiple biological activities [<xref rid="B15-toxics-13-00129" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. It exists in high abundance in the leaves, fruits or seeds of many plants, with higher levels found in onions, kale, grapes, wine, green tea, and apples. Que has excellent biological and pharmacological activities, including antioxidant effects, the inhibition of an angiotensin-converting enzyme, anti-inflammatory effects, antibacterial effects, anticancer properties, and antiviral effects [<xref rid="B16-toxics-13-00129" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Que exists in the form of glycosides and has high medicinal value, making it very beneficial to health. It can also be used as a food supplement. However, due to its short half-life, low water solubility, and rapid metabolism in the body, its bioavailability is relatively low [<xref rid="B17-toxics-13-00129" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-toxics-13-00129" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>In the present research, SD rats were treated with Cd and/or Que. The action of the IRE1&#x003b1;-XBP1 signaling pathway in Cd-induced nephrotoxicity was investigated, to elucidate its association with Cd-induced renal apoptosis under ERS and the protective effect of Que.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-toxics-13-00129"><title>2.

Que is a natural antioxidant substance with biological activities such as antioxidant, antiviral, antihypertensive, and immune regulation activities [<xref rid="B16-toxics-13-00129" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B23-toxics-13-00129" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24-toxics-13-00129" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Quercetin is one of the most abundant natural polyphenols in food. Natural quercetin is found in foods such as wine, black tea, and green tea. The recommended daily dose of quercetin in dietary supplements is usually below 1000 mg. Administration of 1000 mg of quercetin and 1000 mg of vitamin C daily is recommended for the treatment of patients who have had one or more chronic diseases for 12 weeks. After treatment with Que, no negative changes were observed in safety parameters such as hematocrit and hemoglobin [<xref rid="B18-toxics-13-00129" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In our study, the dose of Que used was 100 mg/kg body weight. Recent studies have shown that Que can effectively alleviate kidney damage caused by Cd [<xref rid="B25-toxics-13-00129" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. However, the mechanism of Cd-induced kidney injury remains unclear. Whether Que can inhibit Cd-induced kidney injury also warrants further research.</p><p>UA is the final product of purine metabolism in the body and is primarily excreted through the kidneys. UA plays an important role in regulating animal growth and reproduction. Under normal circumstances, the production and excretion of UA in the body are in a balanced state. However, when the body produces too much UA and cannot excrete it in a timely manner or its excretion mechanism gradually deteriorates, excessive accumulation of UA can occur. Urea, as the main end-product of protein metabolism in the body, is the main component of non-protein nitrogen in the blood. The process of protein synthesis requires a large amount of amino acids and various non-essential amino acids, with urea being the main one. Due to the effects of kidney failure and nephritis, the content of urea nitrogen in the blood significantly increases, and it is primarily excreted through the kidneys. Cre is a substance produced during the process of muscle energy production, and it is metabolized by phosphocreatine. Healthy kidneys can filter creatinine from the blood. It is a commonly used indicator with which to measure renal filtration function. Therefore, the Cre level in the blood reflects the filtering function of the kidneys and is an important indicator for detecting kidney function. In clinical practice, changes in UA, Cre, and BUN levels are commonly used to determine the conditions of kidney function. When the kidney is damaged, the cellular structure of the kidney is damaged to a certain extent, and the levels of UA, Cre, and BUN increase. This study found that the levels of UA, Cre, and BUN in the serum of Cd-treated rats significantly increased. Huang et al. treated C57BL/6 mice with 2 mg/kg/d CdCl<sub>2</sub> intraperitoneally, and in agreement with our results, found that the levels of serum urea nitrogen and Cre in the Cd-treated group were higher than those in the control group [<xref rid="B26-toxics-13-00129" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Compared with the Cd group, the levels of UA, Cre, and BUN in the Cd + Que-treatment groups significantly decreased. Lead reportedly induces renal oxidative stress, as manifested by significantly increased levels of renal markers such as UA and Cre. Conversely, naringin can significantly attenuate the biochemical changes induced by lead in serum and renal tissue [<xref rid="B27-toxics-13-00129" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Rats were orally administered CdCl<sub>2</sub>, and after four weeks, serum levels of UA, Cre, and BUN increased, whereas the Cre clearance rate significantly decreased [<xref rid="B28-toxics-13-00129" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Que treatment significantly alleviated the Cd-induced biochemical changes in serum, urine, and renal function. The above results are similar to those of the present experiment, indicating that Cd can cause renal dysfunction in rats, and Que exerted a certain alleviating effect on Cd-induced kidney injury in rats.</p><p>The degree of Cd-induced kidney tissue damage is related to factors such as dosage, route, and time of administration [<xref rid="B29-toxics-13-00129" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Our results showed that the control and Que groups had renal tubules with a normal structure, glomeruli, and their cystic cavities. However, compared with the control group, the Cd-treated rat kidney showed significantly more significant glomerular atrophy, wider renal glomeruli, and larger tubular volumes (<xref rid="toxics-13-00129-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). Unlike the Cd treatment group, the number and degree of glomerular atrophies were significantly reduced in the Cd + Que-treatment group, indicating that Que is able to reduce the kidney damage induced by Cd due to its inhibition of Cd toxicity.</p><p>Apoptosis is an important pathway of Cd-induced nephrotoxicity injury, and Cd-induced apoptosis can be detected by the TUNEL method [<xref rid="B30-toxics-13-00129" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The green fluorescence shows the apoptosis cells. The number of apoptotic cells increased significantly in the Cd-treatment rats. These results indicate that Cd led to renal cell apoptosis, resulting in an increased number of apoptotic cells, consistent with the findings of Ding&#x02019;s studies, in which they observed cadmium-induced BRL-3A cell apoptosis [<xref rid="B19-toxics-13-00129" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. However, the number of apoptotic cells in the Cd + Que treatment group was significantly reduced compared with that in the Cd treatment group. Caspase-12 containing cysteine is a unique hydrolytic protease that is specifically bound to the ER membrane and can serve as a marker for the ERS-induced apoptosis pathway. After ERS activation, it can cleave activated Caspase-9, thereby activating Caspase-3, which can decompose cell structure, leading to cell apoptosis. The apoptosis mediated by ERS primarily occurs through Caspase-12 activation [<xref rid="B10-toxics-13-00129" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. It is well known that ER-resident caspase-12 triggers apoptotic cell death. Mice lacking caspase-12 exhibit resistance to endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced cell apoptosis [<xref rid="B31-toxics-13-00129" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Apoptosis has important biological significance and is a phenomenon of autonomous and orderly cell death controlled by genes. It plays an important role in maintaining the stability of the internal environment of the body. Apoptosis is a process strictly controlled by multiple genes, among which Bax is a key regulatory gene. The Bax protein belongs to the Bcl-2 family and is a pro-apoptotic protein [<xref rid="B32-toxics-13-00129" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The results of this study showed that compared with the control group, the mRNA and protein expression levels of Caspase-12, Caspase-3, and Bax in the kidneys were significantly increased after Cd exposure. Marta Biagioli et al. obtained similar results. They observed that cadmium decreased ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals. They concluded that Cd-induced NIH 3T3 cell death triggered by ER stress and involving caspase-12 activity could be mitigated [<xref rid="B33-toxics-13-00129" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. However, the mRNA and protein levels of Caspase-12, Caspase-3, and Bax of the Cd + Que treatment group were significantly reduced. This study indicated that Que is able to reduce Cd-induced renal cell apoptosis.</p><p>GRP78 is a marker molecule for ERS. It has multiple physiological functions and is primarily involved in protein folding, the regulation of the ERS response, and tumor occurrence and development, as well as in the regulation of cell migration and the capacity for invasion [<xref rid="B34-toxics-13-00129" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The IRE1&#x003b1;/XBP1 pathway takes part in the unfolded protein response (UPR) in the endoplasmic reticulum and is one of the signaling pathways that activate ERS. Under ERS, the expression of IRE1&#x003b1; is upregulated, and the activated IRE1&#x003b1; dissociates from GRP78 and undergoes phosphorylation. Activated IRE1&#x02019;s activating enzyme activity further cleaves the mRNA of XBP to produce transcription factors encoding XBP1. It can act on the mRNA of XBP-1, splicing and removing 26 introns of XBP-1 mRNA, rapidly translating it into a large number of XBP1s, inducing the expression of molecular chaperones and folding enzymes, and promoting correct protein folding [<xref rid="B35-toxics-13-00129" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Under ERS, it causes an accumulation of a large number of unfolded proteins in the cell. These abnormally accumulated proteins activate the UPR through the IRE1/XBP1 pathway and induce cell apoptosis [<xref rid="B14-toxics-13-00129" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. IRE1 &#x003b1; contains protein kinase and RNAse activity, activates the XBP1 protein, and participates in regulating the expression of downstream CHOP and other genes.</p><p>The activation of the IRE1&#x003b1;/XBP1 pathway is associated with apoptosis [<xref rid="B36-toxics-13-00129" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. IRE1&#x003b1; overexpression can significantly downregulate the level of Polo-like kinase 1, thereby exacerbating the apoptosis level of liver cancer cells. In zebrafish models, the drug-induced activation of the ERS IRE1&#x003b1;/XBP1 pathway can promote lipid overproduction, which in turn affects glucose metabolism by regulating insulin levels, leading to liver cell apoptosis [<xref rid="B37-toxics-13-00129" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Additionally, upregulating the IRE1&#x003b1;/XBP1 pathway can further induce cell apoptosis by activating the JNK pathway [<xref rid="B38-toxics-13-00129" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Our results showed a significant increase in the GRP78 of mRNA and protein levels in the kidneys of Cd treatment group, indicating that Cd activates ERS, and the transmembrane protein dissociates from its molecular partner GRP78, resulting in an increase in GRP78 levels. At the same time, the mRNA and protein expression of GRP78 significantly decreased in the Cd + Que treatment group, indicating that Que has the ability to inhibit the dissociation of GRP78 to alleviate ERS. The gene and protein levels of IRE1 &#x003b1; and XBP1 significantly increased in the Cd treatment group. This discovery suggested that the elevated levels of GRP78 induced by cadmium treatment further activate the IRE1&#x003b1;-XBP1 signaling pathway of ERS. However, compared with those parameters in the Cd treatment group, the mRNA and protein expression contents of IRE1 &#x003b1; and XBP1 were reduced in the Cd + Que treatment group, indicating that Que can inhibit the expression of IRE1&#x003b1; signaling pathway-related genes in ERS, and to some extent alleviate the ERS caused by Cd. The function of ERS has a bidirectional regulatory effect, and the survival and death of cells are determined by the severity of ERS. Mild ERS induces an unfolded protein response, and promotes the correct folding of proteins, thereby alleviating ERS and exerting cell protective effects. However, long-term or severe ERS can trigger the apoptotic pathway, inducing cell apoptosis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec5-toxics-13-00129"><title>5.
