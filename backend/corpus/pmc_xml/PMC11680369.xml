Introduction</title><p>Pancreatic cancer, recognized for its high degree of malignancy and grim prognosis, is marked by distressing increases in incidence and mortality rates annually. Most pancreatic cancers are exocrine adenocarcinomas, encompassing pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and pancreatic acinar cell carcinoma (PACC). PDAC is the predominant type, accounting for approximately 80% to 90% of all pancreatic cancer cases and being associated with an exceptionally poor prognosis. Conversely, PACC, which represents approximately 1% of pancreatic cancers, has a relatively more favorable prognosis compared to PDAC [<xref rid="B1-vaccines-12-01309" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Currently, surgical resection remains the most effective treatment option for pancreatic cancer; however, less than 20% of patients are eligible for surgery, with a median survival time of merely 6 months post surgery [<xref rid="B2-vaccines-12-01309" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Therefore, there is an urgent need to discover innovative and effective treatments.</p><p>Oncolytic viruses (OVs), which selectively replicate in and lyse cancer cells, hold significant therapeutic potential for solid tumors and advanced-stage cancers. They not only directly kill cancer cells but also elicit a tumor-specific immune response that aids in the clearance of residual tumors and metastases. Furthermore, when armed with external factors, OVs can perform immune therapeutic functions by expressing immune modulatory factors [<xref rid="B3-vaccines-12-01309" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-vaccines-12-01309" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Many viruses have been employed as oncolytic agents, including adenovirus, reovirus, poxvirus, herpesvirus, rhabdovirus, paramyxovirus, parvovirus, and picornavirus [<xref rid="B5-vaccines-12-01309" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-vaccines-12-01309" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-vaccines-12-01309" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Of them, herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) is the most widely used for OV development [<xref rid="B8-vaccines-12-01309" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-vaccines-12-01309" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. HSV-1 is an ideal OV candidate due to its broad cell tropism, robust oncolytic activity, substantial genome space for foreign gene insertion [<xref rid="B10-vaccines-12-01309" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], and proven clinical safety record [<xref rid="B11-vaccines-12-01309" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-vaccines-12-01309" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. For a better safety profile in cancer treatment, HSV-1 is usually attenuated through genetic modifications such as the deletion of virulence factors [<xref rid="B13-vaccines-12-01309" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The generation of oncolytic HSV involves the deletion of ICP34.5, which encodes a neurovirulence factor [<xref rid="B14-vaccines-12-01309" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-vaccines-12-01309" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], as well as ICP47, which enhances MHC I antigen processing and presentation to boost tumor-specific immune responses [<xref rid="B16-vaccines-12-01309" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Oncolytic HSV has been employed in the treatment of various cancers and has efficiently delivered immune-modulating factors [<xref rid="B17-vaccines-12-01309" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-vaccines-12-01309" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In 2015, talimogene laherparepvec (T-vec; by Amgen, Thousand Oaks, CA, USA) was approved by the FDA for the treatment of advanced melanoma, making it the first and only FDA-approved oncolytic HSV drug to date. It has been investigated in many clinical trials for other types of cancer, including glioma, head and neck cancer, and breast cancer [<xref rid="B19-vaccines-12-01309" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>The genetic manipulation of HSV-1 is essential for its safe and effective use in cancer treatment. Typically, the external genes employed for oncolytic HSV construction are immune modulators, including cytokines, chemokines, checkpoint inhibitors, co-stimulatory ligands, and immune-cell engagers [<xref rid="B20-vaccines-12-01309" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. 4-1BB (CD137, TNFRSF9) is a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) superfamily, expressed on cell membranes as monomers or dimers, and is a type I transmembrane protein. 4-1BBL (CD137L, TNFSF9) is a ligand for the 4-1BB receptor, which is generally expressed in the form of trimers on the cell membrane and is a type II transmembrane protein [<xref rid="B21-vaccines-12-01309" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. 4-1BBL is predominantly expressed on activated antigen-presenting cells (APCs) such as macrophages, DC cells, and B cells. 4-1BB and 4-1BBL are a pair of costimulatory molecules whose combination provides a second signal for T-cell activation. Many studies have confirmed that 4-1BB and 4-1BBL costimulatory molecules have great application value in cancer treatment [<xref rid="B22-vaccines-12-01309" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. 4-1BBL expressed in APC cells can promote T-cell function and enhance specific antitumor immune responses. Agonistic monoclonal antibodies targeting 4-1BB have been developed for cancer immunotherapy. Preclinical results in various tumor models (both induced and spontaneous) have shown that targeting 4-1BB with agonist antibodies leads to tumor clearance and durable antitumor immunity. Lokon Pharma&#x02032;s oncolytic virus, LOAd703, is an adenovirus-based oncolytic virus equipped with CD40L and 4-1BBL that has shown potent inhibition of pancreatic cancer in preclinical animal models [<xref rid="B23-vaccines-12-01309" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>To investigate the role of an oncolytic virus in combination with 4-1BB targeting pancreatic cancer treatment, we developed an oncolytic HSV armed with 4-1BBL (oHSV-4-1BBL). In this study, it is demonstrated that oHSV-4-1BBL inhibits tumor growth in both Pan02_HVEM (Pan02 cells expressing herpes virus entry mediator (HVEM)) and KPC pancreatic cancer models. Furthermore, the combination therapy of oHSV-4-1BBL and PD-1 antibody demonstrates enhanced therapeutic efficacy. These findings offer new insights into pancreatic cancer treatment strategies.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-vaccines-12-01309"><title>2.

First, the 4-1BBL mouse coding sequence was amplified by PCR from pCMV3-mTNFSF9 (4-1BBL) (Sino Biological, Beijing, China) and inserted into a plasmid with CMV elements. Secondly, the cassette containing the CMV enhancer, CMV promoter, m4-1BBL gene, and SV40 Poly A was cloned into a plasmid with ICP34.5 homology arms.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-vaccines-12-01309"><title>2.2. Cells</title><p>African green monkey kidney cell line Vero (originally obtained from ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA); murine pancreatic cell lines MPC-83 (originally from ATCC), KPC (Shanghai Model Organisms Center, Shanghai, China), Pan02 (from Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China), and Pan02-HVEM (transduced with a lentivirus encoding human HVEM as described previously [<xref rid="B24-vaccines-12-01309" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]); and human embryonic kidney cell sublines 293FT and 293FT-sgRNAGFP (stably expressing sgRNA against GFP) were cultured in DMEM (Biological Industries, Goettingen, Germany, 06-1055-57-1ACS) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco, Waltham, MA, USA, 16000-044) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (P/S, Solarbio, Beijing, China, P1400). All cells were incubated at 37 &#x000b0;C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3-vaccines-12-01309"><title>2.3. Virus Construction</title><p>The wild-type HSV-1 F strain (wt HSV-1) was obtained from Hongkai Zhang&#x02019;s laboratory at Nankai University and used for the construction of oncolytic viruses by the CRISPR/Cas9 system as described previously [<xref rid="B24-vaccines-12-01309" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-vaccines-12-01309" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-vaccines-12-01309" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Briefly, to generate the ICP34.5-deleted virus, donor DNA plasmids consisting of GFP and homology arms flanking ICP34.5 and sgRNA plasmid targeting ICP34.5 were transfected into 293FT cells. The next day, cells were infected with wt HSV-1. Two days post infection, supernatant containing the produced recombinant virus was serially diluted for plaque purification on Vero cells. The resulting GFP-positive virus was verified by PCR and fluorescence microscopy and further used as the backbone to generate the ICP47 knockout virus. The resulting virus was named oHSV and used as the backbone for further construction. To generate the 4-1BBL-armed oncolytic HSV, donor DNA plasmids containing the 4-1BBL-expressing cassette and homology arms flanking ICP34.5 were transfected into 293FT-sgRNAGFP cells, followed by oHSV infection the next day. Supernatant was harvested for plaque purification and identification of the 4-1BBL-positive virus.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot4-vaccines-12-01309"><title>2.4. Viral Propagation, Purification, and Concentration</title><p>For in vitro analysis, Vero cells were infected with oHSV-4-1BBL at an MOI of 0.05. The supernatant was collected 36 to 48 h after infection. The cell pellets were resuspended with 9% milk and went through three freeze&#x02013;thaw cycles to release the virus from cells. The virus from the supernatant and the cells were combined, aliquoted and stored at &#x02212;80 &#x000b0;C. To prepare the purified virus for animal experiments, Vero cells were infected with oHSV-4-1BBL at an MOI of 0.05. The supernatant of the virus culture medium was collected 72 h after infection for centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 10 min, followed by filtration with a 0.45 &#x003bc;m filter (Sartorius, Bohemia, NY, USA, 16533-K). Purification was performed with a HiScreen CaptoCore 700 column (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA, 17-5481-15) to remove cellular proteins and DNA. The viruses were concentrated with ultrafiltration tubes (Millipore, Burlington, MA, USA, UFC910096).</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot5-vaccines-12-01309"><title>2.5.

Results</title><sec id="sec3dot1-vaccines-12-01309"><title>3.1. Construction and In Vitro Characteristics of the oHSV-4-1BBL Virus</title><p>The oHSV-4-1BBL virus used in this study was genetically modified from the existing oHSV virus reported in our previous study [<xref rid="B24-vaccines-12-01309" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], which includes the deletion of the ICP34.5 and ICP47 genes and an the insertion of GFP fluorescent protein at the ICP34.5 gene location. To construct the oHSV-4-1BBL virus, the GFP was knocked out using the CRISPR-Cas9 system, followed by homologous recombination of murine 4-1BBL (m4-1BBL) into the location of GFP in the oHSV virus (<xref rid="vaccines-12-01309-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A). ICP34.5 is a neurotoxic factor that, when knocked out, reduces the virus&#x02032;s resistance to interferon and PKR proteins in normal cells, allowing it to selectively replicate in tumor cells. ICP47 knockout can augment the expression of MHC-I in infected cells, thereby facilitating the presentation of tumor-associated antigens and enhancing the host immune response to tumors. Following viral infection, the loaded 4-1BBL gene can be expressed in tumor cells, binding to the 4-1BB receptor to stimulate T cells to elicit the immune response.</p><p>To verify the construction of the virus, a viral genome was extracted and sent out for sequencing. It showed that the 4-1BBL sequence was inserted as designed. In addition, 4-1BBL expression after infection was tested in different tumor cells by flow cytometry. <xref rid="vaccines-12-01309-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>B illustrates that 4-1BBL was expressed on the surfaces of Vero, Pan02_HVEM, and KPC cells, indicating the successful construction of the oHSV-4-1BBL.</p><p>To assess the impact of the 4-1BBL gene on viral characteristics, we compared the in vitro infection profiles of oHSV and oHSV-4-1BBL in terms of cytopathic effect (CPE), cell viability, and viral replication kinetics. Our findings revealed that both viruses barely induced CPE in Pan02 cells, which lack HSV-1 infection receptors. In contrast, a remarkable CPE was observed post infection with both viruses in Pan02_HVEM, MPC-83, and KPC cells (<xref rid="vaccines-12-01309-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>C). This suggests that oHSV and oHSV-4-1BBL share identical infection profiles against pancreatic cancer cells. In terms of the replication kinetics, Vero cells, which are deficient in type I interferon, seemed to be the most susceptible cell line for all three viruses compared to the pancreatic cancer cells. In addition, all three viruses had strikingly similar patterns across all tested cell lines, except that oHSV and oHSV-4-1BBL exhibited slightly lower replication capacity than HSV-1 (<xref rid="vaccines-12-01309-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>D). Cell viability was determined to indicate the cytotoxic capacity of oHSV and oHSV-4-1BBL after infection with different MOIs (0.1, 1, and 10). It was demonstrated that the cell viability decreased with time and increases in the MOI for the two viruses. Vero and MPC-83 cells seemed to be more vulnerable than Pan02-HVEM and KPC cells. It should be noted that both oHSV and oHSV-4-1BBL viruses exhibited similar cytotoxic patterns in all cell lines (<xref rid="vaccines-12-01309-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>E). Collectively, these results demonstrate that the two viruses have nearly identical characteristics, indicating that the insertion of 4-1BBL did not impact the growth or cytotoxic capacity of the virus.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot2-vaccines-12-01309"><title>3.2. oHSV-4-1BBL Exhibits Superior Antitumor Activity Compared to oHSV</title><p>To evaluate the antitumor efficacy of the oncolytic virus, we employed two mouse models of pancreatic cancer: Pan02_HVEM and KPC. When tumors reached ~50&#x02009;mm<sup>3</sup> (approximately 7 and 4 days post inoculation for Pan02_HVEM and KPC cells, respectively), tumor-bearing mice were treated with PBS or purified oHSV or oHSV-4-1BBL three times (<xref rid="vaccines-12-01309-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>A). In the Pan02-HVEM model, both oHSV and oHSV-4-1BBL remarkably inhibited tumor growth compared to the PBS treatment group. It is worth noting that oHSV-4-1BBL showed enhanced antitumor effects relative to oHSV treatment (<xref rid="vaccines-12-01309-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>B). For example, on day 22, some mice in the oHSV group had already reached the endpoint, while mice in the oHSV-4-1BBL treatment group were almost cured, despite subsequent recurrence. Similarly, in the KPC model (<xref rid="vaccines-12-01309-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>D), which is widely used as a pancreatic cancer model, oHSV-4-1BBL also exhibited better tumor growth inhibition than oHSV (<xref rid="vaccines-12-01309-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>E). In terms of survival, both oHSV-4-1BBL and oHSV treatment remarkably extended survival compared to PBS treatment, with oHSV-4-1BBL being associated with the longest survival (<xref rid="vaccines-12-01309-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>C,F). For further analysis, we conducted a second experiment with the KPC model. With the same treatment regimen as described above (<xref rid="vaccines-12-01309-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>G), mice were euthanized on day 17. Tumor size was significantly reduced in the oHSV-4-1BBL group compared to the PBS and oHSV groups, as evidenced by the visual shape (<xref rid="vaccines-12-01309-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>H) and tumor weight (<xref rid="vaccines-12-01309-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>I). Taken together, oHSV-4-1BBL exhibited an enhanced antitumor effect relative to oHSV for pancreatic cancers.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot3-vaccines-12-01309"><title>3.3. Impact of oHSV-4-1BBL Treatment on T Cells</title><p>Given that oHSV-4-1BBL has a better antitumor effect than oHSV, the underlying mechanism remains to be elucidated. Studies have indicated that the 4-1BB receptor is highly expressed in exhausted CD8+ T cells in melanoma and hepatocellular carcinoma [<xref rid="B27-vaccines-12-01309" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28-vaccines-12-01309" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. To verify whether it is the same case in pancreatic cancer, we examined the expression of the 4-1BB receptor in exhausted CD8+ T cells in the KPC model (<xref rid="vaccines-12-01309-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>A,B). CD8+ T cells were categorized into five subgroups based on varying levels of exhaustion markers PD-1 and LAG-3. There was almost no expression of the 4-1BB receptor in the PD-1<sup>low</sup> and PD-1<sup>mid</sup> subgroups, with increased expression in the PD-1<sup>high</sup> LAG-3<sup>mid</sup> subgroup. As expected, the PD-1<sup>high</sup> LAG-3<sup>high</sup> subgroup showed the highest 4-1BB expression. 4-1BBL is mainly expressed by pro-inflammatory antigen-presenting cells, which are rarely found in highly immunosuppressive TMEs, resulting in little stimulation of the 4-1BB receptor. We hypothesized that oHSV-4-1BBL may exert its enhanced antitumor effects by activating T cells and modifying T-cell exhaustion. To verify this hypothesis, the immune landscape of the tumor microenvironment was analyzed. As shown in <xref rid="vaccines-12-01309-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>C,D, the number of infiltrated CD45+ and CD3+ cells in tumor tissues in the oHSV-4-1BBL treatment group increased significantly relative to that in the PBS and oHSV treatment groups. oHSV-4-1BBL treatment also boosted the population of CD4+ T cells (<xref rid="vaccines-12-01309-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>E) but not that CD8+ T cells (<xref rid="vaccines-12-01309-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>F) relative to the other two treatments. Furthermore, activation marker CD69 and cytotoxic markers IFN-&#x003b3; and granzyme B (GZMB) were analyzed. Compared to the PBS treatment, both oHSV-4-1BBL and oHSV treatments induced significantly larger populations of activated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (<xref rid="vaccines-12-01309-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>G,H), while only the oHSV-4-1BBL treatment resulted in many more IFN-&#x003b3;-positive CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (<xref rid="vaccines-12-01309-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>I,J) and more GZMB+ CD8+ T cells (<xref rid="vaccines-12-01309-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>K). Collectively, the above data show that oHSV-4-1BBL treatment promoted the activation and cytotoxicity of T cells in pancreatic tumors.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot4-vaccines-12-01309"><title>3.4. oHSV-4-1BBL Alters Exhaustive CD8+ T-Cell Distribution</title><p>Previously, it was shown that the 4-1BB receptor is highly expressed in exhausted CD8+ T cells in pancreatic tumors (<xref rid="vaccines-12-01309-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>B). We further analyzed the population of tumor-infiltrating T cells and regulatory T cells (Tregs). Exhausted CD4+ T and CD8+ T cells were marked by PD-1 and LAG-3, while immunosuppressive Tregs were marked by CD25 and Foxp3. Compared to the PBS treatment, although both OV treatments caused a decrease in exhausted CD4+ T and CD8+ T cells and Tregs (<xref rid="vaccines-12-01309-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>A&#x02013;D), the oHSV-4-1BBL group had a significantly lower population of exhausted CD8+ T cells (<xref rid="vaccines-12-01309-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>B,C) and Tregs (<xref rid="vaccines-12-01309-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>D) than the oHSV group.</p><p>Next, to investigate how exhausted T cells were reduced after oHSV-4-1BBL and oHSV treatments, we examined the distribution of CD8+ T cells at various exhaustion stages in the KPC model after treatment conducted in two different ways. In one approach, based on previous studies [<xref rid="B21-vaccines-12-01309" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], CD69 and Ly108 expression levels were used to divide CD8+ T cells into different exhaustion subgroups, as shown in <xref rid="vaccines-12-01309-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>E: exhausted progenitor cell 1 (CD69+ Ly108+, Tex<sup>prog1</sup>), exhausted progenitor cell 2 (CD69-ly108+, Tex<sup>prog2</sup>), exhausted intermediates (CD69-ly108-, Tex<sup>int</sup>), and terminally exhausted cells (CD69+ ly108-, Tex<sup>term</sup>). The exhaustion status sequence is Tex<sup>prog1</sup> &#x02192; Tex<sup>prog2</sup> &#x02192; Tex<sup>int</sup> &#x02192; Tex<sup>term</sup>. We found that Tex<sup>prog1</sup> and Tex<sup>prog2</sup> had similar trends in the three treatment groups. In the Tex<sup>term</sup> subgroup, both viral treatment groups showed drastic reductions. However, in the Tex<sup>int</sup> subgroup, only the oHSV-4-1BBL group showed a significant increase compared to the PBS (<xref rid="vaccines-12-01309-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>F).</p><p>Another approach was to divide exhausted CD8+ T cells into five subgroups based on high, medium, and low levels of PD-1 and LAG-3 expression (<xref rid="vaccines-12-01309-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>A). By comparing the distribution changes of CD8+ T cells at each exhaustion stage under the three treatments, we found that the population of the PD-1<sup>high</sup> LAG-3<sup>high</sup> subgroup in the oHSV-4-1BBL treatment group was significantly reduced. In addition, the population of the PD-1<sup>high</sup> LAG-3<sup>mid</sup> subgroup was notably decreased in the oHSV-4-1BBL and oHSV treatment groups, but there was no significant difference between them (<xref rid="vaccines-12-01309-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>G). In contrast, the two viral treatments markedly increased the population of the PD-1<sup>high</sup> LAG-3<sup>low</sup> and PD-1<sup>mid</sup> subgroups, representing the transition during the exhaustion.</p><p>Based on the above analysis that showed similar results, it can be concluded that treatment with oHSV-4-1BBL can dramatically reverse the exhaustion of CD8+ T cells in pancreatic tumors by reducing terminal exhaustion cells and increasing transitional exhaustion T cells.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot5-vaccines-12-01309"><title>3.5. Combination Therapy with oHSV-4-1BBL and PD-1 Antibody</title><p>Despite the fact that oHSV-4-1BBL treatment could reverse the exhaustion of CD8+ T cells (<xref rid="vaccines-12-01309-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>F,G) and extended the survival time of tumor-bearing mice, the pancreatic tumors eventually grew without complete regression (<xref rid="vaccines-12-01309-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>C,F). Many studies have demonstrated that the combination of immune checkpoint inhibitors contributes to the reversal of CD8+ T-cell exhaustion. We further explored whether blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 signal would further enhance the antitumor effects of the oHSV-4-1BBL treatment. Therefore, a combination therapy of oHSV-4-1BBL and PD-1 antibody was employed in the Pan02-HVEM model. The therapeutic strategy is shown in <xref rid="vaccines-12-01309-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>A. PD-1 antibody was injected intraperitoneally at a dose of 4 mg/kg, and simultaneously, oncolytic virus or PBS was administered intratumorally. Tumor growth was monitored post treatment. On day 19, some mice had already reached the endpoint in the PBS+&#x003b1;PD-1 treatment group, with an average tumor volume of 1597.42 mm<sup>3</sup>, while it was only 147.66 mm<sup>3</sup> and 39.56 mm<sup>3</sup> for the oHSV+&#x003b1;PD-1 and oHSV-4-1BBL+&#x003b1;PD-1 groups, respectively. On day 25, when some mice in the oHSV+&#x003b1;PD-1 group had reached the endpoint, the mean tumor volume in this group was 684.73 mm<sup>3</sup>, compared to 22.97 mm<sup>3</sup> in the oHSV-4-1BBL+&#x003b1;PD-1 treatment group (<xref rid="vaccines-12-01309-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>B). Throughout the experiment, oHSV-4-1BBL+&#x003b1;PD-1 treatment demonstrated dramatically enhanced inhibition of tumor growth relative to the other two groups, which also significantly extended the survival time of the mice. The median survival was 20, 31, and 42 days for the PBS+&#x003b1;PD-1, oHSV+&#x003b1;PD-1, and oHSV-4-1BBL+&#x003b1;PD-1 groups, respectively. It should be noted that the PD-1 antibody significantly extended survival when combined with oHSV-4-1BBL (42 days vs. 33 days; <xref rid="vaccines-12-01309-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>C and <xref rid="vaccines-12-01309-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>D), but this was not the case when combined with oHSV (31 days vs. 30 days; <xref rid="vaccines-12-01309-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>C and <xref rid="vaccines-12-01309-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>D). Notably, two mice were cured in the oHSV-4-1BBL+&#x003b1;PD-1 treatment group. Taken together, it has been shown that the combination of PD-1 antibody could further enhance the antitumor effects of oHSV-4-1BBL compared to the virus alone.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec4-vaccines-12-01309"><title>4. Discussion</title><p>Immunotherapy has made considerable progress in the treatment of tumors, and checkpoint inhibitors such as CTLA-4 and PD-1 have shown some efficacy in non-small cell lung cancer, kidney cancer, and melanoma [<xref rid="B29-vaccines-12-01309" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B30-vaccines-12-01309" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] but have shown little efficacy in pancreatic cancer, emphasizing the need for novel therapeutic strategies. The use of oncolytic viruses has shown good therapeutic effects in solid tumors [<xref rid="B31-vaccines-12-01309" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B32-vaccines-12-01309" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], and more oncolytic viruses are being developed as antitumor drugs. HSV-1 stands out among them because of its strong oncolytic activity and easy genetic modification.</p><p>The superior antitumor activity of oHSV-4-1BBL can be attributed to its dual mechanism of action. First, the oncolytic effect of the virus leads to the destruction of cancer cells and the release of tumor-associated antigens, which can be recognized by the immune system [<xref rid="B33-vaccines-12-01309" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Secondly, the local expression of 4-1BBL within the tumor microenvironment provides a costimulatory signal to T cells, enhancing their activation and cytotoxic potential.</p><p>Considerable studies have shown that T-cell exhaustion in the tumor microenvironment prevents tumors from being destroyed [<xref rid="B34-vaccines-12-01309" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. A typical characteristic of T-cell exhaustion is that cytotoxic capacity is weakened and immunosuppressive receptors are upregulated. Our findings are in line with previous studies that have highlighted the importance of reversing T-cell exhaustion in the tumor microenvironment. The reduction in terminally exhausted CD8+ T cells and the increase in transitional exhausted cells following oHSV-4-1BBL treatment suggest a shift towards a more active T-cell phenotype. This shift is crucial for mounting an effective antitumor immune response.</p><p>In this study, we have shown that the efficacy of oHSV-4-1BBL alone in two pancreatic cancer models is limited. This can be attributed to the fact that terminally exhausted CD8+ T cells generally express high levels of the 4-1BB receptor and various immune checkpoint receptors, such as PD-1, LAG-3, Tim-3, and TIGIT. Even if more stimulation of the 4-1BB receptor is performed, it is difficult to alter the suppressive situation. Other studies have found that exciting the 4-1BB signal in T cells increases the secretion of IFN-&#x003b3;, resulting in the upregulation of PD-L1 in the tumor microenvironment and leading to the re-inhibition of T cells. The combination therapy of oncolytic virus and immune checkpoint inhibitor is a breakthrough in improving the curative effect. Similar to other studies, it was proven in the current study that combination therapy with a PD-1 antibody is beneficial to unlock the great potential of oHSV-4-1BBL for pancreatic cancer treatment. On the contrary, the combination of oHSV and checkpoint inhibitors produced little improvement in efficacy compared to oHSV alone. However, the combination of oHSV-4-1BBL and PD-1 antibody was effective, greatly improving its antitumor effect. Unfortunately, due to some constraints, we were unable to further analyze the tumor-infiltrating T cells after combined treatment with oHSV-4-1BBL and PD-1 antibody.</p><p>While our study provides evidence for the efficacy of oHSV-4-1BBL, there are still other aspects to be explored. Future work will focus on how to achieve long-term survival and avoid relapse in mice that achieve complete remission. Additionally, the impact of this combination therapy on other immune-cell populations within the tumor microenvironment will be investigated. Understanding these aspects will be crucial in translating these findings into clinical applications.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec5-vaccines-12-01309"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, our study has demonstrated promising results in advancing the treatment of pancreatic cancer. The findings underscore the heightened antitumor efficacy of oHSV-4-1BBL, not only by targeting cancer cells directly but also by reversing the exhausted T cells within the tumor microenvironment. Through the innovative application of oHSV-4-1BBL, we have demonstrated that the combination of oncolytic virotherapy with the modulation of the immune checkpoint can elicit a robust and effective antitumor response. Our study provides a foundation for the development of more effective treatments for pancreatic cancer.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We acknowledge Hongkai Zhang at Nankai University and the Beijing Laboratory Animal Research Center for guidance and assistance.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclaimer/Publisher&#x02019;s Note:</bold> The statements, opinions and data contained in all publications are solely those of the individual author(s) and contributor(s) and not of MDPI and/or the editor(s).
