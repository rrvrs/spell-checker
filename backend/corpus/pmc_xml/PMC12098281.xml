Exosomes derived from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) exhibit anti-inflammatory and tissue regenerative properties. This study aimed to investigate the therapeutic potential of exosomes derived from human classical interscapular brown adipocytes (hcBAC-exos) in alleviating symptoms of RA in a mouse model.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We established a mouse model of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) to evaluate the efficacy of hcBAC-exos. Specifically, we assessed the degree of RA remission by applying vitamin E emulsion, as well as a mixture of vitamin E emulsion and hcBAC-exos, to the foot paws of CIA mice. Additionally, the effects of hcBAC-exos on pro-inflammatory cytokines in macrophages (RAW264.7 cells) were investigated at the cellular level. The active components of hcBAC-exos were analyzed via lipidomics, and the mechanism of their ability to inhibit inflammation was explored.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Administration of hcBAC-exos significantly reduced the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in macrophages. In the CIA mouse model, transdermal application of hcBAC-exos led to notable decreases in ankle swelling and the serum levels of IL-1&#x003b2; and TNF&#x003b1; (P &#x0003c; 0.5). Mechanistically, lipidomic analysis showed that Docosahexaenoic acid (C22:6) is highly enriched in hcBAC-exos. Furthermore, we found that C22:6 specifically inhibits IL-1&#x003b2; expression by binding to the amino acids Y183, S210, E265, S182, and R223 of TLR4, mutating these amino acids results in the loss of C22:6 binding activity to TLR4.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Our findings suggest that the hcBAC-exos-C22:6-TLR4-IL-1&#x003b2; signaling pathway plays a crucial role in the context of RA, indicating the potential clinical applications of hcBAC-exos in the treatment of inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>rheumatoid arthritis</kwd><kwd>exosome</kwd><kwd>C22:6</kwd><kwd>TLR4</kwd><kwd>IL-1&#x003b2;</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>The author(s) declare that financial support was received for the research and/or publication of this article.

The global prevalence of RA ranges from approximately 0.3% to 1%, with the prevalence in women being 3 to 5 times higher than that in men, significantly affecting the quality of life and health status of patients (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). RA is characterized by pathological changes in the joint lining, including infiltration of B cells, macrophages, and CD4<sup>+</sup> helper T cells into the synovial stroma, which leads to synovial proliferation and subsequent joint swelling and pain (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Moreover, the overproduction of inflammatory molecules such as tumor necrosis factor (<italic>TNF</italic>), prostaglandin E2 (<italic>PGE2</italic>), interleukin (<italic>IL-1</italic>), and various other cytokines contributes to the persistence of inflammation. In particular, <italic>TNF</italic> and <italic>IL-1</italic> play important roles in the inflammatory process in RA joints (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Currently, commonly used therapeutic agents for RA include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), steroids, disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), and biologics (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). While these medications can alleviate the symptoms of RA and slow disease progression, their use is often limited by concerns regarding safety, tolerability, treatment response rates, and cost (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Consequently, existing treatments for RA fail to adequately address the long-term medication needs of most patients, highlighting the necessity for the development of new therapeutic agents.</p><p>Exosomes are vesicles with diameters of 30&#x02013;150 nm that are secreted by cells under pathophysiological conditions. They play an important role in intercellular communication by influencing the function of recipient cells through the delivery of proteins, lipids, DNA, RNA and other biomolecules (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). In recent years, MSC-derived exosomes have garnered significant attention in the study of RA. Subcutaneous adipose tissue MSC-derived exosomes attenuated symptoms in a mouse model of CIA, and this effect was mediated by IL-1RA in the exosomes (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) On the basis of the ability of exosomes to transmit information to recipient cells, Chen et&#x000a0;al. were the first to report that exosomes derived from bone marrow MSCs transfer miR-150-5p to the joint cavity, reversing the migration and invasion of RA fibroblast-like synoviocytes (RA-FLSs) induced by pro-inflammatory factors such as <italic>IL-1&#x003b2;</italic>, <italic>TGF-&#x003b2;</italic>, and <italic>TNF&#x003b1;</italic> by inhibiting the expression of the target genes <italic>MMP14</italic> and <italic>VEGF</italic>, thereby alleviating RA (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). MSCs can be sourced from various tissues, including the umbilical cord, bone marrow and adipose tissue (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Given that adipose tissue is the largest endocrine organ in the human body, the exploration of adipose tissue-derived exosomes in the context of RA is of significant interest. Mammalian adipose tissue can be categorized into two types, white adipose tissue (WAT) and brown adipose tissue (BAT). BAT is different from WAT in terms of its origin, morphology, function, and secretory factors (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), which leads to varying effects of exosomes from different MSC sources in disease treatment (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Historically, BAT has been recognized for its role in regulating adaptive thermogenesis; however, recent clinical interest has intensified regarding BAT activation as a potential strategy for treating metabolic disorders such as obesity and diabetes (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Additionally, studies have indicated that BAT transplantation can significantly reduce inflammatory cell infiltration in skin cells affected by localized scleroderma (LoS) (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Furthermore, a potential association between BAT and RA has been identified, with metformin shown to inhibit CIA progression and improve metabolic dysfunction in obese mice by promoting BAT differentiation (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Therefore, exosomes derived from BAT may also contribute to the suppression of pro-inflammatory factor expression in RA.</p><p>Given the current understanding of RA and the potential role of hcBAC-exos, we focused on their effects on the expression of inflammatory cytokines in macrophages. To identify the active components within hcBAC-exos, metabolomic analysis of the transdermal substances revealed the candidate fatty acid C22:6. <italic>In vivo</italic> studies involved the application of hcBAC-exos and C22:6 to the feet and paws of CIA mice to investigate their effects on RA. By elucidating the mechanisms of action of hcBAC-exos and C22:6 in immune regulation, we aimed to provide significant theoretical and practical insights for the development of novel therapeutic strategies for RA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2_1"><label>2.1</label><title>Cell culture</title><p>Human classical interscapular brown adipose tissue was obtained from the interscapular of a spontaneously aborted fetus at Beijing Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital.

These human classical interscapular brown adipocytes were cultured and expanded in Dulbecco&#x02019;s modified Eagle&#x02019;s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin (100 U/mL), streptomycin (100 &#x003bc;g/mL) and HEPES (20 mM). These cells were used for experiments between passages 5 and 15. RAW264.7 macrophage cell lines and 293FT cell lines were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, penicillin (100 U/mL), and streptomycin (100 &#x003bc;g/mL).

After 36 h, the conditioned medium from hcBCA was collected for exosome isolation. The TransExo&#x02122; Cell Media Exosome Kit (TransGen Biotech, FE401) was used to isolate hcBAC-exos. Briefly, the cell supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 3000 &#x000d7; g for 30 min at 4&#x000b0;C to remove residual cells and debris. The supernatant was then mixed with EPS-C at the appropriate ratio and allowed to stand at 4&#x000b0;C overnight. The following day, the mixture was centrifuged at 10,000 &#x000d7; g for 30 min at 4&#x000b0;C to precipitate hcBAC-exos. Then PBS was added and the mixture was gently pipetted to collect the hcBAC-exos. The hcBAC-exos were quantified using a BCA protein assay kit and stored at -80&#x000b0;C. The morphology of hcBAC-exos was observed via transmission electron microscopy (USA, FEI). Western blot analysis was conducted to identify the positive proteins (TSG101, CD63 and CD81) of hcBAC-exos. The hcBAC-exos were thoroughly mixed with vitamin E emulsion and applied to the ankle joints of the mice.</p></sec><sec id="s2_3"><label>2.3</label><title>Cell uptake analysis <italic>in vitro</italic>

RAW264.7 cells were inoculated in confocal dishes, and hcBAC-exos-DID was added to the cells for coculturing for 3 and 12 h, respectively. The cells were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min and washed three times with PBS, after which the nuclei were stained with DAPI working solution.

In brief, the core plasmid PLKO.1-shRNA, the packaging plasmid psPAX2, and the envelope plasmid pMD2.G were mixed at a ratio of 4:3:2 in DMEM and co-incubated with three volumes of PEI for 20 min at room temperature. The resulting mixture was added to a cell culture dish containing 70-90% confluent 293FT cells and incubated for 6 h. The mixture was then replaced with fresh basal medium.

Furthermore, the direct application of hcBAC-exos to the skin of the foot paws of CIA mice significantly improved RA symptoms. Lipidomic analysis of hcBAC-exos revealed that the primary component exerting anti-inflammatory effects is C22:6. Mechanistically, we discovered that C22:6 binds directly to the TLR4 receptor, specifically through the amino acids Y183, S210, E265, S182, and R223, thereby suppressing the expression of inflammatory factors. These findings provide new insights into the role of hcBAC-exos in regulating the inflammatory response and suggest potential strategies for RA treatment.</p><p>Exosomes are widely present in cell cultures and various body fluids (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). The cell-targeting ability of exosomes enhances their role as drug delivery platforms. Compared with cell-based therapies, exosomes offer advantages such as no cytotoxicity, low immunogenicity, high circulatory stability, and good biocompatibility, making them suitable drug-delivery carriers for various diseases (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). We found that brown adipocytes produce a substantial number of exosomes that can be taken up by macrophages. <italic>In vitro</italic>, hcBAC-exos demonstrated potent anti-inflammatory properties, primarily as evidenced by their ability to inhibit LPS-induced pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in macrophages. This finding aligns with the role of exosomes as cell-to-cell messengers that modulate immune responses and inflammation (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Moon et&#x000a0;al. reported that BAT transplantation significantly reduced bone damage, inflammation, and cartilage damage, along with pro-inflammatory cytokine levels in CIA recipient mice (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). In the present study, we topically applied hcBAC-exos to the skin of the feet and claws of CIA mice, resulting in a significant improvement in RA symptoms. These observations underscore the potential of exosome-based therapies to target specific tissues and modulate local inflammatory responses without systemic side effects. The specificity of exosome action may confer a distinct advantage over traditional broad-spectrum anti-inflammatory drugs, which often have significant side effects (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Additionally, hcBAC-exos are easier to administer than BAT transplantation and avoid immune rejection, positioning hcBAC-exos as a promising new strategy for RA treatment.</p><p>Numerous studies have highlighted the importance of exosomes in intercellular communication by facilitating the transfer of biologically active lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids, thereby influencing the physiological functions of recipient cells (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Wu et&#x000a0;al. reported that miR-204-5P was abnormally expressed in the plasma exosomes of patients with RA. Furthermore, the overexpression of miR-204-5p in synovial fibroblasts inhibited their activation by targeting genes associated with cell proliferation and invasion (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). Proteomic analysis of serum exosomes from RA patients revealed that the levels of amyloid A (AA) and lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronic acid receptor-1 (LYVE-1) significantly differed between the control and RA groups. These two proteins have potential as additional biomarkers of disease activity in RA patients (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). Furthermore, studies indicate that different types of fatty acids have different mechanisms of action in the regulation of inflammation. Omega-3 fatty acids, such as linolenic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid, and docosahexaenoic acid, can mitigate inflammation by inhibiting the synthesis of inflammatory mediators, including prostaglandins and leukocyte chemokines (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). In addition, they modulate inflammation-related signaling pathways, such as the NF-&#x003ba;B and MAPK pathways, thereby exerting an inhibitory effect on inflammation (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). In contrast, omega-6 fatty acids, such as linoleic acid (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>), are considered pro-inflammatory. Excessive intake of omega-6 fatty acids enhances the production of inflammatory mediators, such as prostaglandin E2, thereby exacerbating the inflammatory response (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). Consequently, fatty acids derived from BAT-derived exosomes may play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of RA.</p><p>We wondered whether some of the fatty acids in hcBAC-exos were involved in inflammatory pathways. To test this hypothesis, we focused on the role of FFAs in hcBAC-exos. Metabolomic analysis revealed that the anti-inflammatory effects of hcBAC-exos were attributed mainly to the presence of C22:6. This finding is important because it highlights the role of specific lipid mediators in the regulation of immune responses. C22:6 directly binds to amino acids Y183, S210, E265, S182, and R223 of the TLR4 receptor, subsequently inhibiting IL-1&#x003b2; expression and providing a clear molecular mechanism by which hcBAC-exos exert their anti-inflammatory effects. Exosomal lipids play crucial roles in the progression of metabolic diseases (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). For example, sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), which is found in endothelial-derived exosomes, can enhance the migration of hepatic stellate cells (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). In patients with simple steatosis and early fibrosis associated with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), the number of circulating exosomes containing C16:0 ceramides and S1P-rich lipids in plasma gradually increases (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). Currently, the role of lipids in exosomes remains poorly understood, and their role in RA is even less understood. Our understanding of the mechanism by which C22:6 inhibits inflammation through the TLR4 receptor is novel and has broad implications for lipid-mediated immune regulation. Although the application of hcBAC-exos and C22:6 in RA treatment is still in the research stage, their natural biocompatibility and anti-inflammatory properties present promising avenues for non-pharmacological interventions (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>).</p><p>Stem cell-derived exosomes have been shown to be edited via metabolic glycoengineering (MGE) technology to selectively target macrophages and alleviate symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) by modulating macrophage heterogeneity (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). The functional resolution and targeted modification of exosomes are important for effective disease treatment. Combining C22:6 with fine-tuned exosomes may facilitate targeted delivery to affected organs, thereby enhancing therapeutic efficacy in suppressing RA. Current research is limited by the use of a single animal model and a single bioactive lipid. Future studies should investigate the role of hcBAC-exos in various RA animal models and explore the synergistic effects of multiple bioactive components within hcBAC-exos. Furthermore, to substantiate our findings, evaluating the potential for clinical translation is essential. The quantification of hcBAC-exos and C22:6, along with their stability during transportation and preservation, as well as their safety and efficacy in human subjects, requires further investigation.</p><p>In conclusion, our study revealed the role of hcBAC-exos in modulating the inflammatory response and proposed a potential mechanism of action for hcBAC-exos, especially C22:6, in RA (<xref rid="f8" ref-type="fig">
<bold>Figure&#x000a0;8</bold>
</xref>). This may represent a novel approach to RA treatment, providing mechanistic insights that establish a foundation for targeted therapy in RA and potentially other inflammatory diseases. Future research should concentrate on addressing the limitations of current studies and translating these findings into clinical practice.</p><fig position="float" id="f8"><label>Figure&#x000a0;8</label><caption><p>Schematic diagram of the mechanism by which hcBAC-exos operate in RA.
