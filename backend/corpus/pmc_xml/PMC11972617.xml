This article aimed to assess the use of long-acting nebulized bronchodilators in an older adult with acute respiratory failure. The institutional setting was a 500-bed academic medical center in the southern US. Arformoterol is a long-acting beta agonist (LABA) and revefenacin is a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA), both approved to treat stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Neither medication is US Food and Drug Administration approved for acute respiratory failure. In this case, both medications were used for their rapid-onset and long-duration bronchodilator activity to treat acute respiratory failure secondary to COVID-19. This older adult clinically improved within three days of nebulized long-acting bronchodilator use.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards)</kwd><kwd>albuterol</kwd><kwd>arformoterol</kwd><kwd>nebulization</kwd><kwd>revefenacin</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a form of acute respiratory failure characterized by hypoxemia and pulmonary edema secondary to direct lung injuries (e.g., pneumonia, aspiration, or toxic inhalants) or indirect lung injuries (e.g., trauma or sepsis) [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia may lead to ARDS [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Mortality and morbidity attributed to COVID-19 is largely due to viral pneumonia-induced ARDS, which disproportionately develops in elderly patients [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Advanced age is a known risk factor for developing severe respiratory infections and complications, including COVID-19 and ARDS, and these patients often require intensive care unit (ICU) admission and extensive therapy for management [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>The current recommendations for management of ARDS, including cases caused by COVID-19 pneumonia, include mechanical ventilation, prone positioning, systemic corticosteroids, venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and neuromuscular blocking agents,&#x000a0;though the guidelines grade several of these recommendations as conditional given low-certainty evidence [<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Inhaled bronchodilators are not included in these guidelines, and their place in critical care is unclear. A 2019 Cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis did not identify statistical differences or clinical improvements in mortality or ventilator-free days among patients treated with the short-acting beta agonist, albuterol [<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Pharmacologically, short-acting beta agonists may worsen ARDS by increasing heart rate and pulmonary fluid clearance and thus increase myocardial demand and cause lung hyperinflation, respectively [<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>Inhaled bronchodilators, notably long-acting agents, have a proven benefit in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations [<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Long-acting bronchodilators provide additional benefits in the treatment of these exacerbations, as they have comparable efficacy and safety to short-acting bronchodilators with fewer administrations required per day [<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The long-acting beta agonist, formoterol, is also connoted as a fast-acting bronchodilator because it has a similar rapid onset of action like the short-acting beta agonist, albuterol, but possesses the added benefit of extended (12 hour) bronchodilatory activity [<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Revefenacin is the first nebulized long-acting muscarinic antagonist approved for once-daily use in patients with moderate to severe COPD [<xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. When used as maintenance treatment, it demonstrated significant improvements in pulmonary function (i.e., trough forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) increased by 100 mL) and was nominally similar to tiotropium with respect to the incidence of acute exacerbations of COPD (revefenacin 21.8% vs tiotropium 28.1%, p-value unreported). Overall, revefenacin is well tolerated, with a low incidence of systemic antimuscarinic adverse events (e.g., xerostomia, headache). Revefenacin has not been studied in the setting of acute respiratory failure, but it may be a reasonable choice for patients in the ICU due to its nebulized route of administration, once-daily dosing, and rapid onset of bronchodilator activity.</p><p>This case report aimed to describe and discuss the use of long-acting nebulized bronchodilators in an older adult with acute respiratory failure secondary to COVID-19. This case was approved by the affiliated institutional review board (protocol #16690, approved January 25, 2024, Category 5) and prepared by the CARE guidelines for case reporting [<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. This case was previously presented as a poster at the 2023 American Society of Health-System Pharmacists Annual Meeting on December 5, 2023.</p></sec><sec sec-type="cases"><title>Case presentation</title><p>A 79-year-old man presented to the emergency department of a 500-bed academic medical center in the southern US&#x000a0;as a transfer from a small, rural county hospital.

He received one 200 mg intravenous dose of remdesivir and one 6 mg intravenous dose of dexamethasone for COVID-19. During his stay, both in the ICU and general medical unit, the patient received three nebulized, once-daily doses of revefenacin 175 mcg for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. Doses 1 and 2 were administered on the last two days of ICU stay (days 2 and 3), and dose 3 was administered four days after ICU discharge. In addition to revefenacin, the patient also received arformoterol 15 mcg nebulized every 12 hours for treatment of his acute respiratory failure. Orders for an albuterol 90 mcg metered dose inhaler and albuterol-ipratropium 2.5/0.5 mg nebulizer (both with directions to use every six hours as needed for dyspnea) were placed through no doses were required or administered.

Although long-acting bronchodilators are not included in the guideline-recommended management of respiratory failure, there are plausible pharmacologic benefits warranting their exploration in such cases. When compared to short-acting bronchodilators, novel long-acting bronchodilators (i.e., revefenacin, arformoterol) were shown to have comparable safety and efficacy when used to treat acute exacerbations of COPD (ECOPD) [<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Although revefenacin has a long-acting duration, it has a short onset of action (14 to 41 minutes), thereby providing relief quickly and maintaining bronchodilation over 24 hours [<xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. By providing sustained bronchodilation, it may decrease the number of rescue bronchodilator administrations required during hospital stays, such as in this case wherein the patient did not require either albuterol metered dose inhalers or albuterol-ipratropium nebulizers. At our institution, metered dose inhalers and nebulized medications must be administered by nurses and respiratory therapists, respectively. Administration and monitoring times for these short-acting rescue medications may require 15 minutes of direct patient care observation. Thus, administration of nebulized long-acting bronchodilators may reduce the burden of rescue medication on both patients and healthcare staff [<xref rid="REF17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>The safety of long-acting bronchodilators is similar to short-acting bronchodilators [<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. However, systemic exposure of revefenacin is increased in patients with renal and hepatic impairment, therefore these patients should be monitored more closely for anticholinergic adverse effects, particularly in patients at risk for agitation, especially older adults [<xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Though it is doubtful that revefenacin alone or in combination with concomitant risk factors caused this patient&#x02019;s ICU delirium, consideration may be warranted. The 2023 American Geriatrics Society Beers Criteria for potentially inappropriate medication use in older adults provides a strong recommendation against the use of medications with anticholinergic properties (i.e., antihistamines and antidepressants with strong anticholinergic properties) be avoided because of increased risks for confusion, dementia, and sedation [<xref rid="REF18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Safety signals have not been identified when long-acting bronchodilators were used in a sample of 30 adults admitted with acute ECOPD&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Further observational studies are necessary to corroborate these findings and affirm the safety of long-acting bronchodilators in both intensive care and general medicine settings.</p><p>This case report possesses limitations. This patient received prompt treatment with remdesivir and dexamethasone for COVID-19, which likely contributed to this patient&#x02019;s overall improvements and brief ICU length of stay. Additionally, there was a four-day lapse between doses 2 and 3 of the revefenacin for reasons undocumented in the medical record or discussed during interprofessional patient care rounds. Despite the prompt resolution of this patient&#x02019;s COVID-19 pneumonia, nebulizer utilization during COVID-19 is controversial because of the risk for aerosolizing the virus and increasing transmission to healthcare providers, caregivers, and contacts [<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Contact precautions, such as those implemented in this case report, should be strictly adhered to if nebulized bronchodilators are administered to patients with airborne illnesses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Although long-acting bronchodilators are not approved to treat acute respiratory failure, the older adult in this case clinically improved after three doses of revefenacin and arformoterol. Additional studies are necessary to determine the efficacy and safety of long-acting bronchodilators to treat acute respiratory distress syndrome or acute exacerbations of chronic lung conditions. Further analysis on the incidence of adverse events, particularly for patients in the ICU, is also warranted.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group content-type="conflict"><title>Disclosures</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Human subjects:</bold> Consent for treatment and open access publication was obtained or waived by all participants in this study.
