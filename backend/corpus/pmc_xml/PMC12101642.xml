</self-uri><abstract><p>Colorectal cancer (CRC) has the second highest incidence rate among all cancers in Korea, with approximately 30% of patients with regional CRC experiencing recurrence. Understanding the genetic drivers of recurrence is essential for early detection and targeted treatment. Therefore, many studies have focused on genetic analysis using tumor-normal matched samples, as this approach provides more comprehensive insights. However, tumor-only samples are far more common in clinical practice because of the difficulty in obtaining normal tissues, making developing robust methods for analyzing tumor-only data a pressing need. This study aimed to investigate the genetic variations associated with CRC recurrence using tumor-only whole-exome sequencing data from 200 Korean patients with stage III CRC. By applying stringent filtering using public databases including Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD), Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC), Single Nucleotide Polymorphism Database (dbSNP), 1000 Genomes Project (1000G), Korean Variant Archive 2 (KOVA2), and Korean Reference Genome Database (KRGDB), we identified 221 statistically significant mutations across 195 genes with distinct distributions between the recurrence and non-recurrence groups. Furthermore, statistical analysis of the clinical data revealed that the T-category, N-category, and preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen levels were correlated with CRC recurrence. Moreover, we identified nine networks through protein-protein interaction analysis and identified networks with high feature importance. We also developed a CRC recurrence prediction model using PyCaret, which achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.77. Our findings highlight the importance of robust variant filtering in tumor-only sample analyses and provide insights into the genetic landscape of CRC recurrence in the Korean population.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source>

In Korea, CRC poses a major public health challenge and will be the second most commonly diagnosed cancer in both sexes as of 2021 [<xref rid="pone.0323302.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The annual incidence highlights the criticality of this disease within the national cancer landscape, with CRC representing 12.4% of all new cancer cases and affecting 29,560 individuals [<xref rid="pone.0323302.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. CRC is classified into stages I, II, III, and IV based on the American Joint Committee on Cancer manual [<xref rid="pone.0323302.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Stage III CRC patients have approximately 1.9 times and 7.8 times recurrence rates, compared to those of stage I and II CRC patients, despite curative tumor resection [<xref rid="pone.0323302.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0323302.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Although CRC recurrence severely affects patient health and survival, stage III CRC patients with relatively high recurrence rates undergo a similar process of adjuvant chemotherapy and surveillance, regardless of genetic risk. This high recurrence rate underscores the importance of understanding the genetic differences between recurrent and non-recurrent CRC. Current research efforts have focused on investigating the recurrence risks associated with stage III CRC, highlighting a wide range of analyses to better understand and manage this disease [<xref rid="pone.0323302.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323302.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Several researchers use the gold standard method of identifying cancer-specific somatic mutations by comparing tumor tissues with normal tissues. However, using normal samples can be impractical due to logistical, financial, and sample availability constraints. In such scenarios, the reliance on tumor-only mutation detection is essential. Indeed, the College of American Pathologists reported that 95% of laboratories performed NGS-based testing of tumor-only samples [<xref rid="pone.0323302.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Unlike the typical gene-level determination of the presence of mutations, tumor-only analysis may show poor precision owing to the detection of germline variants. To address this issue, it is essential to filter out common variants from various large-population databases [<xref rid="pone.0323302.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and analyze them at the mutation level [<xref rid="pone.0323302.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. This approach reduced the likelihood of coincidental overlapping mutations across multiple samples. In fact, the recall rate of the tumor-only analysis is very similar to that of the tumor-normal analysis [<xref rid="pone.0323302.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>While large population databases can be used to filter out common germline variants, tumor-only sequencing inherently cannot distinguish somatic mutations from rare germline variants. It is therefore possible that germline mutations remain in the dataset. One commonly used method to estimate this is by analyzing the variant allele frequency (VAF), as heterozygous germline variants are typically observed with VAFs between 40% and 60% in diploid regions [<xref rid="pone.0323302.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323302.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Protein-protein interactions are crucial to every cellular process, including cell cycle control, splicing, and regulation of gene expression levels [<xref rid="pone.0323302.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323302.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. These interactions provide insights into the functional dynamics of genes and proteins and aid in predicting potential cancer-associated genes [<xref rid="pone.0323302.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) is a widely used software for understanding proteomic data and is capable of constructing protein-protein interaction networks. This tool integrates comprehensive data from a curated knowledge base, research publications, and various third-party databases to derive meaningful interpretations [<xref rid="pone.0323302.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323302.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Networks obtained from IPA are actively used to study the progression, metastasis, and recurrence of CRC [<xref rid="pone.0323302.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0323302.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Additionally, various studies have incorporated machine learning algorithms, such as support vector machine and random forest model, into these networks to build predictive models [<xref rid="pone.0323302.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323302.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>In this study, we focused on Korean patients diagnosed with stage III colorectal cancer, as this subgroup accounts for a substantial portion of CRC-related mortality in Korea. Given the relatively homogeneous genetic background of the Korean population and the high recurrence burden observed in stage III cases, this focus allows for a clearer investigation of recurrence-associated characteristics. We proposed and validated the use of multiple public population databases to filter out inherited variants in tumor-only samples. We also determined the relationships among the genes containing these mutations through protein-protein interaction networks and implemented a CRC recurrence prediction model using these networks.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Asan Medical Center (registration number: 2017&#x02013;1191) and was conducted per the Declaration of Helsinki.

The CRC samples included 200 fresh frozen CRC tissues and were provided by Asan Bio-Resource Center, Korea Biobank Network (2017-14(152)). The study cohorts were enrolled when the CRC was pathologically confirmed to be stage III adenocarcinoma after curative-intent surgery and the tumor tissue could be resected to secure sufficient tissue samples for this study. Among the study cohorts, patients who underwent preoperative chemoradiotherapy or neoadjuvant chemotherapy and those with hereditary CRC or other malignancies within 5 years of surgery were excluded. All enrolled patients underwent regular follow-ups with laboratory and imaging examinations. During regular follow-ups, when recurrence was suspected, recurrence was defined when histologic confirmation was made by biopsy of the suspected lesion. If histological confirmation was not available, sequential enlargement of the suspected recurrent lesion observed in radiological studies or positive findings on positron emission tomography were used to confirm recurrence. As this was a retrospective study, it was conducted by randomly selecting 100 patients each from the recurrence and non-recurrence groups, while the recurrence group could be identified.</p><p>Normal colorectal and tumor tissues were minced into small pieces and frozen in sterile culture dishes.

We conducted an Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) to evaluate the impact of the selected variables in the clinical data on the likelihood of CRC recurrence. At this time, a <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant, indicating a strong association with recurrence outcomes.

Variants that were not associated with any documented protein domains were excluded. Subsequently, we explained the molecular interactions by generating a protein-protein interaction network for genes containing SSMs using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) [<xref rid="pone.0323302.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. These interactions were visualized using Cytoscape [<xref rid="pone.0323302.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], providing insights into the potential biological impacts of our findings. To investigate the effects of SSMs at splice sites on transcription, we utilized SpliceAI [<xref rid="pone.0323302.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323302.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] and SpliceAPP [<xref rid="pone.0323302.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] to assess their potential impacts. The nucleotide and protein sequences of the exons affected by these splice site mutations were extracted from the NCBI database. Additionally, protein sequences were modeled using AlphaFold2 [<xref rid="pone.0323302.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] to compare structures that included or excluded the affected exons. Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV) [<xref rid="pone.0323302.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] and Mol* [<xref rid="pone.0323302.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] were used to visualize mutation information and protein structures.</p><p>We developed our prediction model based on the networks identified using IPA. To construct the model, we utilized Python version 3.8.17 and PyCaret version 2.3.10. Each sample was represented by features corresponding to the number of genes within each identified network, including those associated with the SSMs. We employed various models available in PyCaret and selected the model with the highest area under the ROC curve (AUC). Our model training utilized a 10-fold cross-validation technique with inputs normalized using the min-max algorithm. The selected model was then evaluated for feature importance and ROC curve effectiveness to provide a comprehensive understanding of its predictive power.</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Variant validation</title><p>In this study, we excluded common genetic variants from tumor-only samples using various databases, including gnomAD, ExAC, 1000G, KOVA, and KRGDB. Despite our thorough filtering steps, these resources cannot fully guarantee the elimination of all germline variants, indicating that false-positive variants can be included. To validate the effectiveness of the filtering process, we utilized normal samples from a cohort of Korean patients with stage III CRC from the same hospital, who were expected to have a similar set of common variants. We analyzed 68 whole-genome sequencing samples using the same pipeline as that for the whole-exome sequencing data. To save time, we did not analyze all whole-genome sequence regions but only the genomic regions covered by whole-exome sequencing data.</p><p>Here, we evaluate the effectiveness of third-party databases (gnomAD, ExAC, 1000G, KOVA, and KRGDB) compared to normal samples from the comparable cohort based on the following criteria: A variant that was not classified as a common variant by both the databases and normal samples is assumed to be a germline variant; a variant classified as a common variant by both the databases and normal samples is assumed to be a somatic variant; a variant classified as a common variant by the databases, not by normal samples is considered as a false positive in our methodology, which means minimizing these instances is crucial; a variant was not classified as a common variant by the databases but classified as a common variant by normal samples suggests that using databases is more effective for variant filtering than relying solely on similar cohort data, though it also indicates a higher risk of false negative. To evaluate the effectiveness of third-party databases for variation filtering, we counted the number of false-positive variants; a lower number indicated higher effectiveness. Additionally, we calculated the precision and recall by comparing the variants from the databases with variants from the normal samples.</p><p>We also assessed whether the identified somatic single nucleotide mutations (SSMs) might include germline variants by calculating the variant allele frequency (VAF) for each mutation. For each SSM, we determined the proportion of samples with non-zero VAFs that fell within the 40&#x02013;60% range, which corresponds to the expected range for heterozygous germline variants in diploid regions. This allowed us to estimate the likelihood that each SSM represents a germline mutation.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec010"><title>Results</title><p>In this section, we present a comparative analysis between the recurrence and non-recurrence groups, following the methodologies outlined in the Methods section, using data from 200 patients with pathological stage III CRC.

Owing to the absence of normal tissue data for comparison, we leveraged existing genetic variant databases to identify and exclude common variants. Subsequently, we examined the mutation profiles to identify SSMs and genes, which facilitated our analysis of protein-protein interactions, leading to the identification of nine distinct networks.</p><p>Our findings indicate that certain amino acid substitutions are consistent with those previously identified in CRC but not in other cancer types [<xref rid="pone.0323302.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].

This consistency underscores the robustness of our sample collection and bioinformatic analysis protocols.</p><p>Even within the same population, mutation frequencies can vary significantly across different genetic variant databases, owing to differences in datasets, sequencing methods, and quality control criteria. As shown in <xref rid="pone.0323302.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>, our analysis revealed distinct common variants in East Asians across the gnomAD, ExAC, and 1000G databases. This variability highlights the importance of using multiple genetic variant databases to accurately filter inherited variants from tumor-only samples [<xref rid="pone.0323302.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However, this approach prioritizes reducing false positives such as retained germline variants over maximizing sensitivity and accepts the trade-off that some true somatic mutations may be inadvertently excluded. We deliberately adopted a conservative filtering strategy to minimize false positives, even at the cost of accepting a higher risk of false negatives. Although public databases may not fully represent the Korean population and may contain inaccuracies, using multiple sources in combination helps mitigate the limitations of any single dataset and supports more reliable interpretation of tumor-only mutation calls.</p><p>When comparing the whole-exome and whole-genome databases within gnomAD (<xref rid="pone.0323302.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>), we identified more common variants using the whole-exome database, as expected. However, the inclusion of whole-genome data identified an additional 782 common variants, suggesting that both databases should be utilized even when only whole-exome sequencing data are available. Furthermore, the gnomAD whole-exome database version 4.0 identified 26.6% more common variants than version 2.1.1, emphasizing the need to use the most updated versions of genomic databases [<xref rid="pone.0323302.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323302.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>].</p><p>For the Korean CRC samples, we used the KOVA database, which is a reference for genetic variation in the Korean population. Despite this, KOVA identified fewer common variants (15,022) than our databases, such as gnomAD, ExAC, and 1000G. Additionally, the KRGDB faced accessibility issues and potential mapping inaccuracies due to its hg19 genome build foundation [<xref rid="pone.0323302.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323302.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>].

Further investigation using larger hypermutated cohorts will be necessary to clarify the role of hypermutation in CRC recurrence.</p><p>Through the analysis of clinical data among the recurrence and non-recurrence groups using ANOVA and OLS regression, we determined that the T-category, N-category, and preoperative CEA levels had a significant relationship with CRC recurrence. These findings confirmed the well-known risk factors for recurrence in this study, and the use of similar adjuvant chemotherapy was unlikely to reduce recurrence. Particularly, the preoperative CEA level supports previous studies that found a higher recurrence or death risk in patients with stage III CRC with high CEA levels [<xref rid="pone.0323302.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. These results emphasize the need for precision medicine tailored to each patient, rather than a uniform adjuvant treatment, considering the T-and N-categories, preoperative CEA levels, and genetic variation. In addition to the analysis, future research may benefit from incorporating broader patient-level factors. Prior studies have demonstrated that certain lifestyle behaviors, including sugary drink and liquid fat consumption, are associated with CRC recurrence risk [<xref rid="pone.0323302.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Although such variables were not available in our dataset, integrating lifestyle information, comorbidities, and treatment adherence into future analyses could enhance explanatory power.</p><p>We identified 221 SSMs between the recurrence and non-recurrence groups and analyzed their biological functions through protein-protein interactions using IPA. Significant characteristics emerge in certain networks. As shown in Figs C, D, G, and I in <xref rid="pone.0323302.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material">File S3</xref>, the other networks provide clarity. For example, networks 1 and 2 (Figs A and B in <xref rid="pone.0323302.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material">File S3</xref>) revealed mutations affecting the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway, which is closely associated with CRC. ERK is one of the three major subfamilies of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) closely associated with CRC [<xref rid="pone.0323302.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323302.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Networks 6 and 8 (Figs F and H in <xref rid="pone.0323302.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material">File S3</xref>) demonstrated a connection with <italic toggle="yes">CTNNB1</italic> (<xref rid="pone.0323302.t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>), which is linked to CRC development and metastasis [<xref rid="pone.0323302.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323302.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Network 5 (Fig E in <xref rid="pone.0323302.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 File</xref>) displayed a notable link to <italic toggle="yes">CCND1</italic>, which is associated with cancer progression and metastasis [<xref rid="pone.0323302.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323302.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. These findings suggest that gene mutations within this network can negatively affect the expression of <italic toggle="yes">CCND1</italic> or its downstream effects.</p><p>While IPA provided a high-confidence framework to interpret the functional context of significant mutations, it may not be enough to explain protein-protein interactions. To address this limitation, we conducted an additional analysis using the STRING database [<xref rid="pone.0323302.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>] to visualize interactions within networks 5 and 8, which showed the strongest associations with recurrence and non-recurrence of CRC. In this analysis, network 5 revealed a new connectivity pattern involving <italic toggle="yes">SS18L1</italic>, which was sparsely connected in the IPA network but showed multiple interactions in STRING. This finding highlights the potential relevance of <italic toggle="yes">SS18L1</italic>, whose mutation was associated with the non-recurrence group in our data. Furthermore, previous studies have suggested a link between <italic toggle="yes">SS18L1</italic> and CRC [<xref rid="pone.0323302.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323302.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>] indicating that further investigation of this SSM may provide novel insights into its role in CRC progression. In contrast, many genes in network 8 remained isolated, suggesting that these genes may be poorly characterized and warrant further investigation. The results of the STRING analysis for networks 5 and 8 are provided in Supplementary <xref rid="pone.0323302.s011" ref-type="supplementary-material">File S4.</xref></p><p>We also analyzed splice-site mutations, which are known to be significant because they can substantially alter protein structure. We identified mutations in <italic toggle="yes">LILRA2</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">SRPRA</italic> with a high probability of causing splice loss, affecting exon and intron sequences, and predicted protein structures (Figs C-H in the <xref rid="pone.0323302.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 File</xref>). In <italic toggle="yes">LILRA2</italic>, Gao <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> revealed that high expression is correlated with improved survival without recurrence, while Zhang <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> found conflicting results that high expression is associated with poorer cancer prognosis [<xref rid="pone.0323302.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323302.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Although our study showed that mutations in <italic toggle="yes">LILRA2</italic> are related to CRC recurrence, previous findings conflict with each other and necessitate further investigation [<xref rid="pone.0323302.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. We suggest analyzing <italic toggle="yes">LILRA2</italic> in conjugation with other genes in the same network, as shown in <xref rid="pone.0323302.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6C</xref>. Various studies have explored the role of SRP in cancer, but there has been minimal focus on its receptor <italic toggle="yes">SRPRA</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0323302.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323302.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. Since our research shows a relationship between mutations in the <italic toggle="yes">SRPRA</italic> gene and low CRC recurrence, we suggest further investigation into the SRP receptor in addition to SRP itself.</p><p>A recurrence prediction model based on SSMs in protein-protein interaction networks was developed. The high variable importance of networks 8 and 5 (<xref rid="pone.0323302.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A</xref>) indicates their significant influence on classification performance. Figs E and H in <xref rid="pone.0323302.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 File</xref> (<xref rid="pone.0323302.g006" ref-type="fig">Figs 6C</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0323302.g006" ref-type="fig">6D</xref>) align with the non-recurrence and recurrence groups, respectively. This model demonstrated an AUC of 0.77 (<xref rid="pone.0323302.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6B</xref>), indicating good discriminatory power [<xref rid="pone.0323302.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323302.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. However, validation is challenging because of the limited sample size, necessitating further studies. However, validation using independent patient cohorts remains challenging due to the lack of publicly available datasets containing tumor-only somatic mutation profiles linked with recurrence outcomes. We acknowledge this limitation and emphasize the importance of future studies involving larger and more diverse cohorts to assess the generalizability of our model. Moreover, broader efforts to generate and release such datasets are essential to support external validation and clinical translation of predictive models.</p><p>We validated the effectiveness of third-party databases for classifying variants by comparing their predictions with those of normal samples from a comparable cohort. The confusion matrix in <xref rid="pone.0323302.t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref> achieved a high precision of 0.973 and recall of 0.845, indicating strong performance. Notably, 48.76% of the common variants that were filtered out in this study were not classified as common variants by the normal samples. This indicates a limitation of our study, as it suggests that we may have filtered out mutations potentially associated with CRC recurrence. However, because rigorous variant filtering is recommended for tumor-only samples, this result shows that the use of third-party databases is recommended, even if a comparable cohort exists.</p><p>We found that 100 out of the 221 SSMs showed a greater than 50% likelihood of being germline mutations based on their VAFs. This underscores a key limitation of tumor-only sequencing, which cannot distinguish somatic from rare germline variants with certainty. This result also indicates that, despite filtering with population databases, germline variants may remain in the dataset, potentially affecting the interpretation of recurrence-associated mutations. In future studies, tumor-normal paired sequencing will be necessary to validate somatic status and clarify clinical relevance.</p><p>We investigated the potential functional impact of the identified SSMs using publicly available gene expression datasets through the Xena platform [<xref rid="pone.0323302.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>] with TCGA Colon and Rectal Cancer dataset. For this analysis, we focused on the <italic toggle="yes">REXO1</italic> S589del mutation, which was the most frequently observed SSM across both recurrence and non-recurrence groups. This mutation was selected because the public gene expression dataset we used was not sufficiently large and did not match with our Korean cohort to allow evaluation of less frequent mutations. In the case of <italic toggle="yes">REXO1</italic>, the data indicated that the sample carrying the S589del mutation exhibited elevated <italic toggle="yes">REXO1</italic> expression compared to non-mutated samples with the log2(norm count+1) value of 10.2, suggesting a potential transcriptional impact. Interestingly, previous study has reported a positive correlation between <italic toggle="yes">REXO1</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">ARID3A</italic> expression, the latter of which upregulates <italic toggle="yes">AUCKR</italic>, a factor implicated in CRC progression [<xref rid="pone.0323302.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. Given that the <italic toggle="yes">REXO1</italic> S589del mutation was strongly associated with recurrence (OR&#x02009;=&#x02009;3.51), this finding suggests a mechanistic link between the mutation and recurrence risk, consistent with prior biological findings. Although this result does not substitute for direct experimental validation, it can support for the biological relevance of the <italic toggle="yes">REXO1</italic> SSM and emphasize the need for further investigation. Unfortunately, we could not find gene expression changes for most other SSMs we found in this research. To overcome this limitation, the availability of sufficiently large public datasets becomes essential for meaningful interpretation.</p><p>Consequently, we identified 221 mutations with statistically significant differences between the recurrence and non-recurrence groups in Korean CRC tumor-only samples. Using IPA, we explored gene-level relationships across nine protein-protein interaction networks and implemented a CRC recurrence prediction model. The necessity of using various databases to filter common variants in tumor-only sample analyses was demonstrated. Our study also highlights the limitations of the current Korean databases, suggesting the need for enhancements or new developments to improve research accuracy and relevance.</p><p>Our study focused on tumor-only whole-exome sequencing data to reflect the type of genomic information often available in real-world research and clinical settings. However, whole-exome sequencing has inherent limitations. Whole-exome sequencing does not reliably detect large structural variations, copy number alterations, or epigenetic modifications, all of which may contribute significantly to CRC recurrence. Although recent methods attempt to infer copy number alterations from whole-exome sequencing data [<xref rid="pone.0323302.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>], the precision of current approaches remains limited, especially in the context of tumor-only sequencing where matched normal references are unavailable. Therefore, future developments in analytical tools that expand the resolution of tumor-only whole-exome sequencing to include broader genomic alterations will be critical for achieving more comprehensive recurrence risk stratification.</p><p>In addition, due to the absence of matched normal samples, our analysis could not account for germline variants that may underlie hereditary CRC syndromes such as Lynch syndrome [<xref rid="pone.0323302.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>] or familial adenomatous polyposis [<xref rid="pone.0323302.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. These germline variants are important for improving risk stratification and guiding patient management. Although this study could not assess germline variants, future investigations incorporating tumor-normal paired sequencing may help clarify the complementary roles of somatic and germline mutations in CRC development and recurrence. Furthermore, if robust methodologies are developed to reliably infer germline variants from whole-exome sequencing data, such approaches would be highly valuable, particularly in clinical or research settings where matched normal tissue is unavailable.</p></sec><sec id="sec017" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material id="pone.0323302.s001" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Summary data of samples sequenced.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0323302.s001.xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pone.0323302.s002" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>Numbers of patients with mean and standard deviation for each clinical variable.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0323302.s002.xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pone.0323302.s003" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S3 Table</label><caption><title>List of statistically significant mutations (SSMs).</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0323302.s003.xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pone.0323302.s004" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S4 Table</label><caption><title>Information of SSMs in splicing sites.</title><p>Mutation information, odds ratios, and SpliceAI model delta scores of splice site mutations in <italic toggle="yes">LILRA2</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">FYB1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">HACL1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">RPRD1A</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">NCAPD3</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">SRPRA</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">SERPINB6</italic> genes.

This study addresses a critical clinical question regarding the genetic factors contributing to colorectal cancer (CRC) recurrence in stage III patients. The authors have employed whole-exome sequencing (WES) and machine learning models to identify potential genetic markers of recurrence, making a valuable contribution to precision oncology. The study is well-designed and has several major strengths that enhance its scientific and clinical impact. However, I have the following major concerns:</p><p>1.The study utilizes tumor-only sequencing, which does not differentiate between somatic and germline mutations. This may result in the misclassification of inherited variants as tumor-specific, potentially affecting clinical interpretations.</p><p>2.The study focuses exclusively on Korean patients with stage III colorectal cancer. Given that genetic and environmental factors influencing recurrence may differ across ethnic groups and CRC stages, the applicability of these findings to broader populations is limited. Please discuss this limitation.</p><p>3.While the study identifies statistically significant mutations, it does not confirm their functional impact through experimental validation (e.g., gene expression studies, protein function assays). Without biological validation, the clinical relevance of these mutations remains uncertain.</p><p>4.The CRC recurrence prediction model, developed using machine learning (PyCaret), achieved an AUC of 0.77. While this suggests moderate predictive performance, further validation with external patient cohorts is necessary before clinical application.</p><p>5.The study considers clinical variables such as T-category, N-category, and preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels but does not account for lifestyle factors, treatment adherence, or comorbidities, which may also influence CRC recurrence. Including such factors would provide a more comprehensive analysis.</p><p>6.The study excludes tumors with &#x0003e;24 mutations per megabase to remove hypermutated samples. However, hypermutation status plays a crucial role in immune response and tumor evolution. Its exclusion may limit insights into the mechanisms of CRC recurrence.</p><p>I appreciate the authors' efforts and believe addressing these concerns will further strengthen the study.</p><p>Reviewer #2:&#x000a0;The study provides valuable insights into the genetics of CRC recurrence; however, it would benefit from functional validation, external cohort validation, and broader population studies. I recommend considering minor revisions to enhance methodological robustness and clinical applicability. Below are my comments:</p><p>&#x02022;While the study filters common variants using gnomAD, ExAC, dbSNP, 1000 Genomes Project, KOVA2, and KRGDB, how do the authors address database inaccuracies or population-specific variants that may lead to false positives (wrongly retained somatic variants) or false negatives (important tumor mutations mistakenly removed)?</p><p>&#x02022;WES cannot reliably detect large structural variations, copy number alterations (CNVs), or epigenetic modifications, which may be critical in CRC recurrence. Could the authors provide explanations or alternative approaches to account for these limitations?</p><p>&#x02022;The study utilizes Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) for protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis, which relies on pre-existing knowledge. However, novel mutations and unknown interactions may be overlooked without experimental validation (e.g., CRISPR functional studies, RNA-seq for expression analysis). Could the authors discuss the potential impact of this limitation?</p><p>&#x02022;The study identifies seven splicing site mutations and predicts their effects using SpliceAI. However, without RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) validation, it remains unclear whether these mutations actually result in abnormal splicing events in CRC patients. How do the authors address this concern?</p><p>&#x02022;An important limitation of this study is its exclusive focus on somatic mutations in tumor samples, without assessing germline risk variants that may contribute to hereditary CRC syndromes (e.g., Lynch syndrome, APC mutations in FAP). Acknowledging germline contributions could enhance risk stratification and patient management strategies. Could the authors discuss how future studies might address this gap?</p><p>**********</p><p>6.

This may result in the misclassification of inherited variants as tumor-specific, potentially affecting clinical interpretations.</p><p>We appreciate this important observation. Although we applied strict filtering using multiple population databases (gnomAD, ExAC, 1000 Genomes, etc.) to reduce germline contamination, we acknowledge that some germline variants may remain. In the revised manuscript, we have: Conducted an additional variant allele frequency (VAF) analysis to estimate the likelihood of each somatic single nucleotide mutation (SSM) being germline in origin. Determined that approximately 100 out of 221 SSMs had a &#x0003e;50% probability of being germline. Added explicit cautions in the Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion to highlight this limitation. Included a new Supplementary Table S7 summarizing these findings.</p><p>2.The study focuses exclusively on Korean patients with stage III colorectal cancer. Given that genetic and environmental factors influencing recurrence may differ across ethnic groups and CRC stages, the applicability of these findings to broader populations is limited. Please discuss this limitation.</p><p>We agree that restricting the cohort to Korean stage III CRC patients may limit generalizability to other ethnicities or CRC stages. However, Korea has a relatively homogeneous population, and a significant proportion of CRC-related deaths occur in stage III patients here. We have clarified in the Introduction that our aim was to address a critical issue in this specific national context, but we also acknowledge the importance of validating these findings in more diverse populations.</p><p>3.While the study identifies statistically significant mutations, it does not confirm their functional impact through experimental validation (e.g., gene expression studies, protein function assays). Without biological validation, the clinical relevance of these mutations remains uncertain.</p><p>We concur that experimental validation (e.g., gene expression or protein function assays) would strengthen our findings. While new experiments were not feasible within this study&#x02019;s scope, we performed a limited in silico validation by examining available public datasets for key genes (e.g., REXO1). We found indications (e.g., correlation with ARID3A) suggesting a functional role, but emphasize that further biological confirmation is necessary. We have added a paragraph in the Discussion regarding this limitation.</p><p>4.The CRC recurrence prediction model, developed using machine learning (PyCaret), achieved an AUC of 0.77. While this suggests moderate predictive performance, further validation with external patient cohorts is necessary before clinical application.</p><p>We agree. Due to the lack of publicly available tumor-only recurrence datasets, we could not perform external validation. We have acknowledged this shortcoming in the Discussion and highlighted the need for independent cohorts. As more datasets become available, we plan to refine and validate our model.</p><p>5.The study considers clinical variables such as T-category, N-category, and preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels but does not account for lifestyle factors, treatment adherence, or comorbidities, which may also influence CRC recurrence. Including such factors would provide a more comprehensive analysis.</p><p>We appreciate this suggestion. Our dataset focused primarily on molecular and core clinical variables from medical records, and data on lifestyle or comorbidities were not available. We have acknowledged this limitation in the Discussion, citing relevant research that underscores the importance of such factors. We recommend that future studies incorporate more comprehensive clinical variables.</p><p>6.The study excludes tumors with &#x0003e;24 mutations per megabase to remove hypermutated samples. However, hypermutation status plays a crucial role in immune response and tumor evolution. Its exclusion may limit insights into the mechanisms of CRC recurrence.</p><p>I appreciate the authors' efforts and believe addressing these concerns will further strengthen the study.</p><p>We initially excluded 13 hypermutated cases (5 recurrence, 8 non-recurrence) for consistency in our main analysis. To address this concern, we performed a supplementary analysis on these 13 samples (see Supplementary File S1, Tables C&#x02013;D and Figures E&#x02013;H). These results are also summarized in the revised Methods, Results, and Discussion. We acknowledge the potential importance of hypermutated tumors and recommend future studies with larger hypermutated cohorts.</p><p>-----</p><p>To the Reviewer 2,</p><p>1. While the study filters common variants using gnomAD, ExAC, dbSNP, 1000 Genomes Project, KOVA2, and KRGDB, how do the authors address database inaccuracies or population-specific variants that may lead to false positives (wrongly retained somatic variants) or false negatives (important tumor mutations mistakenly removed)?</p><p>To minimize false positives, we used the union of multiple databases (gnomAD, ExAC, dbSNP, 1000 Genomes, KOVA2, KRGDB). We acknowledge that some true mutations might be filtered out (false negatives), but this approach increases confidence that retained mutations are truly somatic. We have clarified this rationale in the revised manuscript.</p><p>2. WES cannot reliably detect large structural variations, copy number alterations (CNVs), or epigenetic modifications, which may be critical in CRC recurrence. Could the authors provide explanations or alternative approaches to account for these limitations?</p><p>We agree WES has limited capacity for detecting structural variations, CNVs, or epigenetic modifications. While tools like ECOLE exist to estimate CNVs from WES, their accuracy remains insufficient for clinical use. We highlight these limitations in the revised Discussion and emphasize the need for expanded genomic profiling methods.</p><p>3. The study utilizes Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) for protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis, which relies on pre-existing knowledge. However, novel mutations and unknown interactions may be overlooked without experimental validation (e.g., CRISPR functional studies, RNA-seq for expression analysis). Could the authors discuss the potential impact of this limitation?</p><p>IPA draws on a curated database, potentially missing novel interactions. To partially address this, we cross-referenced results with the STRING database. Notably, SS18L1 (associated with non-recurrence) formed more connections in STRING than in IPA, suggesting further experimental study is warranted. We discuss these points in the revised Discussion and include STRING-based network visualizations in Supplementary File S4.</p><p>4. The study identifies seven splicing site mutations and predicts their effects using SpliceAI. However, without RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) validation, it remains unclear whether these mutations actually result in abnormal splicing events in CRC patients. How do the authors address this concern?</p><p>We acknowledge that RNA-seq validation is the gold standard to confirm splicing defects. Due to data and IRB constraints, we could not conduct such experiments. As an alternative, we used SpliceAPP alongside SpliceAI; both tools independently supported potential splicing effects for mutations in LILRA2 and SRPRA, though they differed on SERPINB6. These findings are included in the revised Results and Supplementary Table S5.</p><p>5. An important limitation of this study is its exclusive focus on somatic mutations in tumor samples, without assessing germline risk variants that may contribute to hereditary CRC syndromes (e.g., Lynch syndrome, APC mutations in FAP). Acknowledging germline contributions could enhance risk stratification and patient management strategies. Could the authors discuss how future studies might address this gap?</p><p>Germline risk variants (e.g., Lynch syndrome, FAP) are crucial but could not be systematically assessed without matched normal samples. We now explicitly state this limitation in the Discussion, noting that future tumor-normal paired studies are needed for comprehensive hereditary risk analysis.</p><supplementary-material id="pone.0323302.s014" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>Attachment</label><caption><p>Submitted filename: <named-content content-type="submitted-filename">response_to_reviewers.docx</named-content></p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0323302.s014.docx"/></supplementary-material></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="aggregated-review-documents" id="pone.0323302.r004" specific-use="decision-letter"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0323302.r004</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision Letter 1</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Mahdieh</surname><given-names>Nejat</given-names></name><role>Academic Editor</role></contrib></contrib-group><permissions><copyright-statement>&#x000a9; 2025 Nejat Mahdieh</copyright-statement><copyright-year>2025</copyright-year><copyright-holder>Nejat Mahdieh</copyright-holder><license><ali:license_ref xmlns:ali="http://www.niso.org/schemas/ali/1.0/" specific-use="textmining" content-type="ccbylicense">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</ali:license_ref><license-p>This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution License</ext-link> , which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.</license-p></license></permissions><related-article ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.1371/journal.pone.0323302" id="rel-obj004" related-article-type="reviewed-article"/><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>Submission Version</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></front-stub><body><p>
