However, it has not been well studied, especially in low-income countries like Ethiopia. This study&#x02019;s objective was to assess the degree of sleep quality and related factors among people with asthma who had follow-up visits at public hospitals in the East Gojjam Zone.</p></sec><sec id="sec028"><title>Methods</title><p>An institutional-based cross-sectional study design was conducted among 406 people with asthma through consecutive sampling techniques at public hospitals in East Gojjam Zone from June 6 to July 1, 2022. Sleep quality was measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index through a face-to-face interview, and the collected data were entered into Epi Data version 4.4.2 and exported to SPSS version 25 for analysis. Logistic regression was fitted to assess the association between dependent and independent variables.

Severe asthma, having comorbidity, very poorly controlled asthma, poor sleep hygiene practices, having anxiety symptoms and current use of alcohol were variables associated with poor sleep quality. Reduction in alcohol consumption, improving sleep hygiene practices, and treating comorbidities would be effective measures for improving poor sleep quality.

id="sec023"><title>Discussion</title><p>Although poor sleep quality is a common issue for people with asthma and has an impact on quality of life and productivity at work, its prevalence and associated factors for those people were unknown because, as per the researchers&#x02019; knowledge, no research had been conducted in Ethiopia. The purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence of sleep quality and related factors among asthmatic individuals.</p><p>The findings of this study can help health care providers to develop better management plans that address both asthma symptoms and sleep disturbances, to improve sleep quality by adjusting medications or introducing sleep hygiene practices. The findings can also inform policy changes and updates to clinical guidelines, ensuring that the importance of sleep quality is recognized in the management of asthma.</p><p>In this study, the overall prevalence of poor sleep quality among people with asthma was found to be 64.5%, with a 95% CI of 60.1&#x02013;69.2. The result was in line with the study done in Saudi Arabia (66%) [<xref rid="pone.0323284.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>However, the finding of this study was higher than the studies conducted in Owo and Ondo States in Nigeria (60%) [<xref rid="pone.0323284.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], in Pakistan (54.5%) [<xref rid="pone.0323284.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and in Italy (58.3%) [<xref rid="pone.0323284.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The discrepancy between the current study and studies conducted in Nigeria and Pakistan might be due to the smaller sample size in the studies conducted in Nigeria and Pakistan [<xref rid="pone.0323284.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Another reason for the difference between the current study and the study conducted in Nigeria might be because individuals with asthma who had other comorbid chronic diseases were excluded from the study conducted in Nigeria [<xref rid="pone.0323284.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The discrepancy between the current study and the study conducted in Italy might be due to the difference in socio-demographic characteristics of the participants between the two countries [<xref rid="pone.0323284.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].</p><p>On the other hand the finding of this study was lower than the studies conducted in China (69.9%) [<xref rid="pone.0323284.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], in Iran (72.4%) [<xref rid="pone.0323284.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] in USA (79%) [<xref rid="pone.0323284.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and in Brazil (80.49%) [<xref rid="pone.0323284.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. This discrepancy might be due to socio-economic, psychosocial, and behavioral differences among the study participants [<xref rid="pone.0323284.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].</p><p>In a multivariable logistic regression analysis, people with severe asthma were 2.31 times more likely to have poor sleep quality when compared with people with mild asthma. This was in line with the studies conducted in Italy [<xref rid="pone.0323284.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], in Japan [<xref rid="pone.0323284.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and in London [<xref rid="pone.0323284.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The symptoms of severe asthma are more intense, last for prolonged periods, and do not respond well to standard asthma treatments, which might be the reason why individuals with severe asthma were more likely to have poor sleep quality than individuals with mild asthma [<xref rid="pone.0323284.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].</p><p>People with very poorly controlled asthma were 4.00 times more likely to be poor sleepers than individuals with well-controlled asthma. The result was consistent with the studies conducted in Italy [<xref rid="pone.0323284.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], Japan [<xref rid="pone.0323284.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], Spain [<xref rid="pone.0323284.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], China [<xref rid="pone.0323284.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and USA [<xref rid="pone.0323284.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. This might be because individuals with very poorly controlled asthma have daily symptoms of asthma such as coughing, chest tightness, and shortness of breath and may experience nighttime flare-ups, which greatly affect their sleep quality [<xref rid="pone.0323284.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].</p><p>People with asthma who had poor sleep hygiene practices were 2.99 times more likely to have poor sleep quality than their counterparts. The result was in line with a study done in the USA [<xref rid="pone.0323284.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. This could be due to poor sleep habits such as drinking stimulants (coffee) close to bedtime, having an irregular sleep-wake schedule that disrupts normal sleep patterns, infrequent exercise, watching television in bed, and reading in bed, all of which affect sleep quality [<xref rid="pone.0323284.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].</p><p>People with asthma who had chronic comorbid diseases were 3.11 times more likely to have poor sleep quality when compared with people without other comorbid diseases. This might be due to the presence of other chronic comorbid diseases resulting in poor control of asthma symptoms, more complications, and increased emotional disorders, which might negatively affect the sleep quality of people with asthma [<xref rid="pone.0323284.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>].</p><p>People with asthma and current alcohol users were 3.20 times more likely to be poor sleepers than their counterparts. This might be because consuming alcohol leads to a number of nighttime awakenings due to snoring, and alcohol causes excessive relaxation of the throat muscles, which leads to narrowing or completely closing the airway, increasing resistance during inhalation, which directly and significantly impedes breathing and significantly and negatively affects sleep quality [<xref rid="pone.0323284.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>].</p><p>People with asthma who had anxiety symptoms were 2.67 times more likely to have poor sleep quality than their counterparts. This might be because people with anxiety have excess worry and fear, which makes it harder to fall asleep and stay asleep through the night. This can lead to sleep fragmentation, reducing both the quantity and quality of their sleep [<xref rid="pone.0323284.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec024"><title>Limitation of the study</title><p>The limitation of the study might be the nature of the study design, which was a cross-sectional study design that did not establish a temporal relationship between the outcome and the independent variables. Recall bias and social desirability bias might be the other limitations.</p></sec><sec id="sec025"><title>Conclusion and recommendation</title><p>The magnitude of poor sleep quality among people with asthma was high in this study. Severe asthma, having comorbid diseases, very poorly controlled asthma, having poor sleep hygiene practices, having anxiety symptoms, and current alcohol use were significantly associated with poor sleep quality.</p><p>Since the magnitude of poor sleep quality is high, it needs great attention and remedial actions from health professionals, policymakers, the ministry of health, non-governmental organizations, and other concerned bodies to enhance the sleep quality of individuals with asthma. Reduction in alcohol consumption, improving sleep hygiene practices, and treating comorbidities would be effective measures for improving poor sleep quality. Giving special attentions for individuals with severe asthma and uncontrolled asthma symptoms is also needed. Individuals who participate in the preparation and revision of the treatment guideline should incorporate a sleep quality assessment check list into the guideline for people with asthma and put appropriate interventions in place for those who have poor sleep quality. It is better if future researchers conduct prospective follow-up studies in order to identify the cause-and-effect relationship between the factors and poor sleep quality.</p></sec><sec id="sec026" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material id="pone.0323284.s001" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>This S1 File is the date set used for this study.</title><p>(RAR)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0323284.s001.rar"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank the study participants for their cooperation and the staffs working in the hospitals found in East Gojjam Zone for their support during data collection</p></ack><glossary><title>Acronyms and Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>ACT</term><def><p>Asthma Control Test</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AOR</term><def><p>Adjusted Odd Ratio</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ASSIST</term><def><p>Alcohol Smoking and Substance Involvement Screening Test</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BPH</term><def><p>Bichena Primary Hospital</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BIPH</term><def><p>Bibugn Primary Hospital</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CI</term><def><p>Confidence Interval</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>COR</term><def><p>Crude Odd Ratio</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DALYs</term><def><p>Disability-Adjusted Life-Years</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DEPH</term><def><p>Debre Elias Primary Hospital</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DMCSH</term><def><p>Debre Markos Comprehensive Specialized Hospital</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DPH</term><def><p>Dejen Primary Hospital</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DWPH</term><def><p>Debre Work Primary Hospitals</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GINA</term><def><p>Global Initiative for Asthma</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ICS</term><def><p>Inhaled Corticosteroids</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LPH</term><def><p>Lumamie Primary Hospital</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MGH</term><def><p>Motta General Hospital</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PSQI</term><def><p>Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SBPH</term><def><p>Shebel Berenta Primary Hospital</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SDI</term><def><p>Socio-Demographic Index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SOB</term><def><p>Shortness of Breath</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SPSS</term><def><p>Statistical Project Service Solution</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SSD</term><def><p>Short Sleep Duration</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WHO</term><def><p>World Health Organization</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>YLDs</term><def><p>Years Lived With Disability</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>YLLs</term><def><p>Years of Life Lost</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>YPH</term><def><p>Yejubie Primary Hospital</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0323284.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Reddel</surname><given-names>HK</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Bacharier</surname><given-names>LB</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Bateman</surname><given-names>ED</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Brightling</surname><given-names>CE</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Brusselle</surname><given-names>GG</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Buhl</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name>, <etal>et al</etal>.<article-title>Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) Strategy 2021&#x02013;Executive summary and rationale for key changes.</article-title><source>J Allergy Clin Immunol Pract</source>. <year>2021</year>;<volume>10</volume>(1S):S1&#x02013;<lpage>S18</lpage>.</mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0323284.ref002"><label>2</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><collab>GBD 2019 Diseases and Injuries Collaborators</collab>. <article-title>Global burden of 369 diseases and injuries in 204 countries and territories, 1990-2019: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019</article-title>. <source>Lancet</source>. <year>2020</year>;<volume>396</volume>(<issue>10258</issue>):<fpage>1204</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>22</lpage>. <comment>doi: </comment><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30925-9</pub-id>

Your ethics statement should only appear in the Methods section of your manuscript. If your ethics statement is written in any section besides the Methods, please move it to the Methods section and delete it from any other section. Please ensure that your ethics statement is included in your manuscript, as the ethics statement entered into the online submission form will not be published alongside your manuscript.</p><p>Additional Editor Comments (if provided):</p><p>Thank you for your nice work. While acknowledging the scientific validity of this study, I would like to kindly request that the authors make significant improvements to the manuscript to meet the quality standards required for the journal. The current version of the manuscript appears to have several shortcomings. I would strongly recommend that the authors seek support form a native English speaker for thorough editing. There are instances of spelling errors and incomplete sentences (grammatically incorrect) and formatting issues (e.g., table presentation) observed throughout the manuscript. I would suggest your attention to these details may greatly enhance the overall quality of the work. Authors also need to attend the following major points in addition to the reviewers' comments.</p><p>1. The sample size determination was based on a prevalence rate from a study conducted in Nigeria. To what extent can the prevalence of asthma and related factors be considered similar between Nigeria and East Gojjam Zone in Ethiopia, and how might this affect the generalizability of the findings? How might the regional and cultural differences between Nigeria and East Gojjam Zone affect the generalizability of the findings? I couldn&#x02019;t find something related to this in the manuscript.</p><p>2. How did authors manage the potential sources of bias in data collection, given that the data was collected by trained nurses who were also working in the chronic disease follow-up outpatient department? Have you considered how might this affect the accuracy of the results?</p><p>3. The study considers various factors, including clinical, psychosocial, and behavioural variables, as potential predictors of poor sleep quality among people with asthma. Could you elaborate on the theoretical basis or prior research that supports the inclusion of these specific variables in the analysis?</p><p>4. This study was based on self-reported data for variables such as sleep quality, social support, and substance use. How might self-reporting introduce biases and limitations in the study's results, and what steps were taken to mitigate these potential issues?</p><p>5. Different data ascertainment tools were used to assess several factors. How does the reliability and validity of these assessment tools impact the robustness of your study&#x02019;s findings, and were these tools validated for the specific population studied in East Gojjam Zone in Ethiopia?</p><p>6. Would you please provide evidence why did you use P-value of &#x0003c;0.25 to include variables in multivariable logistic regression (at least provide citations)?</p><p>7. The discussion section lacks a critical element. In addition to comparing your study with similar research, the authors should also delve into the significance of their findings within the context of Ethiopian or East African or African literature. Furthermore, it is essential for the authors to explore the policy, practice, and research implications arising from their findings.</p><p>[Note: HTML markup is below.

The overall manuscript is done on important health problems, but I strongly recommend that authors modify the following issues before considering this article for publication:</p><p>Over all, the manuscript should be edited for English language and grammar issues.</p><p>Abstract: "The magnitude of poor sleep quality among people with... is widespread and has</p><p>detrimental consequences "This sentence is not full; it lacks words.</p><p>It is better to include the gap of this study in the background part of the abstract.</p><p>Introduction</p><p>It is better to show in detail the pathophysiology of sleep and asthma. I think, despite it not being done in the study area, there are studies that show related magnitude with almost related factors. What different considerations or approaches did researchers include for the current study? What is the difference between this study's different outputs of sleep quality and those of other medical illnesses, even those done in Ethiopia?</p><p>Methods</p><p>What is the reason behind using non-probability sampling? Is there any scientific reason to exclude participants with a follow-up of less than 2 months? I think it was also possible to take all 576 participants without considering allocation. What was the reason to use backward variable selection rather than the default enter method?</p><p>Result</p><p>Please limit the number of figures; it is not important to describe age separately by figure; rather, you can use sociodemographic tables. Similarly, for controlled asthma and the like,</p><p>18.2% of participants cannot read and write. Have you approached those regarding ethical issues for such people? Since nothing is reported for them.</p><p>From your findings, 64.3% of respondents use alcohol is currently. Which type of alcohol, and how could participants reported, specifies this question? I consider that almost all of the people taking medication for asthma are recommended to stop drinking, and your participants are also those with follow-ups lasting more than 2 months.
