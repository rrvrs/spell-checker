Its incidence continues to increase significantly in several countries. Pneumonia is one of the leading causes of death in children under five years of age, surpassing other infectious diseases, including measles and AIDS (Hockenberry <italic>et al.</italic>, 2023). An estimated 1.2 million children under five years of age die from pneumonia each year (Anjaswanti <italic>et al.</italic>, 2022), equating to more than 2,200 deaths every day, including over 153,000 newborns, in 2018 (UNICEF, 2020). It is expected to remain the leading cause of death among children under five until 2040 (Wangdi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2021). Pneumonia is a significant cause of childhood morbidity and mortality, particularly in developing countries (Tintinalli <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016; Cill&#x000f3;niz <italic>et al.</italic>, 2021; Kusumadewi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2023).</p><p>More than half of the new cases of under-five pneumonia occur in five countries: India (44 million), China (18 million), Nigeria and Pakistan (7 million each), and Bangladesh and Indonesia (6 million each) (WHO, 2014). According to data from the World Health Organization, there were 25,481 under-five deaths due to pneumonia in Indonesia, ranking seventh among the countries with the highest pneumonia burden in the world (WHO, 2021). According to the 2018 Indonesian Basic Health Research Report, the prevalence of pneumonia among under-fives in Indonesia reached 2.1 percent, with the highest prevalence occurring in children aged 12-23 months (MoH, 2019).</p><p>Pneumonia is also the leading cause of death in children under 11 months of age (14.5%), and the second leading cause of death in children aged 12-59 months, with a proportion of 5.05% (MoH, 2021). Riau Province has a high rate of under-five pneumonia cases, with a prevalence of 1.46 percent. An estimated 18,241 under-fives in Riau Province suffered from pneumonia in 2019, with the Rokan Hilir District being one of the areas with a high prevalence of under-fives pneumonia, reaching 2.04 percent (DoH Riau, 2019). There were 1,954 cases of under-five pneumonia in the Rokan Hilir Regency, accounting for approximately 10.71% of the total cases in Riau Province in 2020 (DoH Riau, 2020). Pneumonia is an infectious disease caused by several agents including viruses, bacteria, and fungi. The most common causes in HIV-infected children are <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae type b</italic> (Hib), <italic>respiratory syncytial virus</italic>, and <italic>Pneumocystis jiroveci</italic> (Kusumadewi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2023).</p><p>Streptococcus infections can occur in endemic areas and in immunodeficient children. Therefore, authorities should consider local and regional epidemiological factors (Tintinalli <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016), which require analysis of risk factors and spatial distribution patterns.</p><p>The increase in under-five pneumonia cases in the Rokan Hilir Regency is related to many determining variables associated with features of airborne infections. Demographic traits, climatic variability, socioeconomic status, and the availability of health infrastructure are factors that require careful consideration. Furthermore, disregarding the patterns of disease spread further complicates efforts to address under-five pneumonia as an airborne illness. Understanding epidemiological principles, identifying factors, and comprehending the patterns of illness distribution are essential prerequisites for devising effective preventive and control methods. Examination of these risk factors has led to the identification of factors that can contribute to disease prevention and control. Knowing disease distribution patterns helps to identify high-risk locations, understand the environmental and socioeconomic variables leading to disease spread, and provide information essential for establishing targeted intervention programs.</p><p>Comprehensive efforts are required to address this concern, including gathering data on factors and distribution patterns associated with pneumonia epidemiology. Risk factor modeling and the use of GIS-based technologies can help identify previously unseen risk factors and distribution patterns. In the last decade, disease epidemiology using mathematical and spatial modeling has been widely used as a data analysis and visualization tool for structuring disease interventions (Robinson, 2000). The application of GIS helps recognize spatial differences, patterns, and risk factors of disease and improves health services (Jaber <italic>et al.</italic>, 2022). Spatial analyses have been widely applied to several infectious diseases (Openshaw, 1996; Kitron, 1998; Bergquist, 2001; Sithiprasasna <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004; FD <italic>et al.</italic>, 2023) and play an important role in disease surveillance and control (Albrecht, 2024).</p><p>The intricacy of risk factors and geographical distribution patterns of under-five pneumonia in the Rokan Hilir District warrant detailed scientific research. Unlike other airborne illnesses, such as TB, which has a national preventive program via directly observed treatment short course (DOTS), under-five pneumonia does not have a preventative program, particularly at the local level. Attention to the spread of under-five pneumonia is now only at the level of manually collecting case findings and short-term treatment of suspected cases. Therefore, information on the risk factors and distribution patterns of under-five pneumonia cases in Rokan Hilir District has never been researched or published. This study aimed to precisely identify and assess the risk factors that impact the growth of under-five pneumonia cases and their distribution patterns using mathematical and geographical modeling. The novelty of this study is the development of a method for prioritizing spatial interventions to prevent pneumonia in children under five years of age by effectively considering the vulnerability levels of different regions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Study Area</title><p>The District of Rokan Hilir is situated at latitudes of 1&#x000b0; 14&#x02019; 0&#x02033; N to 2&#x000b0; 45&#x02019; 0&#x02033; N and longitudes of 100&#x000b0; 17 &#x02019; 0&#x02033; E to 101&#x000b0; 21&#x02019; 0&#x02033; E (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>).

Descriptive analysis was used to provide an overview of the data distribution for each study variable. The links between demographic variables; climatic variability; social, economic, and health infrastructure; and under-five pneumonia cases were studied using the GPR model. The GPR model is a nonlinear regression model used for count data in which the response variable follows a Poisson distribution (Utama and Hajarisman, 2021). Poisson distribution is the distribution of events that rely on a specific period or specific region using data in the form of discrete variables. The processes of developing the GPR model include: 1).

The risk factor is declared free from multicollinearity if the VIF value is &#x0003c;10; if the VIF&#x0003e;10, the variable is removed from the model using the backward elimination method (Achmad <italic>et al.</italic>, 2022); 2) Classify the response (dependent) variable on a Poisson distributed discrete random variable with parameter &#x003b2; using the probability function equation <italic>f</italic>(<italic>y,&#x003bc;</italic>) = <inline-graphic xlink:href="AJID-19-15-g005.jpg"/>/y<sub>i</sub>; y = 0,1,2 (&#x003bc; = mean value and variance y&#x0003e;0); 3) Construct a Poisson regression model with the equation <inline-graphic xlink:href="AJID-19-15-g006.jpg"/> (<inline-graphic xlink:href="AJID-19-15-g007.jpg"/> = average under-five pneumonia cases in a given time interval, &#x003b2; = constant, Xi = risk factor); 4) Testing the effect of the risk factor (x) on the response variable (y) with the equation <italic>Z-<sub>score</sub></italic> = <inline-graphic xlink:href="AJID-19-15-g008.jpg"/> for partial effect and the equation <inline-graphic xlink:href="AJID-19-15-g009.jpg"/> for simultaneous effect, provided that if the value of |<italic>Z-<sub>score</sub></italic>| &#x0003e; <italic>Z<sub>&#x003b1;</sub></italic>/2 with &#x003b1; = 0.05, then the risk factor (X) has a partially significant impact on the response variable (Y), if the value of <inline-graphic xlink:href="AJID-19-15-g010.jpg"/>
<italic>&#x0003e; &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup><sub>(p,&#x003b1;)</sub></italic> means that there is at least one risk factor (X) that has a significant effect on the response variable (Y). Spatial data analysis was performed using the GIS approach through interpolation and reclassification techniques.</p><p>The spatial distribution of risk factors and the distribution of under-five pneumonia cases were interpolated using the IDW method with the equation <inline-graphic xlink:href="AJID-19-15-g011.jpg"/>, (<italic>Z<sub>i</sub></italic> = the height value of data from number of N points, wi = weight value, x,y = coordinates of interpolation points, i = coordinates for each point distribution) (Azpurua and Dos Ramos, 2010). Spatial distribution classification uses the natural breaks method (Jenk optimization) based on EHDP (Dent, 1999; Hibatullah, 2016; Slocum <italic>et al.</italic>, 2022; Harahap <italic>et al.</italic>, 2023), which divides groups based on the value of the standard deviation of the least squares as the optimum regional divider (Ekawati <italic>et al.</italic>, 2021; Kassam <italic>et al.</italic>, 2021). Furthermore, data from the reclassification of natural breaks were digitized in the form of polygons based on sub-district administrative borders with important factors and the number of under-five pneumonia cases as characteristics. The vulnerability level of the region was evaluated into high, medium, and low-risk zones using a scoring approach for the determining variables, employing a Likert scale with the following parameters: low = 1, medium = 2, and high = 3 (Muriithi, 2023). The total risk score was calculated by summing the individual values for each determining factor. Furthermore, the locations were categorized based on the value of the natural break range, using an overlay approach.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Risk factors of under-five pneumonia</title><p>According to the demographic variables, the average population density of Rokan Hilir District in 2021 is approximately 70 people/km&#x000b2;, with substantial variance among the sub-districts.

One of the requirements that must be met in the preparation of the Poisson regression model is the fulfilment of multicollinearity requirements by examining the Varian Inflation Factor (VIF) value of each risk factor with the provisions that if the VIF value &#x0003c;10, then there is no multicollinearity case; otherwise, if the VIF value &#x0003e;10, then there is a multicollinearity case. The multicollinearity test results revealed that the risk factors of air temperature, air humidity, and the number of health workers had a VIF&#x0003e;10, which suggests that there is a case of multicollinearity in the three variables; thus, they must be excluded from the model.</p><p>The risk factors of population density, rainfall, PM 2.5 &#x000b5;m concentration, exclusive breastfeeding, CHL, malnutrition in children under five years, healthy homes, poor population, coverage of health services for children under five years, number of health workers, and number of health facilities were continued as candidate risk factors to compose the model. The autocorrelation checks between candidate risk factors using the residual run test was 1.00 (&#x0003e;0.05), which shows that there is no autocorrelation between risk factors and fits the criteria for the Poisson regression model of under-five pneumonia cases.

Denser populations tend to have more intensive and frequent human contact, which increases the transmission of infectious pathogens to several airborne illnesses (Jin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2022). The Poisson regression model in the Rokan Hilir district indicated that somewhat similar dynamics in one incidence of under-five pneumonia would rise with every 0.70 person/km&#x000b2; increase in the population density. The same was also reported, noting that an increase in population density led to a rise in the number of under-five pneumonia cases in Java (Renika, 2021). A substantial association between population density and under-five pneumonia cases was also identified in Surabaya City, where every one percent rise in population density increased two instances of under-five pneumonia (Maghfiroh <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016). Population density has also increased five cases of pneumonia in Central Java Province (Utami and Yanti, 2021). A one-unit increase in Indonesia&#x02019;s population density leads to one in five fatalities from pneumonia (Savitri <italic>et al.</italic>, 2022). In high-density areas, children under-five years of age are more commonly exposed to sources of illness via direct contact with diseased persons or through contaminated air. The spatial distribution of under-five pneumonia cases in the Rokan Hilir Regency is concentrated in urban areas with a relatively high population density, which tends to increase slums, hygiene problems, and malnutrition, thereby accelerating the spread of under-five pneumonia (Walker <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013). Spatially and temporally, an increase in under-five pneumonia cases is usually related to increased population density in urban regions (Sutriana <italic>et al.</italic>, 2021). Some strategic steps that can be taken to anticipate demographic factors include improving the facilities, quality, and accessibility of health services in densely populated areas; improving the quality of housing in urban areas to comply with sanitation and health standards to reduce the risk of spreading under-five pneumonia; increasing de-densification efforts through good spatial planning and construction of liveable housing in peripheral areas to reduce density in the city center; and local transmigration by relocating part of the population from dense areas to areas with lower populations, followed by adequate infrastructure development in the new areas. Based on spatial analysis, the sub-districts of Rantau Kopar, Batu Hampar, Pekaitan, Pujud, Tanah Putih, and Kubu Babussalam need to be prioritized for local transmigration and de-densification of affordable housing to relieve pressure in densely populated sub-districts. A fairer distribution of people via local transmigration initiatives is a successful strategy to considerably lower the transmission rate of airborne illnesses, such as tuberculosis (TB), in the Rokan Hilir Regency (FD <italic>et al.</italic>, 2023) .</p><p>Rainfall was the lead climatic variable that substantially affected the spread of pneumonia in Rokan Hilir District, in addition to other variables such as air temperature, air humidity, and PM2.5 &#x000b5;m concentration. This finding suggests that air temperature, air humidity, and PM2.5 &#x000b5;m concentration are not direct determinants of under-five pneumonia in the Rokan Hilir District. Jati and Ginandjar (2017) indicated that air temperature and humidity were not significantly associated with pneumonia despite their possible influence on acute respiratory infection (ARI) in girls. Similarly, the concentration of PM2.5 &#x000b5;m assessed in ambient air did not indicate a significant connection with an increase in under-five pneumonia infections, particularly in low-income and middle-income countries (Adaji <italic>et al.</italic>, 2019). The Poisson regression model in the Rokan Hilir area indicated an increase of one under five pneumonia cases for every 31.27 mm increase in rainfall. The mechanism of increased rainfall in the spread of under-five pneumonia is via an increase in the humidity of the microclimate within the home, which influences indoor air quality. This situation produces an optimal setting for the development and spread of harmful bacteria that cause respiratory tract infections in children under five years of age. In addition, stagnant water from excessive rain owing to inadequate household sanitation encourages the formation of disease vectors and enhances the spread of diseases via direct and indirect contact. The aggregation of these variables explains why the geographical distribution of high rainfall categories coincides with an increase in under-five pneumonia cases at the subdistrict level. Although the distribution of high rainfall improves macro-air quality and lowers particle concentrations, it causes the growth of indoor microorganisms to increase, thus affecting the incidence of under-five pneumonia, especially during the transitional season in tropical countries (Shetty and Shetty, 2009). Improving sanitation and drainage infrastructure to minimize waterlogging and decrease disease vector habitats are prioritized to prevent the development of pneumonia under five years of age due to excessive rain. Socialization and counseling on home health norms in susceptible locations should be addressed. Ensuring proper house ventilation and cleanliness will lower indoor humidity, thereby minimizing the incidence of under-five pneumonia despite the increasing rainfall.</p><p>Exclusive breastfeeding is a social factor that strongly impacts the growth of under-five pneumonia cases in Rokan Hilir District. Exclusive breastfeeding refers to providing breast milk as the sole source of nutrition for newborns, without the inclusion of supplemental fluids, solid foods, medications, or vitamins during the first six months of an infant&#x02019;s life. Exclusive breastfeeding was a balancing factor in the Poisson regression model related to the spread of under-five pneumonia cases, where an increase in the percentage of exclusive breastfeeding tended to decrease in five pneumonia cases, whereas a decrease in exclusive breastfeeding increased in five pneumonia cases. The Poisson regression model revealed an average increase of one new under-five pneumonia case attributable to a drop in the proportion of exclusive breastfeeding of 0.41%. Rahmitri and Winahju (2016) reported a reduction in the average number of under-five pneumonia cases in Padang City when exclusive breastfeeding rose by one percent. The incidence of severe pneumonia in Bone Bolango District and Gorontalo City has dropped by 0.1 times, with a one percent increase in exclusive breastfeeding (Achmad <italic>et al.</italic>, 2022). A reduction in 165 cases of under-five pneumonia in Bali Province occurred because of an increase in the rate of exclusive breastfeeding (Dewi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2020). Toddlers with a history of not being exclusively breastfed had 7.4 times increased risk of pneumonia compared with toddlers with a history of exclusive nursing (Fikri, 2016). Exclusive breastfeeding strives to me <italic>et al</italic> the nutritional demands of newborns in the first six-month period since breast milk includes complete and sufficient nutrients for child growth and development and provides protection against many infectious illnesses. Optimal nutrition in breast milk creates antibodies that are crucial for the infant&#x02019;s immune system; therefore, a low proportion of exclusive breastfeeding increases the vulnerability of under-fives to pneumonia (Lugonja <italic>et al.</italic>, 2024). Spatially, locations with poor exclusive breastfeeding rates are concentrated in vulnerable regions with insufficient under-five health facilities and services, especially Pasir Limau Kapas, Simpang Kanan, Sinaboi, Kubu, and Bagan Sinembah Raya sub-districts. Therefore, various strategic efforts need to be made, including intensive education and counseling programs on the importance of exclusive breastfeeding with a focus on mothers in vulnerable communities; provision of adequate support for breastfeeding mothers, including lactation counseling and support from trained health workers; public awareness campaigns involving community leaders and local media to change perceptions and habits about breastfeeding; and increasing the number of under-five health facilities and services that ensure a friendly environment for breastfeeding mothers, including comfortable breastfeeding rooms in public places and workplaces. Government policies that encourage appropriate maternity leave and protect nursing mothers&#x02019; rights in the workplace should be implemented to ensure that mothers have sufficient time and space to breastfeed their infants.</p><p>A clean and healthy lifestyle (CHL) was not significantly associated with the increase in under-five pneumonia cases in the Rokan Hilir District. Although numerous studies have explored the substantial link between CHL and under-five pneumonia, the findings of the Poisson regression analysis in this research revealed that CHL is not a direct driver of the increase in under-five pneumonia cases in the Rokan Hilir District. CHL enhances general health and minimizes the risk of infection by hand washing and by maintaining environmental hygiene (Samrah <italic>et al.</italic>, 2021). However, without particular treatments, such as vaccination against pneumonia-causing microorganisms or improving the nutritional condition of under-fives, CHL practices are not adequate to directly prevent or decrease the prevalence of under-fives pneumonia. Variations in the application of CHL at the home level in this study were not adequate to outweigh the protective influence of another social factor, exclusive breastfeeding. Although CHL was not a factor that directly influenced under-five pneumonia cases in this study, the implementation of CHL at the household level remains a fundamental foundation in efforts to enhance public health status for the prevention of different infectious illnesses in Indonesia (Kusuma, 2021).</p><p>Economic factors, including under-five malnutrition, percentage of healthy dwellings, and poverty rate, had varied impacts on the growth of under-five pneumonia cases in the Rokan Hilir District. The variables of under-five malnutrition and the proportion of healthy houses had a substantial effect on the increase in under-five pneumonia cases; however, the poverty variable showed no direct relationship. The Poisson regression model in the Rokan Hilir District showed an increase of six under-five pneumonia cases for every increase of 36 underweight children. Meanwhile, a 0.71% increase in the proportion of healthy households lowered the incidence of under-five pneumonia cases. These data imply that malnutrition is an essential predictor of the increase in under-five pneumonia cases, particularly in low-income countries (Imran and Imran, 2020). Lack of dietary intake impairs the immune system and respiratory muscles, limiting the process of clearing secretions in the respiratory tract of under-fives, rendering them prone to pneumonia (Alamneh and Adane, 2020). The significant relationship between malnutrition and an increase in under-five pneumonia cases is reinforced by the prevalence of stunting in the Rokan Hilir Regency in 2021, which has reached 29.7%, well above the average prevalence of stunting in Riau Province (23.3%) and Indonesia (24.4%) (Kusnandar, 2022). This result identifies under-five malnutrition as the most significant factor for under-five pneumonia incidence in the Riau Province (Isnaini, 2022) and Central Java Province (Utami <italic>et al.</italic>, 2021). In Surabaya City, a one percent rise in children under five years of age with malnutrition increased the average of two occurrences of pneumonia under five (Maghfiroh <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016). It has been predicted that more than half of the under-five pneumonia mortality rates in hospitals are caused by malnutrition (Kirolos <italic>et al.</italic>, 2021). Based on geographical distribution, malnutrition in the Rokan Hilir District is concentrated in locations with a low percentage of exclusive breastfeeding, insufficient coverage of toddler health services, and an inadequate ratio of health facilities. To anticipate under-five malnutrition, fundamental efforts that may be performed include supporting exclusive breastfeeding, supplemental feeding, and boosting community understanding and awareness of the significance of balanced nutrition for children&#x02019;s health. At a more advanced level, it is important to offer suitable under-five health facilities and services to reduce the incidence of under-five pneumonia in the Rokan Hilir District.</p><p>The proportion of healthy households plays a significant role in developing an atmosphere that promotes good health. A healthy house is a place to live that satisfies many technical health standards, so that its residents avoid various health issues and may attain optimum health status (Saragih <italic>et al.</italic>, 2022). There were 17 healthy home variables, including occupancy density, roof type, wall type, floor type, latrine ownership, latrine type, fecal disposal, drinking water source, distance from drinking water source to fecal storage, location of drinking water source, physical condition of water, location of hand washing, available water at the hand washing location, available hand washing liquid, lighting source, type of fuel for cooking, and location of the house (Veridona and Prabawa, 2020). Increasing the number of healthy houses may minimize the susceptibility to under-five pneumonia cases in a region (Fikri, 2016). The average percentage of healthy dwellings by subdistrict in the Rokan Hilir District was high at 71.11%, which is a counterbalancing variable to the risk of under-five pneumonia transmissions.</p><p>Although poverty levels are typically linked to inadequate access to healthcare and poor nutrition, a study in the Rokan Hilir District demonstrated that poverty does not have a clear association with an increase in under-five pneumonia cases. Similar situations also occur in patients with under-five pneumonia on Java (Renika, 2021). However, it should be highlighted that, within the conceptual framework, poor health may be a cause of poverty, and poverty can cause a low health status. This study illustrates that the government&#x02019;s efforts to provide health insurance for incapacitated people through the Jaminan Kesehatan Nasional (JKN) programs, which involve BPJS Kesehatan, Kartu Indonesia Sehat (KIS), Jaminan Kesehatan Daerah (Jamkesda), and Kesehatan Ibu dan Anak (KIA), have provided equal opportunities for incapacitated people to meet their health service access needs. The implementation of JKN via BPJS Kesehatan has a significant impact on increasing access to healthcare for the incapacitated (Putri, 2014; Djunawan, 2018). Around 1.33 million persons with inadequate economic situations, or around 20.91% of the total population in Riau Province in 2020, have been enrolled as BPJS Kesehatan participants with the PBI status of Contribution Assistance Recipients (CSA Riau, 2021).</p><p>The coverage of under-five health services and the number of under-five health facilities have a major influence on the under-five pneumonia cases in the Rokan Hilir District. Adequate access to these services helps prevent and treat the condition early. Under-five healthcare coverage, which includes vaccination, growth monitoring, and dietary treatments, may successfully lower the incidence of pneumonia by boosting the immune system of under-five individuals. The Poisson regression model demonstrated that every 0.62% average increase in under-five healthcare coverage might lower the occurrence of under-five pneumonia. Similarly, a one percent increase in the number of health facilities would increase the number of under-five pneumonia cases by one. (Maghfiroh <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016) indicated that every one percent improvement in the coverage of under-five health services would lower the incidence of under-five pneumonia in Surabaya City. A drop in the proportion of under-five health services is assumed to be the reason for the rise in 411 under-five pneumonia cases in the Bali Province (Dewi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2020). Suboptimal coverage of under-five healthcare will affect the growth of under-five pneumonia cases (Guswahyuni <italic>et al.</italic>, 2019). A comprehensive under-five healthcare coverage, including vaccination, early diagnosis, and treatment of illness, may prevent pneumonia and its associated sequelae.</p><p>The availability of adequate health facilities offers timely access to diagnostics, case detection, treatment, and medical care, which are crucial in handling under-five pneumonia cases that frequently require urgent intervention. Low under-five healthcare coverage implies that fewer children receive critical preventative therapy, such as <italic>Pneumococcal</italic> and <italic>Haemophilus influenzae type b</italic> (Hib) vaccinations, which are beneficial for preventing pneumonia (O&#x02019;brien <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009). The number of first-level health facilities, such as community health centers (puskesmas), has a substantial impact on the number of under-five pneumonia cases in Rokan Hilir District, where the larger the number of puskesmas, the higher the number of under-five pneumonia cases discovered. The availability of health services in a location can boost the finding of under-five pneumonia cases compared to other places with inadequate health facilities (Renika, 2021). The absence of appropriate ratios and restricted access to health treatments for children under five years of age increases the susceptibility to transmission of under-five pneumonia (Fekadu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2024). Therefore, boosting the coverage of under-five health services and guaranteeing the availability and proper distribution of healthcare facilities is crucial for minimizing the number of pneumonia cases in Rokan Hilir District. The gradual procurement, construction, development, and maintenance of healthcare facilities can be prioritized in the medium-term regional development plan (RPJMD) of Rokan Hilir District to achieve the ideal ratio based on population size to enhance screening and diagnostic testing services for under-five pneumonia cases.</p><p>The absence of well-coordinated nationwide programs and guidelines has hindered the prioritization of pneumonia prevention, similar to the DOTS program for TB (Marley <italic>et al.</italic>, 2023; Dana <italic>et al.</italic>, 2024). Consequently, pneumonia has not received similar importance despite it being one of the top causes of illness and death among under-fives in Indonesia (Fortina <italic>et al.</italic>, 2023). Without clear countrywide instructions, efforts to treat pneumonia are generally fragmented, lack coordination, and depend on regional initiatives with varying levels of effectiveness. Hence, it is essential to establish an under-five pneumonia program that encompasses a structured framework, including uniform diagnosis, supervised therapy, and vigilant monitoring, all of which play crucial roles in the effectiveness of under-five pneumonia interventions. The study found no significant correlation between the decrease in the ratio of health professionals among under-five pneumonia cases. However, improving skills and competencies through continuous education and training of health workers for effective and efficient surveillance is recommended. The equitable distribution of health workers with adequate qualifications and competencies is crucial for diagnosing, treating, and providing education about pneumonia in under-fives, which can significantly reduce morbidity and mortality rates (Okafor <italic>et al.</italic>, 2023).</p><p>In this study, GIS was analyzed in combination with grading of risk factors to identify areas prone to under-five pneumonia. Susceptible regions were classified into three categories: high-risk (score &#x0003e;14), medium-risk (score 12&#x02013;14), and low-risk (score &#x0003c;12). This classification is based on natural break classification and Jenk optimization techniques. High-risk locations are characterized by high population density, high rainfall, high malnutrition, low health homes, exclusive breastfeeding, under-five service coverage, and several health facilities. Moderate population density, exclusive breastfeeding, healthy homes, availability of health services for children under five years of age, number of health facilities, erratic rainfall patterns, and malnutrition all have an impact on areas classified as moderate risk. Meanwhile, low-risk locations tend to have low population density, malnutrition, and rainfall; a moderate proportion of healthy homes; a high percentage of exclusive breastfeeding; under-five health service coverage; and several health facilities. A spatial study of the risk factors provides the main benefit of efficiently diagnosing and controlling the risk of pneumonia (Andrade <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004). By mapping the geographical distribution of pneumonia cases using an overlay of risk factors, the susceptibility of a region can be determined, allowing for more focused and efficient interventions based on priority areas. Priority regions for under-five pneumonia include the Pasir Limau Kapas, Simpang Kanan, Kubu, Bagan Sinembah Raya, and Sinaboi sub-districts. Therefore, it is necessary to reinforce interventions that target these regions through regional health planning, comprehensive response programs, and effective and efficient resource allocation.</p><p>The geographical distribution of high-risk locations surrounded by medium and low-risk areas deserves particular consideration in the under-five pneumonia response, because pneumonia is an airborne illness with rapid transmission. High-risk locations close to medium and low-risk areas have the potential to be sources of infection given population mobility and inter-regional contacts that might increase disease transmission. The spatial proximity of the local morphology may transfer pneumonia-causing organisms to new places, enhance the transmission of illness, and damage areas with lower incidence rates (Gothankar <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018). Therefore, a holistic and comprehensive intervention plan is required, including improvement of susceptible area-based factors. By concentrating emphasis on high-risk locations and their environs and incorporating an area-based strategy in health planning, pneumonia transmission may be repressed more effectively, lowering morbidity and death rates due to this illness. Spatial analysis helps evaluate the changes and efficacy of intervention programs over time, ensuring that resources are deployed effectively, and that reductions in under-five pneumonia cases may be accomplished sustainably (Mendes <italic>et al.</italic>, 2023). Thus, this area-based strategy not only enhances the public health response but also enables improved long-term planning in the under-five pneumonia response.</p><p>The implications of this study can serve as an input for the government to formulate an effective and comprehensive national strategy for tackling under-five pneumonia cases. The complexity of the under-five pneumonia risk factors outlined in this study demands multi-stakeholder collaboration, a strong political will, and adequate fiscal assistance to build a complete, systematic, and sustainable response scenario. Integrated response scenarios with detailed operational standards for under-five pneumonia cases are required to ensure that responses to risk factors are more systematic and effective. Prioritization of interventions against risk factors in vulnerable areas is necessary to achieve a national pneumonia eradication goal of less than 12 incidences per 1,000 children under five years of age in 2030.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This research revealed the variables linked to the growth and regional distribution of under-five pneumonia cases. The findings revealed that population density, rainfall, exclusive breastfeeding, malnutrition, under-five service coverage, healthy houses, and the number of health facilities are variables that impact the incidence of under-five pneumonia. The number of cases of under-five pneumonia has increased with population density, rainfall, malnutrition, and several health services. At the same time, increasing percentages of exclusive breastfeeding, healthy housing, and under-five healthcare coverage may lower under-five pneumonia cases. The geographical distribution of high-risk locations for under-five pneumonia is defined by high population density, rainfall, and malnutrition levels as well as low percentages of healthy homes, exclusive breastfeeding, under-five health service coverage, and several health facilities. Recommended intervention strategies include increasing preventive and promotional health counseling, coverage of health services and facilities, housing that meets health standards, dedensification efforts through local transmigration, and spatial planning with adequate infrastructure, especially in high-risk areas. This was performed to prevent the disease from spreading to medium and low-risk zones. Preventing under-five pneumonia requires a comprehensive and integrated strategy that encompasses addressing the demographic, social, economic, health infrastructure, and environmental circumstances. Vulnerable area-based program interventions, integrated national policies, and precise operational guidelines are necessary to meet the national pneumonia incidence reduction objective of &#x0003c;12 incidents per 1,000 children under-five by 2030.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We express our gratitude to the Central Bureau of Statistics and the Rokan Hilir District Health Office for providing us with data and information.
