Carotid atherosclerosis is a degenerative disease that can cause ischemia when plaques rupture (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>), inducing severe neurological deficits. Calcification is universally present in atherosclerotic plaques; however, the underlying mechanism is not entirely understood. They often appear during atherosclerotic disease progression, where apoptotic cells, the extracellular matrix, and necrotic core substances become sources of calcium microcrystals. They can progress and fuse to form more extensive calcified deposits (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). However, research on the calcification inside plaques remains controversial. Calcified plaques are structural markers of plaque stability and protective factors against ipsilateral ischemic stroke, and are negatively associated with cerebrovascular diseases. However, recent studies have indicated that different calcification characteristics affect the plaque stability (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Most studies have focused on a single characteristic of carotid plaque calcification. The classification method used in this study encompasses the size, location, and shape of the plaque calcification. Hence, six types of calcifications have been proposed by Saba et al. (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>): type 1, no calcification inside the plaque; type 2, intima or superficial calcification; type 3, deep or large calcification; type 4, adventitial calcification with internal soft plaque thickness &#x0003c; 2 mm; type 5, mixed type with intima and significant calcification; and type 6, positive rim sign. The prevalence of cerebrovascular events was highest in patients with type 6 calcification.</p><p>The current study selected calcifications, elements which are easily observable in CT, to explore the correlation between each type of carotid plaque calcification and ipsilateral acute ischemic anterior circulation stroke according to the six calcifications types. This could provide a better radiological basis for evaluating carotid plaque vulnerability and early patient treatment.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>2 Materials and methods</title><sec><title>2.1 Study type</title><p>This is a single-center retrospective study.</p></sec><sec><title>2.2.

Non-intracranial atherosclerotic diseases, including aneurysms, vasculitis, Moyamoya disease, intracranial arterial dissection, reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome, and vertebrobasilar dolichoectasia. Patients with suspected cardiogenic thrombus depicted by cardiac Doppler ultrasound or cardiac CTA, validated coagulation dysfunction, heart failure or respiratory failure, and renal dysfunction (serum creatinine &#x0003e; 133 &#x003bc;mol/L) were excluded. Furthermore, patients with severe disturbance of consciousness Intracranial hemorrhage, a history of cranial surgery, carotid stent placement, or carotid endarterectomy were excluded. Patients with a history of brain infarction having a diameter &#x0003e;1.5 cm (no hyperintensity in DWI) observed on MR were also excluded. The brain infarction could be seen in the posterior circulation supply area.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>2.3 Examination plan and image analysis technology</title><sec><title>2.3.1 Scanning technology</title><sec><title>2.3.1.1. Equipment and reagents</title><p>A SIEMENS SOMATOM Definition Flash dual-source CT scanner was utilized, and the scanning parameters were set as follows: current, 125 mA; voltage, 100 kV; collimation, 16 &#x000d7; 0.6 mm, and slice thickness 0.75 mm. A venous catheter, double-pole release injector, and an iodixanol contrast medium (320 mg I/ml, Jiangsu Hengrui Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., China) were used. A 320 mgI/ml contrast agent (iodoxanol, a non-ionic contrast agent with iodine) was administered using an 18-G catheter inserted within the antecubital vein at 3&#x02013;5 ml/s, and 30 ml of physiological saline was injected at the same rate after injecting the contrast agent. The total amount and flow rate of the contrast agent were individualized according to the patient's weight and scanning range.</p></sec><sec><title>2.3.1.2 CTA scanning protocol</title><p>None of the patients who underwent carotid CTA had a history of heart failure or contraindications for iodinated contrast agents. The patients were placed in the supine position, and CT coverage ranged between the aortic arch and carotid siphon. Patients were scanned from their feet to their heads. The images were tested before and after contrast agent injection. Scanning was performed from the lower edge of the aortic arch to the top of the skull. The scanning time was 8&#x02013;12 s. Contrast agent tracing was applied to determine the CT value within the aortic arch or carotid level of interest. When the CT value was more than 100 HU, the scan was automatically triggered after a 4 s delay. After reaching the threshold, the patients were instructed to hold their breath and start scanning after a 4 s interval. Experienced radiologists conducted all imaging examinations. The patients were instructed not to swallow or move their head or body while scanning to obtain the desired vascular images using three-dimensional reconstruction technology.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>2.3.2 Image analysis technology</title><sec><title>2.3.2.1 Image analysis</title><p>Image analysis was performed on the improved phase of CTA examination inside the GPACS system (WW = 800, WL = 240).</p></sec><sec><title>2.3.2.2 Carotid plaque calcification analysis</title><p>Two radiologists who had over 5 years of experience with head and neck imaging reviewed each image.

We grouped common calcified carotid plaques in clinical practice using CTA technology and developed a new classification method for calcified carotid plaques. We explored their associations with the occurrence of acute ipsilateral anterior circulation stroke. Type 6 calcified plaques are associated with acute ipsilateral anterior circulation strokes. This could help patients receive active and effective treatments before acute stroke.</p><p>Two radiologists who had been diagnosing head and neck images for more than 5 years reviewed the images in our study. Type 2 calcifications are easily distinguishable. In contrast, types 3 and 5 calcifications are difficult to distinguish. According to Kappa consistency testing, there was good inter-observer consistency (&#x003ba; = 0.92).</p><p>First, the morphology of calcified plaques at the carotid bifurcation was examined, and the correlation between plaque calcification type and ipsilateral anterior circulation acute stroke was analyzed (considering 1,178 carotid arteries). Type 6 calcified plaques, that is, edge-sign-positive plaques, had the highest risk of ipsilateral anterior circulation acute stroke. Thirty-five of the 71 patients experienced acute ipsilateral anterior circulation stroke. This was confirmed by Spearman correlation analysis, which indicated a statistically significant correlation between the calcified plaque type and acute stroke. In the paired sample chi-square analysis, the carotid plaque calcification types on the side with acute stroke were often higher than those on the side without acute stroke. It was not difficult to identify the acute stroke proportion in type 6 calcified plaques, which was the most common type, by combining the overall proportion of each calcification type. The acute stroke prevalence in type 6 plaques in our study was much lower than the symptoms of type 6 calcified plaques observed by Saba et al. (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). This is because we introduced the definition of acute stroke. Based on the high signal intensity observed on DWI, false-positive patients were excluded. Simultaneously, patients with a history of larger infarctions were excluded, which reduced the incidence of false-negatives in the control group. In a retrospective cohort study, adventitial calcification with positive internal soft plaque edge signs was observed on CTA. This could predict intraplaque hemorrhage inside the carotid plaques (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Kashiwazaki et al. observed that thin calcifications were associated with intraplaque hemorrhage, demonstrating a different clinical significance from that of thick calcifications (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), consistent with our research findings.</p><p>Gupta et al. observed that every increase of 1 mm can enhance the risk of stroke or transient ischemic attack by 2.7 times for soft plaques (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Similar findings were made in our type 4 and type 6. Xu et al. reported intraplaque hemorrhage and lipid-rich necrotic cores combined with small punctate calcifications (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Nandalur et al. discovered that the proportion of carotid plaque calcification, not the absolute volume, was associated with plaque stability. Specifically, the plaque may demonstrate better stability in some patients when calcification in carotid plaques accounts for more than 45% of the total plaque volume (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). However, similar results were not observed for type 1, 2, and 3. This is because calcification mechanisms and acute stroke are complex (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) and require further investigation. Type 5 refers to mixed type with intima and significant calcification and its complex mechanism needs to be further studied.</p><p>Secondly, our study identified that some baseline data between the acute and non-acute infarction groups showed significant statistical differences, which is consistent with previous studies. Sex, smoking, alcohol consumption, hypertension, hyperglycemia, and hyperlipidemia are the risk factors for ischemic stroke (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Moreover, the consistency of systematic evaluations in observational studies (cohort and case-control studies) indicated a strong, positive, and dose-dependent correlation between serum total homocysteine concentration and stroke risk (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Therefore, daily blood pressure, blood sugar, and blood lipid management while actively quitting smoking and alcohol consumption can help prevent the occurrence of stroke. However, patients depend on medications for disease management (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>).</p><p>Similarly, we tried to exclude acute stroke caused by cardiac embolism or intracranial atherosclerotic plaques because baseline data inclusion and exclusion were performed by two experienced clinical doctors. However, patients with scattered lacunar infarctions identified by MR were not excluded. Because lacunar cerebral infarction has always been caused by cerebral small vessel disease (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>), a common cause of cerebral small vessel disease is small artery sclerosis, which is a cerebral microvascular disease (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>).</p><p>Our study had certain limitations. First, we could not avoid selection bias in the retrospective studies. Secondly, more complex plaques are difficult to describe using a single calcification type. Hence, typing carotid plaque calcifications is challenging.</p><p>This calcified plaque typing model must be validated using prospective and longitudinal cohort studies to establish its clinical reference value. The results of this study are clinically significant. A causal correlation between plaque calcification and acute stroke has not yet been established, although calcification is an accompanying phenomenon in atherosclerosis. However, the study results have established that the morphology of plaque calcification is associated with the occurrence of acute ischemic stroke.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Thanks to all the staff of the Department of Radiology of The First People's Hospital of Lianyungang for their help and support.</p></ack><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s5"><title>Data availability statement</title><p>The raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will be made available by the authors, without undue reservation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="ethics-statement" id="s6"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>The studies involving humans were approved by the Lianyungang First People's Hospital Medical Ethics Committee (Approval number: KY-20220726002-01).
