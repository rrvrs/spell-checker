Insulin-like growth factor 2 binding protein 2 (IGF2BP2) has been identified as an oncogenic factor in LC, whereas its specific role in DDP resistance in LC remains unclear.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par2">In this study, we investigated the role of IGF2BP2 on DDP resistance in DDP-resistant A549 cells (A549/DDP) in vitro and in a DDP-resistant lung tumor-bearing mouse model in vivo. Additionally, methylated RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeRIP-seq) was conducted to identify the potential mRNAs regulated by IGF2BP2, an N6-methyladenosine (m6A) regulator, in the tumor tissues of mice. Compared to normal tissues, IGF2BP2 levels were increased in LC tissues and in relapsed/resistant LC tissues. Most importantly, IGF2BP2 levels were significantly higher in relapsed/resistant LC tissues than in LC tissues. Significantly, knockdown of IGF2BP2 or DDP treatment inhibited A549 cell viability, migration, and cell cycle progression. Consistently, DDP treatment suppressed the viability and migration and triggered cell cycle arrest in A549/DDP cells in vitro, as well as reduced tumor volume and weight of A549/DDP tumor-bearing mice; meanwhile, the combination of DDP and IGF2BP2 siRNA further significantly inhibited A549/DDP cell growth in vitro and in vivo compared to DDP treatment alone. Furthermore, MeRIP-seq data showed that IGF2BP2 downregulation remarkably elevated m6A levels of spondin 2 (Spon2) and reduced mRNA levels of Spon2 in tumor tissues from A549 tumor-bearing mice. Meanwhile, the combination of DDP and IGF2BP2 siRNA notably reduced Spon2 levels, as well as inhibited the viability and induced apoptosis in A549/DDP cells; however, these effects were reversed by Spon2 overexpression.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par3">Collectively, downregulation of IGF2BP2 could overcome DDP resistance in LC through declining the Spon2 gene expression in an m6A-dependent manner. These results may provide a new strategy for overcoming DDP resistance in LC.</p></sec><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s41065-024-00360-w.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Lung cancer</kwd><kwd>N6-methyladosine RNA methylation</kwd><kwd>Cisplatin</kwd><kwd>Resistance</kwd><kwd>IGF2BP2</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></funding-source><award-id>82074144</award-id><award-id>81860534</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Natural Science Foundation of Inner Mongolia</institution></funding-source><award-id>2021MS08152</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region science and technology planning project</institution></funding-source><award-id>201802152, 2019GG039, 2019GG086, 2021GG0167</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Scientific and Technological Innovative Research Team for Inner Mongolia Medical University of Transformation application of organoid in medical and industrial interdiscipline</institution></funding-source><award-id>YKD2022TD002</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Major Project of Inner Mongolia Medical University</institution></funding-source><award-id>YKD2022ZD002</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Radiotherapy discipline construction project of National Cancer Regional Medical Center for for Inner Mongolia Medical University</institution></funding-source><award-id>YKD2022XK009</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Radiobiology system and team construction of radiotherapy for Inner Mongolia Medical University</institution></funding-source><award-id>YKD2022XK014</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>The Zhi Yuan Talent Projects of Inner Mongolia Medical University</institution></funding-source><award-id>ZY0202011, ZY0130014</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Mendelian Society of Lund and BioMed Central Ltd. 2024</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par4">Lung cancer (LC) is the most common malignancy and the primary cause of cancer-related mortality globally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. LC is categorized into two main categories: small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. SCLC accounts for approximately 13&#x02013;15% of all LC cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], whereas NSCLC onstitutes about 85% of cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. LC is characterized by a poor prognosis and a propensity to metastasize to distant sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The five-year survival rate for patients with LC is only about 10% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Although advanced therapeutic options such as radiation therapy, immunotherapy and targeted therapy are available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], chemotherapy is indispensable for LC treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par5">Cisplatin (DDP) has been approved as an anti-tumor drug for the treatment of LC for nearly half a century [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. DDP binds to nuclear DNA, inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, thus exhibiting its anti-tumor properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Nevertheless, the development of acquired drug resistance has significantly limited the effectiveness of DDP in clinical cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Recently, various strategies have been proposed to overcome DDP resistance in LC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. For instance, the combination of metformin with DDP has been shown to exert enhanced anti-tumor effects in cancer cells compared to DDP treatment alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Moreover, aspirin, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, has been reported to increase the sensitivity of lung cancer cells to DDP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Furthermore, propofol, an anesthetic, has demonstrated the ability overcome DDP resistance in LC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Despite these advancements, the outcomes for LC patients remain unsatisfactory, highlighting the need for further countermeasures.</p><p id="Par6">Epigenetic dysregulation, including RNA modification, plays a crucial role in tumor resistance to anti-cancer therapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. <italic>N</italic><sup>6</sup>-methyladenosine (m6A) is a specific type of internal mRNA modification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. This modification can modulate the translocation, degradation, stability and translation of mRNA, thereby impacting gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The modification of m6A is regulated by demethylases (erasers), methyltransferases (writers), and RNA reader proteins (readers) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Insulin-like growth factor 2 binding protein 2 (IGF2BP2) functions as a specific m6A &#x0201c;reader&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], and has been implicated in LC progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Studies have shown that IGF2BP2 can promote the growth of NSCLC cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], and is associated with drug resistance in various human cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. For instance, Han et al. found that forced expression of IGF2BP2 could enhance chemoresistance in glioma cells via stabilizing the long non-coding RNA DANCR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Additionally, IGF2BP2 overexpression has been shown to increase resistance to DDP in cervical cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. However, it remains unclear whether IGF2BP2 influences DDP resistance in LC cells. Therefore, we investigated the role of IGF2BP2 in DDP resistance in LC.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Cell culture and transfection</title><p id="Par7">Human SCLC cell lines H446 (No. CL-0401, Procell), SBC-2 (a kind gift from Tianjin International Joint Academy of Biomedicine), and NSCLC cell lines HCC827 (No. CL-0094, Procell), A549 (No. CL-0016, Procell), H322 (No. 95111734, European Collection of Authenticated Cell Cultures), NCI-H3255 (No. IM-H122, IMMOCELL) and DDP-resistant A549 cells (A549/DDP, No. CL-0519, Procell), human bronchial epithelial cell line (BEAS-2B, No. GDC0139, China Center for Type Culture Collection) were cultured in Dulbecco&#x02019;s modified Eagle medium/Nutrient Mixture F-12 (DMEM/F-12, C11330500BT, Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, No. 10270-106, Gibco) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and incubated in an incubator at 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par44">Drug resistance has long posed a significant challenge in LC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Resistance to chemotherapy, and subsequent relapse are the main reasons leading to poor survival rates in LC patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Treatment failure and tumor relapse are common after DDP treatment in a substantial proportion of DDP-based treatment patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Consequently, it is essential to find effective strategies to overcome acquired resistance to DDP in LC patients. Our results revealed that deficiency of IGF2BP2 could overcome DDP resistance in LC in vitro and in vivo.</p><p id="Par45">Compared to the A549 group, m6A RNA modification levels were obviously elevated in the A549/DDP group, suggesting that m6A methylation is associated with DDP resistance in LC. Numerous studies have confirmed that m6A methylation exerts important roles in modulating cancer progression and drug resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. M6A methyltransferase METTL3 has been reported to contribute to oxaliplatin resistance by stabilizing PARP1 mRNA in CD133&#x02009;+&#x02009;gastric cancer stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Meanwhile, METTL3 could increase AKT levels in NSCLC cells, thereby reducing sensitivity to DDP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. ALKBH5, an m6A demethylase, is highly expressed in DDP-resistant epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) cells; and forced expression of ALKBH5 could confer resistance to DDP in EOC cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. YTHDF1, an m6A reader protein, is over-expressed in gastrointestinal cancers, and elevated levels of YTHDF1 have been associated with chemoresistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Furthermore, IGF2BP2, another m6A reader protein, has been shown to enhance chemoresistance in glioma cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. However, no studies have reported the role of IGF2BP2 in DDP-resistant LC. In the present study, we observed high levels of IGF2BP2 in relapsed/resistant LC tissues from patients compared to LC tissues obtained from non-resistant patients. These results revealed a potential role for IGF2BP2 in facilitating DDP resistance in LC.</p><p id="Par46">The IGF2BP family consists of three members including IGF2BP1, IGF2BP2, and IGF2BP3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], all of which are implicated in the drug resistance of human cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. IGF2BP1 knockdown has been shown to reduce resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs (e.g. 5-fluorouracil, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin) in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. IGF2BP2 could facilitate DDP resistance in CRC via enhancing the stabilization of long non-coding RNA taurine up-regulated gene 1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Additionally, IGF2BP3-mediated m6A modification could promote the stabilization of TMA7 mRNA, thereby contributing to cancer progression and DDP resistance in laryngeal cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. In the present research, we found that reduced expression of IGF2BP2 could further enhance the anti-proliferative, anti-migratory, and pro-apoptotic effects of DDP on A549/DDP cells. Thus suggests that IGF2BP2 downregulation could effectively overcome DDP resistance in DDP-resistant LC cells.</p><p id="Par47">DDP can crosslink DNA and inhibit DNA synthesis, ultimately leading to cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. However, chemoresistance often inevitably appears during DDP treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. In the present study, we found that DDP induced cytotoxicity, cell apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in A549/DDP cells, with these effects greatly augmented by IGF2BP2 knockdown. These findings demonstrated that IGF2BP2 knockdown could overcome DDP resistance in DDP-resistant LC cells by triggering cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.</p><p id="Par48">M6A RNA methylation has been implicated in the progression of several cancers, including LC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Mechanistically, m6A methylation plays a crucial role in modulating gene expression at the post-transcriptional level by influencing mRNA stability, splicing, and translation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. As an m6A &#x0201c;reader&#x0201d;, IGF2BP2 has been shown to enhance the stability of SLC7A11 mRNA through m6A modification, thereby conferring ferroptosis resistance to hepatoblastomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. Our results showed that compared to the Lv-si-NC group, downregulation of IGF2BP2 remarkably elevated the m6A levels of Spon2, but reduced the mRNA levels of Spon2 in tumor tissues of mice, suggesting that downregulation of IGF2BP2 could reduce Spon2 levels in tumor tissues via the modulation of m6A methylation. Some studies have shown that the presence of m6A modification can result in mRNA degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. Li et al. found that IGF2BP2 can enhance the stability of SOX2 transcripts, thereby preventing their degradation via an m6A-IGF2BP2-dependent mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Our results indicated an increased m6A level of Spon2 in the Lv-si-IGF2BP2 group. Thus, we hypothesize that IGF2BP2 downregulation results in elevated m6A levels of Spon2, which subsequently causes mRNA degradation and ultimately leads to reduced mRNA levels of Spon2; however, the exact mechanism of this process warrants further investigation. Both Spon2 and IGF2BP2 have been implicated in the progression and metastasis of human cancers, including LC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. Thus, we speculated that downregulation of IGF2BP2 may inhibit LC progression through downregulating Spon2 in an m6A-dependent manner. Notably, our study is the first to show the relationship between the Spon2 and IGF2BP2 in LC.</p><p id="Par49">Furthermore, our results demonstrated that IGF2BP2 deficiency could reduce Spon2 expression levels in the A549/DDP&#x02009;+&#x02009;DDP group. Moreover, IGF2BP2 deficiency enhanced the pro-apoptotic effects of DDP in A549/DDP cells, whereas these changes were reversed by Spon2 overexpression, suggesting that the knockdown of IGF2BP2 could potentially overcome DDP resistance in A549/DDP cells through the downregulation of Spon2. Collectively, our data showed that the knockdown of IGF2BP2 could prevent DDP resistance in LC by downregulating Spon2 in an m6A-dependent manner. However, this study focused exclusively on the impact of IGF2BP2 siRNA on A549 and A549/DDP cells. Further research is needed to validate the role of IGF2BP2 siRNA in DDP resistance across other LC cell lines and DDP-resistant LC cells in future studies. Furthermore, a therapeutic strategy that combines an IGF2BP2 inhibitor with DDP warrants exploration in subsequent trials, which may provide further insights into the application of IGF2BP2 in LC.</p><p id="Par50">Huang et al. demonstrated that Spon2 overexpression could facilitate colorectal cancer progression through enhancing the infiltration of M2 macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. Research has indicated that M2-like tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) play important roles in tumor progression and acquired drug resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. M2-like TAMs can contribute to chemotherapy resistance by secreting cytokines or activating anti-apoptotic pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. Thus, we hypothesize that the IGF2BP2-Spon2 axis may influence DDP resistance in LC by promoting M2 macrophage polarization; however, this hypothesis requires further investigation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par51">Together, downregulation of IGF2BP2 could inhibit DDP resistance in LC through downregulating Spon2 gene expression in an m6A-dependent manner.
