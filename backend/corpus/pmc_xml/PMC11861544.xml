The incidence of falls increases with age, and preventing and managing falls has become a challenge for society. According to the World Health Organization, the percentage of older adults who have experienced at least one fall in a year is 30% (<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Falls in older adults can lead to fractures, joint dislocations and disability, which can lead to increased dependency and decreased quality of life and even death (<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Early identification of fall-related risks in older adults and intervention is crucial for caregivers. In 2013, the International Association of Gerontology first proposed the new concept of Cognitive Frailty (CF), which refers to the combination of frailty and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in the exclusion of neurodegenerative disorders such as dementia (<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). A Meta-analysis showed that frailty was significantly associated with a high risk of falls occurring (<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Another Meta-analysis of 27 studies found that community-dwelling older adults with MCI had more than twice the risk of fall occurrence than cognitively normal older adults (<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). The introduction of the concept of cognitive frailty combines the two, emphasizing the co-occurrence of frailty and MCI, which, at a theoretical level, would significantly increase the occurrence of falls in older adults. A Meta-analysis showed that CF not only increases the risk of dementia, but also increases the risk of adverse outcomes such as death (<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). However, in various current studies, the findings are not entirely consistent (<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).</p><p>In current clinical care, falls assessment has become a routine item in the admission assessment. The Morse Falls Risk Assessment Scale is the most commonly used in clinical practice and is currently considered the best predictive tool. The scale has six entries, but four of the scale&#x02019;s entries focus on frailty aspects of the older adult&#x02019;s characteristics, less on cognitive aspects, and only one question in the last entry asks about good mental status. In addition, assessments of cognition are rare in current admission routine nursing assessments. As mentioned earlier, the impact of MCI on falls has become prominent and there is a need to strengthen the assessment of cognition in the nursing assessment of older adults on admission. Therefore, this study will systematically evaluate the relationship between CF and the risk of fall occurrence in older adults with the aim of determining whether CF is an independent risk factor for falls, thereby drawing attention to the cognitive aspect of clinical care. The assessment of CF may provide intervenable targets for clinical caregivers to reduce the risk of fall occurrence in older adults.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec8"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec9"><title>Design</title><p>A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) statements.</p></sec><sec id="sec10"><title>Search strategy</title><p>The system searched Cochrane Library, PubMed, Embase, Medline, CINAHL, Scopus, Proquest Central, Web of Science, SinoMed, CNKI, VIP and Wan fang Databases.

analysis and publication bias</title><p>Sensitivity analyses were performed after excluding each of the five prospective cohort studies whose outcome indicator was the occurrence of falls, and the results showed no significant change in the amount of the combined effect, indicating that the results of the Meta-analysis of this study were essentially stable. Publication bias was not analyzed because the number of included studies was small and did not meet the minimum number of documents for making a funnel plot.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec22"><title>Discussion</title><p>A total of 5 prospective cohort studies were finally included in this study, and the scores of the included literature were rated from 7 to 9 after standardized evaluation, of which, 2 studies (<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>) scored 8&#x02013;9, suggesting that the overall quality of the included literature was high. The included studies all used the more commonly used current CF and falls assessment tools, and each study controlled for the influence of confounding factors on the results, and the results also showed that the results of this study were relatively stable after the exclusion of each study. Based on this, the results of the Meta-analysis of this study have high reliability. However, because all of the fall assessments in this study were single-entry inquiries about falls and relied on patient self-reporting, there was some recall bias and the effect of the remaining confounders, and the results of this study need to be viewed with caution.</p><p>A cross-sectional study (<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>) showed that CF was associated with falls in community-dwelling Japanese older adults. However, Brigola et al. (<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) did not find an association between CF and falls after a 4-year follow-up of 405 older adults. The results of this study showed that patients in the CF group had a 1.38-fold increased risk of falls compared with patients in the non-CF group, suggesting that CF is a risk factor for the occurrence of falls in older adults.</p><p>The mechanisms underlying the association between CF and falls in older adults are complex: slow gait speed, a key feature of frailty, is associated with cognitive deficits in processing speed, attention, and executive function (<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), and cognitive deficits and resulting declines in cognitive reserve may make it difficult to ameliorate frailty (<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>); another study (<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) found that both frailty and MCI are associated with higher levels of inflammatory markers, and that CF significantly elevated inflammatory markers in older adults may trigger the onset of falls by accelerating muscle loss and impairing muscle tissue regeneration; and research (<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) suggests that older adults with CF often experience reduced nutrients or visual impairment, and are less responsive when presented with a new environment, making them susceptible to falls. These results suggest that geriatric syndromes such as frailty and MCI may represent common pathways that modulate the association between individual risk factors and falls, presenting a synergistic effect on falls. Therefore, when older adults have these two geriatric syndromes, they are more susceptible to falls, early screening for CF may help to prevent falls, and the assessment and management of CF should be emphasized among clinical caregivers.</p><p>Subgroup analyses in this study showed that older adults assessed as having CF using the Fried Frailty Phenotype Scale and the MMSE Scale assessment tools were at higher risk for falls; that community-dwelling older adults with CF had a significantly increased risk for falls compared to those in hospital settings; and that neither the size of the sample from different regions nor the size of the sample from different studies affected the relevance of the increased risk for falls in older adults with CF.</p><p>The Fried Frailty Phenotype Scale was proposed by Fried et al. (<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) in 2001 based on the theory of the cycle of frailty, including five assessment indicators such as unconscious weight loss, and the Asia-Pacific Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Management of Frailty in the Older stated that the use of this scale is effective in predicting the risk of falls in older adults, and it is one of the internationally recognized tools for the assessment of frailty. The MMSE Scale was developed by Folstein et al. (<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) in 1975, and several studies have used this combined scale for CF assessment. Kim et al. (<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) screened 1,248 community-dwelling older adults using this combined scale and found a correlation between CF and falls. The results of the subgroup analysis in this study found that community-dwelling older adults with CF had a significantly increased risk of falls compared to those in the hospital setting, possibly due to the higher prevalence of CF among older adults in the community (<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), which, combined with the greater range of motion of older adults in the community setting, puts them at increased risk of falls.</p><p>The present study has different findings from previous studies after subgroup analysis of the source of the study population. The results of this study showed a nonsignificant relationship of increased risk of fall occurrence in older adults with CF in the hospital setting, which we consider to be a meaningful finding due to the paucity of current research on this outcome. It is hypothesized that the possible reasons for this are that in the hospital setting, clinical staff are more timely in assessing and teaching falls; secondly, falls are recognized as a major event affecting the safety of older adults admitted to the hospital, and nurses, as the main promoters of patient safety, will enhance care for falls; finally, older adults admitted to the hospital are usually in relatively serious condition, and they may have a limited ability to get out of bed, which may also reduce the incidence of falls to some extent. In other words, this also proves that CF is very significantly related to the occurrence of falls, and that CF is a strong predictor of falls, and timely intervention can reduce the incidence of fall events. Both Zhang (<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) and Ge (<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>) et al. demonstrated that elderly patients with CF are at a higher risk of falling compared to those healthy hospitalized elderly patients, which suggests that screening for CF is important for the prevention of falls in hospitalized elderly patients. Therefore, the assessment of CF and management of falls in both community and hospitalized older adults should be strengthened.</p><sec id="sec23"><title>Implications of this study for clinical practice and future research</title><p>Based on the results of this study, CF in older adults significantly increases the risk of falls, and CF in older adults increases the risk of falls using different CF assessment tools, different sources of study participants (other than hospitals), different regions, and different sample sizes. This implies that clinical caregivers need to assess CF and implement appropriate interventions to enhance early warning awareness, prevention, and management when older adults are admitted to the hospital. There are fewer and limited quality studies related to CF interventions, and one study found that physical activity moderated the relationship between CF and falls (<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), and activity participation can be considered as an effective way to improve CF. In addition, studies have shown that intervention programs including exercise training, nutrition programs, and memory training can reverse debilitation and cognitive impairment (<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Therefore, appropriate exercise training and nutritional interventions need to be considered in conjunction with inpatient fall-related education at discharge to reduce the incidence of falls.</p></sec><sec id="sec24"><title>Limitations of this study</title><p>Only Chinese and English literature was included in this study, which may have language bias; fewer studies were included and the sample size for subgroup analysis was smaller; different CF assessment tools were used in the included studies and there was a certain recall bias in the assessment of falls, which had an impact on the results.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec25"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The present study is based on a Meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies, and the results show that CF in older adults is an independent risk factor for the occurrence of falls. This suggests that nursing assessment of cognitive aspects should be strengthened at the time of hospital admission in older adults, and attention should be paid to the cumulative risk of cognitive emergence in debilitating situations, thus reducing the incidence of falls and improving the quality of care.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="sec26"><title>Data availability statement</title><p>Publicly available datasets were analyzed in this study.
