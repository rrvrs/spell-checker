For the past 30&#x000a0;years, leisure has been identified in the literature as important and health-promoting in mental health settings (<xref rid="bibr7-15691861251328585" ref-type="bibr">Chen &#x00026; Chippendale, 2018</xref>). It is acknowledged the link between leisure and mental health is an emerging field, which is no less than any other areas in mental health. The <xref rid="bibr29-15691861251328585" ref-type="bibr">World Health Organization (2021)</xref> suggests leisure activity and recreation are integral to inpatient care. Similarly, the National Mental Health Standards (Australia) (<xref rid="bibr1-15691861251328585" ref-type="bibr">Australian Government, 2010</xref>) indicate leisure and recreational opportunities should be available for all consumers.</p><p>In occupational therapy, leisure is a powerful therapeutic modality with efficacy in mental health inpatient settings (<xref rid="bibr10-15691861251328585" ref-type="bibr">Cutler et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="bibr18-15691861251328585" ref-type="bibr">Lloyd &#x00026; Lee Williams, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bibr19-15691861251328585" ref-type="bibr">Marshall et al., 2020</xref>). The core scope of practice of an occupational therapist is to utilise meaningful occupation to improve occupational performance and participation. The key to leisure being used effectively as a treatment modality is targeting activity that is meaningful to the individual, which focuses on the individual interests, volition, and values, drawing from the Model of Human Occupation (MOHO) (<xref rid="bibr24-15691861251328585" ref-type="bibr">Taylor, 2017</xref>). Engagement in meaningful activity can assist in reducing incidences of aggression, seclusion, and restraint (<xref rid="bibr25-15691861251328585" ref-type="bibr">Todman, 2003</xref>).</p><p>The issue of a lack of leisure activity in mental health inpatient units (MHIUs) MHIUs has been discussed in the literature for more than 20&#x000a0;years and there are limited clinical guidelines or references to the application in clinical settings (<xref rid="bibr11-15691861251328585" ref-type="bibr">Foye et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bibr22-15691861251328585" ref-type="bibr">Morrison et al., 1996</xref>). A focus in MHIUs is to reduce seclusion and restraint with &#x02018;least restrictive practices&#x02019;, but a key factor to consumers reporting boredom is they remain unoccupied with the dearth of activity offered (<xref rid="bibr19-15691861251328585" ref-type="bibr">Marshall et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bibr28-15691861251328585" ref-type="bibr">Wilson et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p><xref rid="bibr14-15691861251328585" ref-type="bibr">Levick et al. (2022)</xref> established that staff and consumers would benefit from more occupational opportunities, social connections, and a sense of community in locked settings. With consideration of the MOHO, the built and social environment are key barriers to engagement in meaningful occupation in a mental health setting. Currently, there is limited evidence-informed principles that can guide service delivery to offer meaningful occupation and intervention that facilitate participation and recovery.</p><p>A list of 10 practice principles called Levick&#x02019;s Leisure Practice Principles were created in response to a theoretical gap indicating limited occupation-focused guidelines for inpatient mental health settings. There are several clinical guidelines set around the world exploring optimal care of mental health consumers, but limited exploring patient-centred therapeutic engagement that promotes recovery. The practice principles provided a number of valid arguments that leisure is salutogenic and beneficial for people&#x02019;s mental health. A lack of leisure activity continues to be an ongoing problem, fostering boredom and in turn creating occupational deprivation for those with prolonged admissions. There is an increase in the emphasis and importance of leisure time in acute mental health settings, which is considered health creating and health-promoting. Therefore, MHIUs should consider broadening their leisure programs to daily activity and expanding resources available as the bare minimum to improve the consumer experience.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-15691861251328585"><title>Development</title><p>The Levick&#x02019;s Leisure Practice Principles were developed through PhD research exploring the therapeutic benefits of leisure in mental health inpatient units (<xref rid="bibr14-15691861251328585" ref-type="bibr">Levick et al., 2022</xref>). This body of research (<xref rid="bibr14-15691861251328585" ref-type="bibr">Levick et al., 2022</xref>) on Australian mental health inpatient units indicated the need for a focus on the development of practice principles, which is a list of key values and learnings to support the implementation of leisure activity in mental health inpatient units. This research adopted similar practices from <xref rid="bibr3-15691861251328585" ref-type="bibr">Brown et al.

A list of practice principles has been developed based on the findings of <xref rid="bibr14-15691861251328585" ref-type="bibr">Levick et al.

(2022)</xref> conducted a literature review and a series of mixed methods descriptive studies. This included content analysis of staff&#x02019;s perspectives of consumer engagement in leisure inpatient units; a mixed method survey (including three standardised tools MHSIP, CLIP, and the Leisure Boredom Scale) of consumers perspectives of what should be included for occupational opportunity in inpatient settings; a policy analysis of Australian mental health act legislation; and the development of a leisure tool called the Checklist of Leisure, Interest and Participation (CLIP) to assess leisure interests.</p><p>The concept of occupational enrichment and occupational deprivation were key theoretical foundations and considerations during development (<xref rid="bibr26-15691861251328585" ref-type="bibr">Whiteford et al., 2020</xref>). Occupational enrichment is considered the goal for optimal function if a person is experiencing occupational deprivation (<xref rid="bibr26-15691861251328585" ref-type="bibr">Whiteford et al., 2020</xref>). The practice principles will be based on the concept of occupational enrichment and be supported by the feedback from consumers (<xref rid="bibr13-15691861251328585" ref-type="bibr">Levick et al., 2023</xref>), stakeholders, and policy/legislation (<xref rid="bibr14-15691861251328585" ref-type="bibr">Levick et al., 2022</xref>). The concept of occupational enrichment (<xref rid="bibr26-15691861251328585" ref-type="bibr">Whiteford et al., 2020</xref>) is the intention and goal of the principles.</p><p>A review of the Australian National Mental Health Standards <xref rid="bibr1-15691861251328585" ref-type="bibr">Australian Government (2010)</xref> and recovery model principles (<xref rid="bibr9-15691861251328585" ref-type="bibr">Commonwealth of Australia, 2013</xref>) ensured the practice principles complemented mental health models/frameworks currently in place across acute settings which are applicable to an Australian Mental Health Context. The development of the practice principles aims to generate discussion amongst policymakers and change in governing policy and legislation.</p><p>The goal of compiling the practice principles was to generate recommendations that governing bodies could implement in MHIUs to create immediate change. Some key areas that MHIUs may focus on are the built environment, social connection (<xref rid="bibr27-15691861251328585" ref-type="bibr">Wilcock, 1995</xref>), policy and legislation, and promotion of occupational opportunity (<xref rid="bibr21-15691861251328585" ref-type="bibr">Molineux &#x00026; Whiteford, 1999</xref>).

The stakeholder group was formed to gain industry feedback on the utility in a clinical setting and receptiveness of implementing leisure evidence-based practice principles. The mental health clinicians who provided feedback consisted of seven nurses, one occupational therapist, two psychologists, and two psychiatrists (registrar and consultant). All stakeholders identified the practice principles as &#x0201c;crucial&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;necessary, and important&#x0201d;. The group was formed through consulting staff who currently work in locked or inpatient settings at the hospital health service the supporting PhD research was conducted. Participants were invited to participate and those who were willing and available attended the session. Stakeholders were asked to read the practice principles and provided a brief overview of the research surrounding development. They were then invited to provide any feedback on likelihood of use, implementation, and general perspective of utility.</p><p>A thematic analysis was conducted using <xref rid="bibr2-15691861251328585" ref-type="bibr">Braun and Clarke (2014)</xref> methods. Some of the key themes in the feedback included concerns with the shared responsibility of facilitating activity; support from a governance structure to implement activity and longevity of implementing the practice principles.</p><p>All of the nursing staff noted concern with the entire multidisciplinary team being responsible for providing leisure activity. Nurses report being overwhelmed with their current duties, raising concern they cannot do more with their time. All stakeholders suggested concern with support from their governance structure, in particular, funding resources or staff.</p><p>One staff member stated she did not like the inclusion of words such as &#x02018;should&#x02019; or &#x02018;must&#x02019;. This suggestion was discussed with other stakeholders who believed &#x02018;should&#x02019; is an important inclusion to provide urgency and a sense of need behind the principles.</p><p>Staff discussed concerns on the rollout and implementation of practice principles. Some suggested the need for people to &#x02018;take ownership&#x02019;. The psychiatrists identified the environment, positive risks, and consumer involvement in treatment goals as highly important.</p><sec id="sec4-15691861251328585"><title>Practice principles</title><p>Ten principles have been formed more broadly so mental health inpatient units can interpret, adapt, and implement meaningful leisure activities for their consumers.

Activities should closely represent the variety we would expect to see in the community (within reason) to promote volition, a sense of agency, and promote recovery. Participation in an activity of choice assists in developing healthy habits and routines in the community. <xref rid="bibr30-15691861251328585" ref-type="bibr">Wykes et al.

Risks can include perceived risk by staff and risk aversion from the organisation. Positive risk-taking suggests a small number of necessary risks improves the quality of life of consumers (<xref rid="bibr6-15691861251328585" ref-type="bibr">Carr et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bibr23-15691861251328585" ref-type="bibr">Robertson &#x00026; Collinson, 2011</xref>). Consumers can be enabled to engage in activities with small amounts of risk which promotes personal growth, autonomy, and opportunity for success (<xref rid="bibr23-15691861251328585" ref-type="bibr">Robertson &#x00026; Collinson, 2011</xref>). Risk is a part of everyday life and should be assessed, evaluated, and carefully considered as a normal part of operating a MHIU (<xref rid="bibr12-15691861251328585" ref-type="bibr">Just et al., 2021</xref>). In the attempt to reduce risks, occupational opportunities are often minimised leading to occupational deprivation. Strategies to reduce risk should thoughtfully be considered and evaluated however, a level of risk can be tolerated without causing serious harm (<xref rid="bibr12-15691861251328585" ref-type="bibr">Just et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p><xref rid="bibr12-15691861251328585" ref-type="bibr">Just et al. (2021)</xref> suggest organisations can support positive risk with training staff; supervision and reflective practice; a culture shift for new practice; review of policy and guidelines; review of workload demands and improve therapeutic relationships with consumers.</p></sec><sec id="sec8-15691861251328585"><title>Principle 4: Scheduled Leisure activities including individual and group programs should be offered every day</title><p>Consumers and staff both reported a lack of group activity offered which reduces the social opportunities (<xref rid="bibr14-15691861251328585" ref-type="bibr">Levick et al., 2022</xref>). <xref rid="bibr16-15691861251328585" ref-type="bibr">Lim et al. (2007)</xref> found there is limited group activity offered on MHIUs which can contribute to boredom and seldom activity. Furthermore, more than half of the consumers that participated in this study stated engagement in occupational therapy (individual or group programs) contributed to improved function in their daily life. There is varied evidence on the benefits of group-based activity in inpatient settings. However, <xref rid="bibr18-15691861251328585" ref-type="bibr">Lloyd and Lee Williams (2010)</xref> findings suggest individual and group activity is a core domain for mental health occupational therapists. Evaluation and reflection of a group&#x02019;s value is critical to providing effective treatment. Ultimately, consumers will gain a range of skills, social engagement, and meaningful engagement in any form of participation (<xref rid="bibr18-15691861251328585" ref-type="bibr">Lloyd &#x00026; Lee Williams, 2010</xref>).</p><p>The multidisciplinary team need to value the time, effort, and importance of engagement. To provide the opportunity for success in implementing a leisure program, a member or delegate from each discipline (psychiatry, nursing, occupational therapy, social work, and psychology) should champion and take lead to represent their discipline. A delegate from each discipline should be involved to plan the successful implementation of activity. A cultural shift needs to occur for this to be successful and support the quality of care for consumers (<xref rid="bibr18-15691861251328585" ref-type="bibr">Lloyd &#x00026; Lee Williams, 2010</xref>). Consumer engagement in therapies with all disciplines should be considered equally important. A suggestion is to schedule medical reviews and nursing-related tasks (such as blood work or observations) to provide consumers with the opportunity to engage without concern of missing out on leisure activities available. Clear appointment and routine times of engagement with the treating team may assist consumers to plan their day and reduce or frustration when waiting to be seen.</p></sec><sec id="sec9-15691861251328585"><title>Principle 5: Social engagement and meaningful conversation are invaluable for Leisure participation</title><p>Engagement in leisure activity is an important and adequate goal to have as part of treatment whilst being an inpatient. Staff should prioritise engagement with individual consumers as a necessary part of their role. Meaningful engagement and conversation were one of the main leisure activities identified by consumers (<xref rid="bibr13-15691861251328585" ref-type="bibr">Levick et al., 2023</xref>). Leisure and social engagement should be prioritised as much as documentation, medication management, and other duties for all staff.</p></sec><sec id="sec10-15691861251328585"><title>Principle 6: The governance structure should reflect these Leisure-related principles as necessary and important evidence-based care</title><p>To make a change, the governance structure needs to reinforce the importance of leisure and recreation. The governance structure may include local, state, and national macro levels of health. Local governance structures can make meaningful and immediate changes to their staff&#x02019;s role descriptions, strategic plans, incorporation of daily operations, and priorities to provide therapeutic modalities. <xref rid="bibr14-15691861251328585" ref-type="bibr">Levick et al. (2022)</xref> suggested there is limited leisure-related language found in Australian and international legislation, which could be a barrier to engagement.</p><p>A balance between a top-down and bottom-up approach needs to occur to make a cultural shift (<xref rid="bibr20-15691861251328585" ref-type="bibr">McDermott et al., 2015</xref>). A top-down approach would include the governance or directors of a mental health service filtering down changes to policy, procedures, and practice. This needs to occur to make meaningful change in mental health units and create influence over policymakers (<xref rid="bibr20-15691861251328585" ref-type="bibr">McDermott et al., 2015</xref>). Directors and leaders need to identify leisure engagement as an important factor in consumers&#x02019; recovery to facilitate a culture change from the bottom level. The governance structure can assist with ongoing momentum for the multidisciplinary team to reduce the risk of failure or programs ceasing due to lack of interest.

The original research the practice principles were based on focussed on MHIU&#x02019;s and did not explore the application of these principles in outpatient or day rehabilitation settings. The practice principles are based on occupational therapy theory and recovery-oriented principles. The practice principles provide a basis for evidence-based therapy and likely to be translatable to a number of practice settings. Further research of implementation of leisure programs and evaluation of the principles included in this paper in clinical settings such as MHIUs, day rehabilitation and outpatient settings which would assist to establish their usability and efficacy for practice.

Evaluation and implementation of the practice principles in clinical settings are required. The practice principles should be applied to an Australian adult mental health context for implementation and evaluation. Future research may include a case study of one or more inpatient units over a set period (e.g. two years) to explore contextual factors and ease of application with the practice principles. Some factors to be considered in future research may be an improvement of the application of leisure as a therapeutic modality (reviewing levels of engagement in proposed activity and an increase in meaningful occupation). It could be hypothesised that if there is an increase in leisure activity resulting in improved consumer engagement, there would be a reduced readmission rate and a reduction in serious aggression such as seclusion and restraint. The successful implementation of the practice principles will assist policymakers to determine the need for change to overarching legislation and policy that may be limiting meaningful engagement.

The consumers experiences can be improved through the implementation of leisure activity on MHIU. Ten leisure principles were developed based on the literature reviewed and the findings of research conducted throughout PhD research (<xref rid="bibr14-15691861251328585" ref-type="bibr">Levick et al., 2022</xref>). The principles provide health services an opportunity to review the service they currently provide to consumers and determine whether they are providing a therapeutic service. The practice principles target the built environment, social environment, resources, and funding that is available, review of documentation styles, risk management, and the need for scheduled activities.</p><p>Leisure engagement is considered salutogenic and meaningful. Consumers should be provided the opportunity to engage in leisure activity as they would in their home environment. Cognitive stimulation and supportive staff are conducive to positive recovery opportunities.</p><p>The application of this theory suggested more occupational opportunities may enhance consumers&#x02019; recovery from mental illness on MHIU. Support to develop ground-level changes such as routine, access to a safe environment, and engagement in meaningful occupation can promote a therapeutic environment. The practice principles have the potential to be applied to MHIUs across Australia or in similar countries. Further research to explore the implementation and evaluation of these principles in Australia and other countries will assist with implementation guidelines for best practice. An inpatient unit could be used as a case study of implementation and a longitudinal review of the changes made within the unit related to seclusion and re-admission rate. Occupational therapists should harness and champion the rollout of the practice principles in their respective units to enhance occupational opportunities. For successful implementation of the practice principles, consumers, service providers (staff with direct service provision) and policymakers need to be involved in implementation and evaluation.</p></sec><sec id="sec19-15691861251328585"><title>Key points for occupational therapy</title><p>
