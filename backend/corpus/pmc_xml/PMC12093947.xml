In contrast, <italic toggle="yes">D. kuznetsovii</italic> strain TPOSR lacks the MT pathway, relying solely on ADH for growth on methanol. Despite the absence of the MT pathway, cobalt starvation resulted in lower methanol uptake rates and reduced growth rates in strain TPOSR, suggesting a critical role of cobalt in methanol metabolism outside of its role in the MT system. Given the often-crucial role of metal cofactors such as iron, zinc, and other metals in the active site of ADHs, we hypothesized that cobalt could influence the catalytic activity of the TPOSR ADHs. The gene encoding for the most abundant ADH during growth on methanol, Adh1, was heterologously expressed in <italic toggle="yes">Escherichia coli</italic>, and the enzyme was purified for kinetic studies. Adh1 exhibited optimal activity at 55&#x000b0;C and is oxygen tolerant. The methanol turnover rate increased from 1.76 (95% Cl [1.56, 1.99]) s&#x0207b;&#x000b9; to 3.5 (95% Cl [3.3, 3.72]) s&#x0207b;&#x000b9; with the addition of 2 &#x000b5;M CoSO<sub>4</sub>, while higher cobalt concentrations (&#x0003e;5 &#x000b5;M) inhibited Adh1 activity. Similarly, NiSO<sub>4</sub> addition (1&#x02013;1000 &#x000b5;M) enhanced Adh1 activity, with a 75% improvement observed at an optimum concentration of 200 &#x000b5;M. Our findings suggest that the importance of cobalt for the methanol metabolism of sulfate-reducing organisms extends beyond its involvement in the MT system.</p><sec><title>IMPORTANCE</title><p>Methanol is a ubiquitous compound in natural environments, where it is produced geothermally or from plant and microbial biomass. Its microbial metabolism is particularly important in low-nutrient, oxygen-free environments, such as the deep subsurface, where specialized microbes compete for methanol and play a crucial role in the global carbon cycle. Typically, microbes in these settings rely on a cobalt-dependent methanol methyltransferase (MT) pathway for methanol breakdown. However, <italic toggle="yes">Desulfofundulus kuznetsovii</italic> TPOSR deviates from this, lacking the MT pathway and instead relying solely on alcohol dehydrogenases (ADH) to oxidize methanol. Despite the absence of the cobalt-dependent MT system, our study shows that cobalt strongly stimulates the activity of the most abundant ADH, revealing an unexpected, yet significant role for cobalt in this alternative methanol metabolism. Understanding these interactions not only sheds new light on methanol metabolism in nature but also opens up possibilities for developing more efficient and sustainable technologies for methanol conversion in industry.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>KEYWORDS</title><kwd>methanol metabolism</kwd><kwd>alcohol dehydrogenase</kwd><kwd>cobalt</kwd><kwd>sulfate-reducing bacteria</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group specific-use="FundRef"><award-group award-type="grant" id="award-1"><funding-source>

Among these compounds, methanol stands out due to its low cost and ease of handling. Methanol can be efficiently produced from water and CO&#x02082; through electrochemical processes. It is easy to transport, and it is highly soluble in water (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Many microorganisms tolerate high methanol concentrations, making it a suitable microbial substrate, both in oxic and anoxic environments. In aerobic and facultative anaerobic organisms, methanol assimilation is mediated by alcohol dehydrogenases (ADH), while strict anaerobic microbes, like acetogens and methanogens, can also employ cobalt-dependent methanol methyltransferases (MT). However, it was demonstrated that the sulfate reducer <italic toggle="yes">Desulfofundulus kuznetsovii</italic> strain 17<sup>T</sup> has genes encoding for both the ADH and the MT pathway (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Proteome analysis showed that proteins of both pathways are highly abundant during growth on methanol in the presence of cobalt, while only the ADH was abundant during growth without cobalt. In contrast, a newly described strain, <italic toggle="yes">D. kuznetsovii</italic> TPOSR, lacks the essential genes encoding for MT, yet it was able to grow on methanol. Proteomics analysis of methanol-grown cells of <italic toggle="yes">D. kuznetsovii</italic> TPOSR revealed an abundant ADH with high amino acid similarity to the ADH from strain 17<sup>T</sup> (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Furthermore, physiological experiments growing strain TPOSR with methanol indicated impaired growth and methanol uptake when cobalt was omitted. Assuming that the ADH was a cobalt-independent enzyme, these impairments were attributed to the effect of the lack of cobalt on other cobalt-dependent enzymes such as methionine synthase (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). However, ADHs are metalloproteins, and a modulation of their activity by cobalt was previously proposed (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), leaving a direct effect of cobalt availability on the activity of the ADH as a possible explanation for the observed growth impairment of strain TPOSR with methanol in the absence of cobalt.</p><p>ADHs catalyze the reversible conversion between alcohols and aldehydes or ketones. These reactions require the transfer of electrons between the substrate and specific cofactors. Substrate and cofactor are coordinated within the active site of the enzyme by a metal ion. Since the first purification of an ADH from yeast (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), a plethora of ADHs has been studied and divided into three groups based on the cofactor specificity: (i) NAD(P)-dependent; (ii) PQQ, F<sub>420</sub>, and haem-dependent; and (iii) FAD-dependent. NAD(P)-dependent ADHs are further divided into three types: (i) medium-chain or zinc-dependent as present in horse liver (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), (ii) short-chain as found in <italic toggle="yes">Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), and (iii) iron-containing/iron-activated ADHs as first reported from <italic toggle="yes">Zymomonas mobilis</italic> (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). ADHs of <italic toggle="yes">Desulfofundulus kuznetsovii</italic> belong to the latter group. The current understanding of type III ADHs and their potential applications was reviewed recently in reference <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, including the current knowledge about methanol metabolism facilitated by ADH systems. Despite the name &#x0201c;iron-containing/iron-activated,&#x0201d; there are representatives of type III ADHs that contain zinc, cobalt, or no metal ion at all (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). The crystal structures of ADHs display a conserved tunnel-like structure with the coordinating metal at its center and the substrates entering from opposing sites of this tunnel. The kinetic activity is strongly dependent on the type of metal available and varies between different ADH isoforms, as does the substrate specificity. Oxidation of methanol exhibits significantly lower conversion rates when compared to many other alcohols, with some methanol dehydrogenases being dependent on activating proteins (ACT, NUDIX hydrolase) to perform their catalytic activity, as found in <italic toggle="yes">Bacillus methanolicus</italic> (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>).</p><p>ADHs have potential for application in bioremediation or to produce alcohols and other related fine chemicals (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>), but their appeal is often limited by their low thermal stability, low turnover rates, and oxygen intolerance (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Consequently, there is an increasing interest in ADHs from thermophilic and hyperthermophilic organisms because of their higher turnover rates and greater thermal stability. The exploration of the enzymes involved in the methanol oxidation in the strain <italic toggle="yes">D. kuznetsovii</italic> TPOSR offers the possibility of characterizing a thermophilic ADH and provides an opportunity to gain deeper insights into the mechanisms behind cobalt dependency in methanol metabolism. Understanding whether the observed growth inhibition during cobalt starvation is due to the inhibition of the ADH itself or other cellular processes contributes to this effort.</p><p>In this study, we describe the effect of cobalt on the growth and methanol uptake rates of <italic toggle="yes">D. kuznetsovii</italic> TPOSR, along with akinetic analysis of its Adh1 protein. In the presence of cobalt, methanol is completely consumed, whereas the absence of cobalt in the culture medium inhibits methanol consumption, halting the strain&#x02019;s ability to grow at low methanol concentrations. Studies with the purified Adh1 showed reduced activity in the absence of cobalt, consistent with the previously mentioned physiological observations. On the other hand, given its oxygen and thermal tolerance, as well as its methanol oxidation rates, this enzyme could be a promising candidate for biotechnological applications.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Microorganisms and cultivation</title><p><italic toggle="yes">Desulfofundulus kuznetsovii</italic> strain TPOSR (DSM 110707) was available at our culture at the Laboratory of Microbiology, Wageningen University &#x00026; Research, The Netherlands.

The optimum temperature was determined using NAD<sup>+</sup> (0.5 mM and 1 mM) and methanol (1 mM, 10 mM, and 100 mM) in 50 mM Bis-tris propane buffer, pH 9.4, across a temperature range between 30&#x000b0;C and 70&#x000b0;C. The pH optimum for the assessed enzymes was determined using NAD<sup>+</sup> (1 mM) coupled to the oxidation of methanol (1 mM, 10 mM, and 100 mM) at 55&#x000b0;C in TRIS-HCl (pH 7.5, 8, 8.5, and 9), BIS-Tris propane (BTP) (8.6, 9, 9.4, and 10) and CAPS (9.5, 10, 10.5, and 11). We checked whether the HIS-tag extension affected methanol oxidation by comparing uncleaved Adh1 with TEV-cleaved Adh1 (overnight incubation at 4&#x000b0;C) with methanol (0&#x02013;4.9 M) and NAD<sup>+</sup> (2 mM) in BTP (pH 9.4) at 55&#x000b0;C. Since no significant difference was observed (<xref rid="SuF2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplement S3</xref>), the uncleaved Adh1 was used. Kinetic assays to study the methanol oxidation of TPOSR Adh1 were carried out in 50 mM BTP buffer, at 55&#x000b0;C, using 96-well microplates (Greiner, 675101). The concentration of Adh1 in the assays was 50 or 75 nM (2.14 or 3.21 &#x000b5;g/&#x000b5;l) unless stated otherwise. Substrate stocks were freshly prepared and kept on ice, and NAD<sup>+</sup> and NADH concentrations were quantified spectrophotometrically. For the determination of the kinetic parameters, we used NAD<sup>+</sup> concentrations ranging from 0.02 to 2.5 mM and methanol concentrations from 0.75 to 3000 mM. To evaluate the effect of metal ions on the rate of methanol oxidation catalyzed by TPOSR Adh1, initial rates of methanol (100 mM) oxidations with NAD<sup>+</sup> (0.8 mM) were determined with the addition of one of the following metals in a concentration range from 1 &#x000b5;M to 1 mM: CoSO<sub>4</sub>, Fe(II)SO<sub>4</sub>, Fe(III)Cl<sub>3</sub>, ZnCl<sub>2</sub>, MnSO<sub>4</sub>, CuSO<sub>4</sub>, and NiSO<sub>4</sub>.

Relative activities of the reactions in the presence of all metals or EDTA are available in the supplemental material (<xref rid="SuF1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplement S3</xref>). Reactions in the presence of cobalt were carried out, unless otherwise stated, with a final CoSO<sub>4</sub> concentration of 2 &#x000b5;M.

However, the growth of strain TPOSR was impaired in the absence of cobalt. To further explore how cobalt starvation affects strain TPOSR, we observed the growth and the methanol uptake of strain TPOSR, in the presence or the absence of cobalt and vitamin B12, with varying initial methanol concentrations (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>).</p><fig position="float" fig-type="figure" id="F1"><label>Fig 1</label><caption><p>Growth of strain TPOSR (A + B) and methanol concentration in the medium (C + D) with different initial methanol concentrations (1 mM&#x02014;blue circle, 2 mM&#x02014;turquoise square, 3 mM&#x02014;green triangle, 5 mM&#x02014;red hexagon, 7 mM&#x02014;purple X and 10 mM&#x02014;orange plus) in presence (A + C) and absence (B + D) of cobalt and vitamin B12.

Additionally, at the tested methanol concentrations, maximum density was reached only after 300&#x02013;400 hours, due to a severe reduction in their growth rates.

In agreement with these observations, the activity of TPOSR Adh1 was strongly dependent on its metal core. This was reflected in the reduction of methanol oxidation activity after the treatment with metal-chelating ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). To assess the effect of different metal cofactors, we determined the methanol oxidation rates at various metal ion concentrations (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). While the annotation &#x0201c;iron-containing ADH&#x0201d; suggests a Fe(II) or Fe(III) core, the addition of either of these ions did not result in a beneficial effect on the methanol oxidation rate of Adh1. By contrast, the addition of either Fe(II)SO<sub>4</sub> or Fe(III)Cl<sub>3</sub> led to reduced methanol oxidation rate already at low concentrations, while higher concentrations led to photometric artifacts caused by the turbidity of the mixture. Similarly, the addition of ZnCl<sub>2</sub> or MgSO<sub>4</sub> inhibited methanol oxidation of Adh1 above 200 or 300 &#x000b5;M, respectively. No change in activity was observed with the addition of CuSO<sub>4</sub> in the range of 1&#x02013;500 &#x000b5;M. On the other hand, the addition of cobalt and nickel at low concentrations showed beneficial effects on the rate of methanol oxidation by Adh1. The addition of CoSO<sub>4</sub> led to a 25% increase in methanol oxidation rate at an ion concentration of 2 &#x000b5;M, whereas higher ion concentrations resulted in inhibition. Similarly, the addition of nickel achieved a 70% increase in activity at a concentration of 200 &#x000b5;M (2000 times enzyme concentration), while higher concentrations were inhibiting. A strong increase in absorption at 340 nm was observed during the addition of increasing concentrations of MnSO<sub>4</sub>. However, a similar signal was observed in enzyme-free controls, and the increase in signal was therefore attributed to the metal itself. These results indicate that cobalt and nickel, at low concentrations, can enhance the activity of the purified TPOSR Adh1.

However, similar impairments while omitting cobalt have been previously attributed to reduced activity of other cobalt-dependent enzymes, but a direct effect of cobalt on the ADH system remains possible.

Although this enzyme is annotated as an iron-containing ADH, the addition of iron (either Fe<sup>2+</sup> or Fe<sup>3+</sup>) reduced methanol oxidation rates, while cobalt and nickel were found to increase Adh1 activity at low concentrations. The beneficial effects of Co<sup>2+</sup> and Ni<sup>2+</sup> on methanol oxidation align with observations made for the ADH from <italic toggle="yes">Cupriavidus necator</italic> (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>), but the effect of different concentrations was not described. Reports detailing the effects of metal ions in a range instead of a single concentration are rare, even though they can drastically affect enzyme activity. Besides enzyme activity, cobalt could also influence the stability of Adh1. Reference <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> described a group-III ADH from <italic toggle="yes">Pyrococcus horikoshii</italic> OT3, NAD-dependent but not methanol-oxidizing, with low oxygen tolerance when coordinated with Fe<sup>2+</sup>. Oxygen exposure resulted in permanent inactivation of the iron-containing ADH, due to metal-catalysed oxidation of the enzyme, while exchange of the Fe<sup>2+</sup> with Ni<sup>2+</sup> and Co<sup>2+</sup> reduced oxygen sensitivity. Tests with cell-free extracts of methanol-grown TPOSR show a loss of methanol oxidation activity within minutes, possibly indicating the use of Fe<sup>2+</sup> in the native enzyme. The heterologously expressed form of TPOSR Adh1 retains activity for weeks when stored in oxic conditions, perhaps indicating incorporation of Co<sup>2+</sup> or Ni<sup>2+</sup> instead, both of which are likely available in the rich LB media that was used for cultivation of the <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> expression strains. While this explains the stability differences between the native and the heterologous enzyme, the mechanism by which cobalt enhances its activity <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> remains unclear. The binding of the ion to binding sites outside of the active site has been suggested as a general mechanism of protein&#x02013;metal interaction (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). While this remains to be investigated, it could affect the stability of the protein or its substrate coordination. The effect of the exchange of iron and cobalt on the reaction mechanism of a 2-oxoglutarate oxygenase has been described by quantum chemical modeling (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>), indicating that cobalt would reduce enzyme turnover due to higher energy requirements for the activation of oxygen. Although this is not directly relatable to methanol oxidation by an ADH, it can be imagined that the higher ionization energy (with Fe &#x0003c; Co &#x0003c; Ni) could affect the coordination of the substrates leading to the accordingly increased activity of the heterologous enzyme. Concluding, it is evident that additional research is required to further explore the effect of metal ions on the methanol oxidation of Adh1. A promising contribution would be to develop a setup that enables stable activity assays of the cell-free extract, allowing for a systematic assessment of the effects of cobalt and nickel addition on the native enzyme.</p><p>Product inhibition can be a contributing factor to the impaired growth of cells. We did not study the inhibition by formaldehyde because the much higher catalytic activities and lower saturation constants of aldehyde ferredoxin oxidoreductases (EC:1.2.7.5) in combination with its constitutively high abundance in the TPOSR proteome suggest that physiological formaldehyde concentrations are likely very low. Conversely, NADH is of particular interest because previous research using <italic toggle="yes">Ralstonia eutropha</italic> (now <italic toggle="yes">Cupriavidus necator</italic>) showed that an increased NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> ratio is a characteristic of growth driven by alcohol oxidation (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). While NADH is inhibiting at low concentrations, it does not explain the inhibited methanol uptake at low initial methanol concentrations, as no methanol oxidation has occurred yet, and NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> ratios should be low, resulting in minimal product inhibition of Adh1.</p><p>In conclusion, this study demonstrates the importance of cobalt for methanol oxidations of <italic toggle="yes">D. kuznetsovii</italic> TPOSR. While the exact mechanism remains unclear, our data suggest that the effect of cobalt on the methanol oxidation rate of Adh1 could contribute to the observed growth impairment of strain TPOSR. This does not exclude further effects of cobalt starvation on other cellular processes, which remain to be investigated. Furthermore, TPOSR Adh1 is positioned as an interesting enzyme for further research and biotechnological applications due to its high turnover of methanol and its low oxygen sensitivity. We emphasize the need for further research into the concentration-related effect of metal ions in enzymatic studies and propose <italic toggle="yes">D. kuznetsovii</italic> as an ideal model to study the metabolism of methanol in sulfate reducers due to its unique setup with the combined MT and ADH pathways in strain 17<sup>T</sup> and the ADH dependence of strain TPOSR.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>This work was supported by the SIAM Gravitation grant (project 024.002.002) of the Netherlands Ministry of Education, Culture and Science and the Netherlands Science Foundation (NWO).</p></ack><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5-1"><title>SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL</title><p specific-use="print-only">The following material is available online at <ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1128/aem.00215-25" ext-link-type="uri">https://doi.org/10.1128/aem.00215-25</ext-link>.</p><supplementary-material id="SuF1" position="float" content-type="local-data"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1128/aem.00215-25.SuF1</object-id><label>Supplements S1 and S2</label><caption><title>aem.00215-25-s0001.docx</title><p>Harmonized sequence of TPOSR Adh1 with TEV cleavage site and HIS-tag S2, and Dynafit scripts for the calculation of methanol oxidation rates by Adh1.</p></caption><media xlink:href="aem.00215-25-s0001.docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="SuF2" position="float" content-type="local-data"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1128/aem.00215-25.SuF2</object-id><label>Supplement S3</label><caption><title>aem.00215-25-s0002.xlsx</title><p>Data enzymatic assays.</p></caption><media xlink:href="aem.00215-25-s0002.xlsx"/></supplementary-material><p specific-use="online-only">ASM does not own the copyrights to Supplemental Material that may be linked to, or accessed through, an article.
