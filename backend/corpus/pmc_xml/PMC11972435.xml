This retrospective cohort study analyzed the clinical records of 20 patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) treated at our hospital between 2013 and 2024. We investigated the clinical implications of gallbladder removal in patients with PSC, a progressive cholangiopathy with limited therapeutic options. We retrospectively analyzed the data of patients with PSC and compared patients with and without prior cholecystectomy to assess the impact on disease progression using the Mayo risk score, Fibrosis-4 (FIB4) index, and other clinical parameters. Our findings indicated that cholecystectomy was associated with worse Mayo risk scores (p = 0.0004) and an elevated FIB4 index (p = 0.021), suggesting a potential link between gallbladder removal and accelerated disease progression. Furthermore, mortality and transplant-free survival analysis revealed significantly worse outcomes in the cholecystectomy group (odds ratio = 21.0, p = 0.032). However, given the retrospective nature and small sample size of this study, selection bias cannot be excluded, and further research is needed to confirm these findings. These findings support the hypothesis that gallbladder-derived factors, such as retinoic acid, may influence PSC progression and highlight the need for further research into therapeutic interventions targeting this pathway.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>biliary diseases</kwd><kwd>cholecystectomy</kwd><kwd>gall bladder</kwd><kwd>liver function</kwd><kwd>post cholecystectomy</kwd><kwd>primary sclerosing cholangitis (psc)</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was partly supported by a grant from the Foundation for Promotion of Cancer Research (to M.O.).</funding-statement></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a chronic progressive cholestatic liver disease characterized by inflammation, fibrosis, and stricturing of the intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. It often leads to complications such as biliary cirrhosis, liver failure, and a higher risk of cholangiocarcinoma [<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Despite ongoing research, effective medical treatments remain limited, and liver transplantation is the only definitive therapy for end-stage PSC.</p><p>Historically, the gallbladder has been regarded as a passive bile reservoir with little direct involvement in bile duct homeostasis or regeneration [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Conventional understanding suggests that bile flow regulation depends primarily on the liver and biliary epithelium, whereas the role of the gallbladder is limited to bile storage and controlled release [<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Therefore, cholecystectomy has long been considered a procedure with minimal long-term impact on hepatobiliary function, aside from alterations in bile acid circulation. However, emerging evidence challenges this view, suggesting that the gallbladder actively contributes to biliary repair and disease modulation.</p><p>Bile duct repair mechanisms play a crucial role in PSC progression [<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. A recent study identified a previously unrecognized role of the gallbladder in bile duct regeneration: gallbladder-derived smooth muscle cells migrate to the common hepatic duct (CHD) following bile duct injury and produce retinoic acid (RA), which activates SOX9-mediated biliary epithelial cell proliferation and bile duct repair [<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. This finding raises the intriguing possibility that gallbladder removal (cholecystectomy) could impair biliary repair mechanisms, leading to accelerated disease progression in PSC [<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>To test this hypothesis, we conducted a retrospective analysis comparing patients with PSC with and without prior cholecystectomy. We assessed differences in Mayo risk scores, Fibrosis-4 (FIB4) index, and transplant-free survival to determine whether cholecystectomy was a risk factor for disease progression.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Study design, patient selection, and ethics</p><p>This retrospective cohort study was conducted using data from a hospital database containing clinical records of patients with PSC who were evaluated and treated at our hospital between 2013 and 2024. The exclusion criteria included patients who underwent liver transplantation before data collection, those with insufficient clinical records, and those lost to follow-up. The inclusion criterion was a confirmed diagnosis of PSC based on imaging, biochemical markers, and histological findings. Patients who underwent liver transplantation at the time of data collection were excluded. The remaining patients were stratified into two groups based on their cholecystectomy status. The cholecystectomy group comprised patients who underwent gallbladder removal prior to PSC diagnosis, whereas the non-cholecystectomy group comprised individuals who retained their gallbladder. However, the exact timing of cholecystectomy relative to PSC diagnosis was not available for all cases, which is acknowledged as a study limitation. This classification allowed for a comparative analysis of disease severity and progression between the two groups. Informed consent was obtained from all patients included in the study. The study protocol conformed to the ethical guidelines of the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Okayama University Hospital (Approval number: Ken1603-025). Patient consent was obtained via an opt-out system.</p><p>Clinical parameters</p><p>Several key clinical markers were analyzed and compared between the cholecystectomy and non-cholecystectomy groups to evaluate disease severity and progression. The Mayo risk score was calculated for each patient as it is a well-established prognostic model for PSC [<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. This score incorporated various clinical parameters, including age, bilirubin level, albumin concentration, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level, and history of variceal bleeding, to predict the survival outcomes in patients with PSC.</p><p>In addition to the Mayo risk score, the FIB4 index was assessed as a measure of hepatic fibrosis [<xref rid="REF12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The FIB4 index was calculated as previously described. A higher FIB4 index indicated more severe fibrosis, making it a valuable marker for assessing PSC-related liver damage.</p><p>Additional biochemical parameters, including AST, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), gamma-glutamyl transferase (gGTP), and platelet levels, were examined to provide a broader understanding of the disease state. Platelet count was monitored closely because of its inverse relationship with liver fibrosis, as lower levels suggest a more advanced disease status.</p><p>Statistical analyses</p><p>Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 10 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA) to compare the clinical parameters between the cholecystectomy and non-cholecystectomy groups. Student's t-tests were used for normally distributed continuous variables, whereas the Mann-Whitney U test was applied to non-parametric data to determine statistical significance. The relationship between disease severity and hepatic fibrosis was further explored using Spearman correlation analysis to assess the association between the Mayo risk score and FIB4 index. A stronger correlation within a specific group suggested a more pronounced relationship between fibrosis progression and the overall disease severity. A 2 &#x000d7; 2 contingency table analysis was conducted to evaluate the effect of cholecystectomy on clinical outcomes. This analysis was used to compare the mortality and liver transplantation rates between the two groups, with odds ratios (ORs) calculated using Fisher's exact test to determine the relative risk of adverse outcomes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Patient characteristics</p><p>Twenty patients diagnosed with PSC who visited our hospital were included (Table <xref rid="TAB1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).&#x000a0;Among them, five patients (5/20, 25%) had previously undergone cholecystectomy due to gallstone disease or cholecystitis, whereas 15 patients (15/20, 75%) retained their gallbladder. Although the median age differed between the two groups (46 vs. 63 years in the non-cholecystectomy and cholecystectomy groups, respectively), the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.189). Similarly, the median follow-up period during which we observed the incidence of mortality and liver transplantation was longer in the non-cholecystectomy group (1,045 days) than in the cholecystectomy group (144 days), but this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.073). Importantly, none of the patients underwent cholecystectomy during the observation period. In addition, albumin levels were significantly lower in the cholecystectomy group (median: 2.6 g/dl) than those in the non-cholecystectomy group (median: 4.4 g/dl, p = 0.005), suggesting a potential impact on liver function. Hemoglobin levels and platelet counts were comparable between the groups, with no significant differences observed (p = 0.204 and p = 0.895, respectively).</p><table-wrap position="float" id="TAB1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Patient characteristics.</title><p>Values are expressed as median (range).

removal may contribute to disease progression beyond what is expected from the natural history of PSC.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our study provides clinical evidence that prior cholecystectomy is associated with more severe PSC progression, as reflected by higher Mayo risk scores, higher FIB4 index, and worse transplant-free survival. However, given the retrospective design and the small number of cholecystectomy cases, definitive conclusions cannot be drawn, and the possibility of selection bias must be acknowledged. These findings are consistent with those of a recent study that revealed the key regenerative function of the gallbladder in bile duct repair [<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]: gallbladder-derived smooth muscle cells migrate to the CHD following bile duct injury and produce RA, a signaling molecule critical for biliary epithelial cell proliferation [<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Our data clinically suggest that the removal of the gallbladder in patients with PSC may deprive them of this regenerative mechanism, leading to a faster progression of fibrosis, worsened cholestasis, and an increased risk of mortality and transplantation.</p><p>Biliary repair failure is increasingly recognized as a driver of PSC progression [<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. A novel study showed that smooth muscle cell migration and intrahepatic bile duct regeneration failed in the absence of the gallbladder, resulting in persistent biliary injury. Considering PSC&#x02019;s hallmark features of chronic inflammation, injury cycles, and progressive fibrosis [<xref rid="REF14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], it is plausible that the loss of gallbladder-derived regenerative signaling accelerates disease progression. Our finding that patients who underwent cholecystectomy showed a stronger correlation between more severe progression and the Mayo risk score and FIB4 index supports the hypothesis that fibrosis progression is more tightly linked to overall disease severity in these patients, likely due to the absence of gallbladder-derived RA signaling.</p><p>A key finding of our study was the 21-fold increased risk of mortality or liver transplantation in patients with PSC who underwent cholecystectomy. This mirrors the experimental results [<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] in which cholecystectomized mice exhibited impaired bile duct regeneration and increased susceptibility to biliary injury. Nonetheless, it remains uncertain whether cholecystectomy directly accelerates PSC progression or if patients requiring cholecystectomy inherently follow a more severe clinical course. Although some patients in our cohort may have undergone cholecystectomy before their PSC diagnosis because of gallstone disease, our results raise the question of whether gallbladder removal actively worsens PSC rather than being a consequence of early disease. Future prospective studies are needed to determine whether cholecystectomy is a modifiable risk factor for PSC.</p><p>Several mechanisms may explain why cholecystectomy worsens PSC outcomes. Retinoic acid is essential for bile duct differentiation and repair, and, as newly revealed, its absence following cholecystectomy may hinder regeneration, leading to unresolved biliary injury and progressive fibrosis. The gallbladder also plays a role in bile flow regulation; its removal alters bile acid metabolism and increases bile acid toxicity, thereby contributing to cholangiocyte apoptosis and hepatic fibrosis. In patients with PSC who are predisposed to biliary strictures and impaired bile flow, gallbladder removal may further exacerbate cholestatic liver injury. Additionally, bile acids influence the gut microbiota composition [<xref rid="REF15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="REF16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], and changes in bile acid circulation after cholecystectomy could contribute to dysbiosis, which has been linked to PSC pathogenesis [<xref rid="REF17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Other gallbladder-derived regenerative factors may also be lost, warranting further investigation.</p><p>These findings suggest that cholecystectomy should be approached with caution in patients with PSC. Although gallbladder removal is often performed for gallstone disease, its potential impact on PSC progression may be more severe than previously recognized. Clinicians should carefully weigh the risks and benefits, particularly for early-stage PSC. For patients requiring cholecystectomy, alternative strategies should be considered to mitigate the loss of gallbladder-derived regenerative signaling. Potential therapeutic approaches include RA supplementation to restore lost signaling, bile acid-modulating agents such as nor-ursodeoxycholic acid to counteract altered bile acid homeostasis [<xref rid="REF18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], and novel regenerative therapies targeting bile duct repair [<xref rid="REF19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>-<xref rid="REF21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Future studies should determine whether specific interventions can mitigate the negative impact of cholecystectomy on PSC progression [<xref rid="REF22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>-<xref rid="REF24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>Although our study presented compelling evidence linking cholecystectomy to worse PSC outcomes, several limitations must be acknowledged. The retrospective design introduces a potential selection bias, and prospective validation is required. Additionally, our study lacked longitudinal biomarker data to assess whether changes in ALT, ALP, or total bilirubin levels were time-dependent following cholecystectomy. The exact timing of cholecystectomy relative to PSC onset remains uncertain, and although we included only cases in which cholecystectomy preceded PSC diagnosis, some patients may have undergone cholecystectomy due to early, undiagnosed PSC-related pathology. Additionally, RA was not directly measured in human bile ducts, preventing mechanistic confirmation. Finally, our sample size was relatively small. Future studies should focus on larger cohorts with prospective follow-ups to further investigate these associations. Larger multicenter studies are required to confirm these findings in different PSC subpopulations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In summary, our study provides the first clinical evidence that cholecystectomy is associated with worsened PSC progression, likely due to the loss of gallbladder-derived regenerative signals. These findings build upon recent experimental work, reinforcing the concept that the gallbladder plays a crucial role in bile duct homeostasis. Future studies should focus on identifying therapeutic strategies to compensate for the loss of gallbladder-derived factors in patients with PSC undergoing cholecystectomy, potentially paving the way for new targeted interventions.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group content-type="conflict"><title>Disclosures</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Human subjects:</bold> Consent for treatment and open access publication was obtained or waived by all participants in this study.
