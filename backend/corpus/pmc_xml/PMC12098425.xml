This uptake is in part due to the growing body of evidence that links arts and cultural participation to notable impacts on health and well-being at the population level in this country, including on mental health (<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), flourishing among young people (<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), healthy aging (<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), and even mortality (<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Additionally, as the significant health risks posed by social isolation and loneliness are better understood, arts and cultural strategies are increasingly recognized as available resources for countering isolation and building social cohesion in communities (<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).</p><p>The 2023 report by US Surgeon General, Dr. Vivek Murthy, highlights that half of American adults experience loneliness, and that loneliness is a serious health risk at both the individual and collective levels (<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). The report notes that the health risks of loneliness are greater than that of obesity or inactivity and calls with urgency for &#x0201c;a movement to mend the social fabric of our nation&#x0201d; (p. 5). This urgency is underscored by the isolation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and heightened socio-political divisions in the US, which highlight the need not only for opportunities for social connection, but also for building social cohesion, defined in Healthy People 2030 as &#x0201c;the strength of relationships and a sense of solidarity among members of a community&#x0201d; (<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>).</p><p>The notion of social fabric referred to in the Surgeon General&#x02019;s report is not just about social relationships and connections. A strong social fabric refers as well to social cohesion, or the sense of belonging to a group and a willingness to participate and share in it (<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). While definitions vary greatly, many refer to the attitudes and behaviors of members of a community or group, and not simply proximity or connection (<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). As such, social cohesion is critical to a community&#x02019;s ability to respond to challenges and to create conditions in which its members can thrive.</p><p>Social cohesion is often thought of generally as the &#x0201c;glue that holds societies together&#x0201d; (<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Defined as early as the 14th century as a feeling of unity and group consciousness (<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>), early Western theorists, including &#x000c9;mile Durkheim and Charles Horton Cooley, laid the groundwork for understanding social cohesion as integral to societal functioning and well-being, highlighting collective behavior and interdependence (<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). More current definitions, although varied, often focus on the strength of relationships, solidarity, belonging, orientation toward a common good, and willingness to participate (<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17&#x02013;19</xref>). For example, the Council of Europe defines social cohesion &#x0201c;as the capacity of a society to ensure the well-being of all its members&#x02014;minimizing disparities and avoiding marginalization&#x02014;to manage differences and divisions and ensure the means of achieving welfare for all members&#x0201d; (<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). At times, the term has, problematically, been used to refer to the sense of identification and emotional ties among people who share the same characteristics (<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), but this notion of homogeneity as a variable in social cohesion has since been recognized to be linked to economic deprivation (<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). More current definitions emphasize multiculturism and the absence of conflict across differences such as wealth, ethnicity, and race (<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>).</p><p>Arts participation has been explored as a means for building social cohesion in US communities (<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>) and other regions (<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>), as well as for enhancing the well-being of individuals and communities. The <italic>We-Making</italic> Theory of Change (see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>), for example, offers a framework that articulates a relationship between place-based arts and cultural strategies, social cohesion, and community well-being in US communities (<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>We-making theory of change, reproduced from Engh et al.

This theory of change offers a promising model for guiding programming and policy that can increase utilization of available arts and cultural resources to address the critical issue of social isolation in the US communities.</p><p>While increasing studies document relationships between arts participation and both social cohesion and well-being uniquely, few studies have investigated the relationships between all three and, to date, no evidence synthesis has been conducted on this topic. To address this gap, this integrative review aimed to identify, describe, and synthesize literature that investigates arts participation, social cohesion, and well-being in a community context. It builds on work undertaken through the <italic>We-Making</italic> initiative (<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>), and also serves as a foundational study within the broader research agenda developed to assess the One Nation/One Project initiative, a national arts and health initiative designed to activate the power of the arts for social cohesion, health, and well-being and to repair the social fabric of US communities following the COVID-19 pandemic. The review was designed to address the question: <italic>what is the evidence regarding relationships between arts participation, social cohesion, and well-being?</italic></p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec6"><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><p>This study utilized an integrative review methodology (<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>) to examine published literature that investigates arts participation, social cohesion, and well-being. Given the specific and nascent nature of this topic, the integrative review methodology was chosen over others (e.g., scoping or systematic review) to include a broad range of evidence, including theoretical, methodological, and empirical literature. Integrative reviews align with scoping review guidelines and follow a systematic yet holistic approach to minimize bias during literature searching, screening, data extraction, but also include critical appraisal of included studies (<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). This study&#x02019;s methodology development was guided by PRISMA for Scoping Reviews and adopted a holistic approach to synthesizing empirical and theoretical literature (<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>).</p><sec id="sec7"><label>2.1</label><title>Guiding definitions</title><p>The study utilized four definitions to guide its inclusion and exclusion criteria, as well as data extraction and analysis. Each of the concepts investigated in this study evades a single, widely accepted definition. Therefore, the study utilized definitions that offered both breadth and specificity in alignment with the nature of the study&#x02019;s focus.</p><p>Community was defined as a group inhabiting a common territory or having one or more common ties (<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Within this definition, we recognized communities of people sharing common geographic areas, including those composed of culturally distinct members (people with similar cultural identities) and culturally heterogeneous groups (people of different cultural identities related to, among other things, ethnicity, language, race, values, age, or sense of place). We also recognized transient communities, including temporary, resettled, dispersed or displaced residents, including migrant, diasporic, or student communities, and online communities.</p><p>The review utilized a broad and inclusive definition of arts participation (<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). This definition includes modes, or ways, in which people engage with the arts, and includes examples of a wide range of art forms that frame arts participation broadly and inclusively. The search strategy included a broad range of terms representing the arts (see <xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary material</xref> Search Strategy: Sample Search Strategy for PubMed), and both our search strategy and inclusion criteria reflected the definition of arts participation developed for the purpose of public health research.</p><p>The study engaged the Healthy People 2030 definition of social cohesion (<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>), which refers to &#x0201c;the strength of relationships and a sense of solidarity among members of a community,&#x0201d; along with several variables for social cohesion that were developed in the project&#x02019;s broader research agenda. In all, our definition of social cohesion was represented by nine variables: social relationships, social networks, solidarity, belonging, social capital, participation, trust, inclusion, and social support.</p><p>Well-being was defined in alignment with the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation definition: &#x0201c;the comprehensive view of how individuals and communities experience and evaluate their lives, including their physical and mental health and having the skills and opportunities to construct meaningful futures&#x0201d; (<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). While there is no consistent cross-sector definition of well-being, subjective well-being is increasingly recognized as an important health indicator.</p></sec><sec id="sec8"><label>2.2</label><title>Preliminary searching and protocol</title><p>An initial search for similar pre-existing reviews or protocols was carried out on February 25, 2022.

One study reported that utilizing public squares in China for dancing fostered a shared sense of belonging to populations and cultures (<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). Physical creative activity within these public squares cultivated relationships between identity and the historical context of the spaces, which was positively correlated with emotions and social cohesion.

The program created a public visual gallery for storytelling and to facilitate dialogue and foster social capital. As a result of this collaboration, participants developed a sense of trust with others that cultivated social cohesion and personal well-being. While most studies found that arts participation in community spaces fostered social cohesion, Daffern et al. (<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>) found that choirs conducted virtually during the COVID-19 pandemic negatively affected the well-being of some participants, reporting that, &#x0201c;the virtual choir in itself actually had a strong negative impact on well-being&#x0201d; (p. 8) (<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>).

However, many participants also found value and connection in the remote access.</p></sec><sec id="sec26"><label>3.9.2</label><title>Theme 2: culturally rooted arts programs can enhance individual and shared cultural identity, belonging, solidarity, and cooperation</title><p>This theme highlights that community-based arts participation that is rooted in cultural identities, traditions, and practices may be a particularly effective means for engaging people in shared activities that can build important dimensions of social cohesion. For example, in a study of how a community arts center can serve as ethnic enclaves that build social cohesion and well-being, Rubin et al. (<xref rid="ref52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>) found that the center and its creative activities played a significant role in maintaining social cohesion despite the threat of gentrification and cultural displacement. The study underscored the importance of the art center in fostering a sense of security, belonging, and shared cultural identity, and in maintaining social cohesion. Culturally rooted arts programs can also facilitate the process of reclaiming cultural traditions as a component of intergenerational healing. Good et al. (<xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>) reported on how Indigenous youth connected with their heritage through song and dance, sewing regalia, making drums, and learning native language lyrics in a school-based traditional music program. The program documented concurrent improvements in personal, cultural, and social development, while generating connection to cultural identity and a strengthened sense of community.</p><p>This theme also brings to light ways that arts participation creates spaces for cross-cultural exchanges that can build social cohesion among people of diverse cultural backgrounds. For example, Joseph and Southscott&#x02019;s (<xref rid="ref49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>) research found that, &#x0201c;choirs formed by culturally and linguistically diverse groups provide opportunities through performance for the maintenance and transmission of heritage to family, friends and wider community&#x0201d; (p. 187).</p></sec><sec id="sec27"><label>3.9.3</label><title>Theme 3: co-creation and social relationships cultivate commitment to a group and program, which can result in more regular participation, and in turn, enhance benefits</title><p>Several articles highlighted that co-creation, such as community members working together to create a performance or exhibit, can cultivate a commitment to fellow program participants and to a program, resulting in more regular or sustained participation. In turn, more regular participation was shown to result in more benefits to social cohesion, health, and well-being. For example, in a study of a national circus program including five community participatory circus programs in Spiegel et al. (<xref rid="ref50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>) found that participants in a community circus project experienced an enhanced sense of group community bonding and belonging and, as a result, their engagement in the community and well-being grew. They also highlighted ways in which social inclusion and collective practice are intrinsically linked and mutually affect one another.</p><p>In a study of in a community orchestra group, Kang (<xref rid="ref48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>) found that &#x0201c;In a collaborative process of playing in an orchestra, members shared responsibility and resources, and communicated and negotiated among members to achieve the communal goal&#x0201d; (p. 10). They also found enhanced subjective well-being among participants to be associated with a sense of solidarity and community belonging that is cultivated through participation in the orchestra, noting that orchestras can create communities in which different cultural values can be harmonized, which can be an important contributor to social cohesion. Similarly, Phinney et al. (<xref rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>) found that participants in co-creation of visual arts exhibits and performances felt a sense of connection and commitment to each other, a stronger sense of belonging to the larger community, and that in turn this commitment to one another and the program drew participants back consistently (<xref rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). Ward et al. (<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>) reported that community gardening changed participants&#x02019; satisfaction with being a part of a community and enhanced both community participation and people&#x02019;s ability to make contributions to the community. These feelings contributed to a commitment to gardening, which in turn enabled enhancements in health, well-being, and social capital.</p></sec><sec id="sec28"><label>3.9.4</label><title>Theme 4: social cohesion, and its various components, may serve as a mechanism to enhancing well-being</title><p>As noted above, six articles presented studies that suggest that social cohesion can act as a mechanism to well-being in communities. Spiegel et al. (<xref rid="ref50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>) found that creative programs engaged to promote social transformation (through social inclusion, social engagement, culture-sharing, and collective practice) can contribute to both individual and collective well-being (<xref rid="ref50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). Joseph and Southcott (<xref rid="ref49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>) reported that choir members experienced a profound feeling of social connection, which overcame social isolation and positively impacted their sense of well-being (p. 187). Phinney et al. (<xref rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>) also found that the social cohesion that was cultivated through arts participation and Co-creation generated improvements in physical and social health and well-being (<xref rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>).</p><p>Similarly, Ward et al. (<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>) reported findings of a study of a community gardening program in New South Wales that community gardening supported social cohesion (social connection, inclusiveness, and a sense of community), which in turn enhanced well-being along with health and social capital. Finally, Tian and Wise (<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>) studied a public square dance program for women over age 55, most of whom reported experiencing loneliness, in a suburban Chinese community. They found that synchronous group dancing in the public square built numerous dimensions of social cohesion, including being a part of a group, which led to enhanced sense of place, socialization, and well-being.</p><p><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref> below represents the relationships between arts participation, social cohesion, and well-being articulated in the included articles, and also highlights specific components of these relationships.</p><fig position="float" id="fig5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Relationships between arts participation, social cohesion, and well-being in the reviewed articles.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fpubh-13-1589693-g005" position="float"/></fig><p>The model suggests a cycle in which community-based arts participation, particularly wherein co-creation - which refers to activities such as co-crafting and preparing for a performance or art exhibit - and/or cultural sharing are involved, may facilitate relationships and group belonging.

This cycle of arts participation can build social cohesion and (potentially, in turn) enhance both individual and community well-being.

Recognizing a need for place-based strategies for rebuilding the social fabrics and well-being of communities disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, this integrative review aimed to identify, synthesize, and describe literature that investigates arts participation, social cohesion, and well-being in a community context in the US. It did not seek to synthesize the abundance of literature that has previously associated arts participation with well-being (<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="ref53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>), or solely with social cohesion (<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). It sought specifically to consider studies that included all three constructs.</p><p>The review synthesized the findings of 18 articles - 16 original research articles and two evidence reviews. It describes this literature by quantifying significant characteristics across the studies and presents four themes that describe the relationships that emerged from these articles between arts participation, social cohesion, and well-being. These findings highlight key dimensions of community-based arts participation that may contribute to building both social cohesion and well-being. They also support the need for further study of social cohesion as a mechanism, or mediator, for enhancing community well-being.</p><p>The review was undertaken with recognition that cultures around the world, particularly indigenous knowledge systems, have long understood and operationalized understanding of how art participation contributes to social cohesion and well-being in communities (<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="ref54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). This indigenous understanding is articulated in a recent study in Canada, which reported that 53.7% of Indigenous residents surveyed reported that the arts are very important to social connection compared with 23.8% of non-Indigenous respondents. Additionally, 63.9% of Indigenous respondents reported that the arts were very important to community well-being, compared to 30.6% of non-Indigenous respondents (<xref rid="ref55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>).</p><p>Findings of this review also support a growing body of current evidence that articulates the value of arts participation to both well-being and health (<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="ref53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>, <xref rid="ref56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>). Although it was not a focus of this review and therefore not reported as a finding, many of the articles in this review reported health benefits of arts participation that align with this literature.</p><p>In linking social cohesion to enhanced well-being, this study aligns with a recent analysis that used data from 374,378 individuals in the European Social Survey and found that social cohesion had a very strong and significant effect on subjective well-being (<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). It also aligns with the recent <italic>We-Making</italic> initiative in the US, wherein the authors offered a theory of change - representing findings from a study that encompassed literature review, case studies, interviews, logic-modeling, and a two-day expert convening &#x02013; that links place-based arts and cultural strategies with social cohesion and equitable community well-being (<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>).</p><p>This review engaged the primary elements of the <italic>We-Making Theory of Change</italic> (see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>) as a framework in its design (<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). It did not seek to test this theory of change but did seek to identify studies that articulated similar relationships between its primary components, considering the broader concept of arts participation as an abstraction of &#x0201c;place-based arts and cultural strategies&#x0201d; and generalizing from &#x0201c;equitable community well-being&#x0201d; to community well-being.</p><p>Notably, the findings of this review align with the concept of equitable community well-being articulated in the <italic>We-Making</italic> model, as included studies commonly reported improvements in mental and physical health (<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37&#x02013;39</xref>, <xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">42&#x02013;52</xref>, <xref rid="ref57" ref-type="bibr">57&#x02013;60</xref>), preservation of culture (<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="ref47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, <xref rid="ref49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>, <xref rid="ref51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>, <xref rid="ref52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>), creative responses to trauma and racism (<xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="ref51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>, <xref rid="ref52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>), and civic capacity for change (<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="ref46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, <xref rid="ref50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>, <xref rid="ref51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>, <xref rid="ref58" ref-type="bibr">58&#x02013;60</xref>). It also aligns with the <italic>We-Making</italic> assertion that &#x0201c;this process feeds back into, amplifies, and grows social cohesion&#x0201d; (p. 11). This review builds on this theory of change with a nuanced understanding of <italic>how</italic> arts programs &#x02013; with or without an explicit focus on social issues or social change &#x02013; can build the drivers of social cohesion and the commitments that result in sustained participation and persistent presence in a community.</p><p>The review&#x02019;s third theme suggests a potential cycle in which community-based arts participation, particularly wherein co-creation - which refers to activities such as co-crafting and preparing for a performance or art exhibit - and/or cultural sharing are involved, may facilitate relationships and group belonging. Additionally, through both co-creation and cultural sharing (arts activities centered in cultural identities, practices, and traditions) participants may build relationships, a sense of belonging to a community, and solidarity. This in turn may lead to a greater commitment to the program and fellow participants, which may lead to more regular participation in the program. This cycle of arts participation appears to build social cohesion and (potentially, in turn) enhance both individual and community well-being. It is important to note that while in some cases social cohesion was suggested to act as a mechanism for enhancing well-being, arts participation itself also yielded direct benefits to both well-being and health. These relationships should be studied through additional evidence reviews and prospective trials.</p><p>This review&#x02019;s articulation of this cycle highlights the usefulness of co-creation, in particular, as a key element in arts programs designed to enhance social cohesion and community well-being. Overall, this review supports the <italic>We-Making Theory of Change</italic> and offers this additional insight as well for engaging the arts for social cohesion and well-being in communities.</p><p>The review was also interested in identifying research wherein, like in the <italic>We-Making Theory of Change</italic>, social cohesion was identified as a mechanism to well-being. Six such studies were found (see results section above), lending support for this theory of change. However, this idea requires further research as some studies have also noted complexities that should be considered. For example, in a study of social capital in participatory arts programs for well-being, the authors explored two key dimensions of social capital &#x02013; bonding and bridging &#x02013; and noted that bonding in the absence of sufficient bridging in arts projects can reinforce unequal social relations that are detrimental to health and well-being (<xref rid="ref61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>). Notably, some of the variables of social capital explored in that study overlapped with the components of social cohesion used in this review. Additionally, solidarity emerged as a common component of social cohesion in this review and should be investigated further as a potentially important component in building social cohesion.</p><p>Importantly, the diverse culturally-rooted participatory arts programs included in this review contribute to understanding of the importance of the arts for preserving culture and for bridging cultures and cultural differences in community groups. Good et al. (<xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>) highlighted how song and dance, drumming, and learning traditional lyrics in a school-based music program enhanced Indigenous youth&#x02019;s connections with their heritage (<xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). Additionally, some studies highlighted how other forms of arts participation, such as public-square dancing and community circus arts can create space for exploring attachment to place and land, such as when community arts centers help preserve cultural identity and pride and create gathering space for immigrant communities (<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="ref50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>, <xref rid="ref52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>).</p><p>This review suggests that community gardens and choirs may be particularly useful art forms for building social cohesion and, in turn, well-being in communities. This may be because through membership, choirs can provoke a sense of belonging and inclusion and, through group singing, a sense of unity. Community gardening may provide unique opportunities for building social relationship and networks, trust, and social capital. Both forms include co-creation and regular participation and are activities that tend to be available in many communities, and that many people enjoy and may be easily drawn to as compared to forms such as dance, circus, or magic.</p><p>Notably, the findings of this review are reflected in the designs of three past and current nationally scaled arts programs, all intended to address social cohesion and well-being in communities in the US. First, the Federal Art Project component of the Works Progress Administration (WPA) of 1935, implemented in response to the need for rebuilding the economic and social landscape of US communities following the Great Depression (<xref rid="ref62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>). The WPA&#x02019;s unprecedented investment in the arts demonstrated an understanding of the power of the arts to help address social problems at scale.</p><p>Secondly, the Public Works program, which engages theater and the arts to &#x0201c;restore and build community by connecting people through the creation of extraordinary works of art&#x0201d; (<xref rid="ref63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>). This program, which has been implemented in communities across the US and beyond, is grounded in the understanding of three things that lead to group transformation - group enterprise, safe boundaries, and high stakes (<xref rid="ref64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>). Recognizing that community co-creation of art works meets this definition, the Public Works program implements large-scale community co-creation and staging of theater works that are reported by participants to yield &#x0201c;significant mental and physical health benefits, along with a deep sense of bonding and social cohesion&#x0201d; (<xref rid="ref64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>). Finally, and emanating directly from the inspiration of these two programs, One Nation/One Project is a national initiative in the US designed to engage the arts at a national scale to rebuild the social fabrics and well-being of communities following the COVID-19 pandemic. In this initiative, artists in 18 towns and cities are working with local public health and municipal partners to create large-scale participatory arts projects.</p><sec id="sec30"><label>4.1</label><title>Strengths, limitations, and recommendations for further research</title><p>One strength of this review is its breadth and inclusiveness. Integrative reviews allow for more breadth than systematic reviews or meta-analyses, contributing to development of theory and expansion of scientific thought where topics or questions are under-explored (<xref rid="ref65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>, <xref rid="ref66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>). Additionally, by extending from the formative historical work on social cohesion, this review provides a current perspective of its role in relation to community-based arts and community well-being. Despite growing interest in both the arts and social cohesion in relation to well-being, this is the first review to consider these three concepts together. Another strength of this review is its broad definition of arts participation, which allowed inclusion of some practices that previous definitions have excluded, such as circus arts. Additionally, the review supports growing current interest in how the arts can be used for health promotion and prevention (<xref rid="ref67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>). Lastly, the prevalence of mixed methods studies in this review provided both quantitative and qualitative perspectives.</p><p>This review had several limitations. Firstly, only studies published in English were included, limiting the potential breadth of understanding from communities of non-English speakers, notably indigenous communities from North America and elsewhere that hold deep knowledge and long-standing practice at the intersections of the arts and health. This review was also limited in its ability to describe the roles of race or ethnicity as a component in relationships between arts participation, social cohesion, and well-being due to inconsistent reporting of race in the included articles. Reporting guidelines for arts programs and interventions in public health would be helpful in such analyses in the future. Additionally, study populations primarily represented urban communities, limiting the applicability of findings to rural communities, and the scale of evidence included in this review does not provide enough evidence to guide replicability of programming, in general.</p><p>Future research should include broader representation of ethnic, cultural, and social arts programs and practices in rural communities to inform programming in communities outside of urban areas. Inclusion of articles in languages other than English would be helpful in capturing more cultural practices. In future reviews. Additionally, more quantitative methods and population studies may inform reliability and reproducibility of results, aiding in the confirmation of effects of arts-based practices on social cohesion and well-being. Further study of virtual communities should be considered as well, given that results related to the benefits of virtual communities to social cohesion and well-being were mixed in this review and given the rise in virtual communities since the pandemic. Future studies should also explicitly test the potential role of social cohesion as a mechanism for building both individual and collective well-being in communities. This study provides a framework for potential integration of various types of data, such as population, social and health data, that could be applied to future studies using pre-existing administrative data, such as health records, census data, and social services data.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec31"><label>5</label><title>Conclusion</title><p>Findings of this integrative review support previous assertions that arts participation may be a useful approach to enhancing social cohesion and well-being in communities. Notably, it identified dimensions that may offer new insight regarding the relationships between arts participation, social cohesion, and well-being. The review suggests that community-based arts participation, particularly when co-creation and/or cultural sharing are involved, can help build relationships, a sense of belonging to a community, and solidarity. This can lead to a greater commitment to the program and fellow participants, which in turn can lead to more regular participation in the program. This cycle of arts participation can build social cohesion and (potentially, in turn) enhance both individual and community well-being. Prospective studies are needed to investigate these relationships. The review also suggests that the social cohesion that is cultivated through arts participation may act as a mechanism for enhancing well-being. Further research is needed to explore this relationship. At a time when loneliness and social isolation are of paramount concern in the US and in other parts of the world, this review contributes to understand of how community-based arts participation may build social cohesion and, perhaps in turn, community well-being.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to acknowledge the contribution of University of Florida&#x02019;s Center for Arts in Medicine&#x02019;s Interdisciplinary Research Lab members, Jennifer Kuo, Caroline Wagner, Xander Boggs, Tessa Brinza, and Sohrob Farahbakhsh, as well as Mariana Occhiuzzi, Tyler Thomas, Michael Rohd, and Lear DeBessonet.</p></ack><sec sec-type="author-contributions" id="sec32"><title>Author contributions</title><p>JS: Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Project administration, Supervision, Writing &#x02013; original draft, Writing &#x02013; review &#x00026; editing, Data curation, Formal analysis, Methodology, Validation, Visualization.
