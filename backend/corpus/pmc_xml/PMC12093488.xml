According to the Commission Service on digital strategy for Europe, AI systems are software and hardware systems designed by humans that operate in digital and physical realms, gathering and interpreting data from their environment, to make decisions and take actions to achieve complex objectives (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Over the last two decades, an artificial intelligence technology has been increasingly utilised across the healthcare system to improve the quality of patients&#x02019; care and efficiency of medical resources and interventions (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Electronic health records (EHR) allow for constantly growing collection of routine data including clinical notes, radiological reports, radiological and vascular images, physiological and physical metrics, laboratory and histopathology results, and administrative data. There is also an abundance of data derived from large-scale genetic studies and consumer devices such as wearables and smart phones. In many cases traditional statistical approaches fail to parse such large data to provide meaningful results, whereas AI algorithms can effectively handle large datasets and derive information, identifying complex non-linear relationships (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Expeditious advancements in ML- and DL-based technologies could potentially be utilised in developing a more personalized therapeutic approach considering the patients&#x02019; general and clinical characteristics as well as a detailed characterization of the underlying cardio-vascular conditions.</p><p>The incorporation of digital technologies into health systems has transformed and rapidly increased in the last few years. It has been shown that incorporation of technologies such as remote monitoring, digital health applications, internet of things (IoT), and AI technologies during COVID-19 pandemic laid the groundwork for a more resilient and patient-centred healthcare system in the post-pandemic era (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Advancements in technology have expanded telemedicine capabilities with improved video and audio communication tools, remote monitoring devices, wearable devices, and health applications. These technologies enable remote diagnosis, monitoring, and managing various health conditions.</p><p>Constantly evolving AI technologies are utilised in disease identification, risk prediction and modelling, diagnosis, treatment planning, adverse events monitoring and follow up. Vascular surgery is not different in that respect. However, despite an increasing number of publications, there is a paucity of research exploring the source of information utilised to develop AI algorithms relevant to vascular surgery. To address this, we performed a scoping review that aimed to identify the source of input data utilised to develop AI algorithms with focus on NLP utilisation in vascular surgery. Our secondary goals include assessing application of AI algorithms across vascular surgery and identification of target audience of published results.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>Machine learning (ML) is based on probabilistic and statistical techniques forming complex systems that can iteratively learn from data (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Deep learning (DL), being a sub-field of ML, is a part of a wider family of artificial neural networks (ANN), defining an architecture that combines several processing layers to learn from data (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). There are generally three approaches that ML and DL can utilise: supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Natural language processing (NLP) refers to the machine's ability to identify, process, understand and/or generate information in written and spoken human communications (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). NLP applies computational techniques, that may include ML, or DL, or more basic statistical approaches to analyse speech and text and its tools have been used for information retrieval, classification, text extraction, text summarisation, question answering, and text generation utilising linguistics-focused or statistics-focused approaches, or a combination of these two (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). A more extensive explanation of the principles of ML, DL and NLP is included in Appendix 1.</p><p>Cardiovascular diseases (CVDS) are the leading cause of death globally.

Most articles were published after 2020 and focused primarily on aortic pathology, carotid disease, and peripheral arterial disease; venous disease, vascular access, and vascular trauma constituted less than 10% of all studies. Despite an abundance of textual data which was used in over 50% of published projects, only one in ten papers described development of NLP algorithms, indicating its underutilisation.</p><p>Healthcare leaped forward in quality and complexity during the past two decades, characterised by an exponentially increasing use of information technology, and the vast amounts of data that information technology entails. It was estimated in 2020 that new information generated for every human being per second was around 1.7 megabytes (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). It has been shown that researchers often do not take full advantage of the diversity of data available in the EHR and frequently model development will only use a handful of variables pre-emptively identified by investigators. This limitation in data usage may unduly limit the accuracy of predictive models, especially where complex non-linear interactions are involved (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). The textual data in medicine comprises a majority (80%) of information available for analysis (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). However, it is not effective in storing a quantifiable information. A well-designed NLP algorithm would be able to extract a large proportion of quantifiable data from a set of clinical notes without losing it context.</p><p>The volume of data and the velocity at which it is being generated exceeds the capabilities of traditional analytical tools. Novel analytical methods are dynamic and utilise advanced statistics, ML, DL, feedback, and NLP tools to mine through the data. These methods provide unparalleled capability in data exploration, analysis, and visualisation; they are robust and capable of seamlessly adapting models over time as new data comes in (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Rapidly growing medical databanks that include clinical, genomic, imaging, and registries data, will only continue to increase. Thus, the future of medicine is likely to be even more data dependent, with the increasing convergence of medicine and AI technology (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>).</p><p>The AI potential in healthcare has attracted significant attention from public and private sectors, amongst which Google Health has emerged as a major contributor to the development and deployment of AI-driven healthcare solutions, involving DL and NLP technologies (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). The growing demand for machines to handle complex language tasks, including translation, summarisation, information retrieval, and conversational interactions, has led to development of Large Language Models (LLMs; e.g., ChatGPT, MEDPalm 2) (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). They can be implemented in clinical, educational and research applications. However, since they still are lacking accuracy, they could be only deployed in assisting roles. Their adoption into medicine should be shaped by medical profession with careful clinical governance oversight pending further evaluation and fine tuning (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>).</p><p>The increasing utilisation of telemedicine and telehealth technologies in cardiology in the last decade has shown efficiency and efficacy in the management of cardiovascular diseases risk factors such as obesity, vascular risk management and hypertension (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). The implementation of telemedicine in management of patients with chronic heart failure reduced short-term risk of cardiovascular-related hospitalisation and mortality in patients receiving combined remote disease monitoring and consultation (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Digital health-based cardiac rehabilitation programs were shown to significantly reduce cardiovascular-related emergency department visits and unnecessary rehospitalization, however, further research is required to fully understand the clinical impact of digital health interventions (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). ML technologies, such as double machine learning (DML) have been utilised in target trial emulation (TTE), which is a powerful methodological bridge between traditional randomised control trials (RCTs) and observational studies. TTE applies the principles of RCTs to the observational studies in a structured approach. TTE, using DML to handle high-dimensional data, addresses RCTs limitations answering pressing clinical questions particularly in scenarios where conducting RCTs is impractical or ethically challenging (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>).</p><p>Given the context of increasing attention to clinical NLP applications in recent years, we demonstrated that vascular surgery underutilises NLP (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). The narrative data from medical records, clinical parameters, biological and genomic databases were used in 280 (82%) articles, whereas image-based source was utilised in 216 (63%) papers. Despite abundance of narrative data NLP technologies were only utilised in 34 papers (9&#x000b7;9%), whereas ML- and DL-based algorithms were employed in 115 (33&#x000b7;6%), and 193 (56&#x000b7;4%) articles.</p><p>There are few reasons that could explain that low utilisation of NLP in vascular surgery. Firstly, vascular surgery is an image-driven specialty; most of decisions including diagnosis, planning of treatment and follow-up are based on various forms of imaging. Secondly, the importance of narrative data is not appreciated in the vascular community. Utilisation of NLP technologies require labelled data for supervised models, availability of annotators with clinical expertise, and appropriate computational environments. It is technically challenging to meet the hardware and software requirements within existing healthcare IT ecosystems. Additionally, access to patient-level data is controlled by complex information governance regulations, impeding development of efficient NLP algorithms (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Despite increasing attention to clinical applications of NLP, the proportion of studies using text data in healthcare is low (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>).</p><p>NLP holds immense promise in clinical research, with its potential ability to automatically identify cases for clinical studies and trials, drawing from sources like radiology reports. This is particularly important for rare diseases and studies where clinical diagnosis is entered in clinical notes in uncoded manner, and when the precision of diagnostic test is high, but pick up rate is low. Leveraging AI-driven NLP for participant screening using EHR could substantially reduce trials costs and expedite delivery (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). This approach has been actively executed by pharmaceutical companies (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Literature on AI-based technologies in vascular surgery is dominated by machine learning and deep learning that utilise primarily imaging and structured data. Although NLP holds immense promise, it is underutilised. It is likely that the primary reason for this underutilisation is a deficiency in understanding of this technology among clinicians and lack of adequate expertise. Close collaboration between clinicians and data scientists is mandatory to unlock and utilise NLP in the clinical and research fields.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>Thanks to HDRUK Midlands Regional Community Project [QQ2] Contract ID 2401346 that paid publication fee.</p></ack><sec sec-type="author-contributions" id="s6"><title>Author contributions</title><p>KP: Conceptualization, Data curation, Methodology, Writing &#x02013; original draft, Writing &#x02013; review &#x00026; editing.
