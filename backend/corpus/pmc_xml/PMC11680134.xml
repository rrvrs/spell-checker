The persistently covert infection of MRV was previously observed in a natural outbreak of MRV, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here, we show that mandarin fish peripheral B lymphocytes are implemented as viral reservoirs to maintain the persistent infection. When mandarin fish were infected with a sublethal dosage of MRV under a nonpermissive temperature (19 &#x000b0;C) and a permissive temperature (26 &#x000b0;C), all of the fish in the 19 &#x000b0;C group survived and entered the persistent phase of infection, characterized by a very low viral load in white blood cells, whereas some of the fish died of MRV infection in the 26 &#x000b0;C group, and the survival fish then initiated a persistent infection status. Raising the temperature, vaccination and dexamethasone treatment can reactivate the quiescent MRV to replicate and result in partial mortality. The viral reservoir investigation showed that IgM<sup>+</sup>-labeled B lymphocytes, but not CD3&#x00394;<sup>+</sup>-labeled T lymphocytes and MRC-1<sup>+</sup>-labeled macrophages, are target cells for the persistent infection of MRV. Moreover, the reactivation of the quiescent MRV was confirmed through a non-TLR5 signal pathway manner. Collectively, we demonstrate the presence of the B cell-dependent persistent infection of ranavirus, and provide a new clue for better understanding the complex infection mechanism of vertebrate iridovirus.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>mandarin fish ranavirus (MRV)</kwd><kwd>persistent infection</kwd><kwd>B lymphocytes</kwd><kwd>reactivation</kwd><kwd>TLR</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation</funding-source><award-id>2023A1515010009</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>key areas R&#x00026;D Program of Guangdong Province</funding-source><award-id>2021B0202040002</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>Innovation Group Project of Southern Marine Science and Engineering Guangdong Laboratory (Zhuhai)</funding-source><award-id>311021006</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>Guangdong Provincial Special Fund for MAITIT</funding-source><award-id>2019KJ141</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>This work was funded by Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation under No. 2023A1515010009; the key areas R&#x00026;D Program of Guangdong Province under No. 2021B0202040002; the Innovation Group Project of Southern Marine Science and Engineering Guangdong Laboratory (Zhuhai) under No. 311021006; the Guangdong Provincial Special Fund for MAITIT [Grant Number 2019KJ141].</funding-statement></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-viruses-16-01895"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Iridovirus is a large viral family with a linear double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), genome sizes ranging from 99 kb to 220 kb and encoding open reading frames (ORFs) ranging from 98 to 221 [<xref rid="B1-viruses-16-01895" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-viruses-16-01895" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-viruses-16-01895" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-viruses-16-01895" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The <italic toggle="yes">Iridoviridae</italic> family can be divided into two subfamilies, namely, <italic toggle="yes">Alphairidovirinae</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Betairidovirinae,</italic> which are also referred to as vertebrate iridovirus (VI) and invertebrate iridovirus (IVI), respectively [<xref rid="B2-viruses-16-01895" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Among <italic toggle="yes">Alphairidovirinae</italic>, the <italic toggle="yes">Ranavirus</italic> genus has the most abundant members, with great diversity in the genome content, the most diverse array of hosts, including bony fish, reptiles and amphibians, and a very complex pathogenesis [<xref rid="B5-viruses-16-01895" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-viruses-16-01895" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-viruses-16-01895" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Ranavirus-associated viral diseases have caused considerable economic losses and ecological disasters worldwide due to their high contagiousness and lethality to various economically valuable bony fish species [<xref rid="B6-viruses-16-01895" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-viruses-16-01895" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-viruses-16-01895" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>Mandarin fish ranavirus (MRV), also known as a variant of largemouth bass virus (LMBV) in the Santee&#x02013;Cooper ranavirus (SCRaV) species of the genus <italic toggle="yes">Ranavirus</italic>, has emerged as an important pathogenic threat to several bony fish species. The known sensitive natural hosts of MRV/LMBV include largemouth bass (<italic toggle="yes">Micropterus salmoides</italic>) [<xref rid="B9-viruses-16-01895" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-viruses-16-01895" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], koi carp (<italic toggle="yes">Cyprinus carpio</italic>) [<xref rid="B11-viruses-16-01895" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], barcoo grunter (<italic toggle="yes">Scortum barcoo</italic>) [<xref rid="B12-viruses-16-01895" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], two tropical ornamental fish, Doctor fish (<italic toggle="yes">Labroides dimidatus</italic>) and Guppy (<italic toggle="yes">Poecilia reticulata</italic>) [<xref rid="B13-viruses-16-01895" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], as well as mandarin fish (<italic toggle="yes">Siniperca chuatsi</italic>) [<xref rid="B3-viruses-16-01895" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B14-viruses-16-01895" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-viruses-16-01895" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In mandarin fish, MRV infection generally manifests in the following two distinctive clinical phenotypes: acute and chronic [<xref rid="B4-viruses-16-01895" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B14-viruses-16-01895" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-viruses-16-01895" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. During acute infection, morbidity generally occurs at 2&#x02013;4 days post-infection, and is characterized by vomiting and then severe ascites syndrome [<xref rid="B15-viruses-16-01895" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Subsequently, mass mortalities ensue within 3&#x02013;10 days, with an accumulative mortality of &#x0003e;50% [<xref rid="B14-viruses-16-01895" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-viruses-16-01895" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The tropism tissues during acute infection include the pyloric caecum, spleens, kidneys, livers and intestines [<xref rid="B4-viruses-16-01895" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B14-viruses-16-01895" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In contrast, the chronic phase of infection is characterized by lethargy, anorexia, abnormal swimming and impaired coordination, and can persist for up to 5 months [<xref rid="B14-viruses-16-01895" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. During chronic infection, most of the surviving fish become emaciated and deformed due to long-term anorexia or abnormal feeding, and then lose their breeding value. Especially during chronic infection, very low numbers of copies of viral genomic DNA were detected using real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR), but not by conventional PCR, using the visceral organs such as the spleen, liver and kidney. We previously designated this long-lasting, undetectable status of the MRV carrier by using conventional PCR detection as the recessive carrier [<xref rid="B14-viruses-16-01895" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], and we currently designate it as a persistently covert infection (PCI). During MRV-PCI, sporadic death, but not mass mortality, are the major events.</p><p>Prior to the emerging MRV, infectious spleen and kidney necrosis virus (ISKNV), the type species in the genus <italic toggle="yes">Megalocytivirus of Alphairidovirinae</italic>, has been considered as the first important pathogenic threat to the mandarin fish industry [<xref rid="B16-viruses-16-01895" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Until recently, an inactivated ISKNV vaccine with an absolute protection effect of &#x0003e;90% was developed and officially licensed for a commercial application in mainland China [<xref rid="B14-viruses-16-01895" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B17-viruses-16-01895" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The inactivated ISKNV vaccine also showed the same high efficacy in Asia seabass <italic toggle="yes">Lates calcarifer</italic> and spotted seabass <italic toggle="yes">L. maculatus</italic> against various genotypes of ISKNV/RSIV isolates in ISKNV species [<xref rid="B18-viruses-16-01895" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-viruses-16-01895" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Unexpectedly, we attempted to develop an effective MFF-1 cell-based MRV vaccine, conducted with the same rational technology routine as that of the inactivated ISKNV vaccine, but failed. Almost no protection was achieved by the inactivated MRV vaccine, regardless of the MRV antigen dosage (unpublished data by Dong&#x02019;s lab). Generally, ISKNV/RSIV is proposed to be a transient pathogen. As a result, either the inactivated vaccine or non-lethal active virus exposure could elicit robust immune protection against infection or re-infection with virulent ISKNV/RSIV [<xref rid="B17-viruses-16-01895" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B20-viruses-16-01895" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-viruses-16-01895" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-viruses-16-01895" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Conversely, MRV displays the characteristics of persistent infection. As an opposite result, the inactivated MRV vaccine confers no protection. Additionally, the non-lethal active MRV exposure could cause long-term MRV-PCI [<xref rid="B14-viruses-16-01895" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>White blood cells (WBCs), which have a pivotal role in the immune system, serve as dormant or latent carriers of numerous viruses. For instance, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) specifically targets T cells as its latent host cells, while the human T cell leukemia virus (HTLV) can establish residence in both B and T cells [<xref rid="B23-viruses-16-01895" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24-viruses-16-01895" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Similarly, the herpesvirus can conceal itself within B lymphocytes in both humans and animals [<xref rid="B25-viruses-16-01895" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-viruses-16-01895" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27-viruses-16-01895" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28-viruses-16-01895" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B29-viruses-16-01895" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. These viruses strategically target the immune system for infection and latency, enabling them to elude immune clearance and persist within the host for extended periods. Studies have underscored the significance of macrophages (M<sub>&#x000d8;</sub>) as persistent hosts for amphibian ranaviruses [<xref rid="B30-viruses-16-01895" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B31-viruses-16-01895" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B32-viruses-16-01895" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B33-viruses-16-01895" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].

As a result, the injection by i.p. of inactivated <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> and flagellin both led to a sharp upregulation expression of TLR5M transcriptions in the WBCs at 1 and 3 dpi (<xref rid="viruses-16-01895-f007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>A,D). However, no increase in the MRV genome DNA copy and no upregulation expression of the MCP RNA were determined (<xref rid="viruses-16-01895-f007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>B&#x02013;F), indicating that <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> and flagellate stimulation initiated the TLR5 pathway, as expected; however, the active TLR5 was not linked to the reactivation of covert MRV.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec4-viruses-16-01895"><title>4. Discussion</title><p>The natural persistent infection of MRV has been investigated and characterized in our previous report [<xref rid="B14-viruses-16-01895" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The core points of persistent MRV infection include the following: (a) it is a long-term chronic infection with a disease duration of up to 5 months, almost covering the entire breeding cycle of commercial mandarin fish; (b) during persistent infection, the MRV load in various visceral organs is too low to be detected by conventional PCR; (c) the featured clinical signs include lethargy, anorexia and body emaciation and deformity, accompanied with sporadic mortality. Furthermore, our recent study showed that the w/o formulation of the inactivated MRV vaccine conferred no protection against the parental virus challenge, which was also confirmed by several other research teams. Thus, the underlying mechanism of persistently covert infection and the ineffectiveness of inactivated vaccines have become the major issues currently troubling the understanding of MRV.</p><p>For cold-blooded animals, many habitat characteristics such as the water chemistry, soil type, ambient temperature, hydroperiod, UV-B as well as population density can affect the onset of viral diseases [<xref rid="B7-viruses-16-01895" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In the artificial challenge of ISKNV, a water temperature of 20 &#x000b0;C was experimentally evidenced as the threshold temperature [<xref rid="B43-viruses-16-01895" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Over 20 &#x000b0;C, the ISKNV was shown to be highly lethal to mandarin fish regardless of the various infection routines, including the administration by i.p. or intramuscular (i.m.) injection and cohabitation infection manner; however, ISKNV never showed lethality to mandarin fish when the experimental temperature was below 20 &#x000b0;C. In this study, our data showed that 19 &#x000b0;C was also a nonpermissive temperature for the onset of MRV disease, whereas 26 &#x000b0;C was a permissive temperature for MRV outbreak. Under a sublethal dosage of MRV challenge, no fish died (0/20) in the 19 &#x000b0;C group, but 46.7% (7/15) of the fish died of MRV infection, accompanied with ascites symptoms, within 5 dpi in the 26 &#x000b0;C group. The MRV could be easily detected through the colloidal gold-immunochromatographic fast-detection strip, conventional PCR as well as MFF-1-based virus isolation. At 30 dpi, the average viral loads in the WBCs of the 20 mandarin fish reared at 19 &#x000b0;C was 18.5 &#x000b1; 9.7 GEs per mg DNA, whereas it was 33.9 &#x000b1; 20.7 GEs per mg DNA from the 8 survival mandarin fish reared at 26 &#x000b0;C. Since no additional mortality occurred and the viral load in the blood was too low to be detected by conventional PCR and the colloidal gold-immunochromatographic fast-detection strip, it is proposed that all of these fish entered the covert infection phase. Furthermore, the result also suggested that MRV infection under the nonpermissive temperature of 19 &#x000b0;C could spontaneously result in the entry into the persistently covert infection status. By contrast, under the permissive temperature of 26 &#x000b0;C, the infection with a sublethal dosage of MRV could result in partial mortality, and the survival fish could then be transited into the persistent state.</p><p>During the gradual raising of the temperature, five fish died and three of them were measured with high viral loads. The absolute qPCR showed that the average viral load (N = 15) in the WBCs from the survival fish was 139 &#x000b1; 165 GEs/mg DNA, which is much higher than that (18.5 &#x000b1; 9.7 GEs per mg DNA) from the fish (N = 20) before the temperature stress. The result again indicated that raising the temperature stress could reactivate covert MRV to replicate and result in a fatal outcome, and then the survival fish once again entered into the persistent state of infection. After two rounds of drawing blood, and following another 7 days of stabilization, the surviving fish were divided into two groups and treated with DXMS and heat-killed <italic toggle="yes">E. coil</italic>, respectively. As a result, mortality was observed in the DXMS-treated group but not in the heat-killed <italic toggle="yes">E. coil</italic>-treated group. Both the viral load determinations and the IHC analysis demonstrated that DXMS functions as an effective inducer to trigger the reactivation of persistent MRV, which were confirmed by two independent repeated experiments in this study. DXMS, a classic glucocorticoid immunosuppressant, was commonly used in the reactivation of various viruses with persistent or latent characteristics [<xref rid="B44-viruses-16-01895" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="B45-viruses-16-01895" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="B46-viruses-16-01895" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. For instance, cyprinid herpesvirus 2 (CyHV-2), a highly contagious pathogen of goldfish (<italic toggle="yes">Carassius auratus</italic>) and Prussian carp (<italic toggle="yes">Carassius auratus gibelio</italic>), establishes persistent infection in goldfish monocytes/M<sub>&#x000d8;</sub>. DXMS could induce the persistent CyHV-2 to replicate via effectively suppressing monocyte/M<sub>&#x000d8;</sub> function and antibody production [<xref rid="B44-viruses-16-01895" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The mechanism of the DXMS-induced reactivation of covert MRV remained unclear and will be investigated in the future.</p><p>A previous study showed that vaccination with the w/o formulation of the inactivated ISKNV vaccine could induce the mass mortality of mandarin fish with covert MRV [<xref rid="B14-viruses-16-01895" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. This study showed that the w/o formulation of the inactivated MRV vaccine also induced a similar outcome for covert MRV. It was proposed that, on the one hand, the white oil component played an adjuvant role in the w/o formulation of the emulsified vaccine, and, on the other hand, the obvious side effect of the w/o formulation of the vaccine is the induced local fibroperitonitis [<xref rid="B47-viruses-16-01895" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="B48-viruses-16-01895" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The induced peritonitis might trigger the reactivation of covert MRV. Generally, this study once again demonstrates the presence of a persistently covert infection of MRV in mandarin fish under laboratory conditions. Furthermore, the covert MRV can be triggered reactivation through various pathways, encompassing temperature stress, vaccination and the stimulation of the immunosuppressive agent DXMS.</p><p>Numerous epidemiological investigations and clinical data suggest that ranavirus has the capability to establish asymptomatic infections and reactivation under specific conditions [<xref rid="B7-viruses-16-01895" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B32-viruses-16-01895" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B36-viruses-16-01895" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="B37-viruses-16-01895" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]; however, the exact persistent infection has only been validated in FV3. In the case of FV3, the peritoneal M<sub>&#x000d8;</sub> was confirmed as the major reservoir for quiescent FV3, and the quiescent FV3 can be reactivated by <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> flagella-mediated TLR5 signal pathway [<xref rid="B36-viruses-16-01895" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="B38-viruses-16-01895" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In mammalian systems, human herpes simplex virus (HSV) establishes latency in ganglia, reactivating under reduced body resistance or various stress-induced host immune states [<xref rid="B25-viruses-16-01895" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Similarly, bovine herpesvirus 1 (BoHV-1) achieves latency in the spleen, tonsils and groin lymph nodes, reactivating after various stress stimulations [<xref rid="B45-viruses-16-01895" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], while &#x003b3;-herpesviruses, including human Epstein&#x02013;Barr virus (EBV) and murine &#x003b3;-herpesvirus 68 (MHV-68), establish latent infection in B lymphocytes [<xref rid="B49-viruses-16-01895" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. In fish, CyHV3/KHV establishes latency in the B lymphocytes of koi carp, reactivating in response to temperature stimulation and physical stress [<xref rid="B26-viruses-16-01895" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B50-viruses-16-01895" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], whereas CyHV2/GFHNV establishes persistent infection in goldfish monocytes/M<sub>&#x000d8;</sub> and could be reactivated by DXMS treatment [<xref rid="B44-viruses-16-01895" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. In this study, we employed specific antibodies against MRC1 to isolate M<sub>&#x000d8;</sub> and purified the T cells and B cells by using specific antibodies against CD3 and IgM. MRC1, a pattern-recognition receptor, serves as a marker for M<sub>&#x000d8;</sub> and has been identified in various fish species [<xref rid="B51-viruses-16-01895" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="B52-viruses-16-01895" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. CD3, exclusive to T cells, is composed of six peptide chains, and participates in T cell antigen recognition and signal transduction [<xref rid="B53-viruses-16-01895" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. IgM, the principal component of fish immunoglobulins produced by B cells, functions as an antigen receptor on B lymphocytes. To determine the identity of the selected IgM<sup>+</sup> cells, the antibody specific to the B cell transcription factor Pax5 was also used in our study. Pax5 is a major regulator of B cell development and has been identified in both mammalian and non-mammalian species [<xref rid="B54-viruses-16-01895" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="B55-viruses-16-01895" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Pax5 is mainly expressed in vertebrate B cell lineages [<xref rid="B56-viruses-16-01895" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], including bony fish species such as rainbow trout, puffer fish and zebrafish [<xref rid="B57-viruses-16-01895" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>,<xref rid="B58-viruses-16-01895" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>,<xref rid="B59-viruses-16-01895" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Furthermore, using these anti-mandarin fish marker antibodies, B cells, T cells and M<sub>&#x000d8;</sub> were well isolated and purified from the WBCs. The qPCR showed that the MRV genomic DNA load in the IgM<sup>+</sup> B cells was 40-fold higher than that in the IgM<sup>&#x02212;</sup> WBCs after isolation. By contrast, the MRV genomic loads in the purified CD3<sup>+</sup> T cells and MRC1<sup>+</sup> M<sub>&#x000d8;</sub> were much lower than those in the MRV-PCI WBCs. All of these results clearly showed that peripheral IgM<sup>+</sup> B lymphocytes, but not CD3<sup>+</sup> T cells and MRC1<sup>+</sup> M<sub>&#x000d8;</sub>, act as the primary target cells for the covert infection of MRV.</p><p>To assess the possible TLR signals involving the reactivation of covert MRV, 16 mandarin fish TLR molecules were screened. Under the DXMS treatment, the covert MRV was reactivated, as expected, with the slight upregulation expression of 15 of the 16 TLR genes. Meanwhile, when the MRV-PCI mandarin fish were injected with heat-killed <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> or flagella, the TLR5 signal was significantly activated, as expected; however, the covert MRV was not reactivated. All of these results suggest that the reactivation of covert MRV occurs in a non-TLR5 manner, which is different from that of persistent FV3 [<xref rid="B38-viruses-16-01895" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The dissimilarity in their activation pathways may be attributed to their distinct taxonomic status and host preferences, despite both belonging to the <italic toggle="yes">Ranavirus</italic> genus within the <italic toggle="yes">Iridoviridae</italic> family. Specifically, ranaviruses can be classified into seven species, among which, FV3 in the ALRV subclass, primarily infecting amphibians and reptiles, and MRV in the SCRaV species and members in the GIV (grouper iridovirus) species only infect bony fish [<xref rid="B5-viruses-16-01895" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. At the genomic level, the ALRV subclass genome is approximately 105 kb [<xref rid="B1-viruses-16-01895" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B60-viruses-16-01895" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>], the GIV genome is about 140 kb [<xref rid="B61-viruses-16-01895" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>] while, by contrast, the MRV genome is only about 99 kb [<xref rid="B3-viruses-16-01895" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-viruses-16-01895" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Notably, the homology of the MCP between MRV and other ALRV members is less than 84%. The genomic differences may contribute to the heterogeneity observed in fish ranavirus infections compared to that of amphibian ranavirus [<xref rid="B3-viruses-16-01895" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>It is worth noting that the pre-exposure to virulent megalocytiviral ISKNV/RSIV in nonpermissive temperatures could elicit robust protective immunity against the re-challenges with parental viruses in permissive temperatures; thus, so-called live ISKNV/RSIV vaccines were developed on the basis of temperature regulation [<xref rid="B22-viruses-16-01895" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B62-viruses-16-01895" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. As for MRV, the low number of copies of the MRV genome DNA in the nonpermissive temperature of 19 &#x000b0;C maintained for at least 30 days. Even if a mild warming stimulation was applied, a partial mortality outcome occurred, and the survival retransformed into a persistent status. Finally, the covert MRV could once again be reactivated by the DXMS treatment. Obviously, the exposure to virulent live MRV under a nonpermissive temperature could not induce enough immune clearance, which is highly consistent with the field observation. In production practice, the surviving fishes from the ISKNV epidemic would usually never experience a recurrence of ISKNV infection; however, for MRV, after a primary infection, the surviving fishes were transformed into a chronic infection state, which could last for at least 5 months [<xref rid="B14-viruses-16-01895" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Whether the B cell targeting of persistent infection is a key factor affecting the activation of the immune clearance is worthy of further investigation. Specifically, in contrast to the highly effective inactivated ISKNV vaccine, robust experimental evidence shows that the w/o formulation of the inactivated MRV vaccine confers almost no protection against the challenge with virulent MRV regardless of the antigen dosage. Whether the ineffectiveness of inactivated vaccines is associated with the persistent targeting of MRV-specific B cells and its potential mechanisms will be an important topic in the study of its pathogenesis and the vaccine prevention of MRV.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec5-viruses-16-01895"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>In vertebrate iridovirus, FV3, the type species of genus <italic toggle="yes">Ranavirus</italic>, was evidenced to establish persistent infection by using <italic toggle="yes">Xenopus</italic> peritoneal M<sub>&#x000d8;</sub> as reservoirs. MRV is a very distinctive ranavirus from FV3 with very different genomic content and host species. Here, we uncovered that MRV establishes persistent and covert infection by using peripheral B lymphocytes as virus reservoirs. During persistent infection, very low numbers of copies of quiescent MRV were harbored in peripheral B lymphocytes. Water temperature stress, vaccination stimulation and DXMS treatment can reactivate the quiescent MRV to replicate in abundance via a non-TLR5-mediated manner, and results in the recurrence of MRV disease. Our finding suggests the diversity and complexity of the pathogenic mechanisms among ranaviruses, and also has important scientific significance for the in-depth understanding of the infection and immunity interaction of vertebrate iridoviruses, especially ranavirus.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclaimer/Publisher&#x02019;s Note:</bold> The statements, opinions and data contained in all publications are solely those of the individual author(s) and contributor(s) and not of MDPI and/or the editor(s).
