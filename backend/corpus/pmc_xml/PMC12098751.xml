The model is then capable of undergoing analysis by a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software package.

The Ubuntu version of the Linux operating system does not have a monetary cost and can be installed on most consumer and laboratory computer hardware.</p><p>Literature review</p><p>We conducted a&#x000a0;literature search relating to CFD of the ascending aorta using MEDLINE, Embase, and Google Scholar using the keywords "computational fluid dynamics" AND "ascending aorta".&#x000a0;Several papers relating to CFD studies of the aorta, especially from CT images, were identified from peer-reviewed literature.&#x000a0;We also located a master's thesis involving the use of OpenFOAM (OpenFOAM Foundation, London, UK) in a sample of three aortas [<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].&#x000a0;Only one of these was derived from actual CT data, whereas the other two were simplified models for the purposes of developing the initial and boundary conditions.&#x000a0;A doctorate thesis [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] involving eight healthy patients with Marfan syndrome was also identified; however, it utilised the proprietary Alya&#x000a0;software package (Barcelona Supercomputing Center, Barcelona, Spain).&#x000a0;Kimura and colleagues modelled 12 CT-derived bicuspid aortic valves and three controls, with boundary conditions and validation determined by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) [<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].&#x000a0;This was the largest study seen in our literature review.&#x000a0;Other smaller studies were identified which only analysed the aortas of small patient numbers [<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>-<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]&#x000a0;or the aorta outside of the ascending region [<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>-<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Cardiac-gated CT image acquisition (proprietary scanning hardware and software)</p><p>Although imaging equipment may internally store data in vendor-specific proprietary manners, the distribution of imaging usually conforms to the Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) format.&#x000a0;This standard is specified by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO 12052) [<xref rid="REF14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].&#x000a0;It includes metadata, a series of information including patient details and demographics, details of the study, and details of the center undertaking the study.</p><p>We use the IMPAX (version 6.7.0.6011, AGFA Healthcare, Mortsel, Belgium, 2020) viewer to retrieve industry-standard DICOM files from our institution's radiology department's DICOM server.&#x000a0;CT images were derived from multiple hospital and private radiology practice scanners.</p><p>Examination and deidentification (Horos)</p><p>CFD analysis requires good-quality DICOM images.&#x000a0;The Horos software package&#x000a0;is ideal to assess the suitability of imaging. Identifying metadata can be stripped from the image for purposes of confidentiality if required.</p><p>Ideal images must be acquired as arterial phase contrast-enhanced images acquired with electrocardiogram (ECG) gating in diastole from the root of the neck to at least the diaphragm, should have a slice size of 0.625 mm or smaller (though 0.5 mm is preferred), and should have minimal contrast in the venous structures (especially the brachiocephalic vein).&#x000a0;There should be no stair-step artefact or aortic dissection.&#x000a0;</p><p>Segmentation and mesh generation (Image Tool Kit-SNAP (ITK-SNAP))</p><p>DICOM folders from the previous step are next loaded into ITK-SNAP&#x000a0;(version 4.2.2, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA, 2024). Semi-automatic segmentation is carried out in "active segmentation mode".&#x000a0;Firstly, a region of interest (ROI) is specified in all three spatial dimensions, including the entire thoracic aorta and proximal portions of the arch vessels.&#x000a0;</p><p>A rough mask is created by specifying a range of Hounsfield units&#x000a0;(HU, a measure of radiodensity on CT imaging) that maximises the inclusion of the aorta, but minimises other structures such as vertebral bodies and venous structures, especially the brachiocephalic vein (Figure <xref rid="FIG2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Typical lower thresholds are around 300 HU and&#x000a0;upper thresholds around 900 HU; however, these thresholds vary depending on contrast density within the aorta and the presence of contrast within other vascular structures.</p><fig position="anchor" fig-type="figure" id="FIG2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Selecting bounds in ITK-SNAP to include the entire aorta, selecting HU thresholds (note that the aorta is depicted as white), and placing bubbles in multiple planes.</title><p>ITK-SNAP:&#x000a0;Image Tool Kit-SNAP;&#x000a0;HU:&#x000a0;Hounsfield units</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="cureus-0017-00000084523-i02" position="float"/></fig><p>The resulting mask&#x000a0;is then manually "seeded" with "bubbles".&#x000a0;These are placed at multiple levels within the lumen of the aorta, with the size of the bubble selected individually by the eye.&#x000a0;The semi-automatic segmentation process then "evolves" these bubbles, filling adjacent areas of similar HU values [<xref rid="REF15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].&#x000a0;A higher number of bubbles, sized to most closely fit the aortic lumen, improves the efficiency and accuracy of the segmentation process and reduces spillover into adjacent structures of similar HU density, such as vertebral bodies, contrast-filled vessels, and the left atrium. The expansion is manually ceased when the entirety of the aortic lumen has been filled and manually scrutinised for accuracy to minimise the degree of subjectivity in this approach (Figure <xref rid="FIG3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).</p><fig position="anchor" fig-type="figure" id="FIG3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>ITK-SNAP following active segment contouring process.&#x000a0;The aorta has been segmented after the bubbles have expanded to fill the areas of similar HU (where contrast is present) and retracted from the areas of high contrast. The segmented aorta can be closely examined for accuracy at this stage.</title><p>ITK-SNAP:&#x000a0;Image Tool Kit-SNAP;&#x000a0;HU:&#x000a0;Hounsfield units</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="cureus-0017-00000084523-i03" position="float"/></fig><p>At the conclusion of the segmentation process, the outer bounds of the aortic lumen are represented by a series, or mesh, of triangular planes which share common edges.&#x000a0;The mesh represents the real-life outer boundaries of where blood mixed with contrast (high HU value) interfaces with the intima of the aorta (lower HU value).&#x000a0;The resulting mesh is exported from ITK-SNAP as a stereolithography (STL) file.</p><p>ITK-SNAP stores the location of key features of the mesh in millimetres, whereas OpenFOAM requires that STL files represent the location of these features in metres.&#x000a0;An OpenFOAM function called <italic>surfaceTransformPoints</italic> is run within a terminal, having selected the folder containing the STL file as the working directory. The following command is run in the following terminal: surfaceTransformPoints -scale '(0.001 0.001 0.001)' filename1.stl filename2.stl.</p><p>This function multiplies the position of each feature of the STL file named &#x02018;<italic>filename1.stl</italic>&#x02019; by 0.001, the scale factor for millimetres to metres.&#x000a0;The output is then saved into the file &#x02018;<italic>filename2.stl</italic>&#x02019;.&#x000a0;</p><p>Generation of working STL file (Blender)</p><p>The resulting STL is imported into Blender (version 4.4.3, Blender Foundation, Amsterdam, Netherlands, <ext-link xlink:href="https://www.blender.org" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.blender.org</ext-link>, 2025).&#x000a0;Several unnecessary default objects are created, namely, "Camera", "Cube", and "Light". A short script called <italic>FirstDeleteThese.py</italic> is run within the "Scripting" tab of Blender to automatically delete these items (available in the GitHub repository).</p><p>The mesh of the aorta can then be selected, and the selection inverted, capturing any artefactual points not in continuity with the aortic mesh.&#x000a0;These are deleted, leaving only the mesh.&#x000a0;Any other artefacts can then be selected and deleted.&#x000a0;For simplification, we also delete the coronary and intercostal arteries, as well as calcification between the left ventricular outflow tract and aortic root.&#x000a0;This results in a non-manifold mesh (an object which is not "bound" or "watertight")&#x000a0;which is incompatible with CFD software and will be corrected in a subsequent step.</p><p>The CFD analysis requires the location of a point which is specified as either inside or outside the mesh, which defines the domain to be simulated. Since this is an internal flow simulation of blood within the aorta, a fluid domain is identified located inside the closed mesh geometry. The mesh is moved until the aortic root overlies the origin (the point located at Cartesian coordinates (0,0,0)) (Figure <xref rid="FIG4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). This allows a preconfigured OpenFOAM setup without having to customise the specified position of the aorta in each case.</p><fig position="anchor" fig-type="figure" id="FIG4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>The mesh, having been processed to remove all artefact including coronary arteries and intercostal arteries, is placed in a location where the Origin (0,0,0) is bound within. The mesh is rotated until the positive Z-axis (blue, facing superiorly from an anatomical perspective) is in the simulated direction of blood flow, at 90&#x000b0; to the virtual basal ring, passing through the center of the sinotubular junction.</title><p>LSCA: left subclavian artery;&#x000a0;BCA:&#x000a0;brachiocephalic artery;&#x000a0;LCCA:&#x000a0;left common carotid artery</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="cureus-0017-00000084523-i04" position="float"/></fig><p>The OpenFOAM software package (version 12, 2024) will numerically simulate fluid flow along a defined vector, originating from a smaller area of the mesh known as an inlet patch. The inlet patch specifies flow parameters (e.g., velocity, pressure) for the simulation, and the mesh must clearly define the fluid domain to distinguish between interior and exterior regions, especially important in internal flow scenarios like aortic blood flow. This requires an assumption of initial blood flow direction.&#x000a0;We approximate this to be orthogonal to the plane of the virtual basal ring and parallel with the middle portion of the tubular ascending aorta.&#x000a0;The mesh is rotated until the positive Z-axis (the blue axis in Figure <xref rid="FIG4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>) is in this direction. Standardising the initial blood flow to the positive Z-axis also allows for the reuse of OpenFOAM configuration and code with little alteration between cases.</p><p>Mesh smoothing and ensuring manifold surface (MeshLab)</p><p>OpenFOAM requires that a mesh be manifold prior to being used.&#x000a0;A further STL file is exported from Blender and imported into MeshLab (version 2023.12; Istituto di Scienza e Tecnologie dell'Informazione-Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (ISTI-CNR), Pisa, Italy, 2023). A screened Poisson surface reconstruction is used, with the following default parameters: reconstruction depth = 8, interpolation weight = 4, minimum number of samples = 1.5, scale factor = 1.1, solver divide = 8, iso divide = 8, and smoothing iterations = 5&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].&#x000a0;This ensures that the mesh is manifold and smooths out the model. A non-manifold mesh will result in an error when OpenFOAM is run; however, in our experience, the screened Poisson surface reconstruction was reliable in producing a manifold mesh. This function may correct for slight stair-step artefact and/or imperfections in the cardiac gating process (Figure <xref rid="FIG5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>).</p><fig position="anchor" fig-type="figure" id="FIG5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>The effect of the screened Poisson surface reconstruction as before and after: the mesh in panel A has considerable surface artefact and is non-manifold (visibly discontinuous at the aortic inlet, on the brachiocephalic and left common carotid arteries, and on the descending aorta at the site of an intercostal artery). The mesh in panel B has been smoothed and no longer has these discontinuities following scaled Poisson surface reconstruction. This mesh can be divided into inlet and outlet patches for processing in OpenFOAM.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="cureus-0017-00000084523-i05" position="float"/></fig><p>An STL file containing the improved mesh is then exported from MeshLab. This file is then imported back into the Blender file for the case.</p><p>Generation of inlet/outlet patches (Blender)</p><p>Prior to CFD analysis, the mesh must be divided into inlet, outlet, and wall regions.&#x000a0;The inlet mesh in our work is set at the level of the virtual basal ring.&#x000a0;The primary outlet mesh is created at the descending thoracic aorta, and other minor outlet meshes are created at the extremes of the brachiocephalic artery (BCA), left common carotid artery (LCCA), and left subclavian artery (LSCA). Attention is paid to selecting the site where the vessel was "cut off" during segmentation, which corresponds to a flat plane at approximately 90 degrees to blood flow in most cases. The rheological effects of the aortic valve, coronary and thyroid ima arteries, and intercostal arteries are not considered [<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>-<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], consistent with other models [<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>-<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].&#x000a0;</p><p>Blender is used for the creation of inlet and outlet meshes.&#x000a0;A circle selection tool can capture points at the inlet and outlet meshes, and these are split into a new mesh.&#x000a0;The remaining mesh represents the wall of the aorta. As shown in Figure <xref rid="FIG6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>, these separate meshes are named in a standardised fashion: <italic>AortaWall</italic>, <italic>AortaInlet</italic>, <italic>AortaOutlet</italic>, <italic>BCA</italic>, <italic>LCCA</italic>, and <italic>LSCA</italic>.&#x000a0;These are arbitrary designations we have created to standardise our mesh naming and to improve the reuse of our scripts and OpenFOAM functions across cases. To simplify the exporting process of this list of STL files, we wrote a Python script, ExportSTL.py, which can also be found in the GitHub repository. This script is run within the "Scripting" tab of Blender and exports the individual wall, inlet, and outlet meshes to a folder specified in the script, under the filename convention <italic>AortaWall.stl</italic>, <italic>AortaInlet.stl</italic>, <italic>AortaOutlet.stl</italic>, <italic>BCA.stl</italic>, <italic>LCCA.stl</italic>, and <italic>LSCA.stl</italic>.

They typically require specialised solvers (e.g., pimpleDyMFoam, dynamicMeshDict setup) and mesh motion or morphing strategies (e.g., arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE), sliding interfaces, or overset meshes). This will likely remain a drawback of CFD in cardiovascular modelling for the foreseeable future.</p><p>Our model uses standard values of initial blood flow conditions, similar to experimental data from other authors [<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].&#x000a0;We approximate the direction of the vector of blood flow across the aortic valve, using a simplified model where the direction of blood flow is simulated in the direction of the positive Z-axis: the positive Z-axis is typically aligned normal to the inlet (positioned at the virtual basal ring), defining the direction in which the flow enters the domain. This is common in cases where the flow is assumed to be entering from a boundary at a fixed angle (usually perpendicular to the inlet surface).&#x000a0;Gravity is not considered as a force acting on the blood; however, it is negligible relative to pressure-driven flows in models such as this.&#x000a0;Others [<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]&#x000a0;have used superimposed datasets from 4D MRI, albeit with a far higher cost and complexity.&#x000a0;Swanson and colleagues [<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] used Doppler ultrasound in a series of three paediatric patients with aortic coarctation to measure blood velocities, and this is a good solution which we are currently investigating.&#x000a0;</p><p>Our model does not include the aortic valve (and, to a lesser importance, the coronary arteries).&#x000a0;Given this is also a steady-state model, the effects of aortic regurgitation are also not considered. This has been investigated by others [<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="REF13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. This limitation will be addressed in a future non-steady-state solver, though the effect of the coronary arteries should be negligible.</p><p>Despite these limitations, we produced a model that was capable of performing CFD calculations on appropriate CT scans, with results similar to other studies, and real-world figures.&#x000a0;Residual values (as mentioned before) were small and within our target range of less than 1&#x000d7;10<sup>-3</sup>.</p><p>Directions for future research</p><p>Our current model of aortic aneurysm is simple, accessible, reproducible, and cost-effective.&#x000a0;In the future, we intend to improve on our methodology in numerous ways, with the same aims in mind.</p><p>For further refinement of our model, echocardiographic and Doppler ultrasound measurements will be taken to determine true flow velocities.&#x000a0;This would also allow better modelling of inflow direction and provide boundary conditions more in keeping with the patient's normal physiology.&#x000a0;By measuring pulse wave Doppler, it would also be possible to model pulsatile flow through the inlet mesh of the model.&#x000a0;There are solvers available in the OpenFOAM software package that have this capability, albeit with added complexity. This would also allow the measurement of changes in WSS over the cardiac cycle, as well as the measurement of oscillatory shear index.</p><p>Future models will include coronary arteries as well as more accurately model the aortic valve.&#x000a0;This is especially important in bicuspid aortic valves, where the aortic inflow can be eccentric and turbulent, with complex WSS interactions in small regions of the aorta [<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="REF19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>In the future, our model will be compared with 4D MRI, as comparing CFD simulations with 4D MRI data is a valuable approach for validating and improving the accuracy of the CT-derived models. In previous small-series validation studies [<xref rid="REF20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], fluid velocity profiles and WSS agreed with those measured by 4D MRI.</p><p>With real-world validation, kinematic shear stress and WSS could help to identify patients at risk of acute aortic syndrome in a way which is cheap, reproducible, and non-invasive, in addition to aortic size parameters, as is the current norm. This is also the topic of our ongoing research.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We have produced a CFD model of ascending aortic aneurysm based on a CT dataset that relies on an entirely free and open-source toolchain, using computer hardware within the reach of most researchers.&#x000a0;This is an example of FOSS lowering barriers to medical research, as well as allowing complex work to be done.&#x000a0;Our model does make assumptions (for instance, steady-state flow and rigid walls) to simplify the model and has clear, stated limitations.&#x000a0;We are continuously improving the accuracy and reliability of the model while maintaining a FOSS toolchain.&#x000a0;Our hope is that others are able to utilise this model and iterate upon it, both for the improvement of our techniques and to demonstrate the strengths of FOSS within a medical research context.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Dr. Pragnesh Joshi for his mentorship, teaching, and guidance in the study and clinical management of aortic disease.

Some are used only to exclude segments of the aorta which would interfere with subsequent clipping steps and are not included within the analysis. Following these steps on an actual model should make this clear. A sample ParaView state file is included in the GitHub repository under the&#x000a0;<italic>Samples</italic>&#x000a0;directory for reader experimentation, without having to perform the entire CFD process.</p><p>A plane is created first across the aortic arch at the level of the arch vessels and clipped to retain the model of the ascending, arch, and descending thoracic aorta.&#x000a0;This is named &#x02018;AortaNoArchVessels&#x02019; and appears in the Pipeline Browser, as demonstrated in Figure <xref rid="FIG7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>.&#x000a0;A further plane is then created at the boundary of the arch and descending aorta.&#x000a0;The descending aorta is then isolated and named &#x02018;Descending&#x02019;.&#x000a0;The&#x000a0;AortaNoArchVessels&#x000a0;ROI is then selected again, and a copy of the plane for the descending&#x000a0;is made.&#x000a0;To select the opposite ROI (that is, the ascending aorta and aortic arch), the direction of the normal vector is reversed by multiplying the numerical values defining the vector by -1: in the case of the plane in Figure <xref rid="FIG8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>, this would yield the result (-0.599638, 0.745382, 0.21274).&#x000a0;(The numerical values of the Origin point and the Normal vector are visible under the&#x000a0;Properties&#x000a0;tab in the screenshot.)&#x000a0;The result of this operation is named &#x02018;AscendingArch&#x02019;.&#x000a0;A further plane is then generated at the level of the transition from the ascending aorta to the arch, leaving behind the arch.&#x000a0;This is named &#x02018;Arch&#x02019;.&#x000a0;This plane is inverted again by multiplying the numerical values of the Normal vector by -1 and applied to the&#x000a0;AscendingArch: the result is named &#x02018;Ascending&#x02019;.&#x000a0;A final plane is created at the sinotubular junction of the model, which leaves the &#x02018;Tubular&#x02019; ROI.&#x000a0;The Normal vector is again multiplied by -1, to leave the &#x02018;Root&#x02019; ROI.&#x000a0;This process allows the complete division of our aortic model into separate anatomical segments, which may be quantitatively assessed individually.</p></app></app-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="REF1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><article-title>2014 ESC guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of aortic diseases: document covering acute and chronic aortic diseases of the thoracic and abdominal aorta of the adult.
