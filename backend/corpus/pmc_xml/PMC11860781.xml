Methods: We assessed the impact of age and sex on CD4+ T cell and antibody responses to a mixture of six melanoma helper peptides (6MHP) and on CD8+ T cell responses when vaccinating with 12 class I MHC-restricted melanoma peptides (12MP) plus either 6MHP or a tetanus helper T cell peptide (Tet). We hypothesized that immune responses would be greater in men and in younger patients. Results: We found differences in immune response by sex, but they favored female patients and were only evident for helper T cell responses to Tet with a weak trend to higher T cell responses to 12MP in female patients vaccinated with 12MP + Tet. The age-based differences favored younger patients but only for immune response to 12MP when inoculated with 12MP + Tet. Conclusions: These findings reinforce the importance of assessing sex- and age-based differences in immune responses to cancer vaccines and other immune therapies. There is also a need to understand the reasons for such differences.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>melanoma vaccine</kwd><kwd>peptide vaccine</kwd><kwd>T cell response</kwd><kwd>patient sex</kwd><kwd>patient age</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>NIH/NCI R01</funding-source><award-id> CA118386</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>NIH/NCI R21</funding-source><award-id>CA105777</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>NIH/NCI P30</funding-source><award-id>CA044579</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>NIH/NIAID T35</funding-source><award-id>AI 60528-19</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>Alice and Bill Goodwin and the Commonwealth Foundation for Cancer Research</funding-source></award-group><funding-statement>Supported by NIH/NCI R01 CA118386; NIH/NCI R21 CA105777; NIH/NCI P30 CA044579 (Molecular, Immunologic, and Translational Sciences Core, Biorepository and Tissue Research Facility, Office of Clinical Research, and Biostatistics Shared Resource); NIH/NIAID T35 AI 60528-19; and gifts from Alice and Bill Goodwin and the Commonwealth Foundation for Cancer Research.</funding-statement></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-vaccines-13-00194"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy induces objective clinical responses in a large proportion of patients with advanced melanoma, but most will develop primary or acquired resistance [<xref rid="B1-vaccines-13-00194" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] to ICB, leading to death. The development of ICB therapy was built through a growing understanding of the importance of the immune system in responding to solid tumors. It is now understood that T cell activation requires interaction with tumor self-peptides or neoantigens on solid tumors for further mobilization of the adaptive immune system to the site for tumor destruction [<xref rid="B2-vaccines-13-00194" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. ICB enhances this process by enhancing immune cell activation. Any aberration in this process results in unchecked tumor growth.</p><p>It is estimated that approximately 55% of patients with melanoma demonstrate primary resistance to single-agent PD1 inhibitors, around 40% demonstrate resistance to CTLA4+PD1 inhibitor combination, and around 25% of patients develop acquired resistance to PD1 inhibitor therapy within 24 months of initiation [<xref rid="B3-vaccines-13-00194" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. While the mechanisms of resistance to ICB are not fully understood, they have been posited to involve various elements of the cancer immunity cycle and interactions among myriad immunological pathways and signaling molecules [<xref rid="B1-vaccines-13-00194" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Gide et al. organized the mechanisms of resistance into six categories, including insufficient antigen presentation and recognition, weak T cell activation, absence of T cells in the tumor microenvironment, upregulation of immunosuppressive cells and molecules, decreased sensitivity to IFN-gamma signaling, loss or <italic toggle="yes">PTEN</italic> expression [<xref rid="B4-vaccines-13-00194" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], and dysregulation of immune checkpoint markers [<xref rid="B1-vaccines-13-00194" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Among these, one important and targetable mechanism of resistance is the lack of pre-existing T cell response to tumor antigens. In vivo, this may be secondary to low tumor mutational burden and lack of neoantigen recognition, the loss of beta-2-microglobulin (&#x003b2;2m), or loss of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) I. &#x003b2;2m is a component of HLA class 1 molecules, and loss of expression prevents antigen presentation [<xref rid="B4-vaccines-13-00194" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In light of these findings, adding melanoma vaccines to ICB offers promise to overcome this common mechanism of resistance [<xref rid="B1-vaccines-13-00194" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B5-vaccines-13-00194" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-vaccines-13-00194" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-vaccines-13-00194" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Melanoma vaccines deliver immunogenic antigens for presentation by MHC I or MHC II molecules to CD8<sup>+</sup> or CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, respectively. The importance of targeting CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, in addition to CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, with cancer immunotherapy is now recognized [<xref rid="B8-vaccines-13-00194" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Many cancer immunotherapies focus on recruiting CD8<sup>+</sup> T for direct recognition and killing of cancer cells [<xref rid="B8-vaccines-13-00194" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Yet, it is now accepted that activating CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells creates a synergistic effect [<xref rid="B8-vaccines-13-00194" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-vaccines-13-00194" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-vaccines-13-00194" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-vaccines-13-00194" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. For example, CAR-T cell therapy most often involves engineering both CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells to achieve a more robust and clinically significant immune response against antigenic targets [<xref rid="B12-vaccines-13-00194" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], and the manufacture of CAR<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in the absence of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells leads to suboptimal expansion and significantly impaired functionality [<xref rid="B13-vaccines-13-00194" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells are capable of targeting cells presenting MHC II, inducing macrophage activation, causing tumor cell senescence, and prompting cytokine release to support CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, making them important in mediating anticancer effects [<xref rid="B8-vaccines-13-00194" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>Two crucial and understudied factors that impact the outcomes of immunotherapy are age and biological sex. Increased age leads to a wide range of changes in T cell function, including a reduction in T cell receptor diversity and several gene expression changes that mediate age-dependent T cell senescence [<xref rid="B14-vaccines-13-00194" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. We have previously identified decreases in CD8 T cell responses to a melanoma vaccine in patients over age 64 [<xref rid="B15-vaccines-13-00194" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. On the other hand, patients over age 60 had a greater likelihood of treatment response to anti-PD1 therapy compared to younger patients, possibly due to lower populations of regulatory T cells (Tregs) in the older population [<xref rid="B16-vaccines-13-00194" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Depletion of Tregs with an anti-CD25 antibody increased responses to anti-PD1 therapy in young mice with melanoma xenografts, further supporting this possibility [<xref rid="B16-vaccines-13-00194" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Thus, data are mixed on the impact of age on outcomes with immune therapy.</p><p>In addition, associations of biological sex with clinical response rates and survival benefit have been reported in a meta-analysis of 20 randomized controlled trials of various immune checkpoint inhibitors [<xref rid="B17-vaccines-13-00194" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. They found that the pooled reduction in risk of death was two-fold greater for male patients compared to female patients [<xref rid="B17-vaccines-13-00194" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-vaccines-13-00194" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Yet, they found women achieved a greater survival hazard ratio overall compared to men [<xref rid="B17-vaccines-13-00194" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In a long-term follow-up of melanoma patients who received a vaccine composed of highly immunogenic tumor peptides, our group found more favorable survival outcomes in male patients than female patients [<xref rid="B19-vaccines-13-00194" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. It has been posited that these differences may be explained by tumors in male patients having increased tumor mutational burden compared to those in female patients [<xref rid="B20-vaccines-13-00194" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Additionally, in studies on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the expression of cancer germline antigens, including some of those included in vaccinations utilized in our vaccine trials (Mel41 and Mel44), are expressed more often in tumors derived from male patients [<xref rid="B21-vaccines-13-00194" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Despite sex- and age-related differences in immune system response reported in several settings, little is known about the effects of age or sex on the immunogenicity of cancer vaccines. As mentioned above, we previously reported that CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses to class I MHC-restricted peptides were less in older patients (&#x0003e;64 years) but similar by sex [<xref rid="B15-vaccines-13-00194" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. However, that study did not study CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses or interactions of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses. The impact of sex and age on CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell and antibody responses to class II MHC-restricted peptides is not known, nor is their impact on CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses in the setting of vaccines also targeting different class II MHC-restricted antigens. As cancer therapy expands to include more immunotherapy options, an understanding of sex- and age-based differences in immune responses to a melanoma vaccine is critical in predicting patients&#x02019; outcomes. Additionally, these differences may reflect wider trends in immunotherapy responses that are not yet understood. Using data from two clinical trials, we assessed the association of patients&#x02019; biological sex and age on CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell and antibody responses to a mixture of 6 melanoma helper peptides presented by Class II HLA-DR molecules (6MHP) and on CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses when vaccinating with 12 class I MHC-restricted melanoma peptides (12MP) plus either 6MHP or a tetanus helper T cell peptide (Tet). We hypothesized that males and younger patients would have higher T cell and antibody responses to MHC II-restricted peptides in the vaccines.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec2-vaccines-13-00194"><title>2.

The ratio of proliferation in response to vaccination peptides (Nvax) to stimulation in response to cell culture media and to BSA (Nneg) as negative controls were used to determine the stimulation index (Rvax) for each patient.

Antigen-specific T cell responses to 6MHP, 12MP, and Tet were calculated from ex vivo enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISpot) assays for interferon gamma using PBMCs collected through day 50 (weeks 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7).

Discussion</title><p>As more personalized immunotherapies are developed for melanoma treatment, a better understanding of biological sex- and age-based differences in immune responses is essential to patient selection and management. We hypothesized that T cell and antibody responses to the 6MHP vaccines would be greater in males and in younger patients. Instead, we identified increased T cell responses in female patients to Tet peptide, but not to 6MHP, and a significant increase in T cell responses to 12MP in younger patients vaccinated with 12MP + Tet, but not in patients vaccinated with 12MP + 6MHP. The more robust initial immune response to Tet compared to 6MHP may be explained because most patients included in this study had previously received vaccines against tetanus toxoid as part of routine vaccination schedules. Our findings of concordance between the increased response to Tet and increased response to 12MP in the presence of Tet suggest that the response to helper peptides included in the vaccine may enhance the CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell response against 12MP in a sex-dependent manner. Yet, Tet is not a melanoma-associated antigen: while it served to amplify the response to 12MP, it did not add any new targets relevant to melanoma. This may explain longer overall survival in patients who received 12MP + 6MHP vaccination over patients who were treated with 12MP + Tet. The CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell response rates may be higher initially in that setting, but the response generated by 12MP + 6MHP vaccination is more melanoma-specific and clinically relevant [<xref rid="B19-vaccines-13-00194" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The promising clinical outcome benefit in 6MHP + 12MP in our recent trial supports the potential value of targeting shared melanoma antigens in a vaccination.</p><p>Interestingly, neither sex nor age predicted T cell responses to 6MHP. These results support associations of sex and age with immune responses to melanoma vaccines but do not explain the prolonged survival of male patients in long-term follow-up from our clinical trial of the Mel44 patients vaccinated with 12MP + 6MHP [<xref rid="B19-vaccines-13-00194" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In that post-hoc analysis, there was a durable increase in overall survival and recurrence-free survival (HR 0.35, 95% CI 0.14&#x02013;0.86, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.02) in male patients who received melanoma vaccines containing 12MP plus the helper peptides 6MHP rather than Tet [<xref rid="B19-vaccines-13-00194" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Interestingly, the 95% confidence intervals for overall survival between the 12MP + 6MHP and 12MP + Tet diverged at around 8 years after vaccination, driven mainly by the benefit experienced by male patients [<xref rid="B19-vaccines-13-00194" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The explanation for this phenomenon is two-fold. First, it has been posited that responses to immunotherapy may improve over time as a clinically significant immune response is mounted and expanded to include additional neo-antigenic targets [<xref rid="B40-vaccines-13-00194" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. As cancer cells bearing antigenic targets are killed, cell death releases additional epitopes to trigger a cascade of additional immune responses, a process referred to as epitope spreading [<xref rid="B40-vaccines-13-00194" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. It may be the case that immune responses to the 12MP + 6MHP vaccine became more robust over time in male patients because of epitope spreading, which was not analyzed directly in our original studies. It may also be the case that we did not capture increased immune activation in male patients with the measurements we used. For example, our initial studies of Mel41 and Mel44 quantified proliferation assays of PBMCs after antigen exposure and antigen-specific T cell responses to 6MHP, 12MP, and Tet with ELIspot assays for interferon gamma in PBMCs, respectively. Additional endpoints to quantify in future studies include analysis of (i) T cell homing receptors that support homing to tumor sites or (ii) vaccine-induced T cell infiltration into tumor sites induced by vaccination. Finally, it has been demonstrated in prior studies in NSCLCs that tumors derived from male patients have higher expression of cancer testis antigens, which were targeted in our melanoma vaccines [<xref rid="B21-vaccines-13-00194" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. We did not measure expression levels of these cancer testis antigens in tumors from our patients, but future studies may benefit from understanding this as a possible mediator of immune response and clinical outcomes.</p><p>Nonetheless, our data suggest that measures of clinical and immunological responses to cancer vaccines should include analyses as a function of age and biological sex. The underlying pathophysiology of these sex-based differences is unclear but may involve X chromosome inactivation, genetic differences, environmental factors, hormonal differences, or the commensal microbiome [<xref rid="B17-vaccines-13-00194" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Conforti et al. hypothesize that the benefit may be because tumors in women have demonstrated a lower mutational burden, making them less immunogenic [<xref rid="B17-vaccines-13-00194" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Additionally, women, on average, demonstrate superior immune surveillance, which could lower mortality from cancer [<xref rid="B17-vaccines-13-00194" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. This may result in less immunogenic tumors in women which are more likely to evade immune response and become resistant to immunotherapy [<xref rid="B17-vaccines-13-00194" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. They also posit the higher rates of autoimmunity in women may make them more likely to experience adverse effects of ICB therapy necessitating treatment discontinuation [<xref rid="B17-vaccines-13-00194" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]; however, other work suggests that women discontinue ICB therapy earlier than men, but not because of adverse events [<xref rid="B41-vaccines-13-00194" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Additional studies are warranted to understand the relative benefit of immune therapies that take into account differences in both toxicity and oncologic outcomes.</p><p>In a prior study, we identified better CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses to 12MP in patients less than 64 years old, compared to older patients, across three clinical trials, of which only one was Mel44 [<xref rid="B15-vaccines-13-00194" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The present study further dissected the Mel44 study population for those receiving 12MP + Tet and those receiving 12MP + 6MHP, with the finding that the age-related differences in immune response depended on the choice of helper peptides included in the vaccines. This suggests that the impact of age on the immune response to MHC I-restricted peptides may depend on the nature of the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses that support the CD8<sup>+</sup> responses. Alternatively, it could be the case that the higher levels of immune activation seen in younger patients in our cohort precipitate higher levels of regulatory T cell activation, serving to limit the immune response [<xref rid="B16-vaccines-13-00194" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The lower levels of immune activation demonstrated by the older cohort may not induce such a response, allowing for a lower but more persistent immune response to peptide vaccines.</p><p>Limitations in this study are that the quantification of immune response differed for the two clinical trials (T cell proliferation and Ab responses for Mel41; ELIspot assay for Mel44) and that the ELISpot assays from Mel44 only assessed interferon gamma production; however, immune response rates to 6MHP were similar across both studies. Also, data from both trials are concordant in that T cell responses to 6MHP were similar by age and sex. Future studies to understand differences in clinical outcome by sex may include analysis of sex-related differences in multifunctional T cell responses, T cell homing to tumor, or differences in the tumor microenvironments. These have all been posited as relevant mechanisms of resistance to immunotherapy in patients with melanoma and remain critical areas of research [<xref rid="B1-vaccines-13-00194" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B3-vaccines-13-00194" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>Our findings supported our hypothesis that there would be biological sex- and age-based differences in immune response to vaccination. However, the sex difference favored female patients rather than male patients and was only evident for helper T cell responses to a tetanus toxoid peptide (<xref rid="vaccines-13-00194-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>A), with a weak trend (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.12) to higher T cell responses to 12MP in female patients vaccinated with 12MP + Tet.

Conclusions</title><p>The current study supports our hypothesis there are biological sex- and age-based differences in the immune response to peptides included in experimental melanoma vaccines. However, we found that women had more favorable responses compared to men, which was only evident for CD4<sup>+</sup> helper T cell responses to a tetanus toxoid peptide. Additionally, we found younger patients (&#x0003c; 64 years) had a stronger immune response to 12MP when co-inoculated with Tet (<italic toggle="yes">p =</italic> 0.02) but not with 6MHP. Our findings with regards to Tet may be explained by the fact that most patients are immunized against tetanus toxoid previously, making this a powerful immune system stimulator. Despite these differences, we did not see differences in 6MHP response by sex or age, which is surprising in light of our group&#x02019;s finding of longer overall survival for male patients immunized with 6MHP + 12MP. These findings reinforce the importance of understanding the reasons for sex- and age-based differences in immunogenicity, which are also a function of the antigens targeted. In the future, we will examine more markers of T cell activation in response to vaccination and examine the infiltration of vaccine-induced T cells into tumors to better understand how age and sex impact the efficacy of cancer vaccines on patients with melanoma and other cancers.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We appreciate the help of the Biostatistics Shared Resource at the University of Virginia School of Medicine for their guidance and review of our analysis.
