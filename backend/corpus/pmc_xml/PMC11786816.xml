Various DESs were tested for polysaccharides extraction, and the process was optimized using response surface methodology (RSM). A preliminary structural analysis of the polysaccharides was conducted using infrared spectrum. The DESs were characterized by measuring their pH, viscosity, conductivity, refractive index, and density. The optimal extraction agent and parameters were determined. Significant differences in pH, viscosity, and conductivity were observed among DESs, whereas differences in refractive index and density were not significant. Choline chloride-lactic acid was identified as the optimal extraction agent. The optimal extraction parameters were a DES molar ratio of 1:2.1, a water content of 27&#x000a0;%, an extraction temperature of 70&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C, and an extraction time of 44&#x000a0;min, resulting in polysaccharides yield of 18.62&#x000a0;%. The extracted polysaccharides exhibited strong inhibitory effects against Salmonella, along with antioxidant activity and &#x003b1;-amylase inhibitory activities. The study demonstrated that polysaccharides from <italic>Tenebrio molitor</italic> can be efficiently extracted using DESs, showcasing significant biological activities, including antibacterial, antioxidant, and &#x003b1;-amylase inhibitory properties.

With its low breeding costs and high fat content, which provides essential fatty acids beneficial to human health, <italic>T. molitor</italic> represents an insect resource with immense development potential [<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p id="p0015">Polysaccharides are widely distributed natural high-molecular-weight compounds that are closely associated with mechanisms essential for maintaining biological functions. They exhibit a wide range of biological activities [<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and have extensive applications in the food and pharmaceutical industries. Most polysaccharides demonstrate potent pharmacological effects, including anti-tumor, antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory properties, making them valuable sources for developing functional foods and medicines [<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. As an active and efficient component of <italic>T. molitor</italic>, polysaccharides hold significant potential for further development and application. Additionally, Studies have shown that incorporating natural preservatives into food can effectively extend its shelf life [<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Chitosan, renowned for its diverse biological activities, broad availability, biocompatibility, and non-toxic nature, has emerged as a prominent topic in food research [<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Currently, the extraction methods for polysaccharides in the food industry primarily include traditional solvent extraction and high-temperature water extraction. In comparison, Ultrasound-assisted extraction leverages the mechanical and cavitation effects of ultrasound to disrupt biological structures such as cell walls and cell membranes. The disruption of these structures facilitates solvent penetration into the material, thereby improving the extraction efficiency of bioactive compounds [<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], as a result, ultrasound-assisted extraction offers several advantages, including shorter extraction times, operational simplicity, and higher extraction yields [<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>]. whereas high-temperature water extraction is time-consuming, requires large amounts of solvents, and results in lower extraction yields [<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], it no longer meets the demands of the market.</p><p id="p0020">Response surface methodology (RSM) is a comprehensive approach that combines experimental design and mathematical modeling for process optimization. It establishes functional relationships between independent factors and response values through well-structured experimental designs and appropriate data processing, ultimately yielding a regression equation. By analyzing this regression equation, the optimal process parameters can be identified [<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. One of the primary advantages of RSM is its ability to accurately explore the relationships between factors and response values while minimizing the need for extensive experimentation [<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p id="p0025">DESs are considered green solvents due to their minimal environmental impact, easy availability, low toxicity, and cost-effectiveness. Compared to other organic solvents, they exhibit superior solubility and diffusion properties [<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>]. Consequently, the use of ultrasound-assisted DESs for polysaccharides extraction aligns with the future demands of the food industry. During the extraction process, the viscosity, diffusivity, and solubility of DESs vary, influencing their ability to dissolve various polysaccharides [<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. This underscores the necessity of further exploration into these solvent systems.</p><p id="p0030">DESs are innovative extraction solvents [<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], composed of hydrogen bond acceptors (HBAs) and hydrogen bond donors (HBDs). The formation of hydrogen bonds between these components results in a low melting point and excellent solubilization properties, enabling DESs to efficiently extract active compounds from plants. For instance, hydrogen bond donors, such as alcohols, carboxylic acids, or polyalcohols, can form hydrogen bonds with phenolic compounds, including flavonoids and phenolic acids, thereby significantly facilitating their solubilization and extraction [<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Various DES systems, such as combinations of choline chloride with different HBDs, have been utilized to extract a wide range of plant constituents, such as flavonoids, coumarins, and polysaccharides. These systems often outperform conventional solvents, achieving superior extraction efficiency and selectivity [<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In recent years, DESs have demonstrated unique benefits in the extraction and separation of natural active ingredients [<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. As emerging solvents, they have been widely applied in the pharmaceutical, chemical, and food industries for separation and synthesis [<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].

Various DESs were screened, and the polysaccharides extraction process was optimized through response surface methodology. The antibacterial, antioxidant, &#x003b1;-amylase inhibitory activities, and structural characteristics of the polysaccharides were also investigated. The conclusions were as follows: Significant differences were observed in pH, viscosity, and conductivity among the six DESs, while differences in refractive index and density were not significant. Choline chloride-lactic acid was identified as the optimal extraction agent. The optimal extraction parameters for <italic>T. molitor</italic> polysaccharides, determined using response surface methodology, were: a DES molar ratio of 1:2.1, a water content of 27&#x000a0;%, an extraction temperature of 70&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C, and an extraction time of 44&#x000a0;min, resulting in polysaccharides yield of 18.62&#x000a0;%. The polysaccharides from <italic>T. molitor</italic> demonstrated inhibitory effects against four common pathogens, as well as <italic>Aspergillus niger</italic> and <italic>yeast,</italic> with the most significant inhibition observed against <italic>Salmonella</italic>. The MIC of the polysaccharides against <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>, <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, and <italic>Salmonella</italic> were 2, 2, 1, and 0.5&#x000a0;mg/mL, respectively. Within a certain concentration range, the polysaccharides exhibited strong scavenging activity against DPPH&#x02022; and ABTS+&#x02022; free radicals, with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 0.6225, 1.0955, and 0.6930&#x000a0;mg/mL, respectively. Additionally, the polysaccharides demonstrated a certain degree of reducing ability toward Fe<sup>3+</sup>. As the sample concentration increased, its antioxidant capacity also improved. The polysaccharides also demonstrated inhibitory activity against &#x003b1;-amylase, with an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 8.702&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;10<sup>1</sup>&#x02077; mg/mL, and the inhibitory activity increased with concentration. Infrared spectroscopy analysis revealed the presence of functional groups such as C-O, O-H, and C=O confirming the substance as polysaccharides molecule. Natural polysaccharides exhibit significant biological activity, making them valuable for human health and industrial applications. This study provides a theoretical reference for the development and utilization of low-consumption, large-scale biological resources such as <italic>T. molitor</italic>. Future research should focus on further purifying the polysaccharide extract to accurately determine its biological activity and structural characteristics.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>CRediT authorship contribution statement</title><p id="p0305"><bold>Shengru Yang:</bold> Writing &#x02013; review &#x00026; editing, Writing &#x02013; original draft. <bold>Xu Li:</bold> Methodology. <bold>Qiaoli Li:</bold> Data curation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="sec6"><title>Data availability statement</title><p id="p0310">The datasets used and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.</p></sec><sec id="sec7"><title>Ethics declaration</title><p id="p0315">Review and/or approval by an ethics committee as well as informed consent was not required for this study because this article did not involve any direct experimentation/studies on living beings.</p></sec><sec sec-type="COI-statement" id="coi0010"><title>Declaration of competing interest</title><p id="p0320">The authors declare the following financial interests/personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing interests:Reports a relationship with that includes:.
