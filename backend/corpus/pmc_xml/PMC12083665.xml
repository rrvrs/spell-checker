Despite escalating rates of mental health disorders, little is known regarding the role of protective mechanisms that characterise resilience in adolescent mental health globally and in Africa, where there is heightened exposure to adversities. This study draws on two waves of a longitudinal population cohort from a peri-rural setting in KwaZulu Natal South Africa to investigate the relationship between grit &#x02013; as a psychological resilience factor - and mental health outcomes in adolescents (N = 1174). Heightened mental health difficulty ratings for internalising factors were found across two study waves, with females reporting significantly higher rates of depression. Grit was found to be significant predictor of lower adolescent depression and anxiety, but dependent on the severity of internalising symptoms, sociodemographic factors and exposure to socioeconomic adversity. Potential differences in the mechanisms of adolescent resilience are highlighted that involve a dynamic interplay between bottom-up and top-down resilience factors in the African context.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Asenze cohort study</kwd><kwd>adolescence</kwd><kwd>mental health</kwd><kwd>resilience</kwd><kwd>depression</kwd><kwd>multisystemic</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>Research reported in this publication was supported by the Fogarty International Center, NIH, Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences Research, Office of Disease Prevention of the National Institutes of Health under Award Number R01 TW011228, and the National Institute of Mental Health of the National Institutes of Health under Award Number RF1MH134561 and P30-MH43520.

However, the study of adolescent health and development has only recently gained scientific traction<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. The period of adolescence &#x02013; roughly defined from 10 to 25 years<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> &#x02013; is a unique developmental stage characterised by distinct changes in physical, neurocognitive and social-emotional development<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. These developmental shifts also overlap with a heightened vulnerability to mental health disorders<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. Recent estimates from UNICEF indicate that 20% of adolescents globally experience a mental health disorder<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> which accounts for at least 13% of the global burden of disease<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> within the period of early and middle adolescence<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. Half of adult mental health disorders are also reported to begin during adolescence<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. This escalation in mental health disorders in adolescents has been well documented in high-income counties<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>, highlighting the role of early life adversity and wider environmental factors, including social deprivation during the COVID-19 pandemic<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> and the use of social media<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. However, far less attention has been afforded to the adolescent mental health crisis in low-to-middle income countries (LMICs)<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> - particularly in Africa<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. The African context therefore represents both a high adversity context that can result in greater risk for mental health difficulties<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>, as well as an understudied social reality with varying cultural and contextual factors that may uncover different patterns of risk and vulnerability in adolescent mental health globally<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">Consequently, in line with the 2030 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>, action is needed in combating adolescent mental health difficulties particularly in Africa. The study of adolescent resilience against negative mental health outcomes in the face of adversity is therefore, a critical and underutilised approach in the current mental health literature<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>. Resilience research is based on the fundamental observation that mental health can be maintained despite heightened exposure to stress or adversity<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. However, the protective factors underlying resilience are poorly understood, especially during adolescence, as a sensitive neurodevelopmental period. Increased focus on adolescent resilience research is even more urgent in low-resource and high-adversity settings<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>, especially across Africa<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>, which are subject to Majority World biases (i.e., limited research in LMICs that house 90% of the world&#x02019;s population)<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">A culmination of recent resilience research suggests that protective mechanisms that underpin resilience involve a dynamic interaction of internal processes (e.g., &#x0201c;bottom-up&#x0201d;; emotion regulation)<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> and external factors (e.g., &#x0201c;top-down&#x0201d;; social support and community structures)<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>. Aligned with this perspective, drawing on findings from foundational studies in Sub-Saharan Africa<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> and using cross-cultural comparisons<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>, Ungar and Theron<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> have proposed a multisystemic framework for understanding resilience that is culturally and contextually sensitive. Within this framework, resilience involves multiple interacting processes at a biological, psychological, social and ecological level.</p><p id="P6">While recent resilience studies in African adolescents<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> have highlighted the importance of wider external factors at the social and ecological level, resilience also involves internal factors that function at a biological and psychological level<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> that have rarely been investigated in the African context. Emotional regulation for example has been thought to be a critical neurobiological mechanism underlying resilience, especially important in adolescence, where there are distinct changes in white matter pathways and volume, as well as developmental changes in the prefrontal cortex and limbic system<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup>. Neuroimaging and experimental studies, have not only shown the importance of executive function (e.g., working memory) in adolescent development<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup>, but also in relation to adolescent resilience and positive mental health outcomes<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. These neurobiological factors also interact at a psychological level. Although there is consensus in the literature that resilience itself should not be understood as a stable personality trait<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>, individual resilience factors &#x02013; such as cognitive reappraisal<sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> and grit<sup><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> &#x02013; nevertheless form part of the psychological protective factors in Ungar and Theron<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> proposed multisystemic model that promote positive mental health outcomes.</p><p id="P7">The concept of grit arises from a much longer historical tradition<sup><xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup>, but it was first described in the scientific literature by Duckworth<sup><xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> as &#x02018;perseverance and passion for long-term goals&#x02019;. A recent meta-analysis<sup><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> of the current literature has challenged traditional conceptions of grit or being &#x0201c;gritty&#x0201d; to extend beyond the original hierarchical two-factor model, namely perseverance and consistency, to include wider psychological constructs such as adaptability<sup><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> that has been previously implicated in resilience and adolescence research<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup>. Grit has been widely studied in the education literature as a predictor of academic success<sup><xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup>, and more recent studies highlight the association between grit and positive mental health outcomes<sup><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup>, including internalising symptoms<sup><xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup> (i.e., depression and anxiety). Interestingly, neuroimaging studies investigating the neuroanatomical correlates of grit<sup><xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup> have identified structures and networks in the prefrontal cortex, limbic system and white matter pathways, which overlap with neural changes in the adolescent brain<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> and in adolescent resilience<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>. Although studies investigating the relationship between grit and mental health have been conducted in diverse country contexts that include Majority World countries<sup><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup>, cultural biases still extend to the study of grit<sup><xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup>, with further research needed to include African populations and different cultural contexts.</p><p id="P8">Long-standing birth and population cohort studies in Majority World LMICs<sup><xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup> &#x02013; including those in sub-Saharan Africa<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> &#x02013; have played a profound role in understanding and promoting health across the lifecourse<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. To this end, this study draws on data from the Asenze population cohort study, a prospective longitudinal study based in a peri-rural setting in KwaZulu-Natal South Africa that is characterised as a high adversity context<sup><xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup>. The aims of this study are twofold. Firstly, to characterise the longitudinal mental health profile of internalising factors (i.e., depression and anxiety) of adolescents living in a high stress and adversity setting (e.g., socioeconomic adversity; increased exposure to crime; high rates of HIV) across two waves of the Asenze cohort study. Second, to investigate if grit as one measure of resilience, predicts positive mental health outcomes of African adolescents. This study also draws on Ungar Theron&#x02019;s<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> proposed multisystemic approach that integrates culturally and contextually important factors, specifically sociodemographic characteristics and socioeconomic factors, in investigating adolescence resilience. Based on findings from previous cross-sectional studies, we hypothesised that grit would be a significant predictor of lower adolescent depression and anxiety longitudinally when examining internalising symptoms dichotomously and when using continuous scores. As previous longitudinal studies have reported sex differences in the prevalence of internalising symptoms, we also hypothesised that there would be higher rates of depression reported in female adolescents in the cohort across study waves.</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Participants</title><p id="P900">We analysed data collected during waves 3 and 4.

This once again held true when socioeconomic adversity was added.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P17">Our study provides the first longitudinal evidence of the role of grit as a psychological resilience factor in adolescent mental health globally, and in Africa. More specifically, drawing on data from the Asenze population cohort in a peri-rural context in KwaZulu-Natal, South African adolescents presented with high rates of depression and anxiety across two study waves, with females reporting significantly higher rates of depression. Linear regression analyses confirmed our study hypotheses, with grit consistently predicating lower depression and anxiety when using continues scores and controlling for previous internalising symptoms, gender and age, as well as when adding socioeconomic adversity to the model. However, in the most severe cases of adolescent depression and anxiety (top 20%), grit did not predict lower internalising symptoms. Furthermore, when using a dichotomous categorisation of depression and anxiety a slightly different pattern emerged. Grit predicted lower anxiety and not depression, when controlling for previous levels of internalising symptoms at wave 3, gender and age. In comparison, when socioeconomic adversity was added to the model with dichotomous scores, grit predicted lower depression and not anxiety.</p><p id="P18">Taken together, these results suggest the differential predictive role of grit as a resilience factor on internalising symptoms in adolescent mental health depending on symptom severity, sociodemographic factors and socioeconomic adversity. The need to assume a multisystemic framework<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> is therefore further highlighted by our study results. Previous cross-sectional studies conducted in Majority World settings in China<sup><xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup> and Thailand<sup><xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> showed similar associations between grit and lower levels of depression and anxiety. However, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate longitudinal outcomes of grit on depression globally, and in the unique African context, while also focusing on a developmentally sensitive period of adolescence. Furthermore, the use of continuous scores offered a more sensitive analytical approach to changes of internalising symptoms overtime<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>, which also resulted in the most robust results of grit as a significant predictor of lower adolescent anxiety and depression. Nevertheless, our results also highlight that in the most severe cases of mental health difficulties, psychological resilience factors such as grit may not be enough<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup>, and additional multifaceted interventions are needed<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. Here, it is important to note that our results are not aligned to neo-liberal views that hold the individual solely responsible for their mental health<sup><xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref></sup> or that resilience is to be attributed to individual traits alone<sup><xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup>. Rather, our study provides a new perspective on the role psychological protective factors, such a grit, <italic toggle="yes">within</italic> a multisystemic approach to the study of resilience<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>. Future studies are therefore needed to investigate the early determinants of protective factors like grit and what conditions might foster its development. Similarly, studies should be undertaken to investigate the role of similar psychological factors in resilience such as growth mindset<sup><xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup> to help uncover the underlying mechanisms involved in the interplay between top-down and bottom-up processes in adolescent resilience. For example, recent findings<sup><xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref></sup> suggest that psychological resilience factors such as grit, emotion regulation and self-efficacy can be enhanced with resilience-based interventions, however the mechanisms underlying such changes, and the interaction with multisystemic factors, are still unclear.</p><p id="P19">Furthermore, adolescent girls in this study reported significantly higher rates of grit, but also depression, which is consistent with prior studies showing increased vulnerability to depression in adolescent females<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref></sup>. These sex differences in depression may also explain why grit was no longer predictive of lower rates of depression in the adjusted model when looking at the dichotomised mental health outcomes for anxiety and depression. Future studies drawing on neuroimaging methods in the African context<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> could unlock novel insights into the underlying processes involved in potential sex differences or gender-related factors<sup><xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref></sup>, such as emotion regulation, hormonal changes or psychosocial stressors, in resilience research. For example, a recent protocol study using a longitudinal birth cohort in a peri-urban setting in Cape Town South Africa<sup><xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref></sup>, will draw on MRI methods to investigate longitudinal neurodevelopmental changes in resilient emotion regulation. Similarly, in looking at the dichotomised internalising scores, the degree of socioeconomic adversity changed the predictive power of grit, with only depression remaining significant in the model. The association between socioeconomic adversity and depression has been well documented in the literature<sup><xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref></sup>, however future studies are needed to explore the possible moderating relationship of socioeconomic adversity on grit and internalising symptoms. Furthermore, this study drew on objective and rigorous measures of socioeconomic levels &#x02013; household assets, caregiver education and food security. However, these measures have not always been sensitive enough to capture the complexity of <italic toggle="yes">perceived</italic> socioeconomic inequality<sup><xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref></sup>, with recent studies advocated for the use of subjective fiscal appraisals<sup><xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P20">The longitudinal mental health profile of this sample of South African adolescents is consistent with previous longitudinal studies based in peri-urban settings in South Africa as a Majority World LMIC<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref></sup>. However, our study is the first to provide longitudinal evidence of high rates of internalising symptoms in South African adolescents in peri-rural settings. The decline in reported anxiety and depression from wave 3 to wave 4 in the study could suggest potential differences in internalising problems in younger compared to older adolescents<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>, or increased stigma<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> in reporting symptoms in older adolescents within this context. However, this effect might also be attributed to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic during data collection at wave 3 of the cohort study that ran from 2019 to 2021<sup><xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref></sup>. Data collection was halted for a period due to severe lockdown restrictions at the end of March 2020. The negative effect of the pandemic on adolescent mental health has been robustly shown globally<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> and even within this study cohort<sup><xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref></sup>. Therefore, one possibility is that marked higher rates of depression and anxiety were reported post the lockdown period when data collection resumed, which then reduced in data collected at wave 4 in 2022. However, a recent study<sup><xref rid="R61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref></sup> examined depression and anxiety symptoms in adolescents in the Asenze cohort throughout wave 3 and found no relationship between internalising symptoms and government-imposed lockdown restrictions. Therefore, although it is unlikely that the COVID-19 lockdown accounted for changes in internalising symptoms in adolescents in the cohort study, future studies should still explore the potential effect of lockdown restrictions during the pandemic as a source of social deprivation<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> in South African adolescents in the Asenze study and more broadly.</p><p id="P21">Despite the novelty of our results, our study was not without limitations. The study was bound by the use of psychological measures developed in non-Majority World settings that often lack the cultural sensitivity needed in the current study context<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>, despite language translations used in the current study and South African validation studies of our measures <sup>e.g.,<xref rid="R62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, drawing on dual analytic strategies of using both dichotomous classification and continuous scores that were independent of the tests cut-off measures acted as a further buffer to counteract this limitation. Furthermore, the mental health measures used only included internalising mental health factors. Previous longitudinal studies in South Africa have shown a different pattern of mental health outcomes for male and female adolescents for externalising and internalising factors respectively<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. Future studies are needed to test if grit is predictive of lower internalising and externalising symptoms and the possible sex differences involved. Lastly, none of the measures used were diagnostic in nature and were all based on self-report methods that are limited by inherent biases involved, which include mental health stigma<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, given the lack of longitudinal data on adolescent mental health in culturally diverse context<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> such as in this cohort study, the use of such screening tools is an acceptable limitation until more formal diagnostic interviews can be utilised<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="P22">Housing the largest and fastest growing adolescent population in the world, safeguarding adolescent mental health across the African continent is a critical public health mandate.

For the PHQ-9 and GAD-7, scores of 10 or higher were categorised as presenting with depression or anxiety symptoms.

For the PHQ-2 and GAD-2, scores of three and higher indicated the presence of depression or anxiety symptoms respectively, while lower scores indicated minimal or no symptoms. Dichotomising the scores enabled us to describe them longitudinally. Second, the depression and anxiety scores were standardised (z-score transformed) allowing us to look at the data as a continuous measure of depression and anxiety symptom severity overtime. A global score for internalising symptoms was also created by averaging the depression and anxiety standardised z-score at each wave, with higher scores indicating a greater presence of internalising symptoms (supplementary Fig. 1).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S15"><title>Assessment of grit</title><p id="P30">Grit was assessed during wave 3 using the 8-item Short GRIT Scale (GRIT-S)<sup><xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="R71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref></sup>.
