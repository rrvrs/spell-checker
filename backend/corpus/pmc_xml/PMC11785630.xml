We analyzed serial breast MRIs in patients receiving neoadjuvant chemo-immunotherapy on the I-SPY2 clinical trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">Patients with stage 2&#x02013;3 HER2-negative breast cancer were randomized to weekly paclitaxel (control), weekly paclitaxel and pembrolizumab, or weekly paclitaxel, pembrolizumab and intra-tumoral injection of SD-101, a TLR9 agonist. All patients received AC. Regional lymph nodes were retrospectively evaluated on breast MRI at baseline, 3, 12 and 20 weeks by a single blinded radiologist. MRIs were assessed for development of new regional lymphadenopathy, or increase in the longest diameter or cortical thickness of the largest abnormal regional lymph node.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">Between 12/2015 and 4/2021, a total of 43 patients enrolled in the control (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;16) and paclitaxel&#x02009;+&#x02009;pembrolizumab&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;SD-101 (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;27) arms. 12 of 27 patients (44.4%) receiving chemo-immunotherapy experienced increased lymphadenopathy within the first 12 weeks compared to 1 of 16 patients (6.3%) in the control group (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.014).

These agents work by blocking the immunosuppressive interaction between the programmed death 1 (PD1) receptor on effector T cells and the programmed death ligand 1 (PDL1) within the tumor microenvironment thereby promoting anti-tumor immunity and tumor cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. However, despite these advances, immune-related adverse events (irAEs) can occur in up to 50% of patients and serious, irreversible side effects have been reported including adrenal insufficiency, insulin-dependent diabetes and neurologic events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In addition, not all patients require immunotherapy plus chemotherapy to achieve excellent outcomes. For example, up to 51% of patients with stage II&#x02013;III triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) who were treated with chemotherapy alone achieved pathologic complete response (pCR) at the time of surgery, and of these patients, 92.6% were event-free at 3 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Thus, early markers of response to immunotherapy are needed in order to identify patients who do not benefit and who can be spared from unnecessary immune toxicity.</p><p id="Par6">In the neoadjuvant setting, serial imaging has evolved as an important tool to assess response to treatment and may be one potential marker of early response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Of the available standard imaging methods, MRI has been demonstrated to have higher sensitivity for tumor extent and response compared to mammogram, ultrasound or clinical exam with an estimated sensitivity for detecting pathologic complete response of 0.88 (95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.78&#x02013;0.94) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Quantitative functional tumor volume (FTV), defined as the volume of tumor displaying rapid early enhancement followed by a rapid loss of enhancement on dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI, represents an additional novel radiologic marker of response and is assumed to represent the area of viable tumor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Changes to FTV have previously been linked to response to neoadjuvant therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">The Investigation of Serial Studies to Predict Your Therapeutic Response With Imaging And moLecular Analysis 2 (ISPY2) phase II clinical trial aims to identify effective novel agents using personalized assessment of tumor molecular features for patients with high-risk breast cancer in the neoadjuvant setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Patients enrolled in the trial are randomized based on their tumor molecular subtype to receiving one of several investigational agents in combination with paclitaxel for 12 weeks followed by four cycles of dose dense doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide (AC) before proceeding to surgery. While on-treatment, patients undergo serial breast MRIs to assess treatment response. Among the investigational agents used were the PD-1 monoclonal antibody pembrolizumab, as well as intra-tumoral injections of SD-101. SD-101 is a therapeutic vaccine that contains a synthetic oligonucleotide with cytidine-phospho-guanosine (CpG) motifs that stimulates plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) through engagement of toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that activation of plasmacytoid dendritic cells expressing TLR9 by SD-101 potentiates T cell infiltration into the tumor microenvironment, thereby increasing tumor cell destruction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Prior early phase clinical trials evaluated SD-101 in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with melanoma and lymphoma demonstrating response rates ranging from 28 to 78% with a favorable safety profile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">While imaging changes after immunotherapy have been described in other tumor types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], there are little data to describe changes to imaging in patients with early-stage breast cancer. This is particularly true of the changes seen with regional lymph nodes in response to treatment. An understanding of these changes is critical to guiding response assessment and planning surgical treatment in patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemo-immunotherapy. In particular, an understanding of the significance of emerging lymphadenopathy with this therapy and whether this represents progression vs inflammatory changes. In this study, we aimed to describe regional lymph node changes on MRI in patients with Stage 2&#x02013;3 breast cancer receiving standard chemotherapy with or without immunotherapy on the I-SPY2 trial. We hypothesized that patients undergoing treatment with neoadjuvant chemo-immunotherapy would demonstrate increased regional lymphadenopathy, possibly due to underlying immune activation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Participants and study design</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>I-SPY2 trial</title><p id="Par9">The I-SPY2 trial is a multi-center neoadjuvant platform trial testing novel agents in combination with chemotherapy in patients with Stage 2&#x02013;3 biopsy-proven breast cancer.

For this investigation, each MRI was reviewed by a single UCSF breast radiologist who was blinded to the treatment arm as well as the follow-up MRI time point after the baseline scan. MRIs were evaluated for abnormal ipsilateral axillary nodes, defined as nodes with cortical thickening&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;3mm, effacement or loss of the fatty hilum, rounded shape, and irregular margins. MRIs were monitored over time for changes in size of the largest abnormal node OR the development of new abnormal nodes. New lymphadenopathy was defined as development of new qualitative morphologic abnormalities as assessed qualitatively by the reading radiologist.

Early radiologic markers of response represent one possible predictive tool, particularly with the use of serial breast MRIs, which are already commonly used in the setting of neoadjuvant therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Prior serial breast MRI evaluation has focused on changes with neoadjuvant chemotherapy alone, with decreasing tumor size and FTV predictive of response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. However, in the case of treatment with ICI, the phenomenon of &#x0201c;pseudo-progression&#x0201d; has been described in a variety of tumor types in which initial increase in tumor size and volume, thought to be due to immune cell infiltration, are followed by subsequent treatment response. This phenomenon suggests that there may be unique patterns of imaging changes associated with chemo-immunotherapy as opposed to chemotherapy alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. In addition, very little is known regarding regional lymph node changes on imaging in response to neoadjuvant chemo-immunotherapy and whether increased adenopathy may be a sign of disease progression or of immune activation. In this study, we aimed to evaluate changes in regional lymphadenopathy in patients with stage 2&#x02013;3 breast cancer undergoing neoadjuvant chemo-immunotherapy compared to those receiving chemotherapy alone. To our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate lymph node changes in patients with early breast cancer undergoing neoadjuvant chemo-immunotherapy, and to explore potential relationships with surgical pathology and other patient characteristics.</p><p id="Par24">We found that patients undergoing chemo-immunotherapy, primarily with paclitaxel, pembrolizumab, and SD-101were more likely to develop increased lymphadenopathy compared to patients undergoing chemotherapy alone (44 vs 6.6%, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.0143, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Lymphadenopathy increased within the first 12 weeks of treatment prior to decreasing on subsequent therapy and occurred in a larger percentage of patients undergoing SD-101 with pembrolizumab compared to pembrolizumab alone. Of note, we found that SD-101 injections results in both ipsilateral and contralateral lymphadenopathy and may be informative for MRI monitoring of other trials utilizing localized therapies combined with systemic therapies. Similar findings have been reported in patients with non-small cell lung cancer undergoing neoadjuvant ICI who developed morphologically abnormal lymph nodes after treatment that upon biopsy were devoid of cancer cells but did show development of granulomatous inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Interestingly, despite early changes in lymphadenopathy, we note a persistent decrease in breast tumor size at all time points in both chemo-immunotherapy and control groups (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>). These results suggest that patients undergoing chemo-immunotherapy may be more likely to experience early lymph node changes that are independent of tumor response to treatment. One reason for this may be that chemo-immunotherapy activates immune cells residing in regional lymph nodes against tumor cells in the breast. Prior preclinical studies in mouse models have demonstrated a persistent peripheral immune activation in regional lymph nodes being associated with ongoing tumor response to chemo-immunotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Evaluation of patients with head and neck squamous cell cancer has previously shown an increase in CD8&#x02009;+&#x02009;T cell activity in uninvolved regional lymph nodes in response to immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Thus, it may be that an early increase in lymphadenopathy seen on imaging may be reflective of increased peripheral immune activation against tumor.</p><p id="Par25">The overall young age of patients in this cohort (median age 45) which may lead to heightened immune activation, and thus more pronounced lymph node imaging changes on MRI, compared to older patients who typically experience immunosenescence with age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Furthermore, all patients in this cohort had early-stage disease. It is unclear if increasing lymphadenopathy with chemo-immunotherapy would be seen in patients with metastatic disease, particularly for those who are heavily pre-treated, as prior treatment may impair or alter the immune response to ICI. The majority of cases of increased lymphadenopathy were seen in patients who received intra-tumoral SD-101 in combination with ICI which is proof of concept that intra-tumor injection can potentially increase tumor immunogenicity, a key strategy for overcoming immunotherapy resistance.. While fewer patients receiving chemotherapy and pembrolizumab alone had increased regional lymphadenopathy, it is important to note that two patients in the pembrolizumab arm (without SD101) experienced new lymph nodes at 12 weeks and were subsequently node negative with decreased breast tumor size at the time of surgery. As immune checkpoint inhibitors are combined with other investigational agents in the future, it is important to understand the imaging patterns of various combinations in order to optimize clinical trial design and inform clinical practice.</p><p id="Par26">When looking at RCB after neoadjuvant chemo-immunotherapy, there was no significant difference between rates of RCB 0 or 1 in patients with increasing lymphadenopathy compared to those without, though the absolute percentage of patients achieving RCB 0 or 1 was higher in those with increased lymphadenopathy (66.7 vs 53.3%, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.696, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). There were also similar rates of RCB 2 or 3 in patients with increasing lymphadenopathy compared to those without (33.3 vs 46.7%). As noted above, primary tumor parameters improved equally in both cohorts, suggesting the increased lymphadenopathy does not represent new metastatic disease/disease progression and, if reproduced in larger cohorts, does not warrant sampling mid-therapy. This is supported by the fact that, of the 12 patients who experienced increased lymphadenopathy within the first 12 weeks, 11 (92%) had subsequent decrease in lymphadenopathy over the entire 20 weeks of neoadjuvant therapy with the remaining patient experiencing stable lymphadenopathy. In addition, 11 (92%) of these 12 patients were found to have pathologically negative lymph nodes at the time of surgery. This is despite 6 of these patients (50%) having biopsy-proven positive nodes prior to starting chemo-immunotherapy. While these trends were not significant, it is possible that this is largely due to the small sample size in our study and further studies in larger cohorts are needed to explore the association of imaging lymphadenopathy and treatment response. We did note that patients undergoing chemo-immunotherapy achieved RCB 0 at a higher rate compared to control (41 vs 25%) which is consistent with larger phase III trials showing increased rates of pCR with the addition of ICI to chemotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].</p><p id="Par27">Our results did not indicate a correlation between estrogen receptor status, clinical lymph node status, MammaPrint score, Imprint score or tumor grade in the development of increased lymphadenopathy. We also observed similar rates of irAE in patients with increased lymphadenopathy compared to those without (66.7% in both groups), suggesting that regional lymphadenopathy may not predict development of off-target immune activity in our small sample size. This may point to differential mechanisms of immune activation associated with regional lymphadenopathy compared to development of systemic adverse events. While at this time this finding is hypothesis-generating for future investigation, it suggests the possibility of distinct immune mechanisms of response as opposed to toxicity.</p><p id="Par28">As previously mentioned, one major limitation of this study is the small sample size which may lead to bias or lack of generalizability. In addition, we note that most lymph node increases were observed in patients undergoing SD-101 in combination with pembrolizumab and chemotherapy, indicating that our results may not be generalizable to larger groups of patients who undergo ICI and chemotherapy alone. Finally, MRI may not be the optimal imaging modality to assess lymph node size, as ultrasound is often the method of choice for evaluating suspicious axillary nodes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. However, as MRI is the best modality to evaluate neoadjuvant treatment response, findings on this modality need to be understood.</p><p id="Par29">In conclusion, we found that patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemo-immunotherapy with pembrolizumab with or without SD-101 were more likely to experience early increased lymphadenopathy on serial MRI within the first 12 weeks of treatment despite concomitant decreases in breast tumor size. This effect was driven by the SD-101/pembrolizumab arm. The findings suggest that increasing adenopathy in this clinical context is unlikely to represent disease progression and it may be reasonable to defer follow-up imaging in the neoadjuvant setting. We did not observe a correlation between residual cancer burden, clinical node status, MammaPrint high-risk score, Imprint score, tumor ER status or tumor grade with increased lymphadenopathy and patients experienced similar rates of irAE regardless of lymph node changes. Future studies are warranted to determine whether on-treatment increases in lymphadenopathy may be an early sign of treatment response to neoadjuvant chemo-immunotherapy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.<supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM1"><media xlink:href="10549_2024_7481_MOESM1_ESM.pdf"><caption><p>Supplementary Figure 1.
