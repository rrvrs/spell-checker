Bioactive molecules produced by adipose tissue function as adipokines which regulate essential biological pathways that control inflammation response and insulin sensitivity alongside energy balance management and immune system operation. The disruption of adipokine secretion and function leads directly to metabolic disorders which include insulin resistance and persistent inflammation characteristic of obesity-related conditions. This article investigates the therapeutic possibilities of adipokine pathway manipulation through new pharmacological approaches and lifestyle changes alongside personalized medicine developments. Researchers analyze adipokines as important biomarkers for patient disease classification and their application in creating individualized treatment plans. The review highlights existing research deficiencies and obstacles that stand in the way of applying adipokine discoveries to clinical settings. This article integrates existing research to show how adipokine regulation helps prevent obesity-related metabolic issues and suggests directions for future studies to enhance treatment results.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>adipokines</kwd><kwd>insulin resistance</kwd><kwd>leptin</kwd><kwd>metabolic diseases</kwd><kwd>obesity</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction and background</title><p>Obesity is a multifactorial and complex condition in which adipose tissue is excessively accumulated and is associated with many chronic diseases. It is not only a cosmetic problem, but rather it is a serious public health problem of major significance for morbidity and mortality. Worldwide, obesity is on the rise as does its prevalence as a leading risk factor for metabolic diseases (Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), cardiovascular disease, and some types of cancer). According to the World Health Organization, 2022, &#x0201c;One in eight people had obesity, adult obesity has more than doubled since 1990, while adolescent obesity quadrupled, globally. In that year, 2.5 billion adults were overweight and 890 million were obese. In addition, 43% of adults were overweight, and 16% were obese. Thirty-seven million children under the age of 5, 390 million children, and adolescents aged 5-19 are classified as overweight, including 160 million who are categorized as having obesity, and childhood obesity is also increasing&#x0201d; [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The increase in this alarming trend has serious underlying consequences and provoked the urgency to tackle them. These mechanisms represent complex relations among genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors that cause the disturbance of normal metabolic function, causing insulin resistance, altered lipid metabolism, and chronic inflammation [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>In this case, obesity also facilitates the development of a spectrum of comorbidities, including "hypertension", "dyslipidemia", and "NAFLD" (non-alcoholic fatty liver disease), which, together with that risk, increase cardiovascular risk. This increasing prevalence of these diseases emphasizes the importance of having a greater understanding of how excess adipose tissue and metabolic dysfunction are somehow linked [<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Adipose tissue functions as an active endocrine organ because it produces bioactive molecules known as adipokines beyond its primary role as an energy storage system. These adipokines function as essential regulators for fundamental metabolic processes which encompass glucose balance as well as lipid metabolism together with energy regulation and immune responses [<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The most widely known adipokines are leptin, adiponectin, and resistin each of which has a unique but overlapping role in maintaining metabolic balance. For example, leptin, the main mediator of the control of appetite and energy balance, signals the brain about the body's energy stores, whereas adiponectin protects against insulin resistance and has remarkable anti-inflammatory properties [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. On the other side, resistin has been linked to increased inflammation and insulin resistance [<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>These adipokines show dysregulated secretion and activity patterns which lead to metabolic disorders related to obesity including insulin resistance which represents the fundamental characteristic of T2DM. The worldwide increase in obesity rates demonstrates the growing importance of adipokines because they drive metabolic disorder pathophysiology and boost chronic disease risks including diabetes and cardiovascular conditions along with inflammation [<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In obesity, adipose tissue changes structurally and functionally; this leads to imbalances in adipokine release, leading to insulin resistance and persistent low-grade inflammation. Elevation in proinflammatory adipokines for example TNF &#x003b1; and IL 6 is seen in obese people, and this contributes to systemic inflammation leading to further worsening of metabolic disturbances. On the other hand, individuals with obesity or metabolic syndrome often exhibit low levels of adiponectin, a molecule that normally protects against inflammation and insulin resistance [<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Since adipokines play critical roles in metabolic regulation and are linked to obesity-related diseases, adipokines have become targets for therapeutic intervention [<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. New treatment strategies for obesity and its comorbidities require understanding of adipokine secretion and its influence on various metabolic pathways. The functions of these important adipokines in obesity and metabolic diseases have been addressed in this review.</p><p>The objective of this review is to understand the intricate interaction between adipokines and body composition during obesity and metabolic disease. Changes in body fat distribution modify adipokine profiles and how adipokines in turn influence body composition and metabolic health are evaluated. We synthesize recent findings to understand how adipokines are bidirectionally related to body composition and potential therapeutic targets to alleviate metabolic dysfunctions associated with obesity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="review"><title>Review</title><p>Adipose tissue: an endocrine organ</p><p>Adipose tissue, which has long been thought of as an inactive organ for storing energy, has recently been identified as a dynamic endocrine organ involved in metabolic regulation.</p><p>In general, adipose tissue was once considered merely a triglyceride depot, a place where triglycerides were stored to be mobilized when calories were insufficient. The discovery of leptin in 1994, an adipocyte-secreted hormone that controls appetite and energy balance, shifted this perspective further with the discovery of adipose tissue's endocrine functions [<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Since then, numerous adipocyte-derived hormones (collectively referred to as adipokines) that affect several physiological processes involving insulin sensitivity, inflammation, and lipid metabolism&#x000a0;have been identified [<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Secretion of adipokines and their systemic effects</p><p>These adipokines show dysregulated secretion and activity patterns which lead to metabolic disorders related to obesity including insulin resistance which represents the fundamental characteristic of T2DM.

It tells the hypothalamus to keep us from overeating and burn more calories. However, in obesity, elevated levels of leptin cannot trigger these effects because leptin has become "leptin resistant",&#x000a0;adding to further weight gain and metabolic dysregulation. These studies demonstrated that a major factor is leptin's inability to cross the blood-brain barrier in obese individuals [<xref rid="REF14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>Adiponectin demonstrating anti-inflammatory and insulin-sensitive properties</p><p>Adiponectin is the only adipokine whose levels decrease with increasing obesity. It increases the sensitivity of skeletal muscle and liver insulin to transport glucose across the cell surface and eliminate fatty acids. Adiponectin also has anti-inflammatory properties, opposing the actions of proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF&#x003b1;, which are increased in obesity. In obesity, adiponectin is reduced; this increases the risk of T2D and cardiovascular disease and exacerbates insulin resistance [<xref rid="REF15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>Resistin linked to insulin resistance and inflammation</p><p>Insulin resistance and chronic inflammation have been linked to resistin released by adipocytes. In humans, macrophages within adipose tissue secrete resistin rather than adipocytes. In obese individuals, elevated resistin levels correlate with increased inflammatory markers and decreased insulin sensitivity [<xref rid="REF16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. However, the exact ways that resistin influences glucose metabolism are unknown.</p><p>Other emerging adipokines: roles and clinical implications</p><p>Recent years have seen the identification of novel adipokines with significant roles in metabolic regulation.</p><p>Visfatin</p><p>Visfatin was initially thought to act like insulin, and it regulates glucose metabolism and is elevated in obesity. Nevertheless, there is conflicting data about its exact function in metabolic diseases [<xref rid="REF17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>Omentin</p><p>Omentin is secreted primarily by visceral adipose tissue, promotes insulin action, and has anti-inflammatory effects. Low levels of omentin are related to cardiovascular risk, insulin resistance, and obesity [<xref rid="REF18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>Chemerin</p><p>Adipogenesis, inflammation, and glucose homeostasis are regulated by chemerin. Chemerin levels are higher in obesity, T2DM, and metabolic syndrome [<xref rid="REF19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>Visceral vs. subcutaneous fat</p><p>The two primary types of adipose tissue are visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT). Internal organs are surrounded by VAT inside the abdominal cavity; SAT lies under the skin.&#x000a0;VAT reduction interventions tend to be more effective than general fat loss because of VAT's significant link to metabolic disorders including insulin resistance and cardiovascular diseases. Insulin sensitivity improves while inflammation decreases and related condition risks reduce when VAT levels drop. Targeted reduction of VAT leads to superior metabolic health improvements compared to overall body fat loss. The metabolic profiles and adipokine secretion patterns of these fat depots differentiate them. VAT is metabolically active and contributes to systemic inflammation and insulin resistance by secreting increased amounts of pro-inflammatory adipokines, including tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-&#x003b1;) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) [<xref rid="REF20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. However, SAT releases adiponectin, which has anti-inflammatory and insulin-sensitizing properties [<xref rid="REF21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The VAT-to-SAT ratio is related to increased metabolic risk, which includes cardiovascular disease and T2DM.</p><p>Muscle mass and its interaction with adipokines</p><p>Through its dual function as a movement provider and an endocrine organ that releases myokines which work alongside adipokines, skeletal muscle maintains metabolic homeostasis [<xref rid="REF22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Research demonstrates that sufficient muscle mass enhances insulin sensitivity while adjusting adipokine profiles to produce elevated adiponectin levels and lower pro-inflammatory adipokine secretion. This interaction plays an important role in lessening metabolic disease risks including type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease [<xref rid="REF23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Sarcopenia manifests through reduced muscle mass which produces worsened insulin resistance together with unfavorable adipokine secretion patterns that drive obesity-related metabolic disorders forward.</p><p>Effects of weight loss and gain on adipokine levels</p><p>Body weight fluctuations create direct changes in adipokine secretion which affects metabolic health. When weight gain occurs alongside increased VAT, individuals experience higher levels of pro-inflammatory adipokines and diminished adiponectin which leads to greater insulin resistance in addition to systemic inflammation [<xref rid="REF24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. When obese patients lose weight through exercise and dietary changes, they can improve their adipokine balances by reducing inflammatory proteins while boosting adiponectin levels [<xref rid="REF25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. These changes improve insulin sensitivity while lowering inflammation which leads to sustained metabolic advantages and lowers obesity-related disease risks.</p><p>Body composition and its impact on adipokine secretion</p><p>Adipokine secretion is influenced significantly by the adipose tissue distribution, muscle mass, and degree of weight change and thereby metabolic health.

Obesity leads to abnormal adipokine production which establishes connections with chronic inflammation and insulin resistance along with additional metabolic diseases. Through an analysis of adipokine functions, this review examines their impact on metabolic dysregulation by evaluating their involvement in inflammatory processes as well as insulin signaling and hormonal system interactions to understand their multifaceted role in metabolic diseases.</p><p>Inflammatory pathways mediated by adipokines</p><p>Adipokine dysregulation and obesity are related to low-grade chronic inflammation. Not only is this inflammation confined within adipose tissue, but it is systemic and affects other organs and tissues. Key mediators of this inflammatory response are several adipokines, especially those secreted by VAT. Adipokines are proinflammatory, such as TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-6, and resistin, which participate in inflammation and activation of other inflammatory pathways that lead to insulin resistance and metabolic diseases. TNF-&#x003b1; stimulation of the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-&#x003ba;B) pathway is one example, which downstream leads to pro-inflammatory gene expression. The consequence is an enhanced secretion of cytokines and chemokines that perpetuate systemic inflammation [<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. IL-6 triggers inflammatory cascades, inhibits insulin signaling, and promotes the "Janus Kinase/Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription" (JAK/STAT) pathway [<xref rid="REF30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In addition to disrupting insulin action in peripheral tissues, these inflammatory responses contribute to the increase of metabolic syndrome T2DM and cardiovascular diseases (Figure <xref rid="FIG1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).</p><fig position="anchor" fig-type="figure" id="FIG1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Impact of adipokine dysregulation on metabolic diseases</title><p>Image credit: Author</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="cureus-0017-00000078050-i01" position="float"/></fig><p>Adipokine influence on insulin signaling</p><p>Obesity and metabolic disease are defined by insulin resistance. Dysregulation of adipokines is centrally important in controlling insulin sensitivity and their dysregulation has a major impact on insulin signaling. One of the most studied adipokines in relation to insulin sensitivity is adiponectin, an anti-inflammatory adipokine. With the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in the muscles and liver, adiponectin can increase insulin sensitivity by encouraging fatty acid oxidation and glucose absorption in the muscles and liver [<xref rid="REF31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Adiponectin levels are reduced in obese individuals and insulin resistance, which indicates the protective role of adiponectin in ensuring glucose homeostasis.</p><p>In contrast, proinflammatory adipokines including TNF-&#x003b1;, resistin, and IL-6 also disrupt insulin signaling. For instance, insulin receptor substrate (IRS) proteins are serine phosphorylated by TNF-&#x003b1;, which starts the disintegration of the insulin signaling pathway and the emergence of insulin resistance. Resistin has been shown to inhibit insulin's ability to enhance glucose absorption in adipocytes and myocytes, hence reducing insulin sensitivity. In addition, IL-6 acts on insulin signaling through inflammatory pathways that activate the suppression of normal insulin receptor function [<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].

They interact with other hormonal systems to control metabolic processes. The "hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal" axis, which controls stress responses, has a crucial relationship with adipokines. It has been shown that cortisol, a stress-induced hormone, influences adipokine secretion. Obesity involves elevated levels of cortisol that indirectly encourage the secretion of TNF-&#x003b1; and IL6, two adipokines that cause inflammation, which increases metabolic dysfunctions [<xref rid="REF36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p><p>Adipokines also have another important interaction with the autonomic nervous system (ANS). Adipokine secretion is influenced by catecholamines released from the ANS. One example is the release of norepinephrine from sympathetic nerve fibers altering adiponectin and resistin secretion [<xref rid="REF37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The sympathetic nervous system is often overactive in individuals with obesity and this dysregulated adipokine profile contributes to metabolic dysfunction.</p><p>Additionally, adipokines also interact with gastrointestinal hormones, like ghrelin and leptin. Adipocytes produce leptin, and it is known to regulate appetite and energy balance. It tells the hypothalamus to reduce hunger and burn more energy. Despite this, however, in obesity leptin resistance occurs with leptin failing to regulate these processes, resulting in overeating and weight gain [<xref rid="REF28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Interactions with adipokines are key to ghrelin's role in appetite and energy balance regulation, but ghrelin secretion is disrupted in obesity and contributes to metabolic dysregulation (Figure <xref rid="FIG2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) [<xref rid="REF38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].</p><fig position="anchor" fig-type="figure" id="FIG2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Hormonal interactions mediated by adipokines in metabolic regulation</title><p>Image credit: Author</p><p>ANS: Autonomic nervous system</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="cureus-0017-00000078050-i02" position="float"/></fig><p>Clinical implications and therapeutic potential</p><p>Our understanding of obesity and related diseases has not only progressed but also provided many clinical implications of the intricate relationship between adipokines and metabolic diseases. Adipokines are ideal biomarkers for metabolic diseases and targeting adipokine pathways may be a new therapeutic strategy. In addition, lifestyle interventions, including diet and exercise, affect adipokine profiles that can be used to affect metabolic health.</p><p>Adipokines as Biomarkers for Metabolic Diseases</p><p>Adipokines play a progressively important role as biomarkers for the analysis, prognosis, and therapy of metabolic disorders, including obesity, T2D (Type 2 diabetes), and cardiovascular diseases. Given their roles in regulating metabolic processes such as insulin sensitivity, inflammation, and lipid metabolism, they are ideal candidates to reflect the underlying pathophysiology of these conditions. For example, adiponectin, a well-established biomarker of insulin sensitivity, is inversely correlated with visceral fat. Adiponectin is being used as a diagnostic tool to predict T2DM and metabolic syndrome since it is associated with obesity and insulin resistance [<xref rid="REF39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Likewise, leptin, a marker of fat mass that regulates appetite and energy balance, can be elevated in obesity and be a marker of leptin resistance (increased appetite and weight gain)&#x000a0;(Table <xref rid="TAB5" ref-type="table">5</xref>) [<xref rid="REF40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].</p><table-wrap position="float" id="TAB5"><label>Table 5</label><caption><title>Adipokines as biomarkers for metabolic diseases</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr style="background-color:#ccc"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Adipokine</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Role in Metabolic Disease</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Clinical Implication</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Reference</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Adiponectin</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Inversely correlated with insulin resistance and obesity</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Potential biomarker for diagnosing insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">[<xref rid="REF39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]</td></tr><tr style="background-color:#ccc"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Leptin</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Reflects fat mass, elevated in obesity, associated with leptin resistance</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Can be used as a marker for obesity-related metabolic disturbances</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">[<xref rid="REF40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Resistin</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Linked to insulin resistance and inflammation</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Elevated levels correlate with cardiovascular risk and insulin resistance</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">[<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</td></tr><tr style="background-color:#ccc"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">TNF-&#x003b1;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Pro-inflammatory, linked to insulin resistance</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Elevated levels are associated with obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">[<xref rid="REF41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>In contrast, resistin is a pro-inflammatory adipokine related to cardiovascular risk factors and insulin resistance. It is elevated in people with obesity and may be a marker of metabolic dysfunction. Resistin levels have also been found to be elevated in association with a high risk of atherosclerosis and other cardiovascular diseases [<xref rid="REF10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Early detection of metabolic disturbance and stratification of patients for personalized intervention can be enabled by measuring adipokines such as adiponectin, leptin, resistin, and TNF-&#x003b1; [<xref rid="REF41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].</p><p>Targeting Adipokine Pathways: Treatment Strategies</p><p>Given the critical role of adipokines in metabolic dysregulation, therapeutic strategies targeting adipokine pathways are under investigation as potential treatments for obesity, and obesity-associated metabolic diseases, such as insulin resistance [<xref rid="REF42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].</p><p>Another promising therapeutical target is resistin antagonists. It may be possible to reduce insulin resistance and improve glucose metabolism by "weakening" resistin's pro-inflammatory effects. Several studies have shown that blocking resistin decreases insulin sensitivity in animal models [<xref rid="REF43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Additionally, TNF-&#x003b1; inhibitors have been tested to attenuate the inflammatory burden in obesity and improve insulin sensitivity&#x000a0;and prevent progression of metabolic diseases. Obese individuals have been shown to have reduced markers of inflammation and improved metabolic parameters with anti-TNF-&#x003b1; therapies (such as infliximab) [<xref rid="REF44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>].</p><p>While promising, these targeted therapeutic strategies are yet to reach the clinical stage, with further clinical trials necessary to determine their safety and efficacy in humans.</p><p>Lifestyle Interventions: Adipokine Profiles</p><p>The effects of dietary adaptations and exercise on adipokine secretion exist but this information does not directly support our treatment hypothesis which investigates adipokine functions in metabolic regulation. We have discussed how adipokine levels respond to physiological changes from weight loss and weight gain because these responses affect insulin sensitivity and metabolic health. Our study should focus on demonstrating how weight-induced changes in adipokine patterns help regulate metabolic disease processes. The discussion of calorie restriction and exercise should become part of total weight management strategies instead of existing as separate methods (Figure <xref rid="FIG3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).</p><fig position="anchor" fig-type="figure" id="FIG3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Effects of lifestyle interventions on adipokine profiles</title><p>Image credit: Author</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="cureus-0017-00000078050-i03" position="float"/></fig><p>Dietary Interventions</p><p>Studies have indicated that diets rich in omega-3 fatty acids, low in saturated fats, and high in fiber raise adiponectin levels&#x000a0;enhance insulin sensitivity&#x000a0;and lower inflammation. Conversely, adiponectin levels are reduced and proinflammatory adipokines such as TNF-&#x003b1; and IL6 are increased by high-fat diets, especially those high in trans fats [<xref rid="REF45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].</p><p>Exercise</p><p>The other potent modulator of adipokine profiles is regular physical activity. Adiponectin levels can be increased by both aerobic and resistance exercise, and both increase insulin sensitivity and decrease the secretion of pro-inflammatory adipokines. Exercise has been shown to reduce body fat, especially visceral fat, with reductions in body fat associated with improved adipokine profiles and reduced metabolic risk [<xref rid="REF46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. On top of that, exercise promotes the gain in muscle, which in turn regulates the secretion of myokines and adipokines and better metabolic health.</p><p>Weight Loss</p><p>Normal adipokine levels have been shown to be restored with weight reduction, either through bariatric surgery or intensive lifestyle interventions. In fact, high weight loss increases adiponectin levels and decreases proinflammatory cytokines, which leads to increased insulin sensitivity and decreased metabolic syndrome parameters [<xref rid="REF47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].</p><p>Current challenges and future directions</p><p>Research confirms that adipokines function as essential controllers of metabolic processes while serving as fundamental factors in obesity-related metabolic disease development. The absence of standardized assays to measure adipokines represents a fundamental obstacle in adipokine research because it restricts both the uniformity of results and their ability to be compared between different studies. Creating international guidelines together with calibration protocols represents a necessary step toward solving this measurement standardization problem. Standardized assays for adipokine measurement would produce accurate and reliable data collection which supports clinical application development. Moving forward research needs to concentrate on developing better measurement techniques alongside enhanced sensitivity and specificity as well as standardized protocols throughout both research laboratories and clinical environments. This review summarizes adipokines' therapeutic effects but recognizes that standardized measurement practices are essential for basic research progression and clinical application improvement.</p><p>Limitations in adipokine research</p><p>Although research on adipokines has been extensive, researchers still face significant limitations that prevent a complete understanding of adipokine regulation of metabolism and its role in disease processes. The main difficulty with adipokines lies in their diverse nature as bioactive molecules which both share functions and engage in complex interactions thereby complicating the identification of their exact impact on metabolic diseases. The extensive variation of adipokine levels between different populations and across genders and age groups creates difficulties in using them as dependable biomarkers for clinical applications. The concentrations of adipokines show major variations between different ethnic groups which complicates the creation of standard reference ranges or cutoffs. The variable nature of adipokines reduces their effectiveness as independent diagnostic tools for disease detection [<xref rid="REF47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. A more complete diagnostic approach emerges from pairing adipokine profiles with additional metabolic markers including glucose measurements alongside insulin and lipid profiles. The integrated approach offers a solution to adipokine level variability which enables more precise metabolic health assessments [<xref rid="REF48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>].</p><p>The review examines measurement difficulties for adipokines while demonstrating their possible therapeutic value which demands additional research and methodological improvements. This review presents the existing knowledge about adipokines and suggests research directions for future study while making clear that adipokine variability and complexity present opportunities for deeper research that will improve clinical applications.</p><p>Adipokine research faces challenges because scientists cannot determine direct causal links between adipokines and metabolic diseases. The observational nature of most current studies prevents researchers from reaching definitive conclusions about adipokine roles in the pathophysiology of cardiovascular disease, obesity, and insulin resistance. W&#x000fc;rfel et al. [<xref rid="REF49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] explain that adipokines represent possible treatment targets for obesity despite our incomplete understanding of their mechanisms of action on metabolic health. The clinical application of adipokines faces complexity because individual responses to these signaling proteins vary widely [<xref rid="REF49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>].</p><p>Personalized medicine approaches</p><p>Growing research evidence demonstrates how adipokines connect to metabolic diseases which positions them as promising biomarkers for advancing personalized medicine. Due to the variable adipokine levels among different populations and individuals, clinicians must establish frameworks that merge adipokine profiling with additional diagnostic methods to create effective treatment plans. Developing algorithms to merge adipokine measurements and genetic and metabolic alongside clinical data can provide complete metabolic health profiles for patients. Scientists may find anti-inflammatory treatments useful for patients who present raised levels of TNF-&#x003b1; or resistin pro-inflammatory adipokines to restore normal function within adipokine systems. The accuracy of medical diagnosis and treatment plans improves when personalized algorithms take into account variables like ethnicity, gender, and age along with clinical markers such as glucose and lipid profiles. An integrative strategy enables healthcare professionals to bypass current adipokine variability challenges which leads to better designed personalized treatment plans for patients. Although more evidence and validation are necessary, adipokine profiling together with other metabolic markers shows significant potential to propel personalized medicine forward.</p><p>Targeted therapies that modulate adipokine levels could also be part of personalized medicine. For instance, receptor agonists or gene therapy may be used to elevate adiponectin levels in individuals suffering from metabolic syndrome or T2DM. Likewise, leptin-based therapies may be beneficial in people with severe obesity and leptin resistance. Lifestyle interventions such as custom-designed dietary plans or personalized exercise programs could be included, based on the principle of tailoring these to adjust adipokine profiles in a way that promotes metabolic health.</p><p>Nevertheless, in order to realize personalized medicine strategies based on adipokines, we need to further elucidate the individual adipokine responses and develop precision medicine tools to measure the metabolic status of patients with accuracy.&#x000a0;</p><p>Emerging technologies in adipokine measurement</p><p>The precision of adipokine measurement has advanced through recent technological developments including mass spectrometry and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). Multiple adipokines undergo simultaneous accurate analysis through mass spectrometry while scRNA-seq provides detailed cellular-level expression insights. Improved diagnostic precision from recent developments enables adipokines to serve as dependable biomarkers that support early disease discovery and individualized therapeutic approaches [<xref rid="REF46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Limitations of traditional methods of adipokine measurement include low sensitivity, low specificity, and low throughput. However, mass spectrometry (MS) has become a more precise and higher throughput tool for quantifying adipokines and profiling their molecular forms. MS-based techniques can identify novel adipokines and measure their isoforms, which may provide novel insight into their function and their role in metabolic disease [<xref rid="REF50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>].</p><p>Biosensor development for real-time adipokine monitoring is another emerging technology. Continuous monitoring of patients' adipokine concentrations could be enabled by these sensors, enabling personalized treatment adjustments. The development of portable, cost-effective devices for adipokine measurement is being enabled by recent advances in microfluidics and lab-on-a-chip technology. The potential of these technologies to dramatically transform how adipokine profiles are monitored could mean frequent, accurate measurements are possible.</p><p>The combination of MS with scRNA-seq&#x000a0;represents a transformative opportunity for adipokine-related diagnostic methodologies. Through MS, scientists achieve accurate adipokine measurements which enable them to construct comprehensive profiles for early disease detection and treatment assessment. The simultaneous analysis capability of this method enhances diagnostic accuracy by measuring multiple adipokines at once [<xref rid="REF50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. The examination of cellular heterogeneity helps researchers understand adipokine regulation of metabolism. These combined technologies enable personalized medical approaches while advancing disease monitoring capabilities and expanding knowledge about metabolic conditions [<xref rid="REF51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The review examines how adipokines regulate metabolic diseases by affecting critical body functions including inflammation and insulin sensitivity along with energy metabolism. Despite substantial advances in deciphering their mechanisms of action scientists face ongoing obstacles because of their intricate nature and variable characteristics alongside the challenge of proving direct disease connections. The adipokines adiponectin, leptin, and resistin serve essential functions in the development of obesity and cardiovascular diseases as well as insulin resistance. Non-pharmacological disease management strategies emerge from diet and exercise interventions that demonstrate capability to adjust adipokine levels. Mass spectrometry together with biosensors and single-cell RNA sequencing represent breakthrough tools that enhance diagnostic accuracy and therapeutic monitoring capabilities. The progress achieved so far requires additional research to solve current problems including better measurement accuracy of adipokines and understanding their various functions in different populations. Overcoming present research limitations demands the establishment of standardized measurement protocols alongside longitudinal studies. Successful adipokine research progress and targeted therapeutic development depend on interdisciplinary partnerships among endocrinologists, data scientists, and bioengineers. Such research activities will establish foundations for developing improved medical interventions against obesity and its metabolic complications.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group content-type="conflict"><title>Disclosures</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Conflicts of interest:</bold> In compliance with the ICMJE uniform disclosure form, all authors declare the following:</p><p><bold>Payment/services info:</bold> All authors have declared that no financial support was received from any organization for the submitted work.</p><p><bold>Financial relationships:</bold> All authors have declared that they have no financial relationships at present or within the previous three years with any organizations that might have an interest in the submitted work.</p><p><bold>Other relationships:</bold> All authors have declared that there are no other relationships or activities that could appear to have influenced the submitted work.</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="other"><title>Author Contributions</title><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Concept and design:</bold>&#x000a0; Umesh Zadgaonkar</p><p><bold>Acquisition, analysis, or interpretation of data:</bold>&#x000a0; Umesh Zadgaonkar</p><p><bold>Drafting of the manuscript:</bold>&#x000a0; Umesh Zadgaonkar</p><p><bold>Critical review of the manuscript for important intellectual content:</bold>&#x000a0; Umesh Zadgaonkar</p><p><bold>Supervision:</bold>&#x000a0; Umesh Zadgaonkar</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="REF1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="webpage"><article-title>World Health Organization.
