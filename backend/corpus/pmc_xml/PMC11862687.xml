Advances in molecular biology have improved detection and treatment, but conventional histopathological factors remain crucial for prognosis. Tumour budding, defined as clusters of less than 5 tumour cells detached from the main tumour, has been linked to poor prognosis in several cancers. This study explores the association between intra-tumoral budding (ITB) and peripheral tumour budding (PTB) with known prognostic factors in Invasive Breast Carcinoma of no special type (IBC NST).</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and methods</title><p>This retrospective study analysed 70 cases of IBC NST diagnosed at Kasturba Medical College, Manipal, between January 2020 and December 2021. Tumour budding was classified as high-grade or low-grade based on density, which denotes the number of buds per x20 field. Clinicopathological data, including hormone receptor status, Ki-67 index, lymphovascular invasion (LVI), perineural invasion (PNI), and axillary lymph node involvement, were obtained. Statistical analyses were performed to identify a significant association between tumour budding and these factors. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were also done to demonstrate the significance of association.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>High-grade PTB showed significant associations with LVI (p = 0.046), PNI (p = 0.017), and axillary lymph node involvement (p = 0.021). In contrast, high-grade ITB was only significantly correlated with axillary lymph node involvement (p = 0.044). LVI (p-value = 0.240) and axillary lymph node involvement (p-value = 0.142) did not show any association with PTB on multivariate analysis and PNI (p-value = 0.074) near significant association with PTB). A significant inverse association was observed between PTB and Ki-67 (p = 0.012), which remained significant in univariate and multivariate analysis (p-value = 0.017). No significant associations were found between tumour budding and hormone receptor status or menopausal status.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Peripheral tumour budding (PTB) is significantly associated with several poor prognostic factors in IBC NST, while intra-tumoral budding (ITB) correlates primarily with axillary lymph node involvement. Tumor budding, particularly PTB, could serve as an important prognostic marker in breast cancer. Further research is needed to standardize tumour budding assessment in clinical practice.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>invasive breast carcinoma</kwd><kwd>intra tumoral budding</kwd><kwd>peripheral tumour budding</kwd><kwd>prognostic parameters</kwd><kwd>Ki-67</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>The author(s) declare that no financial support was received for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</funding-statement></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Breast cancer is one of the most highly prevalent malignancies in women and causes considerable morbidity and mortality [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. There were an estimated 20 million new breast cancer cases worldwide and 9.7 million cancer deaths in 2022, with the majority of them being in Asia [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The advances in genetics and molecular biology have improved the detection and treatment of breast carcinomas, which in turn have led to better outcomes. However, conventional histopathological prognostic parameters still play a crucial role in prognostication of breast cancers. Hence, identifying more meaningful and reliable histopathological factors to complement the current evaluation protocols is essential, and this is where tumour budding becomes relevant [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Tumour budding is a pathological phenomenon associated with many cancers. Its definition varies from study to study but generally is defined as a cluster of 5 or fewer tumour cells which have detached from the bulk of the tumour and which don&#x02019;t show features of differentiation [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. They can be observed at the invasive margins of the tumour and are called peritumoral or peripheral tumour buds (PTB), while those that are seen in the tumour mass are called intra-tumoral buds (ITB) [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>At the molecular level, they are hypothesised to be the histological manifestations of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). EMT is thought to be a multi-step, dynamic phenomenon that occurs in epithelial cells, where they lose their ability to adhere to their neighbouring cell and develop migratory and invasive characteristics like mesenchymal cells [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Both EMT and its opposite process, mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET), are physiological processes that are important for tissue repair, wound healing and embryonic development. The abnormal activation of EMT is now recognized as a key characteristic of cancer metastasis [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Hence, tumour budding was also thought to be a general invasive indicator and a poor prognostic factor.</p><p>The association between tumour budding with cancers were first described in 1949 by Imai with respect to gastric cancers [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Now, tumour budding is recognised as an aggressive and prognostic indicator in colorectal, oesophageal and gastric cancers [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However, there is limited information about the role and relevance of tumour budding in breast cancers. So, this study attempts to correlate tumour budding, both intra-tumoral and peripheral tumour budding to known clinicopathological prognostic factors of breast carcinoma and hormone receptor status.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>This retrospective observational study was done in the Department of Pathology, Kasturba Medical College, Manipal Academy of Higher Education, Manipal over 2&#x000a0;years from 1st January 2020 to 31st December 2021.</p><p>All cases diagnosed as Invasive Breast Carcinoma, no special type (IBC NST) and who underwent surgical resection (Radical or simple mastectomy) in our hospital were included. Patients who underwent core biopsy or lumpectomy, who received any pre-surgical therapy, who were identified to have distant metastasis at the time of primary tumour diagnosis or where clinical data and histopathological slides were unavailable, were excluded from the study. Patients with only core biopsy done were excluded from the study but the ones followed by radical or simple mastectomy were included in the study. Breast conservation surgery specimens were limited in number and were excluded.</p><p>The clinical details of these patients such as age, sex, presenting symptoms, details of previous therapy, radiological details and follow-up were retrieved from LIS/RISPACS/EMR discharge summaries and the Medical Records Department. The paraffin blocks and haematoxylin and eosin (H&#x00026;E) stained slides for the corresponding case numbers of each patient were retrieved from the pathology archives. The gross features were analysed from the pathology reports in the database.

However, the correlation between tumour budding and menopausal status was not statistically significant. Tumour budding generally remained low-grade across all tumour size groups, though high-grade ITB was present in 83.3% of tumours smaller than 2&#x000a0;cm. Despite this observation, p-values indicated no statistically significant difference in tumour budding distribution across different tumour sizes for ITB and PTB.</p><p>Grade 1 tumours showed a high proportion of low-grade ITB and PTB, while high-grade ITB was most prevalent in grade 2 tumours, and high-grade PTB was most common in grade 3 tumours. However, these correlations were not statistically significant. High-grade PTB was significantly associated with lymphovascular (p = 0.046) and perineural invasion (p = 0.017). In contrast, despite being more frequent in cases with LVI and PNI, high-grade ITB did not show a significant correlation. Both high-grade ITB (p = 0.044) and PTB (p = 0.021) were significantly linked to axillary lymph node involvement.</p><p>In terms of breast cancer subtypes, high-grade ITB and PTB were more frequently observed in Luminal A type cancers, with the lowest proportions found in triple-negative breast cancers. However, this correlation was not significant (p-values of 0.801 for ITB and 0.183 for PTB). High-grade tumour budding was more common in tumours with low Ki-67 index (0%&#x02013;20%) for both ITB (41.7%) and PTB (58.3%), with the correlation being significant for PTB (p = 0.012).</p><p>LVI (p-value = 0.050), PNI (p-value = 0.025), axillary lymph node involvement (p-value = 0.027), and Ki-67 (p-value = 0.018), index showed significant association with PTB on univariate logistic regression analysis, while only Ki-67 (p-value = 0.017) index showed significant association with PTB on multivariate logistic regression analysis, although PNI (p-value = 0.074) showed near significance.

id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>Breast carcinoma is one of the most prevalent cancers worldwide, contributing significantly to mortality and morbidity. Consequently, extensive research has been conducted to identify prognostic factors associated with the disease, aiming to reduce its impact. This study attempts to correlate tumour budding, which has been established as a prognostic factor in other carcinomas, with known clinicopathological prognostic factors for breast carcinoma.</p><p>All patients in this study were female, consistent with the findings of Agarwal et al. [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], Liang et al. [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], and Salhia et al. [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. However, Silva et al. [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] reported 2% of cases being male and 98% female. In this study, 36 (51.4%) patients were post-menopausal, aligning with the findings of Gonz&#x000e1;lez et al. [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and Mozarowski et al. [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In contrast, Agarwal et al. [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] reported that 55% of patients were pre-menopausal, a difference likely due to the fact that only 14 (35%) of cases in Agarwal&#x02019;s study involved patients over 50, while in the present study, 29 (41.4%) were over 60&#x000a0;years old.</p><p>The tumour size distribution in this study, with a maximum dimension of 2&#x02013;5&#x000a0;cm, mirrors the findings of Chandana et al. [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], Agarwal et al. [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and Singh et al. [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] grouped tumours into two categories (&#x02264;5&#x000a0;cm and &#x0003e;5&#x000a0;cm) and similarly found that most tumours were 5&#x000a0;cm or smaller. Gujam et al. [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], however, found that most tumours were &#x02264;2&#x000a0;cm, a difference that may be attributed to geographical and economic factors, as the study was conducted in the UK, where greater patient awareness and better access to screening lead to earlier diagnosis.</p><p>In this study, most cases were of Nottingham Grade 2 (n = 32, 45.7%), consistent with the findings of Salhia et al. [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and Chandana et al. [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Similarly, Liang et al. [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and Singh et al. [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] reported approximately 70% of cases as Grade 2. However, studies by Agarwal et al. [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], Muda et al. [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], and Rathod et al. [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] reported a higher proportion of Grade 3 tumours, which could be due to differences in sample size, inter-observer variability in applying grading criteria, temporal variations and population differences.</p><p>Lymphovascular invasion (LVI) was found in 29 (41.4%) cases, consistent with the findings of Agarwal et al. [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], Liang et al. [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], Salhia et al. [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], Gupta et al. [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], and &#x000d6;zt&#x000fc;rk et al. [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. However, discordance was noted in the studies by Muda et al. [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], Singh et al. [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], and Kumarguru et al. [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Perineural invasion was observed in only a minority of cases, similar to the findings of Salhia et al. [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], Muda et al. [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], and &#x000d6;zt&#x000fc;rk et al [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>Axillary lymph node status is a critical prognostic indicator in breast carcinoma. In this study, 41 (58.6%) cases showed axillary lymph node positivity, consistent with the observations of Agarwal et al. [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], Singh et al. [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], Rathod et al. [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], and Kumarguru et al [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Discordance was noted in the studies by Gupta et al. [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and Chandana et al. [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], which reported lower lymph node positivity, likely due to smaller sample sizes and lower LVI frequency, which is positively associated with lymph node metastasis. However, LVI (p-value = 0.240) and axillary lymph node involvement (p-value = 0.142) did not show any association with PTB on multivariate analysis and PNI (p-value = 0.074) near significant association with PTB. Only axillary lymph node involvement (p-value = 0.048) showed a significant association with ITB on univariate analysis.</p><p>The majority of cases in this study were of the Luminal B subtype, similar to Silva et al. [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] findings. However, Gonz&#x000e1;lez et al. [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and Masilamani et al. [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] reported a higher proportion of Luminal A cases, which could be attributed to variations in sample size, geographical, and ethnic differences in the population studied.</p><p>In correlation with patient age, both intra-tumoral budding (ITB) and peri-tumoral budding (PTB) exhibited higher-grade budding in older age groups, which aligns with the findings of Liang et al. [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], Gujam et al. [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], and Gonz&#x000e1;lez et al. [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] However, most studies, including this one, did not find a statistically significant association between tumour budding and age.</p><p>In this study, we observed a decrease in the proportion of high-grade PTB as tumour size increased, although this finding was not statistically significant (p = 0.361). This is contrary to the majority of studies, including those by Liang et al. [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], Agarwal et al. [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], Kumaraguru et al. [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], &#x000d6;zt&#x000fc;rk et al [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], Silva et al. [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], and Muda et al. [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], which found that high-grade tumour budding was more common in larger tumours, with statistically significant associations. For ITB, a similar pattern of decreasing high-grade budding with increasing tumour size was observed (p = 0.184), while Singh et al. [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] reported increased high-grade budding in both small and large tumours. The discrepancy in findings may be because many cases with tumours smaller than 2&#x000a0;cm had positive axillary lymph node involvement or lymphovascular invasion, which could act as confounding factors.</p><p>No significant association between histologic tumour grade and tumour budding was found in either ITB or PTB. In ITB, a higher proportion of high-grade budding was observed in Grade 2 tumours, consistent with the findings of Singh et al. [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and Salhia et al. [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], although the association in this study was not statistically significant. The lack of significance may be attributed to the smaller sample size. In PTB, high-grade budding increased with tumour grade (p = 0.764), which is in line with the findings of Agarwal et al. [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and Muda et al. [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], although Liang et al. [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] reported more high-grade budding in Grade 2 tumours. Muda et al. [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] also found a statistically significant association.</p><p>This study found a greater proportion of high-grade PTB in Luminal A subtypes, consistent with the findings of Gujam et al. [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and Masilamani et al. [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], while &#x000d6;zt&#x000fc;rk et al. [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] reported more high-grade PTB in Luminal B cases. For ITB, Salhia et al. [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] reported greater high-grade budding in the Luminal A subtype, which is consistent with the findings of this study.</p><p>This study also explored the relationship between Ki-67 and tumour budding (both ITB and PTB), revealing a significant inverse association between PTB and Ki-67 (p = 0.012), which persisted in both univariate and multivariate analyses. Ki-67 serves as a marker of tumour proliferative activity, while tumour budding reflects the tumour&#x02019;s invasive and metastatic potential. Studies on p16(INK4a) and Ki-67 have demonstrated a cessation of proliferative activity at the invasive front of tumours, suggesting that invasion is not synonymous with proliferation. Our findings align with this concept, as the inverse relationship between PTB and Ki-67 indicates a phenotypic shift in tumour cells from a proliferative state to an invasive one [<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Liang et al. [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] had previously validated that budded cells exhibit lower proliferative activity than tumour cells in other areas of the tumour, consistent with studies on tumour budding in colorectal carcinomas.</p><p>The strength of this study lies in its comprehensive analysis of both ITB and PTB, examining their relationships with various established prognostic factors&#x02014;a focus rarely undertaken in previous research. Notably, we demonstrated that PTB is significantly associated with axillary lymph node positivity, LVI, PNI, and Ki-67, while ITB showed a correlation with axillary lymph node positivity. However, in multivariate analysis, only the association between PTB and Ki-67 remained significant.</p><p>The retrospective nature and the incorporation of only 70 cases of IBC NST are the limitations of this study as the small sample size limits the generalizability of the findings in this study and the retrospective nature limits the analysis to existing data, which might not have included all variables of interest. This in turn limits the ability to control the confounding factors and biases inherent in the data collection process. As the study was conducted in a single tertiary care centre, the external validity of the results can be in question as the findings might not apply to other populations. Our study mentions the lack of a standard method for quantifying tumour budding. This could have affected the consistency and reliability of the results. We also did not employ any immunohistochemical stains to assist in detecting tumour buds. For this study, we probably excluded some of the clinically relevant subgroups, e.g., post-neoadjuvant therapy cases or cases with breast conservative surgery. According to us, this study primarily focused on histopathological parameters and incorporated only limited follow-up data. Variables like long-term and disease-free survival were not analysed, which could be crucial for understanding the prognostic significance of tumour budding.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study evaluated tumour budding in terms of peripheral and intra-tumoral budding, categorising them into low-grade and high-grade. Peripheral tumour budding was significantly associated with several poor prognostic factors in invasive breast carcinoma of no special type, including LVI, PNI, and axillary lymph node involvement, however, no significant association was demonstrated in multivariate analysis. In contrast, intra-tumoral budding showed a significant association only with axillary lymph node involvement. Additionally, Ki-67 was seen to be inversely associated with peripheral tumour budding, even on multivariate analysis, suggesting that tumour proliferation and invasion are distinct processes. Given its potential prognostic value, tumour budding could be considered for inclusion in histopathological reporting protocols for breast carcinomas to complement conventional prognostic parameters. Further research is needed to establish a precise definition of tumour budding, including the number of cells forming a bud, the location of budding, standardized quantification methods, and the use of immunohistochemical stains to enhance detection.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s6"><title>Data availability statement</title><p>The original contributions presented in the study are included in the article, further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding author.</p></sec><sec sec-type="ethics-statement" id="s7"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>The studies involving humans were approved by IEC2:470/2022, Kasturba Hospital Institutional Ethical Committee.
