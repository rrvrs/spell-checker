This process leads to structural and functional losses in the cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, and metabolic systems, affecting individuals&#x02019; general health and quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. According to WHO data, the number of people aged 60 and over is expected to exceed 2 billion worldwide by 2050 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. This demographic change indicates that health problems such as cardiometabolic diseases, sarcopenia, and loss of functional independence, which are common in older people, will become more prevalent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">Cardiometabolic diseases increase rapidly during aging and negatively affect the quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and obesity are among the leading causes of cardiovascular diseases and mortality in older adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. A decrease in physical activity levels with aging accelerates the development of these diseases and increases the risk of chronic diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Lack of exercise negatively affects cardiovascular health, muscle strength, and metabolic functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">Regular physical activity significantly benefits cardiovascular health, muscle mass, metabolic function, and overall quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) and WHO recommend that older adults perform at least 150&#x000a0;min of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise or 75&#x000a0;min of high-intensity exercise per week [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. However, adherence to standard exercise programs is often difficult in older people due to time constraints and lack of motivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par9">In this context, high-intensity interval training (HIIT) has been identified as an alternative to moderate-intensity continuous exercise in cardiac rehabilitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. HIIT protocols involve alternating short periods of high-intensity exercise with brief rest intervals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. These intense workouts performed at 80&#x02013;95% of maximum heart rate and combined with low-intensity recovery periods yield effective results in a shorter time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. HIIT may be more effective than traditional moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT) in increasing aerobic capacity and reducing cardiometabolic risk factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par10">Considering the literature, HIIT significantly improves cardiorespiratory fitness (&#x00056;&#x00307;O&#x02082;peak), body composition, and metabolic parameters such as insulin sensitivity, glucose metabolism, and blood lipid profiles in older adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In particular, HIIT programs lasting 12&#x000a0;weeks and longer have been reported to increase maximum oxygen consumption (&#x00056;&#x00307;O&#x02082;peak), by 10&#x02013;30% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Furthermore, HIIT can prevent sarcopenia and improve functional independence by increasing muscle mass and strength [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In addition, HIIT has been reported to increase insulin sensitivity, improve glucose metabolism, and favourably affect lipid profiles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. However, HIIT is not only limited to physiological benefits but also positively affects quality of life. Research shows that participation in regular HIIT programs increases energy levels, facilitates activities of daily living, and significantly improves physical, psychological, and social areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Furthermore, through its modulatory effects on oxidative stress and inflammation, HIIT has been reported to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease and support cognitive function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p id="Par11">However, it is important to note that HIIT may not be suitable for all older individuals. Some studies have reported that HIIT could pose risks such as excessive cardiovascular stress, musculoskeletal injuries, or adverse events in individuals with multiple comorbidities. Therefore, careful medical screening, supervision, and program individualization are recommended before initiating HIIT in elderly populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p id="Par12">The current literature shows significant differences in HIIT protocols&#x02019; intensity, duration, and frequency, making it difficult to compare the results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Moreover, exercise modality also varies across studies (e.g., cycling, treadmill, resistance HIIT), further complicating synthesis and interpretation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In addition, follow-up studies evaluating the long-term safety of HIIT and its effects outside the cardiovascular system are lacking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. This highlights the need for longitudinal studies to evaluate the sustainability, adherence, and broader health impacts of HIIT programs in older adults.</p><p id="Par13">Given the chronic disease burden of older adults, larger-scale, well-designed studies are needed to understand the potential long-term effects of HIIT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. This study aimed to examine the effects of HIIT on cardiometabolic health and quality of life in older adults and to provide evidence-based information on the effectiveness of this type of exercise by meta-analyzing randomized controlled trials. Methodological heterogeneities and inconsistencies in current literature make it difficult to establish a clear framework for the effects of HIIT on the older population. This study aimed to fill these gaps and provide a more consistent analysis by evaluating different study protocols and providing findings that can guide health professionals in developing more effective and safer exercise programs for older adults.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Design</title><p id="Par14">Studies were reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) checklist (Supplementary File 1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Keywords were generated using the PICOS (participants, intervention, control, outcome, and study design) approach to search databases for relevant published articles (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). We focused on studies with a sample of older adults aged over 60&#x000a0;years, regardless of their health status (P). Accordingly, the study populations comprised healthy older adults and individuals with stable chronic conditions. Eligible chronic conditions included, but were not limited to, cardiovascular diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), heart failure, hypertension, and dementia. Studies were included if participants were not experiencing acute exacerbations of their conditions and were considered clinically stable. Interventions (I) included all interventions involving high-intensity interval exercise. Patients in the control group (C) did not receive these high-intensity exercise interventions. Studies focusing on cardiometabolic health parameters and quality of life as outcomes and reporting means, standard deviations (SD), and t-scores or <italic>p</italic>-values were considered (O). In this systematic review, cardiometabolic health outcomes were initially defined following widely accepted criteria in the literature, including cardiorespiratory fitness measures such as peak oxygen uptake (&#x00056;&#x00307;O&#x02082;peak), six-minute walk test (6MWT) performance, and gait speed and cardiovascular and metabolic parameters such as blood pressure, heart rate, lipid profile, blood glucose levels, insulin resistance indices, and body composition measurements. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) testing the effects of high-intensity interval exercise interventions among older adults were analyzed (S). Following the PICOS approach, we addressed the research question: &#x02018;Does high-intensity interval exercise affect cardiometabolic health and quality of life in older adults?&#x02019;.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>The initial database search strategy following PICOS elements</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left">Population</th><th align="left">Intervention</th><th align="left">Comparison intervention</th><th align="left">Outcome measure</th><th align="left">Study</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Older people</td><td align="left">High-intensity interval exercise interventions</td><td align="left">No receiving any high-intensity interval exercise intervention</td><td align="left">Cardiometabolic health and quality of life</td><td align="left">Randomized controlled trials</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p id="Par15">The inclusion criteria were: (a) involving participants aged 60&#x000a0;years or older; (b) RCT design; (c) examining the effects of high-intensity interval exercise interventions; (d) written in English; and (e) moderate or high methodological quality.

Titles and abstracts were then screened for the inclusion of an RCT with a high-intensity interval exercise intervention. When full texts were not available, they were requested from the authors. After the full texts were analyzed, the reasons for excluding the studies were written on the data extraction form. Pilot testing of the data extraction form was performed to increase its reliability and validity and to improve the quality and reliability of the systematic review or meta-analysis study. Firstly, a data extraction form was prepared following the purpose and criteria of the study. This form included the main characteristics of the studies, interventions, outcomes, and other relevant information. Several studies were randomly selected among the studies to be included to test the data extraction form. Three researchers (MGE, BG, and FK) independently extracted data from the selected studies using the form. The data extracted by these researchers were compared. This process was carried out to determine whether some parts of the form were clear, what information was missing, or what parts were confusing. The other researcher (HS) checked and revised the form, considering the problems and inconsistencies from the comparison. Once it was decided that there were no problems in the pilot tests, the form was finalized and used for the main study.</p><p id="Par18">The study authors, country, year of publication, sample size, participant characteristics (age and sex), inclusion criteria, disease type, intervention and control strategies, intervention providers, evaluation points, main outcome variables, and main findings of the study (mean, SD, or <italic>p</italic>-values and effect size) were recorded on a Microsoft Excel form with extracted data. Template for intervention description and replication (TIDieR) reporting guidelines were followed to report details of the interventions. This checklist included (1) the nature of the intervention, (2) the method and location of the intervention, (3) the number and duration of sessions, (4) the method of delivery of the intervention, and (5) the intervention areas.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Search outcomes</title><p id="Par19">For this systematic review and meta-analysis, the effects of high-intensity interval exercise on cardiometabolic health-related outcomes and the quality of life of older patients were analyzed. Outcome measures that were reported by at least three independent studies were included in the meta-analysis. Although conducting a meta-analysis with just two studies is technically possible, such analyses offer limited statistical power and restrict the accurate estimation of between-study heterogeneity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. To ensure the robustness and reliability of the pooled effect sizes, especially when applying a random-effects model, we followed the recommendation of including a minimum of three studies per analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. This approach also allowed for more meaningful interpretation of heterogeneity and increased the generalizability of the findings. In this regard, since 6MWT, &#x00056;&#x00307;O&#x02082;peak, and gait speed and quality of life were evaluated as outcome parameters in at least three studies included in the systematic review, these parameters were selected for meta-analysis in the subsequent process. In addition, these measures are sensitive to changes following exercise interventions and are commonly reported in HIIT studies. Including these tools allowed for a more consistent and comparable synthesis across studies. Accordingly, the meta-analysis was performed on the following outcome variables: 6MWT (m), gait speed (m/s), &#x00056;&#x00307;O&#x02082;peak (mL&#x000b7;kg&#x0207b;<sup>1</sup>&#x000b7;min&#x0207b;<sup>1</sup>), and quality of life (standardized mean scores based on self-reported questionnaires).</p><p id="Par20">6MWT: It was used in four included studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] as a measure of submaximal aerobic capacity and functional exercise performance in older adults. In this test, participants were instructed to walk along a flat, straight course for six minutes at their own pace, with the total distance walked (in meters) recorded as the primary outcome. The 6MWT reflects the integrated response of the cardiovascular, respiratory, and musculoskeletal systems and is a reliable and widely used assessment of physical function in both healthy individuals and those with chronic health conditions. Higher distances indicate better functional capacity and cardiopulmonary fitness.</p><p id="Par21">Gait speed: Gait speed was assessed as an indicator of lower extremity function and general physical performance in older adults across three studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. It was typically measured by timing participants as they walked over a set distance-commonly 4 or 10&#x000a0;m at their usual pace. The outcome was expressed in meters per second (m/s). Gait speed is widely recognized as a reliable and sensitive marker of functional mobility in older adults, and higher gait speed values indicate better physical function and mobility.</p><p id="Par22">&#x00056;&#x00307;O&#x02082;peak: It was determined as the highest 20-s averaged oxygen uptake value achieved during the incremental exercise protocol, reflecting maximal exercise capacity in two studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Among these studies, ventilation and pulmonary gas exchange were measured on a breath-by-breath basis using a tightly sealed face mask connected to a digital volume flow sensor and a rapid-response oxygen and carbon dioxide gas analyzer (Oxycon Pro).

Although gait speed is a widely used indicator of functional mobility and cardiovascular health in older adults, our meta-analysis found no statistically significant difference between the intervention and control groups.

First, the included studies demonstrated high heterogeneity (I<sup>2</sup>&#x02009;=&#x02009;96%), which likely influenced the pooled effect size and limited the estimate&#x02019;s precision. In addition, regarding publication bias, we acknowledge that the funnel plots for gait speed outcome revealed asymmetry, and the limited number of included studies (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;3) further complicates the interpretation. The variability in HIIT protocols, including session duration, frequency, intensity, and mode of exercise, may have contributed to inconsistent effects on gait speed. Second, participant baseline characteristics such as functional status, comorbidities, and physical frailty could have decreased the impact of HIIT interventions. For instance, older adults with lower baseline mobility or sarcopenia may require longer intervention periods to observe measurable changes in gait speed. Additionally, gait speed is a complex outcome influenced not only by cardiometabolic capacity but also by neuromuscular and biomechanical factors, which may not be equally affected by short-term HIIT interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>&#x00056;&#x00307;O&#x02082;peak</title><p id="Par45">HIIT trains many different muscles simultaneously and rapidly, and glycogenolysis in the muscles occurs faster.

During HIIT, heart rate reaches 85&#x02013;95% of maximum capacity, cardiac output increases, and mitochondrial production cells are activated in a cycle consisting of a balance between mitochondrial growth (biogenesis) and degradation (mitophagy) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. In this context, HIIT is an exercise intervention that significantly induces biogenesis and promotes remodeling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. Studies conducted on adult individuals with different disease groups have shown that HIIT regulates key mitochondrial enzymes such as citrate synthase (CS), PGC-1&#x003b1;, beta-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (&#x003b2;-HAD), and cytochrome C (COX-IV), while also enhancing mitochondrial protein synthesis and biogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>].</p><p id="Par46">In the meta-analysis conducted by Oliveira et al. (2024) evaluating the effects of HIIT and MICT on physical fitness in older adults, an increase in &#x00056;&#x00307;O&#x02082;peak values, a key cardiometabolic fitness parameter, was observed only in individuals who underwent HIIT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. In a meta-analysis study by Bouaziz et al. (2020) evaluating the effectiveness of HIIT and traditional endurance training in individuals aged 65&#x000a0;years and older, it was determined that individuals in the HIIT group had a greater improvement in &#x00056;&#x00307;O&#x02082;peak value [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. In a meta-analysis study by Leal et al. (2020) examining the effectiveness of HIIT versus MICT in hypertensive patients, it was found that HIIT intervention provided more favorable changes in diastolic blood pressure and &#x00056;&#x00307;O&#x02082;peak values [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. In the meta-analysis study by Wu et al. (2021) evaluating the effect of HIIT intervention on physical fitness, metabolic parameters, and cardiovascular fitness in older adults, it was determined that there was a greater increase in &#x00056;&#x00307;O&#x02082;peak value compared to MICT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In a meta-analysis study by Yue et al.

In meta-analysis studies in which different patient groups were included in the literature and the effect of HIIT on &#x00056;&#x00307;O&#x02082;peak value was examined, it was determined that there was an improvement in &#x00056;&#x00307;O&#x02082;peak value and cardiometabolic parameters of individuals who applied HIIT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]. In addition, randomized controlled trials in the literature, including older individuals with different disease diagnoses, found that HIIT intervention provided a greater increase in peak VO<sub>2</sub> compared to MICT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>]. On the other hand, in the study by Mueller et al.

Our findings, consistent with the literature, show that HIIT is an alternative, effective exercise intervention to increase &#x00056;&#x00307;O&#x02082;peak value evaluated within the scope of cardiorespiratory fitness by increasing aerobic capacity in older individuals.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Quality of life</title><p id="Par47">Quality of life is a concept that encompasses physical, psychological, social, emotional, economic, and cultural dimensions and expresses the individual&#x02019;s perception of their situation in life in terms of their goals, expectations, and concerns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>]. Exercise is essential to quality of life, and regular physical activity is vital to protect the older person&#x02019;s physical and mental health. Different exercise interventions applied to older individuals help to increase their functionality and independence in daily activities, reduce the likelihood of geriatric syndromes, and protect their psychological well-being [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>]. Baltasar-Fernandez et al. (2023) included 21 older individuals diagnosed with COPD, the patients were given HIIT for 12&#x000a0;weeks and it was found that the quality of life of the individuals in the intervention group was higher [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. A meta-analysis study by Herranz-G&#x000f3;mez et al. (2022) revealed that HIIT intervention had a positive effect on cardiorespiratory fitness and quality of life in individuals with cancer or cancer survivors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>]. The study by Deka et al. (2022) included elderly individuals with coronary artery disease; It was divided into two groups: HIIT&#x02009;+&#x02009;resistance exercise and control group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The physical capacity and quality of life of the older in the intervention group were found to be higher than the control group.

On the other hand, Reed et al. (2022) included 94 patients with atrial fibrillation and examined the effectiveness of HIIT and MICT programs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. It was determined that there was no significant increase in disease-specific and general quality of life in both intervention groups. Our study findings are consistent with the literature, and high-intensity interval exercise positively affects quality of life variables in which psychosocial status is evaluated in addition to physical parameters in older individuals. On the other hand, the important point to remember is that there is heterogeneity among the studies included in this meta-analysis. The first factor that causes this heterogeneity is sample characteristics. The studies included in our meta-analysis included patients with different comorbidities such as COPD, diabetes, coronary artery disease, heart failure, dementia, and healthy older adults. Patients with different medical diagnoses may change the effects of HIIT. The second factor is the difference in intervention protocols. HIIT applied to patients with different durations, frequencies, and protocols may be a factor that changes the size of the observed effects. The scales used to evaluate the parameters we examined in the studies were diverse. This may have led to differences in effect sizes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Limitations</title><p id="Par48">There are some limitations in this meta-analysis. Firstly, since most of the RCTs were conducted in European countries, there may be ethnic, geographical, and cultural differences in the effectiveness of HIIT in older people and the qualifications of the interventionists. Furthermore, most studies included in this meta-analysis included individuals with chronic diseases such as COPD, heart failure, hypertension, and dementia. Therefore, RCTs, including HIIT interventions, must investigate the effect on holistic health outcomes in individuals with other chronic diseases or healthy older individuals from different cultures. These two critical points may limit the generalizability of the findings to all older individuals. Another limitation of our study may be that the scans were conducted only in English. Although the overall methodological quality of RCTs is good, it is essential to remember that some of the studies have methodological weaknesses related to small sample sizes, lack of blinding procedures, and failure to report side effects of interventions. Therefore, the evidence for the impact of methodologically well-planned RCTs with HIIT interventions in older adults using blinding procedures, large sample groups, and long-term follow-up periods should be strengthened. Additionally, the HIIT protocols varied considerably across the included studies regarding intensity, duration, frequency, and recovery periods. This heterogeneity may have influenced the pooled outcomes and complicates the ability to draw standardized conclusions about the optimal HIIT regimen for older adults. Finally, another limitation of the study was that the quality of life meta-analyzed results were based on patient subjective reports, which may introduce the potential for recall bias. Accordingly, participants&#x02019; self-assessments may have been influenced by memory distortions, current mood, or expectations about the intervention, all of which can affect the accuracy of reported quality of life scores in included studies. This limitation may reduce the findings&#x02019; reliability and internal validity and should be considered when interpreting the overall effects of HIIT on quality of life in older adults.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par49">A total of 11 randomized controlled trials were included in this meta-analysis and revealed that high-intensity interval exercise applied to older people positively affected cardiometabolic health parameters (6MWT, &#x00056;&#x00307;O&#x02082;peak) and quality of life. It was found that HIIT increased 6MWT walking distance and &#x00056;&#x00307;O&#x02082;peak but did not affect gait speed. The findings of our study show that in addition to the positive effects of high-intensity interval exercise on physical parameters, it also contributes to the overall quality of life, including psychological, social, and emotional aspects of individuals. Encouraging healthy and older adults with different comorbidities to exercise and including exercise as a supportive treatment component in care services can improve their physical and mental health. Carrying out exercise practices with health professionals such as physicians, physiotherapists, and nurses within the framework of a multidisciplinary team approach will help to evaluate older adults with a holistic approach. The inclusion of HIIT intervention, which is an easily applicable, non-invasive, low cost, and low side effect type of exercise, in the daily life activities of older individuals, may provide more permanent improvements in the long term. Future research should focus on conducting large-scale, long-term RCTs to evaluate HIIT interventions&#x02019; safety, sustainability, and effectiveness in diverse populations of older adults, including those from different cultural and health backgrounds. Such studies would contribute significantly to developing more inclusive and evidence-based exercise recommendations to ensure the broader applicability of HIIT in geriatric care.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>
