Estrogen (E2) treatment is known to be neuroprotectant in SCI. This hormone is highly pleiotropic and has been shown to decrease apoptosis, modulate calcium signaling, regulate growth factor expression, act as an anti-inflammatory, and drive angiogenesis. These beneficial effects were found in our earlier study at the low dose of 10&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g/kg E2 in rats. However, the dose remains non-physiologic, which poses a safety hurdle for clinical use. Thus, we recently devised/constructed a fast release nanoparticle (NP) estrogen embedded (FNP-E2) construct and tested a focal delivery system in a contused SCI rat model which showed protection in the short run. In the current study, we have developed a novel slow-release NP estrogen (SNP-E2) delivery system that shows sustained release of E2 in the injured spinal cord and no systemic exposure in the host. The study of E2 release and kinetics of this SNP-E2 construct in vitro and in vivo supported this claim. Delivery of E2 to the injured spinal cord via this approach reduced inflammation and gliosis, and induced microglial differentiation of M1 to M2 in rats after SCI. Analysis of spinal cord samples showed improved myelination and survival signals (AKT) as demonstrated by western blot analysis. SNP-E2 treatment also induced astrocytic differentiation into neuron-like (MAP2/NeuN) cells, supported the survival of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPC), and improved bladder and locomotor function in rats following SCI. These data suggest that this novel delivery strategy of SNP-E2 to the injured spinal cord may provide a safe and effective therapeutic approach to treat individuals suffering from SCI.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Spinal cord injury</kwd><kwd>Slow-release nanoparticle-estrogen</kwd><kwd>Gliosis</kwd><kwd>Myelination</kwd><kwd>Neural differentiation</kwd><kwd>Bladder function</kwd><kwd>Locomotor function</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Medical University of South Carolina</institution></funding-source></award-group><open-access><p>Open access funding provided by the Carolinas Consortium.</p></open-access></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Spinal cord injury (SCI) can result in severe neurological deficits such as loss of sphincter function, paralysis, and neurogenic muscle loss due to immobility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The primary injury in SCI is an instantaneous, irreversible necrotic cell death at the injury site, but the secondary injury and ischemic cell death that occurs in neighboring tissue (penumbra) may be reversible if treated early [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Following SCI, local inflammation and infiltration of inflammatory cells produce factors such as cytokines/chemokines, production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), activation of calpain, glial scarring, etc.; these destroy tissue and prevent axonal regeneration and recovery of locomotor function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Failure of the CNS to repair and regenerate following an injury has also been associated with the decreased ability of macrophage/microglia to properly transition from M1 to M2 types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Similarly, astrocytic differentiation and neuronal-astroglial interactions can potentially occur, influencing the survival of axons and neurons. Currently, no FDA approved drug is available to effectively treat SCI due to the complex pathophysiology involved. Although methylprednisolone was widely used historically in acute injury, its use remains controversial due to multiple side effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Since the destructive process in SCI is multifactorial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], developing an effective therapeutic agent to attenuate tissue damage and improve function following injury is imperative.</p><p id="Par3">Our laboratory was among the first to show the steroid hormone estrogen (E2, 17&#x003b2;-estradiol) mediated neuroprotection and improved locomotor function in experimental SCI in rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. E2 is a highly pleotropic agent that activates transcription of E2-regulated genes; it is an anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-apoptotic agent that reduces gliosis and has neurotrophic and angiogenic properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. As an anti-inflammatory agent, E2 drives M2 polarization of microglial cells in experimental models of hypoxia, favoring regeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Our recent study with a fast-release nanoparticle (NP) estrogen (FNP-E2) suggests that it decreases CSPG and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expression in astrocytes and reduces proliferation of microglia in acute SCI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Thus, focal delivery of E2 to the spinal cord may attenuate activation and proliferation of microglia and astrocytes, thereby diminishing glial scar and axonal damage in SCI.</p><p id="Par4">E2 has exhibited a neuroprotective effect not only in SCI models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] but also in experimental traumatic brain injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], suggesting E2 warrants clinical evaluation in neurotrauma. However, the FDA-approved drug Premarin (conjugated estrogens containing 8&#x02013;10% &#x003b2;-estradiol) has significant safety concerns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Traditional systemic dosing (oral, i.v.) of E2 poses a hurdle for use in SCI individuals who are already at an elevated risk for deep venous thromboembolism (DVT) as short term E2 treatment used for contraception is associated with increased risks of DVT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. To minimize risk and maximize function, investigations of pharmacodynamics of E2 (1&#x02013;200&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g/g body weight) in dose-dependent and time-dependent studies revealed neuroprotective effects of low dose E2 (5&#x02013;10&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g) with improved locomotor function in rat SCI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><p id="Par5">Focally delivering E2 to the injured spinal cord via NPs may help achieve maximal efficacy while keeping systemic levels of E2 in a physiological range to avoid toxicity. We have recently formulated a novel strategy for fast and slow release E2 delivery with the hope that the acute injury in SCI will be attenuated by direct delivery of fast-release E2 to the injured spinal cord, and then a slow-release delivery of FNP-E2 to have sustained E2 concentrations in the injured spinal cord. While this study is focused on the slow-release nanoparticle (NP) estrogen (SNP-E2) construct, the overall goal is to co-administer the slow-release nano-E2 (SNP-E2) which may increase availability of E2 and prolong the therapeutic effects of FNP-E2 to decrease inflammation in subacute and chronic phases of the SCI. Interestingly, our recent studies with FNP-E2 have shown decreased post-injury lesion size, reactive gliosis, and glial scar formation in acute phases of SCI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Our results also showed increased axonal regeneration, vascular endothelial growth factor production, and glial-cell-derived neurotrophic factor(s) following FNP-E2 administration in SCI rats. Concomitantly improved locomotor and bladder functional recovery was observed with FNP-E2 treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Therefore, low-dose site-directed estrogen delivery may provide a therapeutic approach for enhanced axonal/neuronal repair and functional recovery in SCI individuals.</p><p id="Par6">In addition, we have recently shown that focal delivery of E2 via nanoparticles (NPs), fast release NP estrogen (FNP-E2), increased tissue distribution of E2 over time, attenuated cell death, and improved myelin preservation in injured spinal cord [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Specifically, the FNP-E2 construct reduced the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio in injured spinal cord tissues, and reduced gliosis and penumbral demyelination distal to the lesion site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. While the FNP-E2 construct decreased gliosis and improved locomotor function, sustained recovery and improvement of function may require the use of a slow-release NP estrogen (SNP-E2) construct. This is particularly important because remyelination and functional recovery in SCI take time. Thus, an SNP-E2 construct has been devised to investigate whether sustained delivery of E2 will impact glial and neuronal responses and improve myelination following SCI. This study aims to determine whether targeted delivery of SNP-E2 will lead to neuroprotection and subsequent improvement of locomotor functional recovery. SNP-E2 delivered for a prolonged period of time allowed for extended bioavailability to increase the therapeutic window of E2 (and transition from acute to subacute SCI treatment), enhanced regeneration, and improved function.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Induction of SCI</title><p id="Par7">Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (200&#x02013;250&#x000a0;g) were used for the induction of SCI and treatment with slow-release NP-encapsulated E2. While gender-related differences may be found in SCI where females are favored in terms of tissue preservation and locomotor recovery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], no significant differences between males and females could be seen in SCI regarding the localization, onset, or distribution of pain. Moreover, factors affecting number of painful body regions, pain descriptors, ratings of pain intensities, and life satisfaction were not significantly different. Thus, male rats were used in this study of SCI. Rats were anesthetized with ketamine (80&#x000a0;mg/kg)/xylazine (10&#x000a0;mg/kg). Following anesthetization of the animal and preparation of the surgical site, a midline incision was made on the back over the spinous processes, and a T-10 laminectomy was performed. SCI induction was performed as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Briefly, the spine was immobilized with a stereotactic device, and the injury was induced via the method of Perot: dropping a constant weight (5&#x000a0;g) from a height of 8&#x000a0;cm onto an impounder (0.3&#x000a0;cm in diameter) gently placed on the spinal cord.</p><p id="Par8">Vehicle-treated animals received the same volume of void NPs in buffer (100 &#x000b5;L).

Food was placed on the floor of the cage, and long-stemmed water bottles were provided for ease of access to water. Animals were checked twice daily until sacrifice. Animals were visually inspected to check for abnormal behaviors (head pressing, piloerection, hunching) and handled gently for closer physical inspection, including checking for bladder function. The animals&#x02019; bladders were monitored and expressed twice daily. Rodents that develop urine scald were bathed with warm water and gently dried. Vaseline was applied to the affected area. Urine was expressed onto a clear glass dish in order to visually check for cloudiness.</p><p id="Par10">If the subjects were not recovering appropriately, monitoring was amplified commensurate with the animal&#x02019;s health needs.

These findings correlated with improved locomotor and bladder function in a mild to moderate SCI rat contusion model. Reducing the severity of both acute and chronic stages of SCI in a severe (60gcf) SCI model is harder than mild to moderate SCI. Thus, we have designed SNP-E2 and the delivery of this novel construct to the lesioned spinal cord resulted in E2 availability to the surrounding lesion area with no significant plasma E2 levels in SCI rats. The kinetics distribution in SCI rats suggested that the strategy is a viable approach for focal delivery of E2 for reducing inflammation and, more significantly, estrogenic toxicity. SNP-E2 prevented damage to oligodendrocytes, suggesting that inflammatory factors may have the potential to induce OLG death, which could promote demyelination. The proposed SNP-E2 treatment of severe SCI may produce better effects with negligible toxicity. While E2 is known to be a neuroprotectant, attempts to translate this promising therapeutic into the clinic have not been successful. Safety concerns associated with E2 intravenous (i.v.) dosing have thus far precluded clinical trial evaluation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. By using a focal delivery technique such as NPs, these safety concerns may be alleviated. Additionally, NP-E2 may be delivered for a prolonged period of time, particularly with the use of SNP-E2, allowing for extended bioavailability, enhanced regeneration, and functional improvement. Thus, the site-directed delivery of SNP-E2 may have significant translational value and clinical application not only in acute but also in chronic SCI.</p><p id="Par34">Our present study suggests that SNP-E2 therapy either preserves or activates AKT in the injured spinal cord. The PI3K-AKT pathway is a key regulator of cell survival during cellular damage after SCI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. Thus, the activation of AKT or restoration of AKT after SCI is important for neuronal survival and considered better therapeutic strategy for SCI. It is also considered a key regulator of autophagy due to its energy-sensing function and protective effects on glia and neurons as suggested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. Preservation of AKT pathway also promotes motor function recovery in SCI rats. SCI causes neuronal death, axonal injury, and secondary tissue disruption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. Demyelinated axons and axonal degeneration were observed in untreated SCI rats which were reduced following SNP-E2 treatment. Loss of myelin leaves axons vulnerable to degradation, further exacerbating functional deficits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. Thus, reducing axonal degeneration, demyelination, and neural death could have a protective effect in the injured spinal cord. The extent of axon damage is an important predictor of clinical outcome following SCI and the number of axons that survive the injury makes a significant difference in locomotor functional outcome. Thus, how axonal recovery could be promoted is an important question in devising a comprehensive treatment strategy aimed at preserving and restoring spinal function. Our data showed that axonal damage was minimized by SNP-E2 treatment, suggesting our strategy has a translational potential in human SCI.</p><p id="Par35">While homeostatic microglia are the predominant phenotype in the uninjured spinal cord after SCI, microglia become activated and produce inflammatory cytokines and chemokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. Our study suggests that proinflammatory microglia, especially type 1 microglia, are increased following SCI. These microglia produce iNOS and may play a role in inducing gliosis and the formation of an astrocytic scar that can contribute to axonal damage and neuronal death after SCI. Our data also suggests that SNP-E2 treatment induces differentiation of microglia into type 2 which produce arginase-1 and maybe they are anti-inflammatory. Increased presence of mature OPC by SNP-E2 therapy suggests that anti-inflammatory microglia (M2 type) could regulate oligodendrocyte survival, maintenance, and myelination in the injured spinal cord. M2 microglia are associated with anti-inflammatory responses and could reduce glial scar formation, protecting neurons. Our previous study with FNP-E2 treatment reduced glial scar formation and protected neurons in SCI rat model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. However, we have not tested in vivo effects of SNP-E2 on glial scarring in SCI yet, but our future study will examine whether SNP-E2 affects glial scarring following the induction of microglial polarization to the M2 phenotype in the optimized rat SCI model.</p><p id="Par36">A gradual transformation of microglia from proinflammatory to an anti-inflammatory state may have occurred following SNP-E2 therapy that contributed to astrocytic differentiation or transformation.

However, the specific mechanism required for these transformational changes of proliferated astrocytes to neuron-like cells needs to be further investigated.</p><p id="Par37">Failure to recover motor function following SCI is due in part to inhibition of axonal regeneration and remyelination with the loss of neurons and OLGs. Understanding the mechanisms by which SNP-E2 therapy may address both acute and subacute phases of SCI by reducing glial and immune activation, protecting neurons, and improving function. Estrogenic effects are seen in glial cells and OPCs, which provides rationale for examining how long-term exposure to E2 may alter glial scarring and concomitant neuronal survival. Activated microglia/astrocytes produce a number of inflammatory factors, but the specific influence of microglia on OLGs as well as on OLG precursor cells (OPCs) is important [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>].

Our study suggests a role for SNP-E2 treatment on microglial differentiation. The polarization of M1/M2 microglia after SCI, and their roles in so-called astrocytic polarization of neuron-like cells are important in neural survival. These findings indicate that the focal delivery of SNP-E2 may be beneficial in protecting oligodendrocytes, myelin, and axons. Along that line, SNP-E2 therapy supported a role for sustained release of E2 in inducing astroglial differentiation into neuron-like cells.</p><p id="Par38">Astrocytes are the major glial cells present in CNS, and they outnumber neurons, microglia, or oligodendrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>].

In response to SCI, astrocyte activation occurs, accompanied by changes in microglial activation, altered gene expression, and consequent morphology and functional changes in these cells. Reactive astrocytes are common in SCI and play inflammatory roles in inducing axonal damage and neuronal death. However, astrocytic conversion into so-called A2 astrocytes may play a role in inhibiting neuroinflammation and inducing neuroprotection in the CNS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. Thus, the heterogeneity of reactive astrocytes needs to be investigated in a setting of neurotrauma and our study with SNP-E2 may allow us to further investigate astrocytic differentiation and neural regeneration in SCI as suggested by others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>].</p><p id="Par39">While OPCs contribute to remyelination by oligodendrogenesis, the functions of OPCs need to be restored by blocking glial scar formation.

The current study showed that SNP-E2 mediated reduction of gliosis and microglial differentiation into M2 type protected OPCs and improved myelination.

Coordinated function between the bladder and urethral sphincter is disrupted after SCI, and the degree of dyssynergia is related to the severity of spinal injury. This loss of coordination leads to functional bladder outlet obstruction identified by urinary retention and increased micturition pressure. Non-voiding contractions manifested as phasic bladder contractions during urine storage, result in urinary incontinence and high intravesical pressures, leading to bladder hypertrophy and deterioration of the upper urinary tract. Neurogenic bladder dysfunction is also a condition that affects both bladder storage and voiding function and remains one of the leading causes of morbidity after SCI.

On the other hand, improved locomotor function is also associated with increased bladder capacity and enhanced perception of bladder filling. Our data showed that SNP-E2 therapy benefitted both bladder function and locomotor function in SCI rats, indicating that the treatment strategy decreased inflammation at the cellular level and improved functional outcome after SCI. In conclusion, our findings suggest that the focal delivery of SNP-E2 has a significant therapeutic potential for treatment of SCI individuals.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#x02019;s Note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported in part by funding from the Veterans Administration (BX006101, 1IOBX001262), South Carolina State Spinal Cord Injury Research Fund (SCIRF #2016 I-03 and SCIRF #2018 I-01).
