Face and content validity were reviewed by surveying patient representatives and healthcare professionals, along with the validity of LYMPROM<sup>&#x000a9;</sup> Cymraeg, a Welsh translation. Following COSMIN guidelines, validation study phases used anonymised routinely collected data to examine internal consistency, structural validity, construct validity (compared with the EQ5D-5L), measurement error, test-retest reliability and responsiveness.</p></sec><sec id="sec0126"><title>Results</title><p>LYMPROM<sup>&#x000a9;</sup> demonstrated validity (content and construct) and reliability (test-retest, internal consistency). All items were regarded as relevant, comprehensive and clear, with item content validity index (CVI) between 0.83 to 1.00, and average overall assessment of 0.94. Robust development of LYMPROM<sup>&#x000a9;</sup> Cymraeg ensured appropriate translation into Welsh.</p><p>LYMPROM<sup>&#x000a9;</sup> item scores, with means and medians generally in the lower half of the scale, were positively correlated, as were three (Physical health, Social health and Emotional health) domain scores (domain correlations: 0.595 to 0.812).

PROMs support clinicians to understand the patient&#x02019;s view and deliver person-centred care, along with opportunities to guide shared decision making [<xref rid="pone.0315314.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Together, these are key tenets of the Value Based Healthcare (VBH) agenda, which seeks to optimise outcomes for patients within a financially viable model [<xref rid="pone.0315314.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Lymphoedema is a lifelong condition resulting in chronic oedema (swelling) due to stasis of lymph fluid. Commonly, lymphoedema presents within physical extremities, but can also affect the midline regions [<xref rid="pone.0315314.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The impact of lymphoedema can be far reaching. In addition to physical impact (such as risk of infection, skin changes, heaviness and pain or discomfort) mental and social wellbeing, including altered body image, depression and social isolation, can also be affected [<xref rid="pone.0315314.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0315314.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Lymphoedema services support patients across their life course, advocating and supporting the cornerstones of care [<xref rid="pone.0315314.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] [<xref rid="pone.0315314.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>] to reduce the risk of complications from lymphoedema.

PROMs are a key part of this, supporting holistic patient assessments and targeted support or specialist interventions to enable prudent use of resources.</p><fig position="float" id="pone.0315314.g001"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0315314.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Cornerstones of lymphoedema care.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0315314.g001" position="float"/></fig><p>Lymphoedema services in Wales currently support almost 25,000 people with lymphoedema, giving a prevalence of 7.3 per 1,000 people, with a mixed aetiology and presentation of upper, lower and midline lymphoedema [<xref rid="pone.0315314.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. This equates to over 44,000 patient activities annually, including 7,835 new patient referrals, representing an incidence of 2.5 per 1,000 people.

In a series of workshop-style events, patient representatives, therapists and academics together and separately explored the lived and reported whole life impact of lymphoedema. Groups also highlighted the need to develop a succinct and easy to use tool. Using these findings, researchers summarised the whole-life impact through 13 high-level items across three domains, encompassing Physical health, Social health and Emotional health. For example, washing, dressing, and eating were included within the &#x0201c;personal care&#x0201d; item, a component of Social health. This condensed PROM was then reviewed, and a free text option included to enable patients to describe any other impact of lymphoedema. In 2020, these items were reviewed and extracted into a PROM called LYMPROM<sup>&#x000a9;</sup> [<xref rid="pone.0315314.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].

All items are equally weighted and scored using an 11-point scale, where zero indicates no impact and 10 indicates an extreme impact. The LYMPROM<sup>&#x000a9;</sup> score is then reported as a percentage of the maximum possible score, based on the number of items answered (excluding N/A or omitted responses).

Different participants aged 18 years or older with lymphoedema were involved in each phase of testing. All participants continued to receive usual care with LYMPROM<sup>&#x000a9;</sup> available in English and Welsh. All data were anonymised.</p><sec id="sec006"><title>Ethical considerations</title><p>This study was reviewed at the Research and Development Joint Scientific Review Committee at Swansea Bay University Health Board as a service evaluation (14/04/2020). All data used in this study was anonymous and involved adults (aged 18 or older) participants only. Phase one of this study involved an anonymous survey using staff mailing lists and voluntary stakeholder group contacts. All participants were made aware of the voluntary nature of the study, its purpose and use of data. As part of service evaluation, consent was not required, with no risk of harm identified for participants and options for participants to opt out freely.</p><p>The LWCN privacy notice was made available to all participants of this study, outlining the use of anonymised data in routine evaluations and research. To support the process of data collection for phase three (test-retest) all participants were sent an information sheet ahead of their usual appointment explaining the study purpose, data use and voluntary nature of completing an additional LYMPROM<sup>&#x000a9;</sup> before their usual appointment (i.e., without any impact on clinical care). As outlined to potential participants, consent was assumed by return of the survey/ additional LYMPROM<sup>&#x000a9;</sup>. In other phases all data were routinely collected and then anonymised.</p><p>LWCN funded this validation study; there was no external funding</p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>Phase one</title><p>Phase one explored content validity from the perspective of patient representatives and healthcare staff; and structural validity and internal consistency using anonymised routinely collected data. Translation of LYMPROM<sup>&#x000a9;</sup> from English into Welsh followed guidelines [<xref rid="pone.0315314.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] to promote rigour and ensure the most appropriate translated phrases/ words were used to convey the original intention of the question. Welsh Language legislation makes this translation a legal requirement for public bodies in Wales [<xref rid="pone.0315314.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Translational validity is briefly reported in this paper.</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>a: Content validity</title><p>LWCN staff and patient support groups, as experts in lymphoedema, were invited, via a short explanatory email, to share their views on LYMPROM<sup>&#x000a9;</sup>. Patient support groups were accessed to gather patient representative views outside of NHS care providers. Anonymous feedback, returned by post/ email, covered the relevancy, clarity and comprehensiveness of LYMPROM<sup>&#x000a9;</sup> items [<xref rid="pone.0315314.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], using a four-point ordinal scale of agreement (from &#x0201c;strongly disagree&#x0201d; to &#x0201c;strongly agree&#x0201d;) to rate each item for both relevancy and clarity. Respondents were also asked to assess LYMPROM<sup>&#x000a9;</sup> in overall terms, and could use a free text box to explain responses; for example, to describe items that were scored as low. Alongside the item scores, this information was used to inform item revision, removal or addition.</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>b: Translational validity</title><p>LYMPROM<sup>&#x000a9;</sup> was originally developed in English and translated into Welsh. Two independent forward translations were undertaken with mother tongue in the forward translation language (Welsh). One of the forward translators was an expert in lymphoedema, the construct under investigation. One back translation was used with a person with a mother tongue in the backward translation language (English), but non-expert in lymphoedema. All translators worked independently. Translations were collated by a researcher (MGW) who identified discrepancies and provided a feedback report. All discrepancies were discussed with the translators to resolve any issues.</p><p>Low use of LYMPROM<sup>&#x000a9;</sup> Cymraeg precluded formal assessment of its cross-cultural validity, which seeks to examine if a measure behaves similarly in different populations - for example in different ethnic groups or cultures. Examination of cross-cultural validity, and further translation into other languages, are included in objectives for further research.</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>c: Structural validity and internal consistency</title><p>Anonymised LYMPROM<sup>&#x000a9;</sup> data were collected over seven months in three Welsh Health Boards. From this data, we reported item floor or ceiling effects (the percentage of respondents that record the lowest or highest possible score), item correlations, summaries of LYMPROM<sup>&#x000a9;</sup> domain and total scores, including correlations.</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Phase two: construct validity</title><p>As part of routine care, participants completed EQ5D-5L and LYMPROM<sup>&#x000a9;</sup> questionnaires on the same date. Convergent and divergent validity were assessed by examining correlations between LYMPROM<sup>&#x000a9;</sup> total and domain scores and the EQ5D-5L utility scores and thermometer readings.</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>Phase three: test-retest reliability</title><p>A test-retest study alongside usual care was undertaken in one Health Board over two months, with recruitment reviewed at six weeks. An information sheet was posted to patients in the month before their scheduled appointment explaining the voluntary nature of this study, which would report only anonymised results. Patients were asked to complete an additional LYMPROM<sup>&#x000a9;</sup> during the two weeks before their usual appointment, and explicitly reminded that they could freely choose not to complete the &#x02018;additional&#x02019; LYMPROM<sup>&#x000a9;</sup> for the study without impact on their usual care.</p><p>The interval of two weeks between LYMPROM<sup>&#x000a9;</sup> administrations was chosen to reduce the risk of recall or changes in lymphoedema symptoms. Reliability was assessed through change in and correlations between the two sets of LYMPROM<sup>&#x000a9;</sup> domain and total scores.</p></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>Phase four: responsiveness</title><p>Longitudinal validity examined changes in LYMPROM<sup>&#x000a9;</sup> scores after patients received their first intervention for lymphoedema, using the LYMPROM<sup>&#x000a9;</sup> completed as part of triage (when patients are referred to the service) and the first LYMPROM<sup>&#x000a9;</sup> after follow-up, between four weeks and seven months later. This follow-up interval provided enough time for outcomes to change, with an expected improvement in outcomes (hence <italic toggle="yes">lower</italic> LYMPROM<sup>&#x000a9;</sup> scores) based on therapists supporting participants with the cornerstones of care [<xref rid="pone.0315314.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>.]. Those followed-up within four weeks were excluded, as there would been insufficient time for any intervention effect to be observed; the limit of seven months reduced the risk of patients initially improving but subsequently deteriorating. We were unable to explore compliance with care.</p></sec><sec id="sec014"><title>Sample size considerations</title><p>For an adequate assessment of content validity [Phase 1a], the target sample size was 30-49 participants, based on guidelines for content validity within survey studies [<xref rid="pone.0315314.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. For each of Phases 1c, 2-4, the target sample size, reflecting guidelines for assessing construct validity, test-retest reliability, and responsiveness, was 100 participants [<xref rid="pone.0315314.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], which represents more than seven participants per LYMPROM<sup>&#x000a9;</sup> item.</p></sec><sec id="sec015"><title>Data management and statistical methods</title><p>Participant demographic data and questionnaire responses were initially stored in EXCEL spreadsheets; anonymised data were subsequently imported into SPSS (version 29) for further processing, summary and analysis.

We also calculated a Content Validity Index (CVI) to report the proportion of respondents that &#x0201c;agreed&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;strongly agreed&#x0201d; with a range of overall aspects of LYMPROM<sup>&#x000a9;</sup>, and reported the average of these CVIs.

LYMPROM<sup>&#x000a9;</sup> is one of the first Lymphoedema-specific PROMs (available in English and Welsh) to be validated for adults with lymphoedema, regardless of aetiology or location of lymphoedema. LYMPROM<sup>&#x000a9;</sup> was created by key stakeholders with vast experience, helping to support feasibility and acceptability in routine clinical care. Using a four phased study different aspects of validity and reliability were explored [<xref rid="pone.0315314.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In the absence of a gold-standard for comparison, the authors hypothesised weak to moderate negative correlations between EQ5D-5L utility scores and thermometer (or VAS) readings and LYMPROM<sup>&#x000a9;</sup> Total and Physical health domain scores. Similarly, weak correlations were also expected with scores on the Social health and Emotional health domains.</p><p>The characteristics of participants in each study phases were similar [<xref rid="pone.0315314.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>], however, those involved in phases three and four were younger. Those involved in phase 1a were predominantly female. This is not considered to materially affect results, but will be explored in future work examining LYMPROM<sup>&#x000a9;</sup> data. Possible explanatory factors include the use in phase one of both paper and digital LYMPROM<sup>&#x000a9;</sup>, whilst phases three and four used the digital version only, with data collected <italic toggle="yes">via</italic> an automated platform where paper completions were not necessarily entered digitally. There were relatively small numbers of participants in some sub-groups, particularly in phases three and four, which precluded further detailed analyses exploring some potentially interesting patterns observed in the total and domain scores for key factors such as gender or age [<xref rid="pone.0315314.t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>]. Females tended to report higher impact of lymphoedema, with notable peaks in scores for different domains across the age bands; with Emotional health impact being highest for the younger cohorts for example. This interesting point, however, is less relevant to phase 1a, where participants were asked to rate how relevant, clear and comprehensive they felt LYMPROM<sup>&#x000a9;</sup> was.</p></sec><sec id="sec029"><title>Phase one</title><p>The content validity exercise signposted key amendments to LYMPROM<sup>&#x000a9;</sup>; ensuring pain included reports of discomfort or ache, whilst signalling that not all items would be relevant to all patients (e.g., finances and holidays). Reports of potential overlap of items was in part expected by virtue of the inter-connectedness of some areas such as holidays and hobbies. A small number of survey respondents noted the absence of information on prescribed compression garments or wounds. Compression garment use was considered as an intervention, and wounds as a complication of lymphoedema that would be assessed and reviewed at each patient contact using standardised assessment and review forms. The translation methodology identified important considerations to ensure fidelity with original item wording and intended meaning, which can be further explored in cognitive interviews. Floor effects were observed, with a cohort of patients reporting the best item score (0, zero) [<xref rid="pone.0315314.t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>] Thus LYMPROM<sup>&#x000a9;</sup> is less able to differentiate those reporting minimal impact of lymphoedema. Positively, this failure to detect variability is not shown for patients reporting worst item scores (10, ten). From a clinical perspective, data reported here includes patients with mild to moderate lymphoedema; rather than patients with severe or complex lymphoedema, who should be the focus of the specialist lymphoedema service. Without clinician-reported outcomes it is difficult to explore this theme further at this time.</p></sec><sec id="sec030"><title>Phase two</title><p>Item correlations were generally positive and strong within and across domains [<xref rid="pone.0315314.t007" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref>] and total and domain correlations usually so [<xref rid="pone.0315314.t008" ref-type="table">Table 8</xref>]. This is a key finding; suggesting that the three LYMPROM<sup>&#x000a9;</sup> domains provide information on discrete aspects of a person. Exploring relationships with EQ5D-5L measures shows a similar correlation with the utility score and thermometer reading [<xref rid="pone.0315314.t009" ref-type="table">Table 9</xref>] and confirms predefined hypotheses. The scatter plot [<xref rid="pone.0315314.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref>] demonstrates the value of LYMPROM<sup>&#x000a9;</sup> as a disease specific PROM; capturing discrete aspects of patient outcomes. High utility scores on the EQ5D-5L were reported with a range of LYMPROM<sup>&#x000a9;</sup> scores, typically below 50. Conversely utility scores of zero on the EQ5D-5L were seen with minimal and extreme impact reported on LYMPROM<sup>&#x000a9;</sup>. This finding shows that whilst the EQ5D-5L is a good generic measure, the LYMPROM<sup>&#x000a9;</sup> is a necessary measure to capture lymphoedema specific outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="sec031"><title>Phase three</title><p>Test-retest data shows very strong correlations and minimal change over time, with few outliers who do not show consistency in scores [<xref rid="pone.0315314.t010" ref-type="table">Table 10</xref>; <xref rid="pone.0315314.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>].

The reduction in scores (reduced impact) is seen in the total score and across all domains. The interval period appears to influence the magnitude of score change and this warrants further exploration. For example, larger reductions in scores tended to be seen with longer intervals between LYMPROM<sup>&#x000a9;</sup> completions within usual care. Moreover, the period of data collection, after the Covid-19 pandemic is an important consideration as this represents a time of recovery to business as usual and the provision of in-person contacts for all. These findings represent a positive clinical outcome, where patients report a reduced impact of their lymphoedema as part of usual care and provides insight into ongoing work to establish what constitutes the minimum clinically important difference and collection of clinician reported outcomes with PROMs.</p></sec><sec id="sec033"><title>The strengths of LYMPROM<sup>&#x000a9;</sup> and opportunities for further work</title><p>This study has demonstrated rigour in the development of the LYMPROM<sup>&#x000a9;</sup> and shown the strength of correlations and structure of the LYMPROM<sup>&#x000a9;</sup>, negating at this time the need to further explore factor analysis. The rest-retest phase of the study was one of the most challenging parts to design. Ensuring a minimum interval to reduce the risk of change but also to minimise the influence of recall. Findings indicate that the LYMPROM<sup>&#x000a9;</sup> is able to detect stability in scores. The study hypothesised a reduction in patient scores after their first contact with the service and this too was a challenge of using routinely collected data alone. Whilst significant results were found, the correlations were low, with interesting caveats identified based on the interval (days) between PROM scores. More recent papers have, however, shown that discrete lymphoedema interventions can evoke a greater magnitude of improvement (reduction of LYMPROM<sup>&#x000a9;</sup> item and total scores) [<xref rid="pone.0315314.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0315314.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].

PROMs and, more widely, Patient Reported Experience Measures (PREMs) [<xref rid="pone.0315314.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] prompt patients to reflect on their care and challenge how they view their condition and their role in self-management. Rather than simply retrieving information, PROMs can empower patients to raise important issues with their clinician [<xref rid="pone.0315314.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], providing a tool to monitor progress. Key to this work has been the access to an automated digital PROM platform. Being able to complete LYMPROM<sup>&#x000a9;</sup> at their own time may help patients raise issues they might feel uncomfortable discussing in person. However, more work is needed to support digital access, literacy and uptake, whilst communicating a wider public health message around VBH and patients as key drivers in PROM-led care. Indeed, feedback from patients attending lymphoedema services captured that they were unfamiliar with PROMs in any other part of their healthcare. Ongoing evaluations are driving PROM-led care in Lymphoedema Wales. PROMs are now focussed from the outset within the subjective assessment in the new patient model and reviewed at each contact thereafter. Alongside this, a suite of information resources for patients and therapists is being developed to optimise patient outcomes alongside a programme of emotional and psychological work led by our consultant psychologist.</p></sec><sec id="sec034"><title>Limitations</title><p>Data were collected during an extended period reflecting the challenges of collecting data during the Covid-19 pandemic. The study made use of anonymised and routinely collected data without cognitive interviews or measures of (in)stability for the test-retest or the responsiveness phase. Cognitive interviews with stakeholders would be beneficial for more in-depth understanding in the future. As many patients are reporting PROMs as a novel tool in their care, LWCN staff have had to explain the value of PROMs during their first patient contact. Moreover, patients have signposted the challenge of providing scores based on their lymphoedema alone in the presence of comorbidities. Therapists have sometimes reported &#x02018;coaching&#x02019; patients on how to focus their scores on the impact of their lymphoedema, rather than comorbidities, which may mean that subsequent scores may be altered. This could be a consideration in the responsiveness data. Thus, a patient&#x02019;s next PROM score might be improved (or worsened) through an improved understanding of what they should be scoring on the LYMPROM<sup>&#x000a9;</sup>. Unfortunately, in making use of routinely collected data, there were no reported &#x02018;markers&#x02019; of stability, improvement or worsening by participants during the period of data collection for phases three and four of the study. Moreover, it was not possible to review if participants complied with their plan of care [<xref rid="pone.0315314.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>], which could impact on their outcomes.</p><p>Findings should also be interpreted with caution owing to the challenges of providing a virtual service to a population with a condition that so closely relies on touch and pressure. Moreover, lymphoedema as a chronic condition is not always quick to react to interventions and once again in lacking clinical reported outcomes, it is difficult to fully explore these findings. Whilst, the authors of this study did not use a measure of stability/ change over time, the effect of change on test-retest appears to be inconsequential.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec035"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study has gathered evidence to report on the reliability and validity of LYMPROM<sup>&#x000a9;</sup> as a measurement to help patients communicate the potential impact of lymphoedema.

This could remove the need to have a bespoke PROM in use for patients with midline or upper/lower limb lymphoedema. Based on feedback, LYMPROM<sup>&#x000a9;</sup> has empowered patients and enabled therapists, but more work is needed to optimise use and make PROM talk a part of usual care. Providing important patient-centric information as part of the standardised assessment and review forms empowers patients and therapists to care beyond the historical focus on anthropomorphic measures. The next phase of work will explore other important measures including patient experience and clinician reported measures.</p></sec><sec id="sec036" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material id="pone.0315314.s001" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p>Correlation matrix for LYMPROM&#x000a9; items.</p><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0315314.s001.docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pone.0315314.s002" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>Table S2</label><caption><p>Correlation matrix for LYMPROM&#x000a9; items (coded).</p><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0315314.s002.docx"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to extend their thanks to the patients, staff and local Health Board teams including Local and National Lymphoedema Services and Value in Health teams, Rafael Cuartielles for contributing to data management, Russell White for setting up the digital form, and to Rhian Noble-Jones, Karen Roberts, and the local translation unit for their support with translating LYMPROM<sup>&#x000a9;</sup>.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0315314.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Greenhalgh</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Gooding</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Gibbons</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Dalkin</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Wright</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Valderas</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name>, <etal>et al</etal>. <article-title>How do patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) support clinician-patient communication and patient care?

This sentence is not clear: "For construct validity, LYMPROM&#x000a9; domain scores are calculated as percentages of the maximum possible score, which accounts for both differing numbers of items and any N/A or omitted responses". Please explain how this relates to construct validity.</p><p>5. Methods, page 7. The dates of the study given in the methods are different from those in the ethics section. Differing dates are given for different phases which is rather confusing. Perhaps consider length of phases with a single study duration at the start of methods section?</p><p>6.

Please either amend your manuscript to change the affiliation or corresponding author, or email us at plosone@plos.org with a request to remove this option. The corresponding author has been updated to match the affiliated institute for direct billing.</p><p>3. We note that your Data Availability Statement is currently as follows: All relevant data are within the manuscript and its Supporting Information files. We have now made study data available via the Swansea University Open research data Community, hosted by Zenodo.</p><p>4. We notice that your supplementary tables are included in the manuscript file. Please remove them and upload them with the file type 'Supporting Information'. Please ensure that each Supporting Information file has a legend listed in the manuscript after the references list. Supplementary tables have been removed from the main manuscript and are now included as Supporting Information.</p><p>5. Please review your reference list to ensure that it is complete and correct. If you have cited papers that have been retracted, please include the rationale for doing so in the manuscript text, or remove these references and replace them with relevant current references. Any changes to the reference list should be mentioned in the rebuttal letter that accompanies your revised manuscript. If you need to cite a retracted article, indicate the article&#x02019;s retracted status in the References list and also include a citation and full reference for the retraction notice. References have been checked, with two additions to cover translation guidelines.</p><p>Reviewer 1 comments</p><p>Reviewer #1: This is an interesting and well written manuscript. It is good to see a PROM being used as part of normal clinical care and this manuscript describes validation of the LYMPROM within that context. I have made some comments below that I believe would improve the manuscript: Thank you for your valuable comments; we have addressed these as documented below. Page and line numbers refer to our revised manuscript (clean version).</p><p>1.Ethics statement. The R&#x00026;D committee is the Joint Scientific Review Committee' and not the 'Joint Study Ratification Committee'. Many thanks for highlighting this; we have made the necessary correction. [Page 8, lines 10-11]</p><p>2.Page 4 onwards. LWCN needs to be defined on first use. This acronym is now defined. Page 5, line 6].</p><p>3. Introduction. On page 5, the authors have alluded to earlier development of the LYMPROM and although they have provided a reference, I feel this statement is rather vague. It would be useful to summarise how the LYMPROM was initially developed and the decisions made about what was included. Further text has now been added to summarise the key steps in creating LYMPROM. [Page 5, lines 14-22]</p><p>4. LYMPROM domains, page 6. This sentence is not clear: "For construct validity, LYMPROM&#x000a9; domain scores are calculated as percentages of the maximum possible score, which accounts for both differing numbers of items and any N/A or omitted responses". Please explain how this relates to construct validity. We apologise for the lack of clarity, and have amended the text accordingly. [Page 7, line 9]</p><p>5. Methods, page 7. The dates of the study given in the methods are different from those in the ethics section. Differing dates are given for different phases which is rather confusing. Perhaps consider length of phases with a single study duration at the start of methods section? We agree that there is the potential for confusion; and have now simplified timings by reference to a single study duration (late 2020 to early 2022) in the first part of the methods only. [Page 8, line 5] Some previous text has now been removed.</p><p>6. The manuscript uses 'data' in both the singular and plural (data is/data are). My preference would be plural but singular is acceptable, but the authors need to be consistent throughout the manuscript. Thank you, we have adjusted throughout.</p><p>7. Phase one, page 8. The sentence 'translation into Welsh was briefly considered' is rather vague. Elaborate. We have added details to cover the legal requirement for translation; further details for the translation work are then subsequently provided. [Page 9, line 8; Page 9, line 22 &#x02013; Page 10, line 4]</p><p>8. Content validity, page 8. What do the authors mean by 'Lymphoedema staff mailing lists and representative patient support groups 'aligned' with LWCN were approached? We have added further details explaining these contacts groups. [Page 9, lines 12-14]</p><p>9. Content validity, page 8. The desired sample size is given along with a reference. It would be useful to have sentence or two explaining the basis for the sample size rather than having to refer to the reference. All sample size considerations have been consolidated into a new short sub-section, with, we hope, the required level of detail. [Page 11, line 22 &#x02013; Page 12, line 2] Some previous text has now been removed.</p><p>10. Content validity, page 8/9. There needs to be a more detailed description of the Content Validity Index. Further details have been added here on data collection, and in the data management and statistical methods section on data processing. [Page 9, lines 11-20; Page 12, lines 8-14]</p><p>11. Translational validity, page 9. It's not clear what this sentence means, please elaborate: 'Welsh translation in itself was not considered sufficient to warrant examination of cross-cultural validity'. We now provided further details on why full cross-cultural validity was not possible at this time. [Page 10, lines 5-9]</p><p>12. Phase 3, page 10. The sample size calculation again needs some discussion. This is covered by our response to point 9.</p><p>13. Phase four Responsiveness, page 10. This sentence is not clear: 'This interval provided enough time for outcomes to change without deterioration'. Surely the researchers are looking for change including deterioration? We have amended the description and discussion, and hope this has now been more clearly described. [Page 11, lines 14-19]</p><p>14. Results, page 11 onwards should be presented as past tense. Thank you, we have adjusted the text accordingly.</p><p>15. Figure 1 doesn't really add anything and could be discussed in the text. We would prefer to retain this, as it is now also cited in the limitations for phase four. This is the lymphoedema cornerstone of care that describe key parts of treatment.</p><p>Reviewer 2</p><p>Reviewer #2: Thank you for the opportunity to review this work. It was generally very clearly explained and think it is a really useful piece of work and will be a very valuable tool within lymphoedema My only comments are Thank you for your valuable comments; ; we have addressed these as documented below. Page and line numbers refer to our revised manuscript (clean version).</p><p>Phase 4 &#x02013; line 20 &#x02013; can you explain the phrase &#x0201c;change without deterioration&#x0201d; as would there not be the possibility of improvement as they have started treatment but also of deterioration if not able to follow the plan or a change in condition? We agree and have now reworded this to provide clarity, both and briefly in the limitations section. [Page 11, lines 14-19; Page 32, lines 5-8]</p><p>Data management and statistical methods - Is there any similarities in what was commonly missing and would this have an impact on results? We have provided more details, covering items with and without an explicit N/A option. [Page 13, lines 7-10]</p><p>- Number of males completing phase 1a is very low &#x02013; does this impact on content? This is explored further in the discussion but is not felt to materially affect results. [Page 13, line 18; Page 27, lines 18-21]</p><p>- How was the sample number for each phase calculated? We now refer to published guidelines, and included details in a consolidated sub-section on sample sizes.
