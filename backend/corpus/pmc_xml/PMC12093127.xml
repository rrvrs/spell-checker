It is essential for the discovery and refinement of novel treatments for a wide range of diseases, from rare genetic disorders to widespread chronic conditions like cancer and cardiovascular disease (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Medical research is also the cornerstone of evidence-based medicine (EBM), which uses the best available scientific evidence to guide medical decision-making (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Advances in clinical research have fueled the rise of personalized medicine, an approach that tailors medical treatment to individual patient characteristics, genetic makeup, and lifestyle (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Medical research also plays a crucial role in responding to emerging public health threats, such as infectious disease outbreaks or environmental health hazards (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). It drives innovation, supports evidence-based practices, enhances patient safety, and leads to better health outcomes for individuals and populations.</p><p>Medical research is also a generator of research publications with important impact on health, and areas of medical research receiving most attention and funding are identified to reflect priorities of the scientific community and health care systems. Additionally, identifying key contributors and institutions may help facilitate collaborations and indicate potential gaps in expertise needing to be addressed at the academic level. The study of bibliometric output has emerged as an important approach to understanding the evolution, trends, and impact of scientific research, particularly in clinical sciences (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>).</p><p>In Croatia, bibliometric assessment of research has been performed for different disciplines, including a 2000-2007 study focusing on public health and preventive medicine (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), a study on scientific productivity of early-career researchers from the largest Croatian medical school at the University of Zagreb in 2005 (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), as well as a 2000-2006 study of clinical and life sciences publication output from research institutions in Split (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). University of Split (UNIST), with its School of Medicine (USSM), plays a significant role in medical research and education, contributing to the advancement of medical knowledge and health care practices. The USSM was established as an independent university constituent in 1997, enabling the UNIST to develop its research capabilities in the area of medicine (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). As a key academic institution in the field of health, the USSM, with its clinical base at the University Hospital of Split, has been actively engaged in research, publishing scientific articles, and participating in clinical trials. Currently, there are 162 researchers with academic positions of assistant professor and higher at the USSM. The USSM has been involved in numerous medical research projects across different disciplines, focusing on addressing critical health challenges and contributing to evidence-based medical practices (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). On the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the UNIST, we analyzed most influential publications from UNIST researchers in medicine, as well as the participation in publicly registered clinical trials, in order to gain insight into the development of medical research in the second largest university in Croatia and to identify research priorities in medicine for the university.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Data sources</title><p>In this cross-sectional study, we used the InCites analytical tool (Clarivate, Graz, Austria) to retrieve articles and reviews published by UNIST researchers in the top 5% journals in medical categories of the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC), including the Emerging Science Citation Index (ESCI), from 1997 until 2022. 1997 was chosen because it was the time when the USSM was established as an independent university unit, and could be searched as such in the database. The inclusion criterion for being a UNIST medical researcher was to be affiliated with the USSM. Document types other than &#x0201c;Article&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;Review&#x0201d; were not included in the analysis.</p><p>The data for the analysis were retrieved based on the categories under the clinical medicine group of journals indexed in WoSCC (Clinical, Pre-Clinical &#x00026; Health section). Specifically, we used Global Institutional Profiles Project Categories (<ext-link xlink:href="https://incites.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/22586976355217-Global-Institution-Profiles-Project-Research-Areas-GIPP" ext-link-type="uri">https://incites.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/22586976355217-Global-Institution-Profiles-Project-Research-Areas-GIPP</ext-link>), and the filter &#x0201c;Research area,&#x0201d; Web of Science schema. In order to address the annual changes (mainly increase) in journals&#x02019; impact factors within decades, the selection of the top 5% papers included the consideration of annual journal impact factor position (%) with respect to the overall annual number of journals listed according to the annual impact factor within the corresponding subcategory of WoSCC medical sciences. The rank for papers was established based on the year of publication, using data sourced from the Journal Citation Reports database (Rank by Journal Impact Factor) for each subcategory, with subsequent computation of the percentage. The journals in which these papers were published have been often listed in other WoSCC categories and corresponding subcategories, but it is out of scope of present paper to discuss the journals performance in other WoSCC categories. The articles with more than 50 authors were not considered because it was difficult to evaluate reliable contribution from UNIST authors to the study.</p><p>To assess the activity of UNIST researchers related to clinical trials, we searched the largest public trials registry, ClinicalTrials.gov from the National Institutes of Health, USA, established in 1997. We used the country filter to retrieve all records of clinical trials with a site in Croatia until the end of 2023. We collected the information on the number of clinical trials where the USSM and/or the UNIST were the sponsor, collaborator, or location of a clinical trial. Time filters were not used.</p></sec><sec><title>Data analysis</title><p>The results are presented as frequencies for categorical variables and as medians and interquartile ranges (IQR) for continuous variables. Time trends were assessed using Spearman&#x02019;s rank correlation. Statistical analysis was performed using MedCalc version 23.1.5 (MedCalc, Ostend, Belgium).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Bibliographical analysis</title><p>Overall, 717 articles were published in the 1st quartile of the Clinical, Pre-clinical &#x00026; Health WoSCC section by authors with a USSM affiliation. Of those, 106 articles (15%) were in the top 5% journals in journal categories. Among these, the Document Type was &#x0201c;Article&#x0201d; for 87 (82%) and &#x0201c;Review&#x0201d; for 19 (18%) articles. USSM researchers were first authors on 29 (27%) articles. Because 6 journals were included in more than one category, there were 113 journal data sets for analysis of journal categories. These articles were published in journals from 29 out of 47 WoS journal categories (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The list of articles and their abstracts is available in the Supplement 1<xref rid="S14" ref-type="supplementary-material">(Supplementary material 1)</xref>. There were 18 WoSCC Categories without USSM articles in top journals as follows: Allergy; Emergency Medicine; Dentistry, Oral Surgery &#x00026; Medicine; Dermatology; Hematology; Integrative &#x00026; Complementary Medicine; Medical Ethics; Medicine, Legal; Medical Informatics; Medical Laboratory Technology; Neuroimaging; Nutrition &#x00026; Dietetics; Primary Health Care; Rehabilitation; Rheumatology; Substance Abuse; Surgery; Transplantation.

Out of all registered trials in Croatia, 293 (20.6%) involved the UNIST or USSM.

This is evident from the number of articles published in the top 5% most-cited journals indexed in WoS, and a steady increase in this number from 1997, the year of the establishment of the School of Medicine as the unity of the University of Split, separate from the University of Zagreb School of Medicine. The trend of increasing clinical research evidence confirms previous findings by Puljak et al (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), who reported that the annual number of publications from clinical and life-science researchers from all institutions in Split tripled in the 2000-2006 period. The USSM and the UNIST, as two major clinical research institutions in Split, have demonstrated their excellence in terms of overall publications as well as publications in journals with the highest impact in the global research community.</p><p>Excellence in published clinical research from the Split University was most prominent in the journals from three WoS categories. A high number of articles in top journals from WoS categories Health Care Sciences &#x00026; Services; Public, Environmental &#x00026; Occupational Medicine can be related to the establishment of the Croatian Centre for Global Health (<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) and the Cochrane Croatia (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) as research units of the USSM in 2008. These two centers brought together researchers from different disciplines and their joint research efforts, including the creation of the &#x0201c;10001 Dalmatians&#x0201d; biobank for genomic and metabolomic studies (<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), resulted in a sharp increase in high-quality articles in 2009, 2010, and 2011. The high number of articles in the journal Web Sport Sciences category are the results of the oldest research group at USSM, focused on the physiology of diving and integrative physiology (<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Efforts from all research groups at the USSM and the University Hospital of Split also resulted in strong international research collaborations, with collaborators from 82 countries, clearly demonstrating that Split University is a part of the global research community. Global relevance of medical research at the UNIST is also visible in its research efforts contributing to several UN sustainable development goals (SDG): SDG3 &#x02013; Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages; SDG9 &#x02013; Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation; and SDG16 &#x02013; Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all, and build effective, accountable, and inclusive institutions at all levels (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Our study of the publication output demonstrated that medical research predominantly contributed to SDG3, but also opened the possibility to expand its contributions to other SDGs, such as SDG5 Gender Equality, SDG13 Climate Action, and SDG14 Life Below Water. The three latter SDG have the potential to be further developed at the USSM.</p><p>It is difficult to make comparisons of citations to papers from UNIST with that of other medical schools in Croatia, as there are no comparative studies for other universities or medical schools. We only found the 2012 study on the publication output of the Department of Internal Medicine, University of Zagreb School of Medicine and the University Hospital Center Zagreb, which observed that clinical practice guidelines and randomized clinical trials received most citations (an average of 157 and 76 citations, respectively) (<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). In our sample of publications, we had much higher citation rates, primarily from the categories of Oncology (7 articles with 3728 citations), Endocrinology &#x00026; Metabolism (2 articles with 2387 citations) and Pediatrics (3 articles with 2358 citations). The differences in citation numbers partly reflect the time difference between the two studies, which necessarily resulted in the higher citation numbers in our study, as well as the increased number of indexed journals over time. Further research is needed to dissect in detail the publication output in medicine from different universities in Croatia.</p><p>Our study is the first to describe in more detail research activities related to clinical trials in Croatia. In our previous study from 2017, we showed that, despite the strong legal provisions for clinical trial regulation, the information about clinical trials is not very transparent and visible to the public (<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Our analysis in this study shows that, according to the largest trial registry, ClinicalTrial.gov, the number of registered clinical trials increased since 2000, with a steady increase since 2004, reaching 86 registered trials in 2023. These numbers do not represent the total number of clinical trials in Croatia, because there was no legal mandate for trial registration before 2005 (<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). This mandate was brought about by an international movement led by journal editors of the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE), the most influential group in medical publishing, to increase the transparency and trustworthiness of clinical trials (<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). <italic>Croatian Medical Journal</italic>, the official journal of the USSM was a member of the ICMJE and actively contributed to the development of the trial registration mandate and legislation (<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Most of the clinical trials in Croatia are performed in Zagreb, which has two university hospital centers and two university hospitals (<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Split has a single university hospital center (UNIST) and, therefore, has lower numbers of trials and slower increase in their number over the years. However, Split performed better in the number of registered clinical trials in which either USSM or the UNIST were sponsors or collaborators (20.9% of all registered trials, compared with 6.8% of all trials in Zagreb). This demonstrates the active approach and research initiative of clinical researchers in Split, who performed investigator-driven trials.</p><p>The limitations of our study are related to the inherent biases related to the information sources used in data collection. WoS represents only a small, albeit most influential, fraction of journals (<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). However, the aim of this study was to explore medical research from the UNIST that goes beyond the state of the art, to showcase research excellence and provide evidence for future research policies and plans for the university. Our study is also restricted to a single university. It would be interesting to compare the publication output with other universities in Croatia, but a study of high-impact articles may be biased because the USSM is a relatively new institution, established in 1997, while other research-intensive medical schools have much longer research tradition: the University of Zagreb School of Medicine was established in 1917 and the University of Rijeka School of Medicine in 1955. The limitation related to the registry analysis is that the ClinicalTrials.gov is not the only trial registry and is included in the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), which also includes the EU Clinical Trial Register and a number of national registries (<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). We chose ClinicalTrials.gov for our study as it is the largest global registry, which has high-quality data and includes many of the trials from other registries (<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Also, a reliable analysis of clinical trials in Croatia was possible only after 2005, when the trial registration became a mandatory requirement for journal manuscript submission. We included all registered trials with the Split location in this analysis, but we plan a more extensive analysis of clinical trials in Croatia in different registries.</p><p>Instead of a conclusion, we can offer ideas about the future prospects for medical research at the UNIST and its affiliated hospital. The UNIST should continue and increase support for medical research as the best showcase for research excellence at the University. Research efforts of already outstanding research groups and topics should be continued, particularly in relation to the support to acquire international funding. Research areas that have a great potential for excellent research but have not yet been published in top journals, should be supported in their efforts. Finally, analyses such as in this study should be regularly performed to follow the development of medical research at the University, identify new areas for excellence, support researchers, and attract both early-career and experienced researchers from all over the world to Split. Only by promoting and sustaining research excellence, can the UNIST take the position in the global research community that it deserves.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>We thank the colleagues Ana Matija&#x00161;evi&#x00107; Reni&#x00107; and Petra Zoranovi&#x00107; from the University of Split Library, Split, Croatia for their help in bibliometric analysis.</p><p>Funding None.</p><p>Ethical approval Not required.</p><p>Declaration of authorship AM, IJ and DLj conceived and designed the study; AM and PJ acquired the data; all authors analyzed and interpreted the data; AM drafted the manuscript; all authors critically reviewed the manuscript for important intellectual content; all authors gave approval of the version to be submitted; all authors agree to be accountable for all aspects of the work.</p><p>Competing interests All authors have completed the Unified Competing Interest form at <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.icmje.org/coi_disclosure.pdf" ext-link-type="uri">www.icmje.org/coi_disclosure.pdf</ext-link> (available on request from the corresponding author) and declare: no support from any organization for the submitted work; no financial relationships with any organizations that might have an interest in the submitted work in the previous 3 years; no other relationships or activities that could appear to have influenced the submitted work.
