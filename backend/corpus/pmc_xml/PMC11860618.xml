This study aimed to evaluate the impact of the pandemic on the lifestyle behaviours and health quality of 3134 children aged 5 to 6 years across three periods: pre-COVID, COVID-19 lockdown, and COVID-19 endemicity. Data were collected using the Surveillance of Digital Media Habits in Early Childhood Questionnaire (SMALLQ<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) to measure on- and off-screen media habits of children and the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PaedQL) to assess children&#x02019;s health quality. Adherence to physical activity (PA) guidelines dropped from 32.7% pre-COVID to 27.4% during lockdown but improved to 34.4% in endemicity (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). Sleep (SL) adherence followed a similar pattern, decreasing from 33.4% to 27.9% before rising to 40.6% (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). Screen time (ST) adherence significantly declined during lockdown (16.7% to 10.8%, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). Weak positive correlations with all PaedQL metrics were observed across periods, except during endemicity (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). Concerted efforts involving key stakeholders must be made to mitigate the negative effects of the pandemic on children&#x02019;s lifestyle behaviours and QoL, ensuring they are better prepared for the transition to primary school.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>physical activity</kwd><kwd>sleep</kwd><kwd>screen time</kwd><kwd>24 h activity guidelines</kwd><kwd>COVID-19 pandemic</kwd><kwd>pre-primary school children</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>Singapore Ministry of Education (MOE)</funding-source><award-id>OER 29/19 MCYH</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>The study is part of an international study called International iPreschooler Surveillance Study Among Asians and otheRs (IISSAAR).

Introduction</title><sec id="sec1dot1-sports-13-00032"><title>1.1. Pre-Primary School Children and Quality of Life</title><p>Early-life habits play a crucial role in shaping long-term health outcomes, both positively and negatively [<xref rid="B1-sports-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-sports-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The concept of sensitive periods for development and transition highlights that pre-primary years are a critical phase of heightened receptivity for cognitive, social, emotional, and physical development [<xref rid="B3-sports-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. During this time, children are especially skilled at acquiring new knowledge and abilities, making it vital for educators and caregivers to provide enriching experiences to build the right attitude toward a good quality of life [<xref rid="B4-sports-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Positive experiences, such as proper nutrition, emotional support, and stable environments, promote healthy development and future well-being [<xref rid="B5-sports-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-sports-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-sports-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In contrast, adverse experiences like neglect can have lasting negative effects [<xref rid="B4-sports-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Therefore, it is crucial to cultivate healthy habits and positive lifestyle behaviours during the early years. Early support sets the foundation for long-term well-being, helping children develop the skills and resilience needed to maintain good health [<xref rid="B3-sports-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B8-sports-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>The transition from preschool to primary school education is a crucial period in a child&#x02019;s growth and development [<xref rid="B9-sports-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], marking a significant shift in their learning environment and social interactions [<xref rid="B10-sports-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-sports-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. This transition encompasses a range of emotional, cognitive, and social adjustments that can significantly impact a child&#x02019;s educational trajectory. Research indicates that a well-structured transition can enhance children&#x02019;s readiness for school, thereby facilitating their academic success and overall well-being [<xref rid="B12-sports-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-sports-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Crucial to a successful transition is also the quality of life (QoL). Emotional and behavioural aspects of QoL and physical health are crucial for pre-primary school children transitioning to school [<xref rid="B14-sports-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-sports-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Social skills also play a crucial role in the transition to school, as they are essential for forming relationships with peers and teachers [<xref rid="B16-sports-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-sports-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The development of social skills during preschool is linked to children&#x02019;s readiness for school, as children who can communicate effectively and interact positively with others are better prepared to navigate the social dynamics of a classroom [<xref rid="B18-sports-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>Moreover, the physical health of pre-primary school children is integral to their QoL and school readiness. Adequate nutrition, physical activity (PA), and sleep (SL) are essential for optimal development and functioning [<xref rid="B5-sports-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-sports-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B19-sports-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Research has demonstrated that children who engage in regular PA and maintain a balanced diet exhibit better cognitive and emotional outcomes, which are crucial for successful school transitions [<xref rid="B20-sports-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-sports-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Conversely, children facing health challenges may experience difficulties in adjusting to school, underscoring the importance of addressing health-related QoL factors during pre-primary school years [<xref rid="B22-sports-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>Therefore, adherence to 24 h activity guidelines, which encompass PA, sedentary behaviour, and SL, can influence the QoL of young children. These guidelines promote a balanced lifestyle that integrates sufficient SL, regular PA, and limited sedentary time, which collectively contributes to improved health outcomes and overall well-being [<xref rid="B23-sports-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24-sports-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], all of which can enhance children&#x02019;s ability to adapt to new educational challenges, ultimately contributing to their overall QoL and academic success. Therefore, it is crucial to encourage adherence to these guidelines, especially in early childhood, as adherence often decreases when children begin primary school due to the increased demands of formal education [<xref rid="B12-sports-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-sports-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec1dot2-sports-13-00032"><title>1.2. The COVID-19 Pandemic</title><p>However, unforeseen circumstances can sometimes arise, disrupting children&#x02019;s ability to adhere to the 24 h activity guidelines. A prominent example is in 2020 when the world was shaken by the emergence of a novel disease known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). On 30 January, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a global health emergency, and by 11 March 2021, it had escalated to a pandemic [<xref rid="B25-sports-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly affected lifestyle behaviours worldwide, including those of pre-primary school children.</p><p>Around the world, many countries adopted various lockdown restrictions to curb the spread of the virus. As a result, public facilities, workplaces and educational facilities were either closed or operated with restricted hours, affecting all, including pre-primary children [<xref rid="B26-sports-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27-sports-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28-sports-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B29-sports-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B30-sports-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p>Studies have shown changes in various aspects of children&#x02019;s lives, including SL patterns, PA, screen time (ST), and mental health before, during, and after the pandemic [<xref rid="B27-sports-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28-sports-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B31-sports-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B32-sports-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B33-sports-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].

In China, ST usage was found to have increased from 47.5% to 85.7% during the pandemic [<xref rid="B37-sports-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. A study in Indonesia also revealed a staggering 150.0% increase in average daily screen time during the COVID-19 pandemic [<xref rid="B38-sports-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].</p><p>These changes have also been linked to negative effects on mental health, with children expressing worries and experiencing increased stress levels [<xref rid="B39-sports-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="B40-sports-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="B41-sports-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].

Furthermore, the pandemic has been associated with an increased incidence of overweight and obesity among pre-primary school children, possibly exacerbated by disrupted daily structures, mealtimes, and PA due to school closures [<xref rid="B42-sports-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="B43-sports-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="B44-sports-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>].

Singapore Context</title><p>In Singapore, the surge in COVID-19 cases also led the Singapore government to enforce preventive lockdown measures, causing major disruptions to children&#x02019;s daily routines.</p><p>With the rise in the number of COVID-19 cases in 2020, Singapore introduced a lockdown, known as the circuit breaker, to curb the spread of COVID-19. During the period between April 2020 to June 2020, workplaces shifted to remote operations, food establishments were restricted to take-away services, and schools, including preschools, moved to home-based learning [<xref rid="B47-sports-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Over the next two years, from 2020 to 2021, Singapore periodically introduced and lifted various restrictions, such as banning dining in, enforcing remote work and learning, and limiting gathering sizes in response to case surges. These measures were applied from June to December 2020, then again from May to June 2021, and from July to August 2021. By March 2022, outdoor mask requirements were lifted and restrictions were eased as we moved into the endemicity of COVID-19 [<xref rid="B47-sports-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec1dot4-sports-13-00032"><title>1.4.

Unlike the World Health Organization (WHO) 24 h Movement Guidelines, which categorise children and adolescents aged 5 to 17 under the same age group with uniform recommendations [<xref rid="B49-sports-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Singapore&#x02019;s guidelines are more specifically designed for different age ranges: infants (under 1 year), toddlers (1 to under 3 years), and preschoolers (3 to under 7 years). These guidelines also include dietary recommendations, which will not be evaluated in the current study as they were recently introduced.</p><p>For children aged 5 to 6, the WHO recommends at least 60 min of moderate-to-vigorous PA daily, with muscle and bone-strengthening activities at least three times a week [<xref rid="B49-sports-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. While the WHO suggests limiting sedentary ST, it does not specify a daily limit.

Purpose and Research Agenda</title><p>The pre-primary school period, typically for children aged 5 to 6 years is a critical stage of development that lays the foundation for future academic and social success. At this period, children undergo significant cognitive, emotional, and social growth, which prepares them for the more structured and demanding environment of formal schooling. Given the importance of building the right lifestyle behaviours to promote healthy development of the body and mind, it is essential to encourage greater adherence to meeting the recommended 24 h activity guidelines.</p><p>Singapore introduced its own 24 h activity guidelines for early childhood in 2021 to address the nation&#x02019;s specific health challenges (e.g., rapidly ageing population), cultural contexts (e.g., multi-racial) and lifestyle habits (e.g., high rates of diabetes in middle age groups). The development of these guidelines was prompted by rising concerns about childhood obesity, increasing sedentary behaviour and a lack of PA among young children. The initiative aimed to promote a healthier balance of PA, SL and ST to support the holistic well-being and development of preschool-aged children.</p><p>However, the COVID-19 pandemic further exacerbated these issues, disrupting children&#x02019;s routines and negatively impacting their ability to meet recommended levels of PA, SL, and ST [<xref rid="B50-sports-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. The ongoing effects of these disruptions highlight the critical need to reassess children&#x02019;s adherence to these guidelines, in order to develop strategies that can mitigate the pandemic&#x02019;s impact on their health and well-being.</p><p>Examining Singapore as a case study during the COVID-19 pandemic provides unique insights into the multifaceted impacts of the pandemic on pre-primary school children. With its robust public health infrastructure and proactive government response during the pandemic [<xref rid="B51-sports-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], Singapore created a distinct environment to analyse how the pandemic has affected children&#x02019;s lifestyles and health quality. The country&#x02019;s swift response, such as early lockdowns, widespread testing, and contact tracing, as well as the implementation of various support initiatives aimed at supporting families and children during the pandemic, creates a unique setting for observing changes in children&#x02019;s behaviours and its effects on health outcomes [<xref rid="B52-sports-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Lessons learnt from Singapore&#x02019;s experience with the COVID-19 pandemic can also inform future strategies, and these insights can guide future policies that protect the overall well-being of children in the face of future global health crises.</p><p>Therefore, this research sought to evaluate how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected Singapore&#x02019;s pre-primary school children&#x02019;s lifestyle behaviours at three critical stages: before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. By comparing these periods, this research aimed to provide a comprehensive understanding of the changes in children&#x02019;s PA, SL patterns, and ST, and how these behaviours are associated with their QoL. This information will help identify potential areas for intervention and opportunities for lifestyle amelioration in the daily lives of pre-primary school children in the COVID-19 endemic period.</p></sec><sec id="sec1dot6-sports-13-00032"><title>1.6.

Energetic play (MVPA) followed a similar pattern, decreasing during the lockdown (1.16 &#x000b1; 1.10 h) compared to pre-COVID (1.28 &#x000b1; 1.23 h, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01). This decline was anticipated due to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021, which brought lockdowns, restrictions on outdoor activities, playground closures, and limited access to sports facilities. Similar to Singapore, Japan and China&#x02019;s urban density and cultural emphasis on academics likely contribute to lower PA adherence, exacerbated by stringent pandemic restrictions. In Japan, PA among preschoolers fell significantly, with weekday and weekend playtime decreasing by 8.5% and 15.3%, respectively, after the pandemic began. China also saw a decrease in adherence from 35.7% to 22.5% [<xref rid="B37-sports-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Sweden reported shifts in children&#x02019;s movement behaviour, suggesting changes in adherence to activity guidelines [<xref rid="B55-sports-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. However, some exceptions were also observed, such as in Alberta, Canada, it was found that preschoolers engaged in more overall and MVPA during childcare hours in the pandemic compared to before. It is likely that Canada, with an abundance of outdoor spaces, better supported PA during the disruptions [<xref rid="B56-sports-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>].</p><p>Fortunately, our findings provide reassurance that, following the COVID-19 lockdown, the relaxation of restrictions and the return to indoor and outdoor activities have led to notable improvements in PA levels among pre-primary school children.

The total activity time (2.86 &#x000b1; 1.64 h, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) returned to pre-pandemic levels, and energetic play (1.37 &#x000b1; 1.17 h, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.002) has even exceeded the levels observed before COVID-19.

An increasing number of young children are regularly interacting with both fixed and mobile screens. Therefore, it is essential to consider the potential long-term effects of ST and to tackle excessive usage at an early stage [<xref rid="B63-sports-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>].</p><p>During the COVID-19 lockdown, there was a slight increase in the number of children failing to meet any guidelines (41.1%) compared to the pre-COVID (37.9%) and COVID-19 endemicity (36.5%) phases. The lowest proportion of children adhering to all three guidelines was also observed during the lockdown (0.7%), as opposed to pre-COVID (2.0%) and endemicity (2.1%), reflecting the adverse effects of restrictions on PA or changes in daily routines.</p><p>Thankfully, the endemicity period showed some recovery, with the percentage of children meeting two or all three guidelines improving to or exceeding pre-pandemic levels.</p><p>Notably, across all periods, 2.0% or fewer children managed to follow all three guidelines, underscoring the challenge of maintaining multiple health behaviours simultaneously regardless of whether there was an ongoing pandemic. However, it is also important to note that the majority of children in all periods met either none or only one of the guidelines, indicating that there is room for improvement across all time periods in helping children meet these health guidelines.</p><p>In terms of QoL, across all three time periods, health metrics consistently improved with greater adherence. The pre-COVID period showed a clear trend of improvement across all health metrics as more guidelines were met, with the largest boost seen when moving from two to three guidelines. During the COVID-19 lockdown, health metrics consistently improved with greater adherence, with physical health seeing the greatest gains from 0 to 3 guidelines. In the COVID-19 endemicity period, the highest health metric scores were observed when children met two guidelines, with psychosocial health showing the most notable improvement as adherence increased.</p><p>The positive correlations suggest that as more guidelines are met, QoL metrics tend to increase slightly. The consistency of these results across different time periods, including during the COVID-19 pandemic, also suggests a stable relationship between guideline adherence and QoL metrics.</p><p>Despite the analysis accounting for age and sex, which strengthens the validity of the findings by reducing potential confounding effects, the relationship is weak, suggesting that meeting more guidelines is associated with only slightly better QoL outcomes for children.</p><p>A possible explanation for the weak association might be due to the relatively small magnitude of changes in the guideline adherence measures over time. For example, while PA levels may have rebounded post-lockdown and guidelines have been met, the overall changes may not have been large enough to significantly influence the QoL metrics. Additionally, other moderating factors may have also played a larger role in determining these outcomes. The nature of the PaedQL used in this study integrates total health, including both physical and psychosocial health. The psychosocial component further breaks down into distinct domains such as school functioning, social functioning, and emotional functioning. Adherence to PA, ST, and SL guidelines may directly influence some aspects of QoL, such as physical health, but its impact on broader psychosocial domains is likely moderated by other environmental, social, and personal factors. These additional influences, such as family dynamics, socioeconomic status, and emotional support, may dilute the strength of the direct relationship between guideline adherence and QoL. These findings suggest that multiple factors, beyond guideline adherence alone, play a role in shaping children&#x02019;s health and well-being. This interplay between different health behaviours and other influencing factors could help explain why there is only a weak correlation between adherence to the guidelines and QoL.</p><p>In conclusion, adherence to the 24 h movement guidelines, encompassing PA, ST, and SL recommendations, does still play a small role in the QoL and overall health outcomes of preschool children. Other research across different countries and settings has also consistently highlighted the positive associations between meeting these guidelines and various aspects of child well-being [<xref rid="B53-sports-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,<xref rid="B64-sports-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>,<xref rid="B65-sports-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Understanding these associations is crucial for developing interventions and policies to promote the well-being and health outcomes of preschool children.

Overall, children&#x02019;s QoL scores tended to improve with the number of guidelines met. Despite the relatively weak strength of the associations, a statistically significant relationship exists between meeting more guidelines and achieving higher health scores.</p><p>These findings align with previous research, which shows that pre-primary children who adhere to more 24 h movement guidelines generally have better health-related QoL. For example, it was found that children meeting all three guidelines had significantly higher scores than those who did not [<xref rid="B66-sports-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. This suggests that adequate PA, reduced sedentary behaviour, and sufficient SL positively impact children&#x02019;s overall QoL. Additionally, following these guidelines has been associated with lower obesity rates and better mental health, both crucial for QoL [<xref rid="B67-sports-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>,<xref rid="B68-sports-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>].</p><p>The transition to formal schooling is a pivotal moment in a child&#x02019;s life, where the establishment of good lifestyle behaviours can lead to enhanced school readiness skills, including both academic and social competencies [<xref rid="B69-sports-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Incorporating healthy lifestyle education can improve children&#x02019;s cognitive and socio-emotional development, thereby facilitating a smoother transition into formal schooling [<xref rid="B70-sports-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. This underscores the importance of integrating lifestyle education into early childhood curricula to promote long-term academic success and well-being.</p><p>Excessive ST, lack of PA, and insufficient SL are unfavourable lifestyle behaviours that contribute to an obesogenic environment rather than fostering an active and healthy lifestyle [<xref rid="B71-sports-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Recently, there has been a growing national focus on implementing additional safeguards and guidelines, particularly around limiting ST for young children, to address the mental and physical health risks associated with excessive and early exposure to digital media [<xref rid="B72-sports-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>,<xref rid="B73-sports-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>].</p><p>Research highlights that healthy lifestyle practices in early childhood offer protective benefits against non-communicable diseases and poor health outcomes later in life [<xref rid="B74-sports-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>,<xref rid="B75-sports-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. Therefore, establishing healthy lifestyle habits during the pre-primary years is vital, as these early behaviours set the stage for long-term habits that often persist into adulthood.</p><p>Parents, caregivers, and educators are key in shaping children&#x02019;s lifestyle behaviours, as they are part of the immediate socio-ecological influences on the child [<xref rid="B76-sports-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. During the pre-primary years, parents, caregivers, and teachers must make concerted efforts to prepare children for formal schooling, aiming for a smooth transition from preschool to primary school. Early intervention plays a key role in ensuring that children start building good lifestyle behaviours so as to start formal education with minimal difficulties.</p><sec id="sec4dot4dot1-sports-13-00032"><title>4.4.1. Implications</title><p>This study has presented findings that showcase important practical implications for multi-stakeholders, including parents, schools and policymakers, in promoting greater adoption of healthier lifestyles among children.</p><p>The rebound in PA following the lockdown is a positive sign, indicating that children were able to re-engage in physical activities once restrictions were lifted. This recovery suggests that the COVID-19 lockdown had a disruptive but temporary effect on children&#x02019;s activity levels, and with the easing of restrictions, children could return to more active lifestyles. This rebound could also reflect the effectiveness of post-lockdown interventions, such as the reopening of outdoor spaces and recreational areas, which allowed children more opportunities to engage in PA.</p><p>However, the continued low adherence to ST guidelines post-lockdown raises significant concerns. Despite the easing of lockdown restrictions, screen time remained high, pointing to the potential long-term effects of lockdown habits, such as increased screen use during periods of home confinement. This persistent adherence gap suggests that efforts to reduce screen time may need to be more targeted and sustained, particularly as digital media continues to be integrated into daily routines both at home and in educational settings.</p><p>Therefore, policymakers, educators, and parents should continue to collaborate on promoting balanced routines that prioritise physical activity while limiting screen exposure.</p><p>The data underscore the need for stronger public advocacy by policymakers to focus on increasing physical activity (PA) and sleep (SL) while reducing screen time (ST) among children. The findings align with Singapore&#x02019;s current direction, particularly in regulating screen time in educational settings. Additionally, Singapore has been expanding the development of outdoor and play spaces. However, more efforts are needed to actively encourage and support parents in taking their children outdoors to utilise these spaces effectively.</p><p>Children spend a significant portion of their weekdays in school, making it essential for schools to actively promote healthier lifestyle behaviours. Based on the findings from this study, schools should encourage more PA by incorporating movement into lessons whenever possible or by introducing regular breaks from sedentary activities and avoiding prolonged sitting. Furthermore, the successful adoption of healthier behaviours depends on strong collaboration between parents and schools. Fostering home-school partnerships that consistently reinforce healthy behaviours can help prevent confusion for children, ensuring alignment between the expectations set at school and at home.</p><p>The findings from this study highlight the importance of establishing a well-balanced routine that incorporates PA, ensures sufficient SL, and promotes less ST. Parents should lead by example, limiting their own screen time and encouraging more play activities as a family. This not only fosters familial bonding but also creates an environment conducive to physical activity while helping to reduce screen time for children.</p></sec><sec id="sec4dot4dot2-sports-13-00032"><title>4.4.2. Strengths and Limitations</title><p>The participants in this study, regarding the ethnicity and gender of the preschool children, reflect the national demographic of Singapore. This study appears to be the first to compare the adherence to the newly launched Singapore Integrated 24 h Activity Guidelines over a five-year period and its correlation with health-related QoL.</p><p>However, a limitation of the study is that this was a cross-sectional study. While it can provide a valuable snapshot of the lifestyle behaviours of pre-primary children each year, the data do not allow for the establishment of causality as they do not track changes over the years [<xref rid="B77-sports-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>,<xref rid="B78-sports-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. Nonetheless, with the findings from this study, we are able to identify associations between adherence to guidelines and the health-related QoL of children each year. The number of valid responses collected during the COVID-19 endemicity period was smaller compared to the other two time periods. While the analysis was conducted using non-parametric tests that are more robust to unequal sample sizes, future studies should prioritise increasing participation and gathering more comprehensive data across the time periods. Additionally, the data are derived from self-reported online questionnaires, which may have been subjected to recall bias and social desirability bias. Parents who completed the questionnaires may have struggled to accurately recall or may have felt compelled to report more socially acceptable durations, potentially leading to inaccurate reporting of their children&#x02019;s PA, ST and SL, resulting in overestimations or underestimations of these behaviours. Nonetheless, to minimise social desirability bias, the survey was conducted anonymously, and the questionnaires were carefully developed. Recall bias was also addressed by limiting the survey to a seven-day recall period.</p></sec><sec id="sec4dot4dot3-sports-13-00032"><title>4.4.3. Future Studies</title><p>To mitigate recall bias and social desirability bias, future studies can use objective measures such as accelerometers to collect more accurate data and use them to cross-check with self-reported data. Future research should aim to assess the causal relationship between adherence to guidelines and developmental outcomes, as well as to examine the long-term effects of such adherence on children&#x02019;s physical, socioemotional, and cognitive development. This will provide a deeper understanding of how following these guidelines impacts overall well-being and informs strategies to promote sustained positive outcomes.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec5-sports-13-00032"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>Despite Singapore&#x02019;s robust health measures and quick response to the pandemic, the COVID-19 pandemic and its different phases still have had varying impacts on preschool children&#x02019;s adherence to ST, SL and PA guidelines. Children&#x02019;s lifestyles changed across the different time periods, with the COVID-19 lockdown generally showing the most negative impact on play time and time engaged in MVPA, while the COVID-19 endemicity period showed some recovery and even improvements. This underscores the importance of continuing efforts to encourage adherence to guidelines as we transition into the post-pandemic era in Singapore.</p><p>While the associations between QoL and adherence to guidelines may be weak, it is still concerning that the number of children consistently meeting all three guidelines over the three time periods of COVID-19 remained alarmingly low, especially given the impact adherence can have on the QoL for pre-primary children.</p><p>Considering the major disruptions COVID-19 caused to children&#x02019;s routines, it is essential to address the lingering effects on their lifestyle behaviours, with a focus on promoting recovery and fostering improvements. This requires the implementation of interventions that promote healthy habits, regular PA, and adequate SL.</p><p>However, addressing lifestyle behaviours in children is a complex and multifaceted challenge often referred to as a &#x0201c;wicked problem&#x0201d;. Achieving meaningful progress in adherence to guidelines demands sustained interventions that are not only evidence-based but also adaptable to evolving circumstances and contexts. Effective solutions require consistent monitoring of behavioural trends and outcomes, alongside the ability to remain flexible and responsive to changes. Given the intricate web of factors influencing lifestyle behaviours among children, a multi-stakeholder approach, with parents, schools, healthcare providers and policymakers working in unison, is necessary. A sustained, unified and comprehensive effort among key stakeholders is critical to empowering children to adopt and sustain healthy behaviours. By fostering a nurturing environment and prioritising collaborative efforts, we not only support children&#x02019;s growth and development but also set the foundation for positive health outcomes [<xref rid="B79-sports-13-00032" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>].</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors acknowledge and express their appreciation to all preschools that collaborated in the research and to all parents who participated in the research.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclaimer/Publisher&#x02019;s Note:</bold> The statements, opinions and data contained in all publications are solely those of the individual author(s) and contributor(s) and not of MDPI and/or the editor(s).
