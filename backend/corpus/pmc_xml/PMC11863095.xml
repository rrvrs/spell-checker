These components are also implicated in carcinogenesis. Thoracic SMARCA4-deficient undifferentiated tumor is a recently introduced category in the fifth edition of the WHO classification in 2021, typically exhibiting rhabdoid morphology in adults. In contrast, rhabdoid tumors occurring within the abdominal cavity in adults are rare and sporadic, with limited detailed documentation, making them relatively less understood compared to their thoracic counterparts.</p></sec><sec><title>CASE PRESENTATION</title><p>A man in his 70s was admitted to our hospital with a chief complaint of fever. He was diagnosed with a mesenteric solid tumor measuring 6 cm in maximum diameter. Shortly after the hospitalization, bowel obstruction became evident, accompanied by the rapid tumor progression, and then surgical treatment was attempted. A soft, bulky tumor situated in the mesentery accompanied by extensive tumor dissemination was found intraoperatively. The tumor was resected along with the obstructed terminal ileum, aiming to restore intestinal patency and obtain tissue samples. Histopathologically, the tumor represented morphological features resembling a rhabdoid tumor along with a high Ki67 labeling index (50%). Immunohistochemistry revealed SMARCA2 deficiency with preserved SMARCA4 expression. The absence of Claudin-4 expression further supported the diagnosis of a mesenteric SMARCA2-deficient yet SMARCA4-preserved undifferentiated tumor.

Further research is required to improve our understanding of its clinical features, underlying mechanisms, and optimal management strategies.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>KEYWORDS</title><kwd>rhabdoid tumor</kwd><kwd>mesenteric undifferentiated tumor</kwd><kwd>SMARCA2</kwd><kwd>SMARCA4</kwd><kwd>SWItch Sucrose non-fermentable chromatin remodeling complex</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="abbreviations" id="s1"><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>

His appetite and oral food intake were normal during this period. A solid mass, the size of a fist, was palpable on his lower abdomen without associated tenderness. He had a history of heavy smoking (Brinkman index: 800) and was diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.</p><p>Upon admission, contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) revealed a solid tumor measuring 6 cm in maximum diameter with moderate vascularity located in the mesentery of the terminal ileum accompanied by minimal ascites (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig. 1A</bold></xref>). Findings indicative of intestinal obstruction were not identified.

Blood tests showed an elevated white blood cell count (15900/mm<sup>3</sup>) and C-reactive protein (32.4 mg/dL).

Accordingly, the treatment approach was planned to involve histological confirmation and initiation of chemotherapy. However, on the third day following admission, abdominal distension and vomiting became evident, leading to the diagnosis of small bowel obstruction. Gastrointestinal decompression using a long tube was performed; however, it proved to be ineffective. A small bowel contrast study and following abdominal CT demonstrated severe intestinal obstruction caused by the solid tumor. Therefore, surgical treatment was attempted (Day 6).</p><sec id="s3_1"><title>Intraoperative findings</title><p>A soft, bulky tumor situated in the mesentery and involving the terminal ileum was observed (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig. 1D</bold></xref>), accompanied by extensive tumor dissemination towards the sigmoid colon and bladder. Additionally, a moderate volume of ascites with rich bloody components was present across the abdominal cavity. Due to extensive peritoneal tumor dissemination, a palliative surgery was performed to obtain a tissue diagnosis and relieve intestinal obstruction, as an R0 resection was deemed unfeasible.</p></sec><sec id="s3_2"><title>Postoperative clinical course</title><p>Despite transient improvement in oral food intake following surgery, the postoperative course was marred by rapid progression of residual tumor tissue.

This tumor is characterized by its high malignancy in adults with primary involvement in the thoracic region and undifferentiated rhabdoid morphology.<sup><xref rid="ref-3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>)</sup></p><p>SMARCA4 is one of the 15 components comprising the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, known to regulate gene expression by controlling chromatin compaction and accessibility for gene transcription in an ATP-dependent manner. In addition to SMARCA4, the SWI/SNF complex also includes SMARCA2 and SMARCB1, each known as constituent components implicated in carcinogenesis.<sup><xref rid="ref-4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>)</sup> Most SWI/SNF-deficient undifferentiated tumors exhibit monomorphic, undifferentiated epithelioid cells with rhabdoid cytomorphology.<sup><xref rid="ref-4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>)</sup></p><p>While rhabdoid tumors have been well recognized as highly malignant neoplasms in pediatric patients, with atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors arising in the central nervous system,<sup><xref rid="ref-5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>)</sup> recently, tumors displaying characteristic rhabdoid morphology are reported in various organs, including thoracic tumors, among adult malignancies.<sup><xref rid="ref-6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="ref-7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>)</sup> Moreover, while SWI/SNF-deficient undifferentiated tumors are rare entities and typically display characteristic rhabdoid morphology, SWI/SNF complex deficiency is observed in over 20% of epithelial malignant tumors in both children and adults, even in the absence of this morphology.<sup><xref rid="ref-4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>)</sup> Associations have been suggested, including differentiation status, MSI mutations, and BRAF mutations.<sup><xref rid="ref-8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>)</sup></p><p>Thoracic tumors with SMARCA4 deficiency comprise two subtypes: SMARCA4-deficient undifferentiated tumors and NSCLC with SMARCA4 deficiency.<sup><xref rid="ref-9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>)</sup> Considering the fact that SWI/SNF complex deficiency is found in gastrointestinal malignancies, similar observations may be suggested in other types of cancers. According to Rekhtman <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., the epithelial adhesion molecule Claudin-4 is expressed in SWI/SNF-deficient NSCLC, while almost no expression is observed in SWI/SNF-deficient undifferentiated tumors.<sup><xref rid="ref-10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>)</sup> Thus, Claudin-4 may serve as a criterion for determining the origin of tumors.<sup><xref rid="ref-9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>)</sup></p><p>Here, we present a case of a patient diagnosed with a mesenteric undifferentiated tumor exhibiting rhabdoid features. The clinical course was notable for the unusually rapid progression of the tumor, distinguishing it from commonly encountered malignant neoplasms. The mesenteric tumor displayed morphological features resembling rhabdoid tumors and exhibited vigorous cell proliferation, prompting consideration of SWI/SNF-deficient tumors in the differential diagnosis. Ultimately, SMARCA2 deficiency was noted, while SMARCA4 expression was preserved. Furthermore, the absence of Claudin-4 expression led to the diagnosis of a Mesenteric SMARCA2-deficient yet SMARCA4-preserved undifferentiated tumor.</p><p>While SMARCA4-deficient undifferentiated tumors generally coincide with SMARCA2 deficiency, reports of undifferentiated tumors with preserved SMARCA4 expression and isolated SMARCA2 deficiency are limited. In 2022, Iwakoshi et al. reported three cases of thoracic SMARCA2-deficient yet SMARCA4-preserved undifferentiated tumors exhibiting Claudin-4 deficiency. Similar to our case, all three cases had unfavorable prognoses compared to NSCLC.<sup><xref rid="ref-9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>)</sup></p><p>It is reported that SWI/SNF deficiency, including isolated SMARCA2 loss, is present in a certain proportion of gastrointestinal cancers associated with poor prognosis.<sup><xref rid="ref-11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>)</sup> However, reports of gastrointestinal undifferentiated tumors exhibiting rhabdoid features, solitary SMARCA2-deficiency, and Claudin-4 negativity are rare, and to our knowledge, this is the first report of such a case.</p><p>Regarding treatment strategies, the therapeutic approach for Thoracic SMARCA4-UT may serve as a useful reference. Cytotoxic chemotherapy is not considered effective in SMARCA4-deficient tumors. Interestingly, SMARCA4 expression is a predictive biomarker in patients undergoing adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy in NSCLC. Next-generation sequencing of SMARCA4-UT has shown a high tumor mutation burden (TMB) in some cases, suggesting that regimens containing immune checkpoint inhibitors may offer promising treatment strategies.<sup><xref rid="ref-10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="ref-12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>)</sup> While publication bias should be taken into account, a durable response to pembrolizumab in thoracic SMARCA4-UT has been reported in a single case.<sup><xref rid="ref-13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>)</sup></p><p>Limitations are as follows: Regarding the mediastinal tumor, its consistent enlargement with the mesenteric tumor suggests a correlation; however, a biopsy was not performed. As for the possibility of the mediastinal tumor being a primary tumor metastasizing to the abdominal cavity, this scenario appears less likely given the lack of enlargement of mediastinal lymph nodes or lung tumors, along with the larger tumor volume in the abdominal cavity. Due to the rapid progression of the disease, the diagnosis of the SNF/SWI-deficient mesenteric tumor was made posthumously, preventing the assessment of microsatellite instability status, programmed cell death protein 1/programmed cell ligand 1 expression, and TMB in our case.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="s5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>In conclusion, evaluation of SWI/SNF expression and Claudin-4 could lead to the final diagnosis of intra-abdominal undifferentiated tumor presenting vigorous growth and rhabdoid morphology. Its clinical presentation is challenging, and the establishment of the concept and nosology of this rare malignancy is recent; further research is required to improve our understanding of its clinical features, underlying mechanisms, and optimal management strategies. When encountering an abdominal undifferentiated tumor with aggressive growth, SWI/SNF-deficient UT should be considered as a potential diagnosis, as this entity remains relatively novel and not well recognized outside of thoracic organs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="acknowledgments" id="s6"><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>We would like to express our sincere gratitude to Dr. Tokiko NAKAI and Dr. Tomonori OTANI for their invaluable effort in the pathological examination.
