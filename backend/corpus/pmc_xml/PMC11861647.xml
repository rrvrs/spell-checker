Based on these, an individualised learning plan was assigned.&#x000a0;Each task is delivered using either interactive videos, chatbot and/or animated/AI games.&#x000a0;The child&#x02019;s progress is captured for attention (attempted questions, retries and timeouts) and retention (first time corrects and corrects) continuously.&#x000a0;The initial interactive questions administered to parents were repeated to assess child&#x02019;s progress in real life.&#x000a0;Paired &#x02018;t&#x02019; test using SPSS version 26 was used to compare initial and final data.</p></sec><sec id="sec0396"><title>Results</title><p>Out of 85 registered children, 41 regularly used the AI tool. Mean age was 43.93 months (range 26 to 72 months).&#x000a0;37 (90.24%) were boys. The baseline mean scores (ranges), were CARS 33.48 (30-39.5); Social quotient 53.4 (27.25-80.32), Developmental quotient 71.35 (45.90-93.33) and IQ 62.34 (36.58-86.83).&#x000a0;The base line mean score of parents assessed child function was 115.24 (range 58 to 215).&#x000a0;A mean of 15.54 tasks were given (range 5 to 48).&#x000a0;At the time of analysis with a mean follow up of 3 months (range 2 to 5 months) the children completed a mean of 10.10 tasks (range 0 to 42).&#x000a0;There was significant improvement in child&#x02019;s learning captured by the AI software based on attention and retention parameters (p = &#x0003c;0.00001).&#x000a0;This improvement was also reflected in parent assessed child function (mean 147.15, (59 to 231)) (p = &#x0003c;0.00001).&#x000a0;The percentage of improvement in both software captured and parent assessed child function was directly related to the amount of time spent by the child on the software.</p></sec><sec id="sec0397"><title>Conclusions</title><p>AI driven individualised learning approach is effective in teaching skills and promote social integration for children with ASD.&#x000a0;Such technology can capture the child&#x02019;s progress on a day-to-day basis and deliver personalised training.</p></sec><sec id="sec0398"><title>Disclosure of Interest</title><p>None Declared</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="1"/></counts></article-meta></front></article>
