According to projections by the United Nations, by 2030, the number of people aged 60 years and older worldwide will reach approximately 1.4 billion, accounting for over 16% of the global population [<xref rid="pone.0324130.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The incidence of cognitive impairment increases with age, with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease becoming increasingly prevalent [<xref rid="pone.0324130.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. According to data from the World Health Organization (WHO), approximately 50 million people globally are living with cognitive impairment, the vast majority of whom have Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease [<xref rid="pone.0324130.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The growing size of this population not only affects the quality of life of older adults but also imposes a substantial socioeconomic burden. Consequently, the prevention and management of cognitive impairment has emerged as a pressing global health challenge.</p><p>In China, the pace of population aging and the associated risk of cognitive impairment are particularly pronounced. It is projected that by 2035, the number of people aged 60 years and older in China will exceed 400 million, accounting for over 30% of the total population [<xref rid="pone.0324130.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. This demographic shift places China at a heightened risk for cognitive impairment [<xref rid="pone.0324130.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Recent studies have shown a steady rise in cognitive decline among Chinese older adults, with prevalence increasing from 11% in 2011 to 28% in 2019, particularly in regions with significant urban&#x02013;rural disparities [<xref rid="pone.0324130.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Furthermore, due to China&#x02019;s unique socioeconomic conditions, cultural factors, and family structures, the impact of cognitive impairment on the elderly is more complex and profound. As the affected population continues to grow, cognitive health has become a key issue influencing the trajectory of healthy aging in China [<xref rid="pone.0324130.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>In recent years, a range of interventions targeting cognitive impairment have been implemented in China, including the establishment of elderly health management platforms and cognitive health promotion initiatives. Nevertheless, the prevalence of cognitive impairment continues to rise, which is closely linked to the limitations of current intervention strategies and related research. Specifically, existing studies often suffer from small sample sizes [<xref rid="pone.0324130.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324130.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], limited geographic representation, and a focus on urban or region-specific populations [<xref rid="pone.0324130.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0324130.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], thereby failing to reflect the cognitive health status of the nationwide elderly population. Moreover, current interventions primarily emphasize individual-level treatment approaches [<xref rid="pone.0324130.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324130.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], lacking comprehensive analyses of multidimensional influencing factors such as socioeconomic status, health behaviors, and chronic diseases. These methodological shortcomings have contributed to suboptimal intervention outcomes, highlighting the urgent need for a more holistic and integrated research perspective.</p><p>In light of the above, this study aims to systematically investigate the multidimensional factors associated with cognitive impairment among middle-aged and older adults in China, using data from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS). In contrast to previous studies, this research adopts a large-scale, nationally representative design, seeking to address existing gaps in the literature and provide robust evidence for the development of targeted public health policies and intervention strategies. By comprehensively analyzing socioeconomic, behavioral, and clinical factors, the study aims to identify effective approaches to improve cognitive health outcomes. Ultimately, it seeks to support policy and practice innovations that enhance the health and quality of life of the aging population in China.</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>1. Data and methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>1.1. Data source</title><p>The China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) is a nationally representative, longitudinal survey aimed at examining the health, economic, and retirement status of Chinese individuals aged 45 years and older, along with their spouses. Conducted from 2011 to 2020, CHARLS stands as the first national survey focused on the middle-aged and elderly population in China, providing a comprehensive, high-quality public micro-database that is valuable for scientific and policy research.</p><p>The 2018 wave (Wave 4) of CHARLS, which serves as the data source for this study, included data from 150 county-level units (excluding Tibet) and 450 villages/urban communities across China. The survey utilized a multistage probability sampling method, encompassing 19,744 individuals from 10,257 households. It collected extensive information on various topics, including demographics, health status, economic conditions, family structure, and social support. Additionally, physical measurements, health examinations, and lifestyle factors were also recorded.</p><p>This study is a cross-sectional analysis based on the 2018 CHARLS data, with ethical approval obtained from the Biomedical Ethics Committee of Peking University (Approval No: IRB00001052&#x02013;110155). All participants who consented to take part in the survey signed an informed consent form. The CHARLS survey excludes individuals residing in collective dwellings, such as nursing homes, military bases, and schools, ensuring that the data reflect the experiences of community residents.</p><p>By offering a robust and internationally comparable dataset on the health and socioeconomic conditions of the middle-aged and elderly population in China, CHARLS provides valuable insights into the challenges and needs of this demographic group.</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>1.2.

Cognitive function assessment</title><p>Cognitive function in this study was assessed using the MMSE [<xref rid="pone.0324130.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], a widely recognized tool for evaluating cognitive impairment and intellectual functioning. The MMSE provides a comprehensive and accurate reflection of the degree of cognitive deficits and intellectual levels, serving as a basis for neuropsychological diagnosis and treatment. The MMSE covers multiple cognitive domains, including memory, orientation, comprehension, attention, and reading/constructional abilities. The total score ranges from 0 to 30, with higher scores indicating better cognitive function.</p><p>In this study, the criteria for cognitive impairment were adjusted based on participants&#x02019; educational levels: a score of &#x02264;17 for illiterate individuals,&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;20 for those with primary education, and &#x02264;24 for those with secondary education or higher was classified as cognitive impairment, while scores above these thresholds were considered indicative of normal cognitive function [<xref rid="pone.0324130.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>1.4.

Statistical analysis</title><p>Categorical data were presented as frequencies and proportions, and differences between groups were assessed using the chi-square test.</p><p>Due to the inclusion of numerous variables and the high dimensionality of the data, this study employed a combination of LASSO regression and logistic regression for multivariate analysis of cognitive status.</p><p>LASSO regression, a penalized regression technique, was used to select the most relevant variables by shrinking the coefficients of less important variables to zero, thereby retaining only those strongly associated with cognitive status. A seed number (123) was set to ensure reproducibility, and the &#x0201c;glmnet&#x0201d; package in R was used for the analysis. The optimal lambda (&#x003bb;) value was determined using 10-fold cross-validation.

Specifically, for each additional year of age, the risk of cognitive impairment increases by approximately 9.8%. Previous studies [<xref rid="pone.0324130.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] have supported a close relationship between age and cognitive decline. As age increases, physiological changes in the body and brain lead to a decline in various cognitive functions. Age-related neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease (AD) and other forms of cognitive impairment, tend to exacerbate with advancing age. The mechanisms behind these neurodegenerative diseases are closely related to changes in brain structure and function. Research has shown [<xref rid="pone.0324130.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] that as age increases, neural cells in the brain gradually lose function, and neural transmission processes slow down, which can lead to a decline in cognitive functions such as attention, memory, and language skills. Furthermore, aging can result in other physiological and biochemical changes, such as reduced blood flow, insufficient oxygen supply, and a decline in neurotransmitter function, all of which can further affect cognitive function in the brain [<xref rid="pone.0324130.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In addition to biological mechanisms, aging is also accompanied by changes in socio-psychological factors that may indirectly affect cognitive health. For example, older adults may face increased loneliness and social isolation, both of which have been identified as significant risk factors for cognitive decline [<xref rid="pone.0324130.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Additionally, the widespread use of medications and changes in lifestyle (such as reduced physical activity and poor nutrition) in the elderly population may further accelerate the decline in cognitive function [<xref rid="pone.0324130.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>The study shows that sleep duration is a significant factor influencing cognitive function, with an <italic toggle="yes">OR</italic> of 0.964 (<italic toggle="yes">95% CI</italic>: 0.943&#x02013;0.985), meaning that for each additional hour of sleep, the risk of cognitive impairment decreases by approximately 3.6%. This result highlights the significant role of sleep in protecting cognitive function, particularly in individuals with insufficient sleep, where increasing sleep duration helps reduce the risk of cognitive decline. However, the restricted cubic spline analysis indicates that when daily sleep duration increases from 0 to 5.83 hours, its effect size on cognitive risk has decreased. Once sleep duration exceeds 5.83 hours, the risk of cognitive impairment increases as sleep duration increases. This U-shaped relationship suggests that the association between sleep duration and cognitive function follows a more complex dynamic pattern. Moderate sleep has significant benefits for brain health, whereas excessive sleep may indicate other underlying health issues that could negatively affect cognitive function [<xref rid="pone.0324130.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324130.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Sleep deprivation prevents the brain from receiving adequate rest and repair, and prolonged sleep deprivation can affect brain structure and function, increasing the risk of cognitive decline. Sufficient sleep is essential for brain health, especially during the repair and memory consolidation processes that occur at night. Studies have shown that the deep sleep phase is critical for the brain to clear waste and repair damage, particularly in reinforcing and repairing neural cells and connections [<xref rid="pone.0324130.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Additionally, sleep helps enhance learning and memory processes; especially after learning new information, sleep aids in converting short-term memories into long-term ones, thereby improving cognitive function. On the other hand, excessive sleep has also been linked to cognitive impairment. Chen W&#x02019;s study [<xref rid="pone.0324130.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] suggests that too much sleep may lead to daytime sleepiness, difficulty concentrating, and memory decline, thereby affecting an individual&#x02019;s cognitive function. Excessive sleep could be indicative of underlying health issues, particularly related to mental health disorders (such as depression and anxiety) or neurodegenerative diseases (such as Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease). In such cases, although sleep duration is longer, its quality may be poor, or it may be intertwined with other health problems, potentially negatively impacting cognitive function.</p><p>According to the study results, females have a lower risk of cognitive impairment compared to males, with an <italic toggle="yes">OR</italic> of 0.891 (<italic toggle="yes">95% CI</italic>: 0.806&#x02013;0.984). This finding is consistent with related literature and theories. Many studies suggest that gender may influence the incidence of cognitive decline, with females generally having a lower risk of cognitive decline than males [<xref rid="pone.0324130.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324130.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. This may be attributed to factors such as females&#x02019; long-term life experiences, social support, and relatively higher education levels and health behaviors during certain periods. Additionally, some studies [<xref rid="pone.0324130.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0324130.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] have pointed out that physiological characteristics of females, such as longer life expectancy and hormonal changes, may also impact cognitive health. However, despite the gender differences, the risk of cognitive impairment is influenced by the interaction of numerous factors, including social, cultural, and psychological factors. Females in many cultures may enjoy more social support and social engagement, which have been shown to contribute to the maintenance of cognitive health.</p><p>Compared to married individuals, the risk of cognitive impairment in divorced or widowed individuals is significantly reduced, with an <italic toggle="yes">OR</italic> of 0.523 (<italic toggle="yes">95% CI</italic>: 0.455&#x02013;0.600). Divorce or widowhood may prompt individuals to reassess their lifestyle, leading them to adopt more proactive health behaviors, such as engaging in more social activities and exercise, which contribute to the maintenance of cognitive health [<xref rid="pone.0324130.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Moreover, divorced or widowed individuals may rely more on external social support and community resources, which could potentially reduce the risk of cognitive decline. Therefore, although divorce or widowhood is generally considered a negative factor that may increase the risk of cognitive impairment, certain factors in these groups may help mitigate this risk.</p><p>Compared to individuals with a rural household registration, those with an urban household registration (<italic toggle="yes">OR</italic> = 1.201, <italic toggle="yes">95% CI</italic>: 1.077&#x02013;1.339) was found to be at higher risk for cognitive impairment. This conclusion is supported by related studies. For example, XIANG Y et al. found that urban residents are more likely to experience a higher risk of cognitive decline and dementia compared to rural residents [<xref rid="pone.0324130.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. This may be attributed to factors such as increased life stress, lower social support, environmental pollution, and a higher prevalence of chronic diseases in urban environments. The intensification of urbanization is often associated with lifestyle changes, such as poor dietary habits, lack of exercise, and higher psychological stress, all of which could accelerate cognitive decline. Moreover, high population density in urban areas may lead to greater social isolation, further impacting cognitive health [<xref rid="pone.0324130.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. This could explain the association between urban household registration and cognitive impairment.</p><p>Compared to individuals with self-rated health as &#x0201c;Good,&#x0201d; those who rated their health as &#x0201c;Fair&#x0201d; had a higher risk of cognitive impairment, with an <italic toggle="yes">OR</italic> of 1.231 (<italic toggle="yes">95% CI</italic>: 1.079&#x02013;1.404). This result is consistent with studies by Bendayan and colleagues, which also found that poorer self-rated health is associated with an increased risk of cognitive decline, especially in the elderly population [<xref rid="pone.0324130.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Self-rated health is an important subjective measure of an individual&#x02019;s overall perception of their physical and mental health. Individuals who rate their health as poor tend to experience more physical and mental health problems, including chronic diseases, poor quality of life, and social isolation, all of which may contribute to cognitive decline. However, a self-rated health of &#x0201c;Poor&#x0201d; does not necessarily predict cognitive decline, as it may also be influenced by an individual&#x02019;s sensitivity to their health condition and their ability to improve health behaviors (e.g., actively seeking medical help or making lifestyle changes). Therefore, these individuals may, in some cases, demonstrate better cognitive function. Ramsingh also noted that poor self-rated health may prompt individuals to pay more attention to health management, potentially reducing the risk of cognitive decline [<xref rid="pone.0324130.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p><p>The results show that chronic disease is a risk factor for cognitive function, with an <italic toggle="yes">OR</italic> of 1.277 (<italic toggle="yes">95% CI</italic>: 1.168&#x02013;1.395). Individuals with chronic diseases are at higher risk for cognitive impairment. This conclusion is supported by numerous studies. ANTAL B et al. reported that chronic diseases may affect brain health through various mechanisms, thus accelerating the onset of cognitive decline [<xref rid="pone.0324130.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. For instance, high blood glucose levels caused by diabetes can lead to vascular damage and microvascular changes in the brain. These vascular issues may interfere with brain blood supply, thereby affecting brain function and the maintenance of cognitive abilities. Chronic diseases are also typically associated with systemic inflammation, and this chronic low-grade inflammation is considered harmful to the brain, potentially leading to cognitive decline by damaging neurons and synaptic connections. Moreover, LEE Y&#x02019;s research found that individuals with chronic diseases, especially the elderly with multiple comorbidities, face a higher risk of cognitive decline [<xref rid="pone.0324130.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The poor cardiovascular health of chronic disease patients leads to insufficient oxygen and nutrient supply to the brain, which is also a significant factor in cognitive impairment. Additionally, lifestyle and health behaviors of individuals with chronic diseases often exacerbate the deterioration of cognitive function. Studies have shown [<xref rid="pone.0324130.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] that psychological factors and lack of social support directly affect the occurrence of chronic diseases, indirectly influencing cognitive function.</p><p>Impairment of IADL is a risk factor for cognitive function, with an <italic toggle="yes">OR</italic> of 2.094 (<italic toggle="yes">95% CI</italic>: 1.857&#x02013;2.362). IADL evaluates an individual&#x02019;s ability to independently perform complex tasks in daily life, such as managing finances, cooking, shopping, and using transportation, all of which typically require higher cognitive and executive function. Therefore, IADL impairment can be a sensitive indicator of cognitive decline, especially in the elderly population. The relationship between IADL impairment and cognitive decline has been confirmed by several studies. For example, POPE C et al. found that IADL impairment often occurs in the early stages of cognitive decline and can serve as an important predictor of cognitive deterioration [<xref rid="pone.0324130.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. As cognitive function declines, individuals typically experience difficulties in handling complex daily tasks, such as managing finances, household chores, and maintaining social activities. These tasks depend on an individual&#x02019;s working memory, attention, planning, and decision-making abilities. In addition, IADL, as the factor with the highest effect size on cognitive function, may be related to the fact that the personal abilities required to complete IADL tasks are highly similar to the items assessed by the MMSE scale. For example, managing finances is related to memory and calculation ability, while shopping is related to orientation. Therefore, when IADL is impaired, it often indicates problems with the brain&#x02019;s executive functions, which in turn suggests a decline in cognitive abilities.</p><p>Alcohol consumption is a risk factor for cognitive function, with an <italic toggle="yes">OR</italic> of 1.187 (<italic toggle="yes">95% CI</italic>: 1.068&#x02013;1.320). Excessive alcohol consumption has been shown to be closely related to an increased risk of cognitive decline and dementia. For instance, WOODS A&#x02019;s research found that individuals who engage in long-term heavy drinking are more likely to develop cognitive impairment, including Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease, compared to non-drinkers or moderate drinkers [<xref rid="pone.0324130.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Even moderate alcohol consumption may be associated with cognitive decline, suggesting that the impact of alcohol on cognitive health may be cumulative. BRENNAN S&#x02019;s research pointed out that although small amounts of alcohol may have some cardiovascular protective effects, its impact on cognitive function is not entirely harmless, especially in the context of long-term alcohol use [<xref rid="pone.0324130.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The damage to the brain caused by alcohol primarily manifests as neurotoxicity. Alcohol can affect the brain&#x02019;s neurotransmitters, damage neuron structures, and reduce neural plasticity, leading to cognitive decline. Alcohol&#x02019;s metabolic products (such as acetaldehyde) can damage the hippocampal region of the brain, which is crucial for memory and learning abilities, thus leading to symptoms such as memory loss, difficulty concentrating, and executive dysfunction in long-term drinkers.</p><p>Exercise is considered a risk factor for cognitive function, with an <italic toggle="yes">OR</italic> of 1.819 (<italic toggle="yes">95% CI</italic>: 1.537&#x02013;2.152). This result seems contradictory because exercise is generally viewed as a protective factor for cognitive health. However, exercise may reflect that individuals with cognitive impairment attempt to improve their health through physical activity rather than directly causing cognitive decline. JIN Q suggested that exercise in the early stages of cognitive decline might only be a sign of deteriorating health [<xref rid="pone.0324130.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Additionally, differences in the type and intensity of exercise may affect the results. Some high-intensity exercise could increase physical stress, affecting cognitive health. TAYLOR J&#x02019;s study indicated that excessive exercise could lead to physical fatigue and hormonal fluctuations, which in turn may affect brain function [<xref rid="pone.0324130.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Exercise may also indirectly influence cognitive function by affecting the stress response mechanisms (such as cortisol levels), particularly in individuals with chronic health issues or in the elderly population. An individual&#x02019;s motivation and psychological factors related to exercise can also influence the outcome. MANDOLESI L emphasized that exercise habits, frequency, and psychological motivation are key factors. If individuals feel difficulty or excessive stress during exercise, it may negatively impact their cognitive health [<xref rid="pone.0324130.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].</p><p>Physical disability is considered a protective factor for cognitive function, with an <italic toggle="yes">OR</italic> of 0.848 <italic toggle="yes">(95% CI</italic>: 0.769&#x02013;0.936), a result that contradicts the usual negative correlation between disability and cognitive decline. Individuals with disabilities may compensate for functional deficits through cognitive and behavioral strategies. For example, individuals who have lost sensory functions may enhance the use of other senses, which could improve cognitive abilities in other domains. Moreover, disability may prompt individuals to rely more on memory, planning, and decision-making functions, thereby delaying cognitive decline. Disabled individuals typically receive more medical and social support, which benefits cognitive health. MATTKE S&#x02019;s research suggested that frequent medical examinations and cognitive assessments could help detect cognitive issues early and take preventive measures [<xref rid="pone.0324130.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Additionally, individuals with disabilities may place greater emphasis on health management and self-care, reducing the risk of cognitive decline. AI F&#x02019;s research found that social interactions and daily support networks, especially assistance from family and friends, play a vital role in enhancing cognitive health. Psychological adaptation is also an important factor. A positive psychological state and emotional regulation protect cognitive function, helping individuals maintain better social engagement and reduce the risk of cognitive decline [<xref rid="pone.0324130.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].</p><sec id="sec020"><title>Limitations</title><p>Despite the comprehensive nature of this study, several limitations should be acknowledged.
