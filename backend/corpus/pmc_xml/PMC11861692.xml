Introduction</title><p>The human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a respiratory virus from the genus <italic toggle="yes">Orthopneumovirus</italic> within the <italic toggle="yes">Pneumoviridae</italic> family [<xref rid="B1-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. RSV is responsible for approximately 33 million cases of acute lower respiratory tract infections (such as bronchiolitis and pneumonia) globally and is recognized as a common cause of morbidity, particularly among young children. Nearly all children contract RSV by age two, most experiencing only mild respiratory symptoms, though the virus follows a clear seasonal pattern [<xref rid="B5-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In infants, while approximately 90% of cases are managed in outpatient settings, RSV is a significant driver of hospital admissions, even in otherwise healthy infants [<xref rid="B7-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Additionally, RSV affects more than just pediatric populations; in fact, it also poses a substantial health burden for adults, especially immunocompromised individuals and older adults, with a marked impact on those in institutional care [<xref rid="B9-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Consequently, RSV has a considerable global impact, both in direct healthcare costs and through indirect economic effects [<xref rid="B12-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>Several technological advancements have been developed to prevent RSV infections, particularly targeting the most vulnerable populations (i.e., young children and the elderly). Passive immunization with monoclonal antibodies including newer long-acting antibodies has become a key strategy for protecting infants, especially those at high risk. These antibodies provide temporary immunity by neutralizing the virus and preventing its spread in the respiratory tract [<xref rid="B15-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In addition, subunit protein-based vaccines and innovative mRNA technology-based vaccines designed to elicit immune responses in both pediatric and elderly populations are undergoing advanced clinical trials, focusing on the RSV fusion protein (the key pathogenetic factor) to generate a robust immune response [<xref rid="B18-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>The approval of RSV vaccines and long-acting antibodies by major regulatory bodies, such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA), has marked a significant advancement in RSV prevention. In 2023, the FDA approved the use of RSV vaccines for older adults [<xref rid="B26-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], while both maternal vaccines and long-acting monoclonal antibodies have been approved for newborns and children [<xref rid="B27-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], offering protection during the peak RSV season. The EMA has similarly endorsed these innovations, paving the way for broader adoption across Europe. Several countries, including the United States and members of the European Union, have either introduced or are preparing to roll out these preventive measures, prioritizing high-risk populations such as infants, pregnant women, and the elderly. The increasing global focus on RSV prevention through these approvals reflects a commitment to reducing the virus&#x02019;s impact, particularly among those most vulnerable to severe outcomes. On the other hand, it is well known that the availability of an approved vaccine does not guarantee its uptake by the target population: while the causes are likely multifactorial, vaccine hesitancy is a contributing factor. The most frequently studied factors that facilitate or inhibit preventive therapies utilization are structural barriers such as cost, availability, and accessibility. These barriers are already known and are considered by program implementers. In addition to these factors, the vaccine community must also consider vaccine hesitancy, an increasingly common phenomenon that impacts both immunization rates and the ability of a vaccine to reach its full potential [<xref rid="B28-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Understanding people&#x02019;s beliefs and opinions about RSV disease prophylaxis could be crucial for addressing the phenomenon of vaccination hesitancy and supporting health authorities to design tailored health policies and/or public health interventions regarding other RSV prophylactic therapies as highlighted in a 2022 systematic review that aimed to identify and understand global predictive factors for COVID-19 vaccination uptake [<xref rid="B29-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p>This paper aims to summarize current evidence concerning knowledge and attitudes regarding RSV prevention, including intention to get vaccinated or uptake (when vaccines were already offered) and healthcare professionals&#x02019; recommendations. It examines these attitudes in terms of beliefs, perceptions, opinions, views, acceptance, interest, and preference.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-vaccines-13-00159"><title>2.

Overall, 16 articles related to palivizumab, either in general [<xref rid="B65-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>,<xref rid="B70-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>,<xref rid="B72-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>,<xref rid="B73-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>,<xref rid="B74-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>,<xref rid="B75-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>,<xref rid="B76-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>,<xref rid="B77-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>,<xref rid="B78-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>,<xref rid="B79-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>] or specifically regarding compliance with it or its administration [<xref rid="B80-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>,<xref rid="B81-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>,<xref rid="B82-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>,<xref rid="B83-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>,<xref rid="B84-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>,<xref rid="B85-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>].</p><p>Among articles about palivizumab, seven focused on HCPs [<xref rid="B70-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>,<xref rid="B72-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>,<xref rid="B73-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>,<xref rid="B74-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>,<xref rid="B75-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>,<xref rid="B76-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>,<xref rid="B77-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. The findings generally highlight low awareness of RSV prophylaxis; for instance, only half of the participants were aware of it in one of the oldest studies [<xref rid="B70-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>], while several knowledge gaps were also found recently [<xref rid="B74-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>,<xref rid="B75-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>,<xref rid="B76-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. Nonetheless, attitudes towards RSV prevention were largely positive, with between 75% and 82% of pediatricians supporting the use of monoclonal antibodies and 92&#x02013;94% being in favor of a potential future vaccine [<xref rid="B71-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>,<xref rid="B75-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>,<xref rid="B76-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>].</p><p>One study found that the information provided by medical practitioners to families regarding palivizumab was inaccurate, failing to correctly describe the effect of palivizumab on the severity of the illness, with it being described as if it reduced the need for ventilation and mortality [<xref rid="B77-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. Similarly, the information provided during counseling was found to drastically affect palivizumab administration in the Netherlands [<xref rid="B79-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. When it was described as recommended, the uptake rate was between 89 and 99%, whereas when it was described as a personal choice (preference-sensitive decision) and the benefits were described using the number needed to treat (NNT), specifying that 20 children need to be treated to prevent one hospitalization, the uptake was only 8%.</p><p>Since the effectiveness of palivizumab is short-term, compliance with the monthly schedule is essential for ensuring immunization. From the HCPs&#x02019; perspective [<xref rid="B80-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>], the most common barriers were caregiver inconvenience, distance to the clinic, cost of prophylaxis, and a lack of understanding of the severity of RSV. As interventions to improve compliance with palivizumab prophylaxis schedules, participants recommended the provision of educational materials about RSV, reminders from the hospital or clinic, and administration of prophylaxis at home to increase compliance. The latter was supported also by parents who participated in a pilot trial about at-home immunization [<xref rid="B81-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. All participants who received the immunization at home would prefer it there, and 70% of those in hospital would prefer to receive it at home. Different interventions to increase compliance were also tested, and a reminder two days early with a request to plan the appointment day was the most effective in increasing compliance (97% vs. 91% in the control group) [<xref rid="B82-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>].</p><p>The studies examining the perspectives of parents or parents to be on immunizing their children against RSV showed that between 26% [<xref rid="B94-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>] and 65% [<xref rid="B92-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>] had not heard of RSV or only know the term (see also <xref rid="app1-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="app">Table S2</xref>), while intention to vaccinate varied from 38% [<xref rid="B88-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>] to 97% [<xref rid="B95-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>]. The only study reporting actual uptake was conducted in France, and the uptake was 92% [<xref rid="B86-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>].</p><p>The main reason for acceptance was the protection of the infant, although perceiving the illness as severe also contributed to acceptance [<xref rid="B65-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>,<xref rid="B87-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>,<xref rid="B90-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>,<xref rid="B91-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>,<xref rid="B92-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>,<xref rid="B93-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>,<xref rid="B95-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>]. The main reason for refusal was concerns about safety and side effects [<xref rid="B65-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>,<xref rid="B91-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>,<xref rid="B92-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>,<xref rid="B93-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>,<xref rid="B95-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec4-vaccines-13-00159"><title>4. Discussion</title><p>Recent progress in RSV prevention strategies has attracted considerable attention and new prevention options are under development [<xref rid="B15-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. As for all immunization programs, the success of RSV prevention strategies depends upon the awareness about them and their acceptance by the (parents/caregivers of the) target population [<xref rid="B96-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>,<xref rid="B97-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>]. This systematic review gathered 61 articles reporting on knowledge and various attitudes, including beliefs, perceptions, preferences, opinions, views, acceptance, intention, and uptake, regarding RSV prevention.</p><p>Compared to the other topics, a relatively small number of articles focused on vaccination for the elderly and adults at risk (n = 10). This is likely due to the relatively recent appreciation of the burden of this disease among adults and seniors [<xref rid="B97-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>,<xref rid="B98-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>,<xref rid="B99-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>,<xref rid="B100-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>,<xref rid="B101-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>,<xref rid="B102-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>]. On the other hand, most articles examined attitudes towards the passive immunization of infants, with roughly half examining attitudes towards vaccination during pregnancy (n = 24, with a subset of 8 studies also examining preferences for maternal versus infant immunization) and the other half focusing on infant immunization (n = 27, of which 16 focused on the short-term monoclonal antibody palivizumab, with a subset of 6 studies assessing adherence to its monthly administration). Approximately one-third of the articles evaluated attitudes among healthcare professionals (n = 19), with half of these focusing on infant immunization.</p><p>A common finding in most articles examining potential recipients of RSV prevention was low awareness about RSV, with a significant proportion of participants either never having heard of it or only knowing the name (see <xref rid="app1-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="app">Table S2</xref>). In contrast, awareness of bronchiolitis was generally more widespread, especially among parents, in line with the literature on patterns of online queries [<xref rid="B103-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>], although this may also depend on the use of the terms that are common in everyday language, for instance, in the news, and may also depend on the language. Despite this limited awareness, attitudes towards RSV prevention were generally often positive, with acceptance rates ranging from 16% to 97% (<xref rid="app1-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="app">Table S2</xref>). The primary reasons for acceptance included the desire for protection against the disease and recognition of its severity, while concerns about safety and potential side effects were the most frequently cited reasons for refusal or hesitancy.</p><p>Specifically, data on the acceptance of RSV vaccination in adults shows generally rather low levels of acceptance, with the proportion of people already vaccinated ranging from 9 to 17% and an additional 8 to 42% intending to get vaccinated [<xref rid="B30-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B32-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B35-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], with the exception of one study showing a 63% uptake in community pharmacies [<xref rid="B38-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] and one hypothetical study on the general population over 18 years of age reporting that 68% would accept vaccination [<xref rid="B39-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. This discrepancy may be due to several factors, including limited vaccine availability during the initial rollout, cautious recommendations from trusted agencies and HCPs, the eligibility of different age groups, and heightened caution regarding the novelty of the vaccine. Moreover, the higher uptake rate in pharmacies suggests that practical issues such as the ease of access may also be relevant. Also, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices has changed the recommendation for RSV vaccination from all people &#x02265;60 years using shared clinical decision-making (June 2023) to all adults aged &#x02265;75 years and adults aged 60&#x02013;74 years who are at increased risk for severe RSV (August 2024) [<xref rid="B104-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>].</p><p>Articles examining attitudes towards RSV prevention in infants generally confirmed a limited awareness of RSV and its prevention, whereas parents were more often aware of bronchiolitis, sometimes through direct experience, as confirmed also by infodemiology data [<xref rid="B103-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>]. Concerns about the severity of RSV infection were quite sparse, with severity being perceived to be lower in samples with older children. Nonetheless, attitudes toward vaccination were generally positive, with moderate to high acceptance of immunization. Interestingly, acceptance was also found to depend on how the benefits were conveyed: using the number needed to treat (e.g., 20 children need to be treated to prevent one hospitalization) and framing the decision as a preference-sensitive decision resulted in lower acceptance of immunization [<xref rid="B79-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. Additionally, HCPs generally showed very positive attitudes, with pediatricians being slightly more favorable toward active rather than passive immunization [<xref rid="B71-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>,<xref rid="B75-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>].</p><p>The findings of articles on maternal vaccination showed that pregnant people and people planning pregnancy were often unfamiliar with RSV but were often accepting of vaccination during pregnancy if it was recommended, although the acceptance rates varied between studies. Worrying about potential risks for the baby in the short and long term was the most frequent reason for refusing or being hesitant about vaccination [<xref rid="B46-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="B48-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="B52-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="B61-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. In line with similar findings about COVID-19 maternal vaccination [<xref rid="B64-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>,<xref rid="B69-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>], some evidence indicates that this hesitation may be transient and, at least partially, rooted in the novelty of the vaccination. Indeed, about 80% of women who refused maternal RSV vaccination distrusted new vaccines, together with the fact that about one-third indicated that they did not have enough time to decide whether to take a maternal RSV vaccine, while about two-thirds responded that they would get vaccinated in a future pregnancy [<xref rid="B54-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>].</p><p>The positivity of attitudes towards prevention was found also in a study using DCE, where a majority of pregnant women (89%) and HCPs (96%) expressed a preference for any prevention over no prevention, regardless of the characteristics of the prevention options considered [<xref rid="B43-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. It is worth noting, however, that this study presented participants with a choice between three options: two preventative strategies and a no-prevention option. In decision-making literature, this could sway preferences in two different ways: if the two prevention options are too similar, the choice could become too difficult, leading people to prefer the no-prevention option (similarity decoy effect). Conversely, if one preventative option is clearly inferior to another (e.g., lower effectiveness and lower duration of protection), the superior option may be preferred over the no-prevention option more frequently when the inferior (decoy) option is present. Considering that several products are being developed to prevent RSV, it is possible that people will be able to choose between different options, which could further increase vaccine acceptance [<xref rid="B105-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>] if the options are not too similar.</p><p>It is worth noticing the great variability in the methodological approaches across studies, with most using ad hoc measures, complicating the comparison and synthesis of findings. For instance, knowledge about RSV was assessed with a variety of questions, with the most commonly used being about whether people were familiar with the term (awareness of RSV), while the other questions were quite diverse, with only some overlap between studies. Even when measures appear similar, they may differ in wording, capturing slightly different aspects of the intended construct, or offer varying response options, further limiting comparability. For example, when assessing vaccination intentions, the &#x02018;unsure&#x02019; option was sometimes presented separately (e.g., on a seven-point Likert scale [<xref rid="B39-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]), sometimes grouped with other responses (e.g.,, &#x0201c;probably will get vaccinated or unsure&#x0201d; [<xref rid="B30-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]), or not present at all (e.g., only yes or no answers [<xref rid="B70-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]). Additional issues emerge when measuring intentions during a vaccine rollout, as behaviors and intentions dynamically change overtime [<xref rid="B30-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Furthermore, few articles referred to established models, with only one study [<xref rid="B46-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] employing the 5C model of vaccine hesitancy (comprising confidence, complacency, constraints, calculation, and collective responsibility) [<xref rid="B68-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>] and another [<xref rid="B56-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] using the Behavioral and Social Drivers of Vaccination framework (BeSD) [<xref rid="B66-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>,<xref rid="B67-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>].</p><p>Another important consideration is that most studies were conducted in high-income countries (see <xref rid="vaccines-13-00159-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>), following the recent introduction of new RSV prevention options. While this limits the generalizability of the findings, it also highlights the importance of addressing global equity and supply. From a public health standpoint, the push for affordable and universal access to RSV vaccines is essential. Ensuring that both adult vaccination and infant immunization are integrated into routine immunization programs can contribute to more comprehensive protection and reduce the burden of RSV-related morbidity. Policies that support equitable distribution and funding models that prioritize affordability can help to achieve broader coverage, particularly in underserved communities where RSV poses significant risks. These efforts align with the broader goal of strengthening healthcare resilience and promoting universal coverage through preventive measures [<xref rid="B96-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>].</p><p>Current studies also highlight the pressing need for greater investment in education, both within healthcare settings and among the general population. Such investments are crucial for building a well-informed public that can make evidence-based decisions and embrace vaccination as a key preventive tool [<xref rid="B106-vaccines-13-00159" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec5-vaccines-13-00159"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>This review of quantitative and qualitative studies highlighted that, despite awareness and knowledge of RSV and its prevention being limited, attitudes towards prevention strategies are generally positive, with moderate to high rates of acceptance. The reasons guiding acceptance or refusal are similar for all RSV prevention strategies, with protection against the disease and the perceived severity of the disease promoting acceptance, while concerns about side effects leading to refusal or some level of hesitancy. As more options are likely to become available, preferences may be further affected by the options available, and it is likely that more options are going to be available and approved in the near future. The evidence suggests that the effectiveness and length of protection will play an important role in shaping preferences. Furthermore, all things being equal, maternal vaccination tends to be more acceptable than infant immunization.</p><p>Moreover, the evidence underscores the importance of addressing the knowledge gap about RSV, its risks, and the benefits and potential side effects of vaccination, both among the public and healthcare professionals. Education about RSV should be guided by decision-making research to ensure clear and effective communication in healthcare settings.</p><p>Given the role of HCPs as trusted sources of information, their knowledge and confidence in discussing RSV prevention are pivotal. Training programs designed to boost familiarity with RSV epidemiology, prevention strategies, and updated clinical trial results could foster more effective patient counseling. Enhanced training covering communication strategies to address vaccine safety concerns and counter misinformation can empower HCPs to engage in meaningful discussions, fostering informed, confident decision-making.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclaimer/Publisher&#x02019;s Note:</bold> The statements, opinions and data contained in all publications are solely those of the individual author(s) and contributor(s) and not of MDPI and/or the editor(s).
