Traditional treatment involves diuretics and vasodilators, but a subset of patients develop resistance due to acute cardiorenal syndrome. Dapagliflozin, categorized as a sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor (SGLT2i), has emerged as a promising therapy for AHF, demonstrating substantial benefits in reducing both mortality and morbidity among patients. The purpose of this meta-analysis and systematic review is to determine dapagliflozin&#x02019;s safety and efficacy in AHF patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">In accordance with PRISMA guidelines, we conducted a systematic search across several databases (PubMed, Science Direct, and Cochrane Library) up to June 2024 to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared dapagliflozin with control treatments in patients with AHF. Key outcomes of interest included In-Hospital Cardiovascular mortality rates, duration of hospitalization, and instances of in-hospital worsening. Data extraction and quality assessment adhered to established protocols and the results were evaluated using Review Manager (RevMan Version 5.4.1) The assessment of bias risk follows the principles established in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">Five RCTs comprising 912 patients met the inclusion criteria. Dapagliflozin significantly reduced In-Hospital Cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.36&#x02013;0.88, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.01, I&#x000b2;=26%) and 30-day hospital readmissions (RR 0.73, CI 0.54&#x02013;0.99, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.05, I&#x000b2;=7%). However, dapagliflozin did not significantly affect the length of hospital stay (MD -0.11, CI -0.73-0.51, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.72, I&#x000b2;=60%) or the incidence of hypotension (RR 0.82, CI 0.36&#x02013;1.84, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.63, I&#x000b2;=0%). A significant weight change was observed (MD 0.93, CI 0.03&#x02013;1.83, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.04, I&#x000b2;=95%), which was resolved upon sensitivity analysis (MD 1.34, CI 1.02&#x02013;1.66, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001, I&#x000b2;=0%). No significant effects were found for worsening renal failure or changes in GFR in this study.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par4">Dapagliflozin appears to be beneficial in reducing In-Hospital Cardiovascular mortality and 30-day hospital readmissions in AHF patients. Although it demonstrates potential, additional research is needed to establish its significance in AHF management. Further investigation with larger sample sizes, different doses, and comprehensive safety and cost-effectiveness is imperative to thoroughly evaluate the safety and clinical efficacy of Dapagliflozin, underscoring the necessity for additional data to substantiate its role in managing patients with AHF.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical trial number</title><p id="Par5">Not applicable.</p></sec><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12872-024-04412-x.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Dapagliflozin</kwd><kwd>Acute heart failure</kwd><kwd>In-hospital cardiovascular mortality</kwd><kwd>SGLT2i</kwd><kwd>Meta analysis</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature 2024</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par6">Acute Heart Failure (AHF) is characterized by abnormal cardiac function, leading insufficient blood flow to meet the metabolic needs of tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. This critical condition carries high morbidity and mortality that requires immediate medical intervention to avoid serious complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Studies indicate a 2-year I mortality rate of 52.8% among AHF patients, underscoring the acute and life-threatening nature of this condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. AHF marks a combination of distressing symptoms such as dyspnea (shortness of breath), orthopnea (difficulty breathing when lying down), lower limb swelling, and clinical manifestations such as increased jugular venous pressure and accumulation of fluid in the lungs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">The cornerstone of treatment in the most common presentations of AHF has been diuretic therapy, often combined with vasodilators. According to current international guidelines, intravenous loop diuretics are recommended as the first-line treatment for AHF. Together, these drugs alleviate congestion and improve the stroke volume to promote better oxygen delivery by dilating both arterial and venous vessels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. However, approximately one-third of the patients cannot achieve decongestion due to the onset of acute cardiorenal syndrome, CRS-1, which denotes a sudden decline in cardiac function accompanied by reduced kidney function and significant resistance to diuretic therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">Dapagliflozin, a sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor (SGLT2i), is a beacon of hope in the treatment of heart failure. It lowers glucose by blocking the SGLT2 protein located in the proximal convoluted tubule (PCT) of the nephron [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. This novel antidiabetic agent is a viable therapeutic option for heart failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Additionally, clinical studies demonstrate a reduction in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, a general reduction in hospital readmission rates, and improved survival prospects for patients with HF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] While underlying studies indicate promising potential, the clinical evidence on the utility of SGLT2 inhibitors in this context is still evolving, and there remains an opportunity to expand the current clinical evidence. In this meta-analysis, we aim to assess the safety and efficacy of dapagliflozin in AHF, aiming to clarify its therapeutic role.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par9">The meta-analysis followed the guidelines specified in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Data sources and search strategy</title><p id="Par10">An exhaustive and thorough search was carried out using various electronic databases, including PubMed, Science Direct, and Cochrane Library.

Two independent reviewers (M.H.S. and A.R.) screened the titles and abstracts, followed by a full-text review to ensure adherence to inclusion criteria. Discrepancies were resolved by a third reviewer (S.R).Studies were included if they fulfilled the following criteria: (i) written in English (ii) reported outcomes of interest, (iii) were randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Ongoing trials, letters, case reports, abstracts, reviews, and extension studies were excluded. Relevant information such as the primary author, year of publication, total number of participants, group-specific patient counts, mean age across groups, and baseline comorbidities were systematically collected using an electronic data extraction form. The primary outcome was In-Hospital Cardiovascular mortality in AHF patients. Secondary outcomes were Length of Hospital Stay in Days, 30 Days Hospital Readmission, Change in Weight from Baseline in kg, Hypotension, Hospital Worsening Heart Failure and Renal Failure, Change in GFR at the End of the Study, mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Risk of bias and quality assessment</title><p id="Par12">We evaluated the risk of bias in the included RCTs using the Risk of Bias 2 tool (RoB 2) as advised by the Cochrane Collaboration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The studies were rigorously evaluated according to their selection bias, blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of outcome assessment, incomplete outcome data, and selective reporting. Low risk of bias, high risk of bias, and unclear risk of bias (lack of information) are the three categories into which the studies were classified. Two authors, independently assessed the titles and abstracts of the articles and conducted a thorough review of the full texts to determine if the studies met the inclusion criteria. Disparities were settled through discussion with a third author, ensuring the objectivity of the process.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="Par13">For the statistical analysis, Review Manager (Rev Man Version 5.4.1) from the Cochrane Collaboration in London, UK, was utilized. Dichotomous outcomes were assessed using relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs), while continuous outcomes were analyzed using mean difference (MD). All results were presented with 95% CIs. A random-effects model was applied to combine outcomes, and statistical heterogeneity was evaluated using Higgins&#x02019;s I&#x000b2; statistic: I&#x000b2; &#x0003c; 50% indicated mild, 50&#x02013;75% moderate, and &#x0003e;&#x02009;75% severe heterogeneity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].

We assessed various primary and secondary outcomes to thoroughly evaluate the drug&#x02019;s efficacy and safety. In-Hospital Cardiovascular mortality was our primary endpoint, while secondary endpoints included hospital stay duration, 30-day readmission rates, changes in weight, incidence of hypotension, and GFR alterations. Our findings reveal dapagliflozin shows promise in reducing In-Hospital Cardiovascular mortality, hospital readmissions, and weight in AHF though some secondary outcomes such as hospital stay duration, hypotension risk did not consistently favor dapagliflozin. Overall, dapagliflozin demonstrated beneficial effects compared to alternative treatments. However, caution is warranted due to study limitations such as small sample sizes and potential biases in the included trials. Despite these limitations, our analysis underscores dapagliflozin&#x02019;s potential in reducing In-Hospital Cardiovascular mortality, heart failure exacerbations, hypotension risks, and hospitalizations, alongside effects on weight and GFR. Notably, our study did not find significant benefits related to renal function based on the available data.</p><p id="Par37">AHF management involves several treatment options, each with distinct benefits and drawbacks. Diuretics are a cornerstone in AHF management, crucial for reducing congestion and alleviating fluid overload symptoms by promoting vasodilation and increasing sodium and water excretion. However, diuretics require close monitoring to mitigate risks associated with electrolyte imbalances, which can lead to hospitalization and increased mortality rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Vasodilators, including ACE inhibitors (ACE-Is) and nitrates, improve hemodynamics and enhance exercise capacity. Yet, ACE-Is can cause profound hypotension and renal complications, while nitrates are associated with tolerance and adverse effects such as headaches and hypotension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Calcium channel blockers [CCBs), despite their anti-arrhythmic benefits and potential to enhance diastolic capacity, are limited by their cardio-depressive effects and restricted usage in heart failure patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In the quest for new therapies to manage AHF effectively, dapagliflozin has emerged as a promising option. As a sodium-glucose co-transporter type 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, dapagliflozin primarily acts on renal receptors to increase glucose excretion, a mechanism widely utilized in the management of type 2 diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. In the context of AHF, dapagliflozin enhances diuresis, optimizes ventricular loading conditions, and reduces preload. Additionally, it influences adipose tissue distribution, decreases arterial stiffness and blood pressure, and promotes cardiac and lipid metabolism through various adipokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p id="Par38">Various studies have explored the impact of dapagliflozin on mortality rates in patients with heart failure. Research consistently indicates that dapagliflozin is linked to a reduced risk of mortality, primarily from cardiovascular causes such as heart failure and sudden cardiac death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Although our study findings are limited to cardiac deaths, dapagliflozin&#x02019;s effect on non-cardiac deaths is also noteworthy. Other studies have revealed that dapagliflozin reduces non-cardiac deaths, including those from malignancy and infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. This mortality benefit extends beyond patients with HF to those with co-existing conditions such as diabetes or chronic kidney disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Consequently, dapagliflozin appears to be effective in reducing both cardiac and non-cardiac deaths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. These results align with our study, which examined the effect of dapagliflozin on In-Hospital Cardiovascular mortality. Additionally, research has shown that dapagliflozin use is associated with shorter hospital stays, particularly when initiated early in the course of treatment. It has also been observed that dapagliflozin reduces the length of hospital stays in individuals with severe heart failure, leading to a decreased need for readmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Our findings were consistent with previous research in this regard [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. However, the impact of dapagliflozin on hospital stay duration in our study did not show a significant reduction (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.72]. In terms of readmissions, dapagliflozin was found to reduce the risk of 30-day readmissions compared to placebo. This benefit was more pronounced in patients with severe heart failure and diabetes, although non-diabetic patients and those with milder disease also experienced advantages from this medication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p><p id="Par39">Dapagliflozin exerts a significant impact on both heart failure (HF) and renal function, influencing multiple physiological pathways. By enhancing ventricular function, dapagliflozin reduces the risk of HF worsening across various patient groups, regardless of diabetes status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Studies have consistently shown lower rates of HF exacerbation and hospitalization among dapagliflozin users, highlighting its role in improving clinical outcomes in HF patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. However, conflicting results have been observed regarding its impact on renal function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Some trials indicate that dapagliflozin reduces the risk of worsening renal function in patients with a GFR below 25&#x000a0;ml/min/1.73&#x000a0;m&#x000b2;, which contrasts with our findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Other studies support the notion that dapagliflozin can slow renal decline, emphasizing its potential for renal protection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Our study also demonstrated dapagliflozin&#x02019;s ability to minimize the incidence of hypotension, corroborated by research on lipoprotein-associated hypotension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Despite concerns about orthostatic hypotension in specific contexts, the overall evidence suggests that dapagliflozin does not significantly increase the risk of hypotension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Heterogeneity in our findings, particularly regarding weight change and GFR endpoints influenced by studies like Zachary et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], underscores the need for adjustments to enhance consistency across diverse populations.</p><p id="Par40">Our meta-analysis did not reveal a significant reduction in hospital stay duration for patients treated with dapagliflozin compared to controls. This outcome aligns with dapagliflozin&#x02019;s known effects on diuresis and volume reduction, which can lead to quicker stabilization of patients with AHF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. The early initiation of dapagliflozin could facilitate faster clinical improvement, thereby reducing hospital stay lengths. Additionally, dapagliflozin significantly reduced the risk of 30-day readmissions, particularly in patients with severe heart failure and diabetes. The reduction in readmission rates is likely due to the sustained hemodynamic and metabolic benefits of dapagliflozin, which include improved ventricular function and reduced fluid overload [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. These effects help prevent acute decompensation post-discharge, a common cause of early readmissions. Moreover, our analysis showed significant weight reduction in patients receiving dapagliflozin. Weight reduction can be attributed to dapagliflozin&#x02019;s diuretic effects, leading to decreased fluid retention, and its impact on glucose and lipid metabolism, contributing to fat loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. This is particularly beneficial in heart failure management as it reduces the workload on the heart.</p><p id="Par41">Dapagliflozin also demonstrated a significant reduction in the incidence of hypotension among its users. Its role in reducing preload and afterload without causing excessive vasodilation likely contributes to its lower risk of hypotension compared to other heart failure medications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. This finding is crucial, as hypotension can limit the use of certain therapies in heart failure patients. However, the effects on GFR were mixed, with no statistically significant changes overall. Dapagliflozin has a complex impact on renal function. Initially, it can cause a mild reduction in GFR due to diuresis and reduced intraglomerular pressure. However, long-term benefits include renal protection through mechanisms such as reduced hyperfiltration and improved glycemic control. The lack of significant GFR change in our meta-analysis could be due to the short follow-up periods in the included studies, which were insufficient to capture long-term renal benefits.</p><p id="Par42">Our study acknowledges several limitations that impact our findings. The small sample size may compromise the robustness and generalizability of our results, while the lack of adequate studies precluded meta-regression analysis, limiting our ability to adjust for confounding variables. Additionally, limited data availability may have restricted our comparisons of various medications, hindering our assessment of their comprehensive effects. We were also unable to evaluate adverse events or cost-effectiveness, both vital in shaping dapagliflozin&#x02019;s clinical profile. Furthermore, the inconsistent reporting of renal safety endpoints, such as worsening renal function (WRF), oligoanuria, and the initiation of renal replacement therapy, restricted our analysis of dapagliflozin&#x02019;s renal impact. Future research should focus on conducting larger studies that consistently report renal safety endpoints and evaluate adverse events and cost-effectiveness. Additionally, it should explore the effects of different dosages of dapagliflozin to provide a comprehensive understanding of its role in AHF management.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par43">Our study underscores the significance of dapagliflozin in the management of AHF. We demonstrated the superior efficacy of dapagliflozin compared to the control group in treating AHF, highlighting its pivotal role in AHF therapy. However, further research is warranted to deepen our understanding of this drug in the context of AHF. Future studies should consider larger sample sizes, explore different dosage regimens, and conduct multiple comparisons to comprehensively evaluate dapagliflozin&#x02019;s therapeutic potential. Additionally, it is essential for upcoming research to include discussions on cost-effectiveness and conduct detailed safety analyses. Furthermore, evaluating the efficacy of various doses of dapagliflozin should be a priority for future investigations. Such research efforts will help solidify the place of dapagliflozin in the therapeutic arsenal against AHF, potentially improving outcomes for a broad spectrum of patients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.</p><p>
