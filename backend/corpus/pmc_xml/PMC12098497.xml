Collaboration network analysis identifies China as the leading contributor to research in this field. Document co-citation analysis highlights several influential studies examining the &#x0201c;double-edged sword&#x0201d; role of autophagy in periodontal disease, illustrating how autophagy alleviates oxidative stress and inflammation in periodontitis by removing damaged organelles, inhibiting pro-inflammatory mediators, and promoting periodontal tissue repair through the secretion of pro-angiogenic cytokines.

The primary etiological factor is dental plaque, which includes both gingivitis and periodontitis. PD involves complex interactions between systemic and local immune responses, with inflammation playing a central role (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>).</p><p>Autophagy is a conserved cellular process that maintains homeostasis by degrading and recycling damaged or unnecessary cellular components (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). As a protective mechanism, it alleviates oxidative stress by removing dysfunctional organelles, particularly mitochondria, and modulates inflammatory responses by inhibiting the release of pro-inflammatory mediators and suppressing inflammasome activation (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Furthermore, autophagy contributes to tissue repair by promoting the secretion of pro-angiogenic cytokines in response to inflammatory conditions. However, under prolonged or excessive stress, dysregulated autophagy may induce apoptosis (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), reflecting a dynamic balance between these two cell death pathways.</p><p>In the context of periodontal disease, autophagy exerts multiple protective effects. It contributes to the clearance of pathogenic microorganisms, such as Porphyromonas gingivalis, alleviates oxidative stress by removing dysfunctional mitochondria and reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS), and modulates inflammatory responses by limiting the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and inhibiting inflammasome activation (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Additionally, autophagy prevents excessive apoptosis and promotes periodontal tissue regeneration by enhancing the survival and differentiation of periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSCs) and stimulating the secretion of pro-angiogenic factors, such as angiopoietin (Ang) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). These mechanisms emphasize autophagy&#x02019;s pivotal role in preserving periodontal health and highlight its potential as a therapeutic target for mitigating tissue destruction and facilitating repair in periodontitis. However, under prolonged or intense stress, dysregulated or excessive autophagy may shift toward apoptosis, highlighting the need to maintain autophagic balance for periodontal homeostasis (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Autophagy is not limited to periodontal health; it is widely involved in various biological processes and is closely associated with inflammatory responses. Dysregulation of autophagy has been associated with a range of diseases, including autoimmune disorders, cancer, diabetes, and oral diseases (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).</p><p>Bibliometrics is a field that applies mathematical and statistical methods to analyze books, articles, and other scholarly publications. Its purpose is to assess and track the quantity and quality of scientific activities, as well as to understand the structure, development, and trends of academic research (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). In recent decades, bibliometrics has been extensively applied in medical research, including studies on PD, cell death, cancer, COVID-19, and metabolic diseases. However, bibliometric studies focusing on autophagy have predominantly concentrated on cancer, while research on the role of autophagy in periodontal diseases remains relatively limited.</p><p>This study aims to conduct a comprehensive bibliometric analysis of the role of autophagy in PD. This study will summarize the knowledge base, research hotspots, and development trends in the field, providing a strong foundation for future research. Elucidating the role of autophagy in PD could significantly influence the diagnosis and treatment of these conditions, thus advancing clinical practice. This will not only assist researchers and experts in gaining a deeper understanding of the relationship between autophagy and periodontal diseases, but also ultimately benefit PD patients by improving treatment outcomes and quality of life.</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>2 Methods</title><sec id="S2.SS1"><title>2.1 Data source and search strategy</title><p>This study utilized the Web of Science Core Collection (WOSCC) database<sup><xref rid="footnote1" ref-type="fn">1</xref></sup> as the data source, which is widely regarded as the premier database for bibliometric analysis (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>).

This analysis not only revealed research hotspots and trends but also offered valuable insights into future research directions. From 2006 to 2023, research on the role of autophagy in PD exhibited significant growth, particularly after 2015 (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). The increase in research volume reflects the academic community&#x02019;s growing attention to the role of autophagy in PD, likely due to the increasing recognition of autophagy&#x02019;s critical function in regulating chronic inflammation.</p><p>Scientific collaboration is defined as the joint effort of researchers to generate new scientific knowledge. Scientific collaboration occurs at various levels, including individual, institutional, and international collaboration. When assessing the importance of nodes in a collaboration network, both social connectivity and academic output are critical, with betweenness centrality (BC) being a key indicator of social connectivity. If a node&#x02019;s BC exceeds 0.10, it indicates that the node is central, relatively important, and highly influential in research (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>).

Notably, China leads in the number of publications, accounting for more than half of the total (54.55%), with a BC greater than 0.10, demonstrating its significant influence in this research area. Brazil achieved the highest BC (0.57) in the national cooperation analysis (<xref rid="TS1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 1</xref>), far surpassing China (0.15), which may be attributed to Brazil&#x02019;s economic development and recent improvements in public health (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>).

There is limited extensive collaboration among authors, who tend to collaborate with familiar colleagues or specific research teams, such as the close collaboration between Sakagami, Hiroshi, Hashimoto, Ken, and Amano, Osamu, among others. To address current limitations in collaboration among authors and institutions and to foster more extensive and deeper partnerships within the field, we propose the following recommendations. First, the regular organization of multidisciplinary workshops and thematic conferences can facilitate cross-disciplinary communication and promote the integration of diverse academic perspectives. Second, international collaboration should be strengthened by encouraging research teams to apply for international funding programs, establish joint laboratories abroad, and actively engage in international academic exchanges. Third, establishing inter-institutional cooperation platforms at regional and national levels is essential for the efficient sharing of data, methodologies, and research resources. Finally, closer collaboration between academia and industry should be fostered by aligning industrial demands with academic expertise, thus accelerating the translation of scientific findings into practical applications. Overall, enhancing international and cross-sector collaboration has the potential to bridge disciplinary gaps, overcome institutional barriers, and create a positive feedback loop that drives the advancement of high-quality scientific research.</p><p>The top 10 co-cited authors were each cited more than 20 times, and seven authors played significant bridging roles (BC &#x0003e; 0.1), indicating their influence as key promoters of knowledge dissemination and interdisciplinary collaboration (<xref rid="TS4" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 4</xref>).

This study includes the five most co-cited papers in the field of &#x0201c;the role of autophagy in PD&#x0201d; (<xref rid="TS6" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 6</xref>). The most cited article is &#x0201c;Increased autophagy is required to protect periodontal ligament stem cells from apoptosis in the inflammatory microenvironment&#x0201d; by An Y et al., published in 2016 in J Clin Periodontol (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). This study utilized immunohistochemistry to detect LC3 expression in periodontal ligament (PDL) tissues from patients with periodontitis (<italic>n</italic> = 20) and healthy controls (<italic>n</italic> = 20). Additionally, to further investigate the mechanism of autophagy, the study conducted cell experiments with PDLSCs divided into three groups: healthy PDLSCs (H-PDLSCs), periodontitis PDLSCs (P-PDLSCs), and inflammation-simulated PDLSCs (I-PDLSCs). Autophagy levels in PDLSCs were measured by qRT-PCR and Western blotting. LC3-positive spots were identified by immunofluorescence, and autophagic vesicles (AVs) were observed using transmission electron microscopy. Results: Elevated levels of autophagy gene expression and autophagosome formation were observed in the PDL tissues of periodontitis patients. Increased protein levels of LC3, Beclin-1, Atg7, and Atg12 were found in P-PDLSCs and I-PDLSCs. LC3-positive spots and AVs were identified in P-PDLSCs and I-PDLSCs. Activation of autophagy may protect PDLSCs from apoptosis. Conclusion: The study suggests that regulating autophagy in P-PDLSCs may offer a novel therapeutic strategy for enhancing periodontal treatment.</p><p>The second article, &#x0201c;The Role of Reactive Oxygen Species and Autophagy in Periodontitis and Their Potential Linkage,&#x0201d; by Liu CC et al., was published in 2017 in Front Physiol (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). This review examines the role of the imbalance between reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antioxidant defenses in the pathogenesis of periodontitis. The main points highlight that ROS and autophagy play crucial roles in periodontitis. Elevated ROS levels induce oxidative stress and periodontal tissue damage, while autophagy regulates cell fate, promoting both cell death and preventing apoptosis. The specific roles of autophagy in periodontitis include bacterial clearance, regulation of immune responses, and inhibition of periodontal cell apoptosis.</p><p>The third article, &#x0201c;Lipopolysaccharide from Porphyromonas gingivalis promotes autophagy of human gingival fibroblasts through the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway,&#x0201d; by Liu J et al., was published in 2018 in Life Sci (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). This study treated human gingival fibroblasts (HGFs) with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Porphyromonas gingivalis (P.g) and observed autophagosome formation and the conversion of microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3)-II using both morphological and quantitative methods to evaluate whether the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway mediates LPS-induced autophagy in HGFs. Main results: Increased autophagy was observed in LPS-treated cells compared to controls, with significantly higher expression of LC3-II and ATG5 mRNA and proteins, as well as more LC3 puncta and autophagosomes observed via immunofluorescence microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. LPS-treated cells exhibited significantly decreased expression of p-PI3K, p-Akt, and mTOR. Experiments with the PI3K activator 740Y-P and the Akt-specific activator SC79 confirmed that inhibition of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway is associated with LPS-induced autophagy. The autophagy inhibitor 3-MA increased LPS-induced secretion of TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-1&#x003b2;. Conclusion: LPS from Porphyromonas gingivalis induces autophagy in HGFs by inhibiting the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway, and autophagy helps suppress the secretion of inflammatory cytokines induced by LPS.</p><p>The fourth article, &#x0201c;Activation of Autophagy in Periodontal Ligament Mesenchymal Stem Cells Promotes Angiogenesis in Periodontitis,&#x0201d; by Wei W et al., was published in 2018 in J Periodontol (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). This study aimed to investigate the ability of PDLSCs to promote angiogenesis within an inflammatory environment and explore the mechanisms underlying abnormal angiogenesis in periodontitis. Healthy PDLSCs (HPDLSCs) and periodontitis PDLSCs (PPDLSCs) were isolated from human periodontal ligament tissues under healthy and inflammatory conditions, respectively, and the expression of autophagy-related proteins and pro-angiogenic cytokines was evaluated by qRT-PCR and Western blot. The angiogenic capacity of endothelial cells was measured using the Matrigel tube formation assay. Autophagy levels in PDLSCs were modulated by rapamycin-induced autophagy and siRNA-mediated inhibition of Beclin-1 expression. Main results: The inflammatory environment increased the expression of autophagy-related and pro-angiogenic factors. Rapamycin-induced autophagy enhanced the angiogenic capacity. Inhibition of autophagy diminished angiogenic capacity. Conclusion: Autophagy promotes angiogenesis in periodontitis by modulating the paracrine function of PDLSCs. Inflammation-related autophagy functions as a switch to modulate the pro-angiogenic potential of PDLSCs, unveiling a new mechanism of abnormal angiogenesis in periodontitis and offering new insights for potential therapeutic strategies.</p><p>The fifth article, &#x0201c;Autophagy and its implication in human oral diseases,&#x0201d; by Tan YQ et al., was published in 2017 in Autophagy (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). This study provides a summary of the mechanisms and types of autophagy and their roles in human oral diseases. Key findings: Autophagy is categorized into macroautophagy, microautophagy, and chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA), each differing in the method of delivery of cytoplasmic components to lysosomes and their physiological functions. Macroautophagy (commonly referred to as autophagy) is the most extensively studied type, involving the formation of double-membrane autophagosomes that encapsulate cellular components for lysosomal degradation. Autophagy plays a &#x0201c;double-edged sword&#x0201d; role in oral cancer, inhibiting tumorigenesis while also promoting tumor growth, with potential applications in anti-cancer therapy for oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Autophagy plays a critical role in tooth development and the pathogenesis of periapical lesions, initially protecting cell survival and later promoting cell death. In periodontal disease, autophagy regulates inflammation and immune responses by modulating cell death and inhibiting apoptosis in infected cells. Autophagy is essential for Candida albicans infection survival and pathogenicity, aiding bacterial adaptation and survival through vacuole-mediated autophagy. Conclusion: Autophagy plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of oral diseases, exerting protective effects while also having the potential for pathological progression under specific conditions. Future research should focus on exploring the interactions between autophagy, apoptosis, immune responses, and other cellular processes to identify new therapeutic targets and strategies.</p><p>These five articles clearly demonstrate that autophagy not only functions as an &#x0201c;inflammation regulator,&#x0201d; controlling the extent of inflammation, but also protects cells from apoptosis. However, excessive inflammation can induce autophagy, thereby promoting cell death. Therefore, early intervention in periodontal inflammation and exploration of how to harness the protective functions of autophagy to manage periodontal disease may constitute promising future research directions.</p></sec><sec id="S4.SS3"><title>4.3 Research hotspots between autophagy and PD</title><p>Keywords provide insight into research hotspots and trends within a specific field.

Additionally, burst keyword analysis examines the temporal distribution of keywords to identify emerging trends and frontier areas within a discipline, with particular emphasis on those experiencing rapid growth. &#x0201c;Epithelial cells&#x0201d; exhibited the highest burst intensity, while &#x0201c;mechanical stress&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;orthodontic tooth movement&#x0201d; have emerged as the most recent burst keywords since 2020. Based on the previous discussion, the current research hotspots in this field can be summarized as follows.</p><sec id="S4.SS3.SSS1"><title>4.3.1 Alveolar bone remodeling</title><p>Autophagy plays a crucial role in alveolar bone remodeling. PDLSCs exhibit significant potential in periodontal tissue repair, and their osteogenic differentiation is essential for the formation of new alveolar bone (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Recent studies have shown that in human periodontal ligament fibroblasts, upregulation of alkaline phosphatase activity, formation of mineralized nodules, and increased expression of osteogenic-related genes correlate with enhanced autophagic activity (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Blockade of autophagy inhibits osteogenic differentiation. This suggests that autophagy may impact periodontal tissue regeneration by influencing the osteogenic differentiation of PDLSCs (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Some studies suggest that gold nanoparticles can enhance osteogenic differentiation of PDLSCs by stimulating autophagic activity (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4.SS3.SSS2"><title>4.3.2 Epithelial cells</title><p>Epithelial cells have garnered increasing attention in the field of autophagy and periodontal disease due to their pivotal role in maintaining mucosal barrier integrity and modulating immune responses (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). As primary defenders against pathogens like Porphyromonas gingivalis, epithelial cells utilize autophagy to preserve tight junctions and regulate inflammation. However, Porphyromonas gingivalis can disrupt this defense by inhibiting the ATG5&#x02013;LC3 pathway, increasing barrier permeability and promoting systemic inflammation via the oral&#x02013;gut (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Autophagy acts as a double-edged sword: while it clears pathogens and maintains homeostasis, it may also be hijacked by pathogens for survival (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). These findings raise key questions: How do pathogens specifically manipulate autophagy? What are the temporal dynamics between autophagy and other death pathways like apoptosis and pyroptosis? How do epithelial cells across tissues differ in their autophagic responses? Can therapeutic modulation of autophagy restore barrier function and reduce inflammation? Addressing these questions will deepen our understanding of the pathogen&#x02013;autophagy&#x02013;immune network and support the development of precision therapies targeting epithelial cells in periodontal and systemic diseases.</p></sec><sec id="S4.SS3.SSS3"><title>4.3.3 Orthodontic tooth movement</title><p>In recent years, the growing number of adult orthodontic patients and increased awareness of periodontal health have significantly heightened research interest at the intersection of autophagy, orthodontics, and periodontitis. Orthodontic force-induced oxidative stress has been shown to activate autophagy, which plays a dual role in regulating inflammation, bone remodeling, and tissue homeostasis (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Mechanical force applied during orthodontic tooth movement induces a biological response in periodontal tissues, activating autophagy, particularly on the pressure side. Studies have shown that the expression of autophagy-related proteins, such as Beclin-1 and LC3-II, significantly increases in the early stages of OTM, indicating the initiation of the autophagic process (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Autophagy plays a pivotal role in regulating the inflammatory response. During OTM, periodontal ligament cells subjected to mechanical forces undergo local inflammation and enhanced autophagy. Research indicates that autophagy regulates the inflammatory response, assisting cells in coping with mechanical stress and nutrient deprivation. During OTM, autophagy influences bone remodeling by modulating osteoclast activity. The aggregation of osteoclasts on the pressure side correlates with autophagy activation (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Studies have shown that excessive autophagy can impair osteoclast recruitment, thereby limiting bone resorption and tooth movement. Additionally, autophagy-activating drugs such as rapamycin can reduce osteoclast numbers, further validating the regulatory role of autophagy in bone remodeling (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). This intricate interplay has given rise to several critical research questions, including how mechanical stress modulates autophagy through signaling pathways such as AMPK/mTOR, the specific role of autophagy in osteoblast function and inflammatory responses, and its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target in personalized orthodontic treatment. Future research should focus on the spatiotemporal regulation of autophagy, the integration of multiple signaling pathways, and the development of translational strategies to enhance clinical precision and therapeutic efficacy in orthodontic care.</p></sec><sec id="S4.SS3.SSS4"><title>4.3.4 Periodontal treatment</title><p>The treatment of periodontal disease is essential for maintaining oral health and preventing tooth loss. Early diagnosis and effective interventions not only help prevent tooth extraction but also substantially improve overall health (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Traditional periodontal treatments, including scaling and root planning (SRP) and periodontal surgery, aim to remove plaque and calculus from the tooth surface to reduce inflammation and infection, thereby controlling disease progression. However, these methods may cause discomfort in some cases and are often limited in their efficacy for treating advanced periodontal destruction, such as bone loss (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). With advancements in technology, an increasing number of innovative treatments are being incorporated into periodontal disease therapy.</p><p>Laser therapy and ultrasonic treatments are two innovations that have gained widespread use in recent years. Laser therapy utilizes precise high-energy laser beams to remove damaged tissue and promote wound healing, providing effective anti-inflammatory benefits with minimal tissue damage (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Ultrasonic treatment uses high-frequency vibrations to efficiently remove calculus and plaque, minimizing impact on soft tissues and reducing patient discomfort during traditional scaling procedures. These emerging techniques not only enhance treatment efficiency and reduce patient discomfort but also improve overall treatment outcomes (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>).</p><p>As research progresses, accumulating evidence underscores the innovative potential of autophagy as a therapeutic intervention in periodontal disease management. Autophagy, a natural cellular repair mechanism, plays a pivotal role in clearing damaged organelles and pathogens, thereby maintaining cellular homeostasis (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). In the context of periodontal disease treatment, modulating autophagy pathways can effectively enhance tissue regeneration, mitigate inflammation, and strengthen immune defenses (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). Autophagy regulation holds promise for optimizing periodontal tissue repair and improving the effectiveness of current therapeutic approaches, particularly in tissue regeneration and bone remodeling. Therefore, integrating autophagy modulation into periodontal disease treatment strategies could open the door to novel therapeutic options in this field.</p><p>In conclusion, autophagy plays a &#x0201c;double-edged sword&#x0201d; role in periodontal disease (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Autophagy maintains cellular homeostasis by clearing damaged organelles and proteins while protecting cells from damage by regulating apoptosis and inflammation. In pathological conditions such as periodontitis, the regulatory mechanisms of autophagy play a crucial role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and protecting tissues from damage. However, when the stimulation is excessive or prolonged, autophagy can trigger apoptosis, leading to tissue destruction. These findings offer new perspectives on understanding the role of autophagy in periodontal disease and present potential targets for developing new therapeutic strategies against periodontitis.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>TABLE 1</label><caption><p>Dual roles of autophagy in periodontitis.</p></caption><table frame="box" rules="all" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5"><thead><tr><td valign="top" align="left" style="color:#ffffff;background-color: #7f8080;" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mechanism/process</td><td valign="top" align="left" style="color:#ffffff;background-color: #7f8080;" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Protective effects</td><td valign="top" align="left" style="color:#ffffff;background-color: #7f8080;" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Harmful effects</td><td valign="top" align="left" style="color:#ffffff;background-color: #7f8080;" rowspan="1" colspan="1">References</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Pathogen clearance</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Autophagy promotes the clearance of periodontal pathogens, such as Porphyromonas gingivalis, thereby mitigating infection and inflammation.</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Impaired or insufficient autophagic response can hinder pathogen clearance, thereby elevating the risk of infection.</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">(<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Inflammatory regulation</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Regulated autophagy modulates cytokine secretion and immune responses, thereby contributing to the maintenance of a balanced inflammatory state and the protection of periodontal tissues.</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Dysregulated or excessive autophagy may contribute to chronic inflammation, leading to subsequent tissue damage.</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">(<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Cell survival and tissue regeneration</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Autophagy promotes the differentiation and survival of periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSCs), supporting tissue regeneration.</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Overactivation of autophagy can impair stem cell function and cause apoptosis, hindering tissue regeneration.</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">(<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Promotion of bone tissue repair</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Autophagy modulates osteogenic differentiation and mineralization, contributing to alveolar bone regeneration and mitigating bone loss in periodontitis.</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Overactivation of autophagy in osteoclasts may promote bone resorption and disrupt bone homeostasis, exacerbating alveolar bone loss.</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">(<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Influence on host immune function</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Proper autophagy supports immune cell function, aiding in the clearance of pathogens and maintaining periodontal tissue integrity.</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Dysregulated autophagy can impair immune surveillance, reducing pathogen clearance and facilitating disease progression.</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">(<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mitochondrial homeostasis</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mitophagy helps maintain mitochondrial function in periodontal cells, promoting cell survival and preventing oxidative stress.</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Defective mitophagy can lead to mitochondrial dysfunction, increasing oxidative stress and contributing to tissue damage.</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">(<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>)</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></sec></sec><sec id="S4.SS4"><title>4.4 Future perspective</title><p>Recent advancements have significantly improved our understanding of the dynamic regulatory mechanisms of autophagy in periodontal disease. Autophagy plays a vital role in periodontal protection by eliminating pathogens, degrading inflammasomes, and maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis, thereby alleviating oxidative stress and inflammation (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). However, excessive autophagy activation can result in lysosomal dysfunction, exacerbate oxidative stress responses, and promote osteoclast-mediated bone resorption. Critical molecular regulators, including the PINK1-Parkin pathway (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>), RAB7A-mediated autophagosome maturation, and USP4 deubiquitinating modification (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>), have emerged as essential targets for modulating the &#x0201c;double-edged sword&#x0201d; effects of autophagy. Regarding innovative therapies, exosomes derived from mesenchymal stem cells have shown potential in promoting periodontal regeneration through the delivery of regulatory molecules (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). Furthermore, interdisciplinary research has uncovered molecular links between systemic diseases, such as diabetes and oral cancer (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>), and disruptions in periodontal autophagy, offering new perspectives for developing future precision therapies.</p><p>Looking ahead, several research areas are critical for fully harnessing the potential of autophagy in periodontal disease regulation:</p><p>Therapeutic Regulation: There is an urgent need to develop novel small-molecule drugs, gene-editing technologies, and localized delivery systems capable of precisely controlling autophagic activity. Such approaches could not only prevent pathogens from exploiting autophagy for immune evasion but also enhance cellular repair and tissue regeneration.</p><p>Diagnostic Methods: Future research should focus on developing bioassays and imaging techniques that are based on autophagy-related biomarkers. These methods could facilitate the early detection of periodontal tissue damage and changes in autophagic status, thereby providing a foundation for personalized therapeutic interventions.</p><p>Tissue Regeneration: Autophagy plays a critical role in tissue repair and regeneration in periodontal disease (PD). By enhancing autophagic processes in periodontal ligament stem cells and osteoblasts, bone regeneration and tissue healing could be accelerated. Biomaterials that activate autophagy, along with gene therapies targeting autophagic pathways, have significant potential for regenerating damaged periodontal tissues. The integration of stem cell therapies with advanced biomaterials, coupled with autophagy modulation, could establish innovative regenerative platforms, significantly advancing tissue repair and functional recovery in periodontal bone and soft tissues.</p><p>However, insufficient investment in interdisciplinary integration, clinical translation, and large-scale data analysis may hinder rapid progress in this field. Enhanced funding and resource allocation, along with deeper integration of basic and clinical research, are essential for elucidating the precise mechanisms by which autophagy regulates periodontal disease and promoting its widespread clinical application, ultimately accelerating the translation from mechanistic insights to precision medicine.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S5"><title>5 Strengths and limitations</title><sec id="S5.SS1"><title>5.1 Strengths</title><p>In recent years, there has been a significant increase in the volume of publications concerning periodontal disease (PD) and autophagy. In this context, this study provides a comprehensive bibliometric analysis of the relationship between autophagy and periodontal disease, synthesizing the existing body of knowledge using English-language publications indexed in the Web of Science. Specifically, it identifies 20 key terms with substantial citation bursts, thereby illuminating critical research trends and emerging hotspots within the field. Additionally, by offering a clear overview of influential authors, journals, and key research trajectories, this study provides valuable insights into the current state of research. A notable strength of this analysis is the inclusion of a &#x0201c;Future Perspective&#x0201d; section, which examines the potential applications of autophagy in therapeutic modulation, diagnostics, and tissue regeneration for the management of periodontal disease. Furthermore, the use of rigorous bibliometric tools ensures the reliability and reproducibility of the findings, while the study&#x02019;s clinical relevance bridges the gap between academic research and practical applications. This underscores the translational potential of autophagy in PD treatment and regenerative medicine.</p></sec><sec id="S5.SS2"><title>5.2 Limitations</title><p>In line with other bibliometric analyses, this study also has several limitations: (1) CiteSpace cannot fully replace systematic searches; (2) The study primarily focused on English-language publications, which may have excluded valuable research published in other languages. Future studies could incorporate non-English publications to offer a more comprehensive global perspective; (3) This study was confined to publications from 2006 to 2023, which may have led to the exclusion of significant research. Future studies could expand the review to include publications prior to 2006, offering a more comprehensive understanding of the evolution of autophagy-related research in periodontal disease. (4) Data were obtained from the WoSCC database, which is commonly used in scientometric analyses. However, the analysis could have been further enhanced by incorporating additional databases. Future studies should broaden the search to encompass a wider range of literature; (5) A limitation of citation-based analysis is its tendency to underrepresent recent high-impact studies due to citation time lags. Recently published high-quality studies may be excluded due to insufficient citation counts, which can affect the identification of research hotspots and emerging trends. Additionally, articles with significant contributions may not have accumulated sufficient citations to fully reflect their impact. Future studies should track citation trends over time to better understand the long-term impact of recent publications.</p><p>Despite these limitations, we believe this study effectively captures the hotspots and emerging trends in the role of autophagy in PD. Based on this study, future researchers can gain a comprehensive understanding of the current research landscape and select research directions based on the identified hotspots and emerging trends.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="S6"><title>6 Conclusion</title><p>In recent years, the role of autophagy in periodontal diseases (PD) has attracted significant attention, as demonstrated by the increasing number of related publications.
