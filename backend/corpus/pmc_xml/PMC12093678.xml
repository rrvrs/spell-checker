Computational methods, such as SoupX&#x000a0;(Young (Gigascience 9:giaa151, 2020)), have been used to solve this problem but it may remove biologically relevant data. This study presents a clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9-based method that selectively removes non-variable RNAs. We applied this approach to scRNA-seq data from human intestinal tissues of 17 patients. By targeting non-variable genes, including ribosomal and mitochondrial RNAs, CRISPR-Cas9 treatment effectively reduced their expression, outperforming computational methods in both the number and extent of gene removal. The CRISPR-Cas9 treated samples, sequenced at half the depth compared to untreated samples, maintained comparable sequencing quality, and saturation, demonstrating that this approach can reduce sequencing costs while preserving data quality. Cell type composition and gene expression patterns remained consistent between treated and original datasets, with no unintended gene deletions. Overall, our findings suggest that the CRISPR-Cas9-based method offers a cost-effective solution for improving scRNA-seq data quality, particularly for tissues with high levels of non-variable RNAs, without compromising biological integrity.

The recommended sequencing parameters from 10X Genomics are shown in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. According to these guidelines, the minimum sequencing depth is 20,000 read pairs/cell with 200 sequencing cycles. For a typical input of 20,000 cells (a commonly used sample size) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], the total data size would be approximately 80 GB. The sequencing depth will be more higher according to sample trait and size. So the size of scRNA-seq data is basically huge, it makes high cost burden.

In scRNA-seq data, we often encounter issues related to non-variable RNAs. Their high expression levels make it difficult to detect lower-abundance genes, as they consume a substantial portion of the limited sequencing capacity. Scientifically, these RNAs interfere with data interpretation and even introduce distortions. For example, they can disrupt network or interaction analyses and cause the expression levels of other genes to be underestimated. Various computational method (in silico) are developed to solve this problem. One of the widely used method is SoupX which removes RNAs with high contamination fraction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. However, its performance is limited and carries the risk of removing biologically relevant data.</p><p id="Par4">CRISPR-Cas9, a gene-editing technology known for its high specificity, is widely used in biological research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Notably, in scRNA-seq, CRISPR-Cas9 technology can remove the targeted genes before PCR amplification, preventing these genes from being amplified. This ensures their successful exclusion from sequencing data. This approach is particularly advantageous for studies involving intestinal tissues, which contain high levels of enzyme such as DNase and RNase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], leading to extensive RNA degradation. During experiment, RNA fragments generated by enzymatic degradation often enter single-cell droplets, increasing background noise in intestinal scRNA-seq data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Although in silico methods are commonly applied to intestinal dataset, they can be inefficient and risk removing unintended data.</p><p id="Par5">Previous studies have individually reported the gene removal efficiency of CRISPR-Cas9 and computational methods. However, a direct comparison between the two methods and a detailed analysis of their respective characteristics have not yet been conducted. This study aims to fill this gap. Furthermore, previous reports on CRISPR-Cas9 system used in our study did not examine off-target effects or conduct more comprehensive downstream analyses. In this study, we extended the evaluation to global gene expression to determine whether CRISPR-Cas9 selectively removes target genes without compromising the integrity of the original data.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Cohort and sample collection</title><p id="Par6">A total of 17 patients were diagnosed with IBD at Seoul National University Hospital were included in this study.

This can interfere with the analysis process, particularly when using DEG-based tools. Such issue may arise due to ambient RNAs caused by a high RNase environment or the inherently high endogenous expression of these genes. To address this problem, computational methods are typically applied to mitigate the impact of these non-variable RNAs on the data. We sought to investigate whether the CRISPR-Cas9-based method offers advantages over computational methods.</p><p id="Par15">To assess the performance of CRISPR-Cas9 based method, we compared RNA expression levels of targeted non-variable RNAs such as ribosomal genes, mitochondrial genes across three datasets: the original (untreated) data, computationally processed data, and CRISPR-Cas9-treated samples (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B, Supplementary Fig. S1). The original intestinal data exhibited high expression of almost ribosomal genes. Computationally processed data (SoupX) showed a general reduction in the expression of these genes. Although it could reduce expression levels in highly expressing cells, it was unable to eliminate them completely. In contrast, the CRISPR-Cas9 method almost entirely removed these genes. This difference is attributed CRISPR-Cas9 physically targeting cDNA, whereas computational method relies solely on theoretical calculations. Similar results were observed in mitochondrial genes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B). Violin plots provide a comprehensive view of this result (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>C). Next, we analyzed which genes were deleted by each method. Venn diagram illustrates that the CRISPR-Cas9 method effectively removed a broader range of non-variable genes (77 genes), whereas the computational method eliminated only 19 genes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>D). While computational method can remove mitochondrial genes, but it was less effective in ribosomal genes. Additionally, the CRISPR-Cas9 method eliminated other non-variable genes that were not addressed by computational methods such as <italic>EEF1A1 </italic>and<italic> MALAT1</italic>. This result demonstrated that CRISPR-Cas9 effectively eliminated non-variable genes better than computational method, and this approach maybe useful in circumstances when these genes impede the findings. To confirm that non-variable genes were evenly expressed across samples, we calculated non-variable gene score. UMAP visualizations illustrated this score across each cell types (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>E). In the original data, non-variable RNAs were distributed quite evenly across all cell types. However, after CRISPR-Cas9 treatment, the non-variable gene score was decreased.</p><p id="Par16">It was important to confirm that sequencing quality of both groups (original and CRISPR-Cas9 treated) was comparable. By eliminating non-variable RNAs, the CRISPR-Cas9 method reduced the total transcripts, allowing us to achieve similar data quality at lower sequencing depths. In this study, the original data were sequenced at 50,000 reads per cell, while the CRISPR-Cas9 data were sequenced at half that depth (25,000 reads per cell). Despite half of the sequencing depth, the CRISPR-Cas9 samples showed consistent sequencing saturation, median genes per cell, and recovered cell number (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>F, Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). This result indicate that the CRISPR-Cas9 method can produce high quality data at half the sequencing cost.

We annotated eight major cell clusters based on well- established marker genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], including plasma cells, epithelial cells, T cells, B cells, mesenchymal cells, myeloid cells, endothelial cells, and neural cells. The two groups integrated well, showing no batch effects (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A, Supplementary Fig. 2&#x02009;A&#x02013;B). To compare cell type frequencies between the original and CRISPR-Cas9 treated data, we analyzed the distribution of each cell type (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B, Supplementary Table S3). There were no significant differences in any of the cell types. Since Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B presents mean values, it may appear as there is a difference in cell frequency for plasma cells and epithelial cells. However, further examination of individual GEMs showed that there were no statistically significant differences in cell frequency (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B,Supplementary Fig. S2 C). The observed variation in GEMs following CRISPR-Cas9 treatment may be due to quality control steps, such as doublet removal, which could have led to an unequal loss of cells between groups. Next, we sought to further demonstrate that CRISPR-Cas9 does not alter the data trends, even at the subpopulation level. In the original data, T/NK cells exhibited high levels of non-variable gene expression and represented the third largest cell population (Figs. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>E and <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B, C). So, we focused on T/NK cell and identified twelve T/NK cell subpopulations in both groups (original =&#x02009;27,949 cells, CRISPR-Cas9 =&#x02009;27,394 cells) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>D, E). UMAP plots confirmed that the T/NK cell subpopulations integrated well (Supplementary Fig. S2D), and there were no significant differences in the T/NK cell subtype frequencies (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>F, Supplementary Table S4). We focused on T/NK cells, because plasma cells exhibited high heterogeneity, lacked a well-established subpopulation classification, and epithelial cells showed lower non-variable gene expression compared to T/NK cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>C). When we examined epithelial cell data, their frequencies also remained consistent across the original and CRISPR-Cas9-treated data (Supplementary Fig. S3 A&#x02013;C, Supplementary Table S4). These results indicate that the CRISPR-Cas9 based method does not affect the integrity of scRNA-seq data, even after the removal of non-variable RNAs. And the CRISPR-Cas9 data retained biological information consistent with the original data.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p><bold>A</bold> UMAP visualization displaying 342,795 human intestinal cells from two groups (original and CRISPR-Cas9-treated), clustered into eight major cell types (left).

Although there were no significant differences in cell frequencies, the possibility remained that gene expression patterns of other genes could alter due to the change of non-variable genes. Additionally, we were concerned that CRISPR-Cas9 might mistakenly remove unintended genes which were not listed in guide RNA.</p><p id="Par19">To investigate this, we first compared the expression of all genes between the CRISPR-Cas9-treated and original data. The results indicated that have quite different expression between two groups. Among 32,056 genes, 101 genes were downregulated (log2 fold change &#x0003c; &#x02212; 1) in the CRISPR-Cas9 treated data (Supplementary Table S5). Most of these genes were non-variable genes included in the guide RNA list, primarily ribosomal genes and mitochondrial genes, which is consistent with our result in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. A heatmap showed genes that downregulated in CRISPR-Cas9 treated data (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A). Expression levels in about 100 genes are decreased and most of genes are mitochondrial genes or ribosomal genes. Next, we investigated whether the same issue occurred within the subpopulation levels. Technically, the smallest nonzero <italic>p</italic>-value in R version 4.4 is 2.225074e &#x02212;&#x02009;308, and if the <italic>p</italic>-value falls below this threshold, it is displayed as 0. In our data, CRISPR-Cas9 almost entirely removed ribosomal genes and mitochondrial genes, leading to <italic>p</italic>-value of these genes being displayed as 0. This numerical limitation indicated complete removal but made it challenging to visualize the data. So, we randomly downsampled the dataset to retain biological information while increase <italic>p</italic>-value to manageable levels for R [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Volcano plots illustrated upregulated/downregulated genes in the original data compared to the CRISPR-Cas9 data within the T/NK cell subpopulation (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B, Supplementary Fig. S4 A). Colored genes represent those with <italic>p</italic>-value &#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05 and a log&#x02082; fold change &#x0003e;&#x02009;1 or &#x0003c; &#x02212; 1, and genes highlighted in blue represent ribosomal or mitochondrial genes. Across all of T/NK cell subpopulations, no unintended gene deletions were detected. These findings demonstrate that the CRISPR-Cas9 method can effectively remove targeted genes without unintended data loss.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p><bold>A</bold> Heatmap displaying downregulated genes in the CRISPR-Cas9 dataset.

We conducted a pathway analysis using GO database (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>C). Each T/NK cell subpopulation of two groups (Original data and CRISPR-Cas9 treated data) inferred the same GO pathways. Since the inferred pathways remained consistent, we can carefully conclude that the CRISPR-Cas9 treated data remain consistent in gene expression analysis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par21">In some organs, high expression of RNase and DNase activity pose significant challenges in scRNA-seq experiments. These enzymes cause cell death during the isolation or GEM generation process, leading to an abundance of ambient RNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. This ambient RNA inserts single-cell droplets, making it appear as if some cells inherently express certain RNAs. This problem is not neglectable, because it can result in misleading data, such as an overrepresentation of doublets or the appearance that the most cells uniformly express certain genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In intestinal scRNA-seq data, mitochondrial and ribosomal genes are often highly expressed. This overexpression can interfere with cell clustering and distort gene expression patterns. Therefore, for some organs prone to high ambient RNA contamination, alternative approaches are necessary, even if they come with some data loss. SoupX is commonly used to mitigate ambient RNA contamination by computationally identifying and removing genes inferred as ambient RNA. However, its specificity and efficiency are limited. However, based on our data, whether ribosomal and mitochondrial genes are increased due to ambient RNA from RNase activity or due to their inherently high endogenous expression, CRISPR-Cas9 provides a useful alternative for handling such data. In some studies, samples with high ribosomal and mitochondrial gene expression have been excluded to enhance analytical accuracy. However, the application of CRISPR-Cas9 allows for the retention of more data while minimizing bias.</p><p id="Par22">In this study, from 352 genes (include in guide RNAs list), only 100 genes were successfully removed (Supplementary Fig. S4B). This indicates CRISPR-Cas9 we used (Jumpcode, DepleteX) had an efficiency of less than 30% compared to manufacturer data. The remaining 250 genes were either poorly removed or unaffected. This is likely due to the limitation in eliminating genes with naturally high expression or potential inefficiencies of guide RNA. However, mitochondrial and ribosomal genes were effectively removed, which was our primary objective, as these genes contribute to problems in intestinal tissue data analysis. Additionally, we expected that removing non-variable genes might reveal novel genes that were previously undetected in the original data because of their low expression levels. However, no such genes were identified in our dataset. A minor advantage was observed. Cell clusters that formed due to the high expression of mitochondrial and ribosomal genes disappeared. However, this was not a big deal, as these clusters were already part of other distinguishable clusters. Thus, we did not observe the expected improvements in cell clustering. From another perspective, if significant differences had emerged after CRISPR-Cas9 treatment, it would have been difficult to determine whether the whole results were reproducible in the original data. This may raise an confuse. However, fortunately, the CRISPR-Cas9-treated data remained consistent with the original results. This suggests that CRISPR-Cas9-treated data can serve as a alternative when the original dataset is noisy due to excessive non-variable gene expression or poor sample conditions.</p><p id="Par23">In the field of scRNA-seq, small datasets or studies with limited cohort sizes often face challenges related to data reliability. As experiment scale and data size continue to grow, the sequencing burden also increases. From this perspective, our findings demonstrate that high-quality scRNA-seq data can be obtained at half the sequencing depth using the CRISPR-Cas9-based method. This means that high-quality data can be generated at half the cost, which is particularly beneficial for large-scale studies or datasets with high cell input Our data, which show comparable sequencing saturation and quality values, support this conclusion. Furthermore, this cost-efficient approach could be applied to other areas, such as bulk RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics, including technologies like 10X Visium (10X Genomics).</p><p id="Par24">This study also has some limitations. The selected non-variable genes were assumed to have minor effects on data interpretation. As their name suggests, &#x0201c;non-variable genes&#x0201d; are ubiquitously expressed and are typically excluded from DEG based analyses. Moreover, these genes are generally not expected to play significant functional roles. However, in specific experimental contexts, their expression may offer valuable insights. And some databases or machine learning model may utilize data from these genes. Therefore, CRISPR-Cas9-based gene deletion should be selectively applied depending on the objectives of the experiment.</p><p id="Par25">In Supplementary Figure S4, some NK/T cell subpopulations, such as ILC3 and CD8AA T cells, exhibited numerous downregulated genes beyond ribosomal and mitochondrial genes. We hypothesize that this phenomenon may result from the small number of cells in these populations, leading to potential statistical overestimation of certain genes.</p><p id="Par26">Also, while computational methods often exhibit limited performance in removing ribosomal genes, they offer the advantage of eliminating other ambient RNAs within the data. By contrast, CRISPR-Cas9 can only target and remove genes that are specifically selected using guide RNA. It is important to note that we do not claim that the performance of SoupX in intestinal scRNA-seq data is inadequate; rather, we compare their efficacy specifically in the context of certain genes.</p><p id="Par27">In conclusion, CRISPR-Cas9-based non-variable gene deletion can be particularly useful when studying organs with high expression of non-variable genes or when working with large datasets. However, this approach may not be suitable for datasets where these genes provide valuable information. In future studies, we will compare our data with results from other CRISPR-Cas9 methods using different guide RNAs. This comparison will help determine whether the observed trends are consistent across various CRISPR-Cas9-based methods.</p><p id="Par28">The cohort data are provided in Supplementary Table S6.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>
