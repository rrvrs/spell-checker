Although a diverse array of therapeutic approaches are currently available, all possess limitations, including suboptimal efficacy and the potential for severe adverse reactions. Chronic pain management is challenged by the trade-off between safety and efficacy. Analgesic drugs that provide significant pain relief can carry a higher risk of adverse reactions than safer, less effective options like glucosamine-chondroitin joint supplements (<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). This therapeutic dilemma is complicated by differing risk perceptions between veterinarians and caregivers. Veterinarians, due to their medical training, may be more comfortable with the risks associated with prescription analgesics, whereas caregivers may be more hesitant, sometimes declining or limiting their use even when deemed necessary by the veterinarian (<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). This disconnect is underscored by a 2018 study revealing that 22% of dogs for whom analgesics were recommended by their veterinarians did not receive them (<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>).</p><p>Development of new therapies offering enhanced safety and efficacy can help bridge the gap between veterinary recommendations and caregiver acceptance. Bedinvetmab (Librela&#x02122;), a monoclonal antibody (mAb) targeting nerve growth factor (NGF), represents a significant advancement in canine osteoarthritis (OA) pain management. Following its approval by the European Commission in November 2020, it became the first mAb authorized for this indication. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted U.S. marketing authorization 2.5&#x0202f;years later, and the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority subsequently registered the same drug as Beransa&#x02122;.</p><p>While these regulatory approvals underscored worldwide confidence in veterinary mAbs, their human equivalent were associated with substantial safety concerns. Specifically, NGF modulates bone and cartilage turnover (<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), and its inhibition is linked to accelerated joint degeneration in humans (<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). This was evidenced in 2012, when clinical trials of anti-NGF mAbs (aNGFmAbs) revealed rapidly progressive osteoarthritis (RPOA) (<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), leading the FDA to impose a two-year clinical trial hold and mandate a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) post-hold. However, even with stringent screening, low dosing, and NSAID prohibition after the REMS was implemented, RPOA risk persisted (<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9&#x02013;11</xref>). While the exact mechanism is still under investigation, human clinical trials did not support the hypothesis that RPOA is caused by overuse of weight-bearing joints (<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).</p><p>Post-marketing pharmacovigilance is crucial for continuously monitoring a drug&#x02019;s safety and efficacy after it enters the market, as clinical trials cannot capture the full spectrum of potential adverse reactions. It involves a combination of voluntary reporting of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) by healthcare professionals and the public, and proactive surveillance programs, including government-funded, industry-sponsored, and independent research. Their findings inform regulatory decisions, which can range from label updates and limited use restrictions to, in rare cases, market withdrawal if the risks outweigh the benefits (<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>).</p><p>When an animal exhibits unexpected clinical signs following drug administration, differentiating these effects from the underlying disease or a new unrelated condition can be complex. Nevertheless, prompt identification of potential causal relationships is paramount for ensuring patient safety. The thalidomide tragedy exemplifies the critical importance of rigorous pre-clinical and post-marketing drug safety surveillance. Insufficient testing and a lack of robust post-marketing surveillance systems failed to identify the teratogenic potential of thalidomide (<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). This resulted in widespread use of the drug leading to severe birth defects in thousands of children, highlighting the potentially devastating consequences of delayed recognition of drug-related adverse events.</p><p>In December 2024, the FDA issued an open letter to veterinarians, alerting them to neurological and musculoskeletal safety signals identified during their post-marketing surveillance of Librela (<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). The FDA&#x02019;s Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) employed an algorithmic approach to evaluate ADRs. Their approach, incorporating disproportionality analysis, statistically assessed the frequency of reported adverse events (AEs) in dogs receiving Librela compared to those treated with other OA medications. The FDA&#x02019;s analysis identified 18 distinct safety signals in dogs administered Librela, encompassing neurological events, urinary problems, and musculoskeletal disorders (<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Notably, the FDA observed a disproportionately elevated reporting rate of &#x0201c;lameness&#x0201d; in dogs receiving Librela. In response, the Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) advised veterinarians to proactively inform pet owners about these potential adverse reactions (<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>).</p><p>The CVM emphasized that their objective was to generate hypotheses, acknowledging the inherent limitations of establishing definitive causality (<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). They noted that AE reporting systems are subject to various biases, including underreporting, reporting biases influenced by [social] media attention, and confounding factors such as concomitant medications. Furthermore, the CVM&#x02019;s reliance on algorithmic analyses of secondary data, without the benefit of expert clinical interpretation, introduces additional diagnostic uncertainty (<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). To address this limitation, we employed a two-pronged approach. Firstly, we conducted a specialist-led disproportionality analysis of musculoskeletal adverse event reports (MSAERs) to expand upon the CVM&#x02019;s work. This analysis tested the null hypothesis that Librela&#x02019;s MSAER rate would not exceed that of six comparator drugs with the same indication by more than 50%. Secondly, we report the findings from a subset of dogs whose AE data were subjected to independent adjudication by an expert panel and subsequently submitted to the European Medicines Agency (EMA).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec9"><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec10"><label>2.1</label><title>MSAER disproportionality analysis</title><p>A detailed description of the EudraVigilance database (EVD) analysis is provided in <xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Video 1</xref>. Briefly, accurate identification of clinically relevant musculoskeletal adverse events (MSAEs) required a thorough understanding of the pharmacovigilance system&#x02019;s information flow (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>), and the limitations inherent in the system. Specifically, diagnostic terms submitted by primary reporters are only published if they are listed in the Veterinary Dictionary for Drug Regulatory Activities (VeDDRA). Otherwise, the Marketing Authorization Holder (MAH; Zoetis, Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium) selects a diagnostic term from a predefined list including clinical signs (e.g., lameness), non-specific diagnoses (e.g., arthritis), and specific diagnoses (e.g., ligament rupture) (<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). At the time of analysis, VeDDRA contained 113 musculoskeletal and 313 neurological AE diagnoses (i.e., low-level terms, LLTs) (<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Many LLTs exhibit clinically relevant overlap (<xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). For example, &#x0201c;limb weakness&#x0201d; (a musculoskeletal LLT) may indicate a neurological problem, while &#x0201c;collapse of leg&#x0201d; (a neurological LLT) might describe an orthopedic AE. With over 35,000 possible combinations of musculoskeletal and neurological LLTs, a simple algorithmic approach was not considered feasible.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>This diagram is adapted from the European Medicines Agency&#x02019;s pharmacovigilance data flow chart (<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Although the Agency encourages reporting via the attending veterinarian (shown in the upper half of the diagram), an Adverse Event Report (AER) may be initiated by anyone directly involved with the event.

Subsequently, over an 11-month period, multiple clinicians who subscribed to the forum contacted Author 1 to share concerns regarding serious MSAEs in dogs treated with Librela. Based on these communications, an independent working group was formed comprising clinicians with firsthand experience with MSAEs (see below). The primary objective was to investigate a potential association between Librela administration and the observed pathology. Given the lack of prior records of RPOA in dogs, the working group sought advice from an expert in human neuro-osteoarthropathy (Author 2) and two EBVS<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Specialists in Diagnostic Imaging with published expertise in musculoskeletal imaging (Authors 3 and 4).</p><p>Twenty-three suspected musculoskeletal adverse events (MSAEs) were independently reviewed by nine investigators with a combined 128&#x0202f;years of experience in referral practice (Authors 1, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 14, 15, 16). Clinical data from each case, including signalment, clinical signs, Librela dosing information, concurrent medications, treatment outcomes, and relevant diagnostic test results (radiographs, CT scans, synovial fluid analysis, histopathology), were evaluated. Four cases were excluded from further analysis due to incomplete data or insufficient evidence to support a causal relationship.

Ligament/tendon injuries, polyarthritis, fractures, musculoskeletal neoplasia, and septic arthritis were reported nine times more frequently in Librela-treated dogs. Worryingly, since its European release, Librela has accumulated 20 times more reports than the highest-ranking comparator drug (Rimadyl) and three times more than <italic>all</italic> comparator drugs combined over a 20-year period. Furthermore, independent expert review of a subset of cases strongly supported a causal association between Librela and accelerated joint destruction.</p><p>Librela experienced rapid market penetration following its 2021 European release. Zoetis recently reported global distribution exceeding 21 million doses, translating to an estimated average daily distribution of over 15,000 doses (<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). This initial market success has been tempered by emerging concerns regarding bedinvetmab&#x02019;s safety. These concerns have been amplified by various factors, including the FDA&#x02019;s safety update (<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), negative press coverage (<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), the European Commission&#x02019;s investigation into potential anticompetitive conduct by Zoetis (<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>), and the emergence of online communities disseminating safety concerns. This confluence of events has fostered a climate of apprehension and confusion. Addressing these concerns requires unbiased and rigorous post-marketing pharmacovigilance to evaluate this drug&#x02019;s true risk&#x02013;benefit profile.</p><p>Assessing the &#x0201c;expectedness&#x0201d; of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) is fundamental to effective pharmacovigilance. In causal relationship investigations, statisticians use Bayesian principles to evaluate reaction likelihood, considering plausibility and prior knowledge (<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). The FDA&#x02019;s ABON (Algorithm for Bayesian Onset of symptoms) links drug exposure to adverse events AEs (<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). For example, when applied to NSAIDs, ABON incorporates prior knowledge of prostaglandin inhibition, its effect on gastrointestinal (GI) mucosal integrity, and the established link between NSAIDs and GI ulceration (<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Notably, NSAIDs can cause subclinical GI damage, undetectable without endoscopy (<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). When clinical signs occur, vomiting and diarrhea are common manifestations (<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). However, the FDA does not use sales-figure-based prevalence estimates, because they can dramatically underrepresent true incidence (<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). For example, comparing carprofen&#x02019;s AERs to drug sales suggests vomiting and diarrhea occur in &#x0003c;1/10,000 doses, falsely implying that common side-effects are &#x0201c;very rare&#x0201d; (<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>).</p><p>The NSAID analogy is valuable for three reasons. First, while prostaglandins safeguard gastrointestinal integrity, NGF plays a similar pivotal role in bone and cartilage repair (<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Second, serious subclinical cartilage and bone degeneration often precede clinical signs (<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Third, recent claims of bedinvetmab&#x02019;s &#x0201c;rare&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;very rare&#x0201d; AEs (<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>) are based on similar methodology to the carprofen analysis described above. Given NGF&#x02019;s diverse roles and prior evidence of RPOA, subchondral bone fractures, and atraumatic joint luxations in humans and animals (<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30&#x02013;33</xref>), bedinvetmab-associated MSAEs are an <italic>expected</italic> consequence of NGF inhibition.</p><p>Bayesian analysis, while powerful, can be susceptible to subjective biases. This is exemplified by the FDA&#x02019;s role in the opioid crisis. Despite acknowledging the inherent risk of opioid addiction, the agency over-relied on a five-sentence letter, disproportionately cited as evidence of low addiction rates with oral opioid therapy (<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). The FDA&#x02019;s subsequent mischaracterization of addiction risk as &#x0201c;minimal&#x0201d; was heavily criticized (<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Similarly, the hypothesis that RPOA is a uniquely human problem has faced significant criticism. Multiple experts have contested this claim (<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>), citing weak supporting data (<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). Notably, the joint safety claims outlined in Librela&#x02019;s datasheet (<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>) are based on radiographic assessment of five healthy beagles who received the recommended dose (<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). This study reported &#x0201c;mild&#x0201d; cartilage erosion in two dogs, despite erosion being, by definition, a severe form of cartilage pathology. Furthermore, despite being invited to provide annotated images to clarify this discrepancy (<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>), Zoetis declined to do so (<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>).</p><p>Janssen (fulranumab), Pfizer (tanezumab), and Regeneron (fasinumab) self-reported accelerated joint degeneration in their pre-marketing human aNGFmab clinical trials (<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). The FDA responded quickly and decisively, voting 21&#x02013;0 to recognize RPOA as a side-effect of aNGFmAbs and mandating a sophisticated risk mitigation strategy for all subsequent trials (<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). The scale of the precautions undertaken by these pharmaceutical companies is exemplified by Pfizer&#x02019;s tanezumab program, which involved 18,000 patients and 50,000 radiographs analyzed by 250 experts (<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>).</p><p>When viewed in context, bedinvetmab&#x02019;s limited pre-marketing clinical trials raise serious concerns. Only 89 dogs received more than three doses (<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>), and crucially, no radiographic screening for accelerated joint degeneration was conducted (<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). Unlike Janssen, Pfizer, and Regeneron, Zoetis was unable to self-report accelerated joint destruction due to the absence of radiographic investigations. Consequently, we must rely on post-marketing surveillance to determine whether companion animals experience the adverse joint pathology observed in humans and laboratory animals treated with aNGFmAbs.</p><p>We initially intended to publish only the 19 adjudicated cases as a case series. However, we recognized the potential for case examples of severe pathology to be dismissed as outliers&#x02014;isolated events swamped by the widespread positive experiences reported with bedinvetmab. Given Librela&#x02019;s popularity, this perspective would be understandable. However, this response would be analogous to assessing the risk of NSAID-induced gastrointestinal harm by comparing the incidence of perforating gastric ulcers with NSAID sales figures. It should be obvious that such an approach neglects the critical fact that NSAIDs can induce subclinical harm which is undetectable without inconvenient tests such as endoscopy. Crucially, unlike the gastrointestinal mucosa, which possesses significant regenerative capacity, cartilage damage, once incurred, is largely irreversible (<xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). This fundamental difference underscores the gravity of MSAEs associated with aNGFmAbs.</p><p>To complement the FDA&#x02019;s Bayesian analyses, which collected data from May 2023 to March 2024, we employed a descriptive evaluation to 20&#x0202f;years of MSAER data. This approach was deemed complementary because the ABON algorithm primarily focuses on identifying ADRs occurring shortly after medication initiation, while MSAEs often exhibit a long latency period between drug administration and AE detection. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that most reactions in the FDA&#x02019;s analysis occurred within the first week post-injection, whereas most human RPOA (<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>) and 13/19 cases in our study manifested at least 6 months after treatment initiation.</p><p>A limitation of our descriptive analysis is the inherent subjectivity associated with expert judgment. To mitigate potential bias, the adjudication panel primarily comprised veterinarians with a shared interest in advancing pain management for companion animals. Importantly, none had financial ties to veterinary pharmaceutical companies. Having mitigated bias, and recognizing the inherent subjectivity in data analysis and interpretation, we prioritized <italic>data presentation</italic> to facilitate independent judgment by readers, regardless of their level of expertise. Another acknowledged limitation of our study pertains to the FDA&#x02019;s guidance that AE signal detection should primarily serve as a <italic>hypothesis-generating tool</italic>. Accordingly, our exploratory study was designed to identify potential safety signals rather than provide a comprehensive safety profile. As such, it cannot address specific questions like the impact of NSAID co-administration on MSAER risk. However, we believe these findings offer valuable insights and will stimulate further investigation.</p><p>Our study highlights an important weakness in the current pharmacovigilance system: the lack of comprehensive terminology for accurately capturing serious AEs. The absence of RPOA as a diagnostic term in VeDDRA is of particular concern, potentially leading to a substantial underestimation of MSAERs. Without a specific term, these events may be misclassified as manifestations of the underlying condition being treated (e.g., &#x0201c;arthritis&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;lameness&#x0201d;), obscuring the true incidence and severity of ADRs. To address this deficiency and enhance data quality, we formally requested the addition of the term &#x0201c;RPOA&#x0201d; to VeDDRA (<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Our proposed definition, &#x0201c;joint pathology falling well outside the natural history of OA,&#x0201d; leverages the expertise and clinical judgment of reporting veterinarians with direct access to patient data.</p><p>An FDA panelist involved in the adjudication of humanized aNGFmAbs eloquently summarised our current belief: &#x0201c;All parties agree that the use of aNGFmabs is effective, but they are associated with a unique, rapidly progressing form of OA&#x02026;and we can only speculate as to its causes (<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).&#x0201d; In animals, just as in humans, the goal of effective pain management is paramount. However, we must also ensure that our therapeutic interventions do not inadvertently exacerbate the underlying condition. To uphold the highest standard of care for companion animals, we hope to apply the same rigorous scrutiny to veterinary mAbs as was employed in human healthcare.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="sec20"><title>Data availability statement</title><p>The original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/<xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary material</xref>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="author-contributions" id="sec21"><title>Author contributions</title><p>MF: Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Writing &#x02013; original draft, Writing &#x02013; review &#x00026; editing.
