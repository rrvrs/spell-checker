In contrast to multiple sclerosis (MS), relapses are the key contributor of disability. Identifying prognostic factors in relapse recovery is therefore important for disability prediction in AQP4-NMOSD and MOGAD. Modifiable factors such as vascular risk factors (VRFs) and smoking are globally prevalent and may impact clinical outcomes in these disorders.</p><p>VRFs, including smoking, have been associated with increased disability and reduced quality of life in MS.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-13524585251325069" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="bibr2-13524585251325069" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr3-13524585251325069" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Smokers have been shown to have poor recovery from relapses in AQP4-NMOSD<sup>

<xref rid="bibr4-13524585251325069" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
</sup> The study however was underpowered to distinguish the different effects in &#x02018;current smokers&#x02019; versus &#x02018;past smokers&#x02019;. In a study with a combined cohort of MOGAD and AQP4-NMOSD patients, smokers were also more likely to show lesion persistence on MRI after an acute attack which was correlated with poor clinical recovery.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr5-13524585251325069" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
</sup> However, again the numbers were small and so the effects in the individual diseases could not be assessed. Our study included a much larger number of patients and was able to show that &#x02018;current&#x02019; smokers had a poorer recovery from onset attack compared to &#x02018;never&#x02019; smokers in both AQP4-NMOSD and MOGAD. It is noteworthy that past smokers did not appear to be at greater risk of poor recovery, highlighting the benefit of smoking cessation strategies. Although current smokers with AQP4-NMOSD had a higher risk of poor visual recovery, we were not able to detect a significant effect of smoking on visual outcomes in our AQP4-NMOSD cohort. This may be due to underpowering, as fewer AQP4-NMOSD patients had ON compared to the MOGAD cohort.</p><p>Limited studies of VRF have identified hypertension, diabetes and hyperlipidemia as prevalent comorbidities in AQP4-NMOSD.<sup><xref rid="bibr6-13524585251325069" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="bibr7-13524585251325069" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Cai et al.<sup>

We have not identified studies examining the impact of VRF on the MOGAD cohort or on visual disability outcomes in either AQP4-NMOSD or MOGAD. One study found higher BMI was significantly associated with a diagnosis of MOGAD in first episode of acute ON compared to AQP4-NMOSD or MS although the predictive value of BMI in MOGAD ON outcomes was not explored.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr18-13524585251325069" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>
</sup></p><p>Even though a higher proportion of current smokers and VRF cohort had poor recovery from onset attack and first ON attack in both disease groups, the VRF cohort did not reach statistical significance in MOGAD nor did current smoking status for visual recovery in AQP4-NMOSD. There could be various explanations for this. First, there is potential underpowering of the current study, especially within the AQP4-NMOSD cohort, as very few patients with ON were smokers and the visual recovery generally for all patients is poor. Repeating the study with larger numbers may reveal the effects of smoking and VRFs to be significant in clinical and visual outcomes in both diseases. In addition, MOGAD patients were younger and thus it is possible that &#x02018;age-related&#x02019; VRF effects<sup>
<xref rid="bibr19-13524585251325069" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>
</sup> may not have been present for long enough to show an effect. Smoking however usually commences in the teens and as current smokers, rather than a past smoking history appears to be the major risk factor, the smoking effect appears to be more immediate and potentially reversible. Finally, these disorders have distinctive underlying disease mechanisms. AQP4-NMOSD is a primary astrocytopathy, where antibodies target AQP4 at end feet of astrocytes present on central nervous system capillary vessels,<sup>
<xref rid="bibr20-13524585251325069" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>
</sup> whereas in MOGAD, antibodies target the myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) which is uniquely expressed on myelin and oligodendrocytes.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr21-13524585251325069" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>
</sup> In addition, AQP4 is expressed in retinal M&#x000fc;ller cells and astrocytes, which are located in the retinal nerve fibre layer<sup>
<xref rid="bibr22-13524585251325069" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>
</sup> while the retina is typically unmyelinated, and therefore would be devoid of MOG. These distinctive features may contribute to different interactions with smoking and VRF effects.</p><p>The harmful effects of smoking and VRF are attributed to diverse pathophysiology. Smoking-related damage to the vascular and central nervous system is attributed to the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, gas-related (nitrous oxide, carbon monoxide, cyanide) and hypoxic damage<sup>
<xref rid="bibr23-13524585251325069" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>
</sup> and complement activation.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr24-13524585251325069" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>
</sup> This might explain the difference in the effect of &#x02018;current&#x02019; versus &#x02018;past&#x02019; smoking. Although inflammatory damage is present in vascular comorbidities, the associated vasculopathy in these conditions is a result of a complex interplay of various metabolic and pro-inflammatory factors such as atherosclerosis, endothelial dysfunction, structural remodelling and advanced glycation end products from hyperglycemia.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr25-13524585251325069" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>
</sup> Thus, there may be different pathological processes between smoking and VRF which contribute differently to clinical outcomes. The lack of association noted in our study between smoking status and VRF is interesting and may reflect the distinct characteristics that drive smoking initiation in youth, or that patients with VRF are advised against smoking more than those without.</p><p>We did not find any significant associations between smoking and VRF on OCT parameters. However, OCT is an extremely sensitive clinical tool in AQP4-NMOSD and MOGAD ON<sup><xref rid="bibr26-13524585251325069" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="bibr27-13524585251325069" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> and thus it may not be a good tool to detect subtle difference between sub-groups. As visual impairment after ON in AQP4-NMOSD is common, abnormalities across all sub-groups are not unexpected, whereas although MOGAD patients experience better visual recovery, the OCT is particularly sensitive in this disease showing abnormalities even when the VA outcomes are good.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr28-13524585251325069" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>
</sup></p><p>We acknowledge limitations within this study. Despite the overall large cohort, &#x02018;current&#x02019; smokers were small in numbers (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 32 MOGAD and <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 21 AQP4-NMOSD). Although there was no clear difference in the baseline features between the included and excluded cohorts, we are unable to rule out undetectable selection bias. Unknown confounders that might influence the results are also a limitation that we could not adjust for. We did not have detailed information on smoking such as duration of smoking and number of packs/per year and the length of time patients have ceased smoking in the past smoking group. However, it would be difficult to account for all these variables. In addition, we were not powered to distinguish between the sub-types or severities of each VRF. However, these are rare diseases and despite the relatively small cohort, we were still able to demonstrate higher proportions of poor outcomes in smokers and those with VRFs even if statistical significance was not achieved for some analyses. Categorical classification of risk factors may overlook effects at higher severity levels, potentially missing important associations. However, this does not negate the positive associations that have been observed.</p><p>This is the first study to systematically examine the impact of smoking and VRF on clinical outcomes in a large cohort of AQP4-NMOSD and MOGAD patients separately and to study visual outcomes with prospectively collected data. This study supports a detrimental effect of smoking on a large cohort of MOGAD and AQP4-NMOSD patients and VRF effects in AQP4-NMOSD, with an additional focus on visual recovery outcomes. These findings suggest that active management of VRFs and smoking cessation may be important for optimising patient outcomes in MOGAD and AQP4-NMOSD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="section20-13524585251325069" specific-use="figshare"><title>Supplemental Material</title><supplementary-material id="suppl1-13524585251325069" position="float" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>sj-docx-1-msj-10.1177_13524585251325069 &#x02013; Supplemental material for Smoking status and vascular risk factors as predictors of disability in AQP4-NMOSD and MOGAD</title></caption><media xlink:href="sj-docx-1-msj-10.1177_13524585251325069.docx"/><p>Supplemental material, sj-docx-1-msj-10.1177_13524585251325069 for Smoking status and vascular risk factors as predictors of disability in AQP4-NMOSD and MOGAD by Fiona Chan, David Berhanu, Sara Samadzadeh, Anna Francis, Nasrin Asgari, Friedemann Paul, M Isabel Leite, Ruth Geraldes and Jacqueline Palace in Multiple Sclerosis Journal</p></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="con"><p><bold>Author Contributions:</bold> The authors confirm contribution to the paper as follows:</p><p>JP: Study conception and design; Analysis and interpretation of results; Draft manuscript preparation.</p><p>FC: Study conception and design; Data collection; Analysis and interpretation of results; Draft manuscript preparation.</p><p>DB: Analysis and interpretation of results; Draft manuscript preparation.</p><p>SS: Analysis and interpretation of results; Draft manuscript preparation.</p><p>AF: Draft manuscript preparation.</p><p>NA: Draft manuscript preparation.</p><p>FP: Draft manuscript preparation.</p><p>MIL: Draft manuscript preparation.</p><p>RG: Draft manuscript preparation.</p><p>All authors reviewed the results and approved the final version of the manuscript.</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>The author(s) declared the following potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: FC has received a European Treatment in Multiple Sclerosis Clinical Fellowship (ECTRIMS) award of which this work was completed during the clinical fellowship.
