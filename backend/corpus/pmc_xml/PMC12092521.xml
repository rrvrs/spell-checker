The current paper investigates whether functional facts&#x000a0;(information about what an object is used for) are remembered more efficiently compared with nonfunctional facts. Experiment 1 presented participants with images of functionally ambiguous objects associated with a (made-up) name and a (made-up) fact that could relate either to the object&#x02019;s function or to something nonfunctional. Results show that recall of object names did not depend on whether they were associated with a functional or nonfunctional fact, while recall of the functional facts was significantly better than the nonfunctional facts. The second experiment replicated this main effect and further found that functional facts are remembered more efficiently after they have been associated with confirmatory (as opposed to disconfirmatory) feedback. It is suggested that semantic information is not unitary, and that one way of categorising semantic information is in terms of its adaptive relevance. Potential mechanisms are proposed and discussed, along with suggestions for future research.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Functional memory</kwd><kwd>Semantic memory</kwd><kwd>Adaptive memory</kwd><kwd>Cultural memory; Mnemonics</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Psychonomic Society, Inc. 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Humans are not the only tool-using species (see, e.g., Seed &#x00026; Byrne, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2010</xref>), but the extent of our tool use and the complex nature of how we use and manipulate objects to meet our needs puts us far beyond any other creature. This has attracted interest from cognitive scientists, who endeavour to explain how these capacities can be explained at a neurocognitive level (e.g., Vaesen, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2012</xref>). A cognitive capacity that humans seem to particularly excel at is being able to think about the <italic>functions</italic> of objects. Humans are exceptionally good at conceptualising an object as being &#x0201c;for&#x0201d; a particular purpose, to the extent that, once we have established in our minds what the function of an object is, we often have difficulty thinking of it in any other way, as evidenced by the well-known phenomena of &#x0201c;functional fixedness&#x0201d; (Duncker, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">1945</xref>). Indeed, studies have shown that being informed just once about an object&#x02019;s function is sufficient to hinder any deviation from this conceptualisation (Defeyter &#x00026; German, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2003</xref>). Information about function, it seems, is cognitively potent, and many theorists have suggested the existence of a conceptual system that is dedicated to the organisation and storage of functional information (Vaesen, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2012</xref>).</p><p id="Par3">The link between thinking about function and memory has not received a great deal of attention beyond a small number of studies. Schacter and Cooper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">1993</xref>) had participants think about possible functions of novel objects, finding that subsequent recognition memory was improved compared with when the objects were encoded in relation to structural information (e.g., whether the objects were facing left or right). More recently, functional encoding has been proposed as a potential proximate mechanism to explain the so-called survival processing effect (see Bell et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2015</xref>; Kroneisen et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2021</xref>; Wilson, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2016</xref>), a mnemonic phenomenon in which recall is enhanced when stimulus items are processed with reference to a grasslands survival schema (Nairne et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2007</xref>).</p><p id="Par4">The current paper&#x02019;s focus is on functional knowledge itself, and whether this kind of information is prioritised by mnemonic systems. There is a growing literature on how (and why) mnemonic systems prioritise information. For example, investigating whether &#x0201c;valued&#x0201d; stimuli are prioritised in memory, Murphy and Knowlton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2022</xref>) assigned arbitrary scores to stimulus items, finding an asymmetry in recall that depended on whether participants&#x02019; goals were framed in terms of gains (e.g., &#x0201c;do your best to maximise your score&#x0201d;) rather than losses (e.g., &#x0201c;do your best to minimise your losses&#x0201d;; see Knowlton &#x00026; Castel, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2021</xref>, for a review of value-based learning). Additionally, a broad range of studies have established a family of &#x0201c;self-reference&#x0201d; effects that make certain things more memorable when they are attached to our self-concept in some way (see Klein, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2012</xref>, for a review). Other research has attempted to investigate the nature of mnemonic priorities by deriving predictions from evolutionary theory. For example, Kroneisen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2018</xref>) found that information about another individual&#x02019;s past behaviour (and how relevant it is to you) can influence how memory operates in relation to that person, a finding that supports the idea that memory systems in species that engage in frequent reciprocal cooperative interactions will be sensitive to cues relating to the trustworthiness of potential exchange partners.</p><p id="Par5">The current approach is derived from the functionalist agenda in memory research (Nairne &#x00026; Pandeirada, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2010</xref>). As Wilson et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2011</xref>) point out, not all stimuli in the world are equal in terms of their fitness relevance, and so we might expect that certain forms of information are privileged in terms of how they are processed. Why might we expect information about the function of objects to have fitness relevance and be prioritised in memory? Learning and storing information relating to object function is hugely important from a socio-cultural standpoint. Being able to think about the function of objects is central to most human cultures. Human life is based around using a vast array of objects, and individuals are required to learn an enormous number of functional facts over a lifetime. This kind of learning is arguably a fundamental feature of human life and could be considered as being of acute importance given that survival in cultural groups depends upon an individual becoming familiar with the tools that exist in the shared environment. Failure to efficiently learn about the functions of the artefacts in one&#x02019;s cultural environment would put an individual at a severe disadvantage. To the extent that humans can be said to have a &#x0201c;capacity&#x0201d; for culture, this capacity must in part consist in cognitive skills that allow for the efficient detection, encoding and retrieval of information relating to the function of objects. Having an internal &#x0201c;database&#x0201d; of functional information also allows individuals to effectively communicate with each other about useful artefacts, facilitating the &#x0201c;ratcheting&#x0201d; effect that drives cultural evolution by allowing innovations to be built upon existing knowledge (Tennie et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2009</xref>). Being able to efficiently process, store, and recall information about function is arguably more important than performing identical cognitive tasks on other (nonfunctional) object-related information. Functional facts have more adaptive value than other kinds of facts, including (arguably) what an object is called. This line of reasoning suggests that learning about the functions of objects should be particularly privileged in a way that learning about other object-related facts may not be. It might further be argued that information about function should also be more sensitive to feedback compared with other forms of semantic information. This is because the adaptive consequences of being wrong about functional information are greater than the consequences of being wrong about any other form of semantic information that could be attached to objects (e.g., names).</p><p id="Par6">The current studies aim to investigate the link between functional information and memory. Given the socio-cultural importance of learning functional information and the adaptive benefits that prioritising such information might have, the expectation is that this form of semantic information will be prioritised mnemonically in comparison with semantic information that is not functional in nature.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Experiment 1</title><p id="Par7">The first study presented participants with functionally ambiguous objects, along with a made-up name and a piece of information that could either be about the function of the object (a &#x0201c;functional-fact&#x0201d;) or about something nonfunctional.</p><p id="Par8">Predictions were as follows:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par9">There will be significantly elevated recall for &#x0201c;functional facts&#x0201d; about the objects compared with &#x0201c;nonfunctional facts&#x0201d;, and</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par10">there will be no significant difference in the recall rates for the names of the objects associated with &#x0201c;functional facts&#x0201d; compared with &#x0201c;nonfunctional facts&#x0201d; (because the names of objects convey no information about function).</p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par11">Institutional ethical approval was granted for both Experiment 1 and 2, which were conducted in accordance with all ethical standards as set out by the British Psychological Association.</p><p id="Par12">Sample size was set at 50 as a sensitivity analysis revealed that it was possible to detect an effect of <italic>d</italic><sub>z</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.42 for the comparison between functional and nonfunctional facts with a statistical power of 0.90 in a one-tailed test.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Method</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Participants and design</title><p id="Par13">Participants were undergraduate students participating for course credit. Fifty participants took part (mean age&#x02009;=&#x02009;22.6&#x000a0;years, 21 men, 29 women) in a repeated-measures study in which recall of the name and the information associated with functionally ambiguous objects was measured across two conditions: functional information and nonfunctional information.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Materials</title><p id="Par14">Forty-five images of functionally ambiguous/unusual objects were collected from various websites and internet message boards that specialise in such objects. The sourcing of the images began with searches on various image search engines for &#x0201c;unusual&#x0201d; &#x0201c;unknown&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;ambiguous&#x0201d; objects. This yielded some usable images and also provided links to online locations where such objects are posted and discussed.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn1">1</xref> These locations were also searched for suitable images until enough had been found. For an image to be considered for inclusion it had to depict an object on its own (i.e., the image could not depict an object in human hands or alongside other objects). Objects selected were all an appropriate size to be held in the hands and manipulated/used. Suitable objects were those for which the function was not obvious or was ambiguous. Some objects resembled known objects but did not obviously perform the same function as the object they resembled. For example, Object 4 resembled a pair of scissors in that it had handles with looped slots through which a thumb and fingers could be placed. However, rather than cutting blades, the two extensions contained hemispherical cups that formed a full sphere when the &#x0201c;blades&#x0201d; were brought fully together (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Images were edited to be approximately the same size when presented in the centre of the screen. Although images varied in resolutions, no image was included that did not depict the object in a way that its potential functions could be adequately discerned.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Illustrations of two objects and accompanying facts.

Similar images can be found online and anyone replicating this work is encouraged to use independently sourced images.</p><p id="Par16">Names associated with each image were two syllable nonsense words that did not obviously resemble any known names for objects or tools (e.g., Loftog; see the Appendix Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> for a list of the names used). Functional and nonfunctional information for each object was created by the experimenter and were not intentionally related to the actual function of the objects (which were unknown anyway). Four facts were created for each object, two functional and two nonfunctional. Each &#x0201c;fact&#x0201d; had to be conceivable when associated with the object (i.e., participants had to view the provided functional information as something that would be possible given the object that it was associated with&#x02014;e.g., a functional fact that was associated with a hook-like object was &#x0201c;this object was used to weigh bales of hay&#x0201d; and not &#x0201c;this object is used to measure angles in buildings&#x0201d;, which would not be conceivable given the features of the hook-like object).</p><p id="Par17">Functional facts were chosen to convey some way in which the object could be used. Nonfunctional facts were chosen such that they conveyed a generally interesting piece of information about the object but did not include details about its function. These facts tended to be related to things like where the object originates from, where it currently resides, who once owned it, and so forth. For example, the previously mentioned Object 4 (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) was assigned the following functional facts: (a) &#x0201c;It is used to squeeze juice out of fruit&#x0201d;; (b) &#x0201c;It is used to shape minced meat into meatballs&#x0201d;; and the following nonfunctional facts: (c) &#x0201c;It was recently sold at a private auction&#x0201d;; (d) &#x0201c;It now belongs to a museum of science&#x0201d;. Only one of these facts would be presented on any given trial; see the Appendix Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> for a full list of the functional and nonfunctional facts.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Procedure</title><p id="Par18">Participants read an information sheet and signed a consent form. After providing basic demographic details, participants first took part in a series of practice trials that replicated the real trials described below. These practice trials used stimuli that were not used in the main trials.</p><p id="Par19">At the start of the session, participants were told that they were about to see a series of unusual objects. They were informed that the first part of the experiment involved them answering two questions for each object: (1) &#x0201c;Do you recognise this object?&#x0201d; and (2) &#x0201c;Do you know what this object is used for?&#x0201d; and that both questions would be answered on a 7-point scale.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn2">2</xref> These measures were taken so we could assess how &#x0201c;ambiguous&#x0201d; the stimuli were in our sample. Participants were further told that, after they had rated the objects, they would see each one again. On this presentation, each object would be accompanied by a name and a piece of information about the object. They were asked to pay close attention to this information because their memory would be tested for it later in the study. On each of the 44 encoding trials, the object and associated information were presented on-screen for 7&#x000a0;s, with the image of the object appearing in the centre of the screen. Directly under the object, the name was presented in the following way: &#x0201c;This is a _____&#x0201d;, and directly below this was the functional or nonfunctional fact. For each participant, half of the objects presented were associated with functional facts, and the other half associated with non-functional facts. Order of presentation was randomised. Which fact was chosen for each object (from the two available in each information condition) was also randomised.</p><p id="Par20">After viewing all objects and associated names/facts, participants proceeded to the recall stage after a 3-min distraction task that involved counting backwards from a given number when cued. For the name recall, each object was presented alongside two names, one of which was the name that was presented in the first part of the experiment, the other being a name that had not been used at any point previously. For the fact recall, the object was shown along with an instruction to type into a textbox the fact that had been associated with the object in the earlier phase. After completing these recall tasks for all objects, participants were thanked and debriefed.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Results and discussion</title><p id="Par21">Firstly, the scores from the rating tasks relating to recognition of objects and knowledge of object function were calculated. The average recognition score for the objects used in the study was 2.55 (<italic>SD</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.93). The average score for the recognition of function was 2.24 (<italic>SD</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.76). Given that the highest score on these measures was 7, these data show that the objects were, as intended, generally unknown to the sample.</p><p id="Par22">Responses in the information recall task were given to two independent raters who were blind to the hypotheses. Interrater reliability was high (Cohen&#x02019;s Kappa&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.85). On trials where the two raters disagreed, a third rater was used and a majority-vote method provided the final decisions.</p><p id="Par23">When asked to decide between two options which name had been associated with each object during the encoding phase, the mean number of correct responses for objects that had been previously associated with functional facts was 13.22 (<italic>SD</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.71) and was 13.30 (<italic>SD</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.18) for objects that had been associated with nonfunctional facts. This difference was not statistically significant: <italic>t</italic>(49)&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.18, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.86 (two-tailed<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn3">3</xref>), Cohen&#x02019;s <italic>d</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.03.</p><p id="Par24">When asked to recall the fact that had been associated with each object, the mean recall score for functional facts was 13.32 (<italic>SD</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;5.01); the mean recall score for nonfunctional facts was 9.74 (<italic>SD</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;4.62). This difference is statistically significant: <italic>t</italic>(49)&#x02009;=&#x02009;7.94, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001 (one-tailed) Cohen&#x02019;s <italic>d</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.12.</p><p id="Par25">These results support the hypothesis that functional facts would be better remembered than nonfunctional facts. As expected, recall of the names of the objects did not differ according to whether the object was associated with a functional fact compared with a nonfunctional fact. Functional information, it seems, is particularly memorable. Experiment 2 was conducted as a way of further investigating this effect.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Experiment 2</title><p id="Par26">The second experiment aimed to further explore the mnemonic potency of information about the function of objects. As shown by the results of Experiment 1, when learning new facts about an unfamiliar object, we are more efficient when the information is of a specific semantic form&#x02014;that of information about the object&#x02019;s function. Whereas Experiment 1&#x000a0;was concerned with asking about the potential mnemonic advantages of the functional information itself, Experiment 2 additionally asks about whether receiving feedback (either confirmatory or disconfirmatory) on one&#x02019;s initial judgment of an item&#x02019;s function influences subsequent recall of that functional information.</p><p id="Par27">There are multiple ways to conceptualise the role of feedback in this context, making it hard to make specific predictions. Intuitively, we might expect that information confirming an item&#x02019;s true function would be most likely to be recalled because that information has most utility in terms of interacting with the object appropriately in the future. Confirmatory feedback has also been associated with dopamine release (Doll et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2011</xref>), which may have implications for subsequent recall performance (Shohamy &#x00026; Adcock, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2010</xref>). Receiving confirmatory feedback could also trigger a &#x0201c;truth-effect&#x0201d;, such that the information increases in cognitive fluency and is thus remembered more efficiently (see Dech&#x000ea;ne et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2010</xref>, for a review and meta-analysis).</p><p id="Par28">It could also be argued, however, that instances where we are mistaken about functional information should be most memorable. Some theorists have emphasised that an adaptive and optimised cognitive system should be flexible and thus should prioritise information that violates expectancies (see, e.g., Bell et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2012</xref>). If we think an object is for one thing but are subsequently informed that it is actually for something else (unexpected disconfirmatory feedback), this could be especially important to remember, because using objects in the wrong way can be harmful in both a physical and a social sense. Remembering functional information that is contrary to one&#x02019;s initial estimates might be important given the potential costs of continuing to misconstrue the function of the object into the future.</p><p id="Par29">Additionally, the ongoing debate over how &#x0201c;truth value&#x0201d; is represented in memory (Gilbert, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">1991</xref>) is also relevant when considering the role of feedback. Briefly, the Spinozan model holds that new information is automatically believed to be true at encoding, with further processing only required to update this and tag the information as false. The Cartesian model suggests that new information is initially neutrally represented, with truth value established later, when a true or false tag is attached. If the Spinozan model is correct, information associated with confirmatory feedback will receive less processing than information associated with disconfirmatory feedback. If the Cartesian model is correct, then both forms of feedback will be associated with similar levels of cognitive effort (see Bernhard et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2023</xref>; Nadarevic &#x00026; Erdfelder, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2019</xref>).</p><p id="Par30">All these scenarios have implications for how to conceptualise the effects of feedback in the current task. As such, no directional predictions were made for the role of feedback on recall of functional facts. Because functional information is adaptively more important than nonfunctional information, it is expected that feedback has more of an influence on the former.</p><p id="Par31">Predictions were as follows:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par32">Functional facts will be recalled more efficiently than nonfunctional facts (replicating the findings of Experiment 1).</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par33">Feedback will have more of an influence on recall of functional facts compared with nonfunctional facts (i.e., there will be an interaction between fact type and feedback).</p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par34">No specific predictions were made regarding the type of feedback and its effect on recall.</p><p id="Par35">A power analysis was conducted using the effect size from the previous experiment (<italic>d</italic><sub>z</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.12). This suggested that a sample size of 11 would be sufficient to detect the previously detected difference between functional and nonfunctional facts with a statistical power of over 0.90 in a one-tailed test. As the effect size for the second comparison (the effect of feedback) was unknown, another analysis was conducted assuming a small effect size (entered as half the size of the known effect in the other condition: <italic>d</italic><sub>z</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.56). This suggested that a sample size of 44 was required for statistical power of 0.95 in a two-tailed test. Sample size was thus set at around 50.</p><sec id="Sec9"><title>Method</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Participants and design</title><p id="Par36">Fifty-one participants (mean age&#x02009;=&#x02009;27.01&#x000a0;years, 16 men, 35 women) took part in a repeated-measures design consisting of 2 (facts: functional vs. nonfunctional)&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;2 (feedback: confirmatory vs. disconfirmatory) factors.

Half of the trials involved pairs of functional facts, and the other half involved pairs of nonfunctional facts. On each trial, participants were asked to choose which fact they thought was correct and were provided with immediate feedback as to the (pseudo) correctness of their response. Which response was deemed &#x0201c;correct&#x0201d; was randomly allocated and was not associated with any known information about any of the objects. After completing the encoding phase, participants completed the same 3-min distractor task described in Experiment 1, and then moved on to the recall phase, in which they were presented again with the 44 objects they had seen during the encoding phase and were asked to enter into a text box the fact that they had previously learned about the object. After doing this for all objects, participants were thanked and debriefed.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Results and discussion</title><p id="Par38">Responses from the recall task were given to two independent raters who were blind to the hypotheses.

As can be seen in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, the pattern for nonfunctional information across the feedback conditions stands in contrast to that for the functional information, suggesting once again that functional information is processed differently compared with nonfunctional information, with recall of the former appearing to be more susceptible to confirmatory feedback. This suggests that there are different cognitive consequences when being told that we are correct when the information under consideration is functional in nature compared with when it is nonfunctional information. Again, this highlights the unique nature of functional information.</p><sec id="Sec13"><title>Post hoc<italic> analyses</italic></title><p id="Par47">To further investigate potential mechanisms associated with the observed recall advantage for functional facts, post hoc measures of plausibility, concreteness, and imageability were collected for all object/info pairings (see the Appendix Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Statistically significant differences between functional and nonfunctional facts were found for all three measures.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn6">6</xref> To explore the degree to which these factors were implicated in the functional advantage, the following analyses were conducted on the recall data from Experiment 1 using the stimulus items as the units of analysis. For each measure (plausibility, concreteness, and imageability) 10 object&#x02013;info pairings from each condition (functional facts/nonfunctional facts) were selected that had average ratings in the middle of the response scale (i.e., around 3). Items chosen on plausibility had average ratings ranging from 3.00 to 3.20.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn7">7</xref> When this matched subset was compared on recall, the functional advantage persisted, <italic>M</italic><sub>Functional</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.66, <italic>SD</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.19; <italic>M</italic><sub>Nonfunctional</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.50, <italic>SD</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.23, <italic>t</italic>(18)&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.68, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.055, Cohen&#x02019;s <italic>d</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.75, one-tailed. Although this falls just short of significance, the effect size indicates a medium/large effect, suggesting that the recall advantage associated with functional facts cannot be fully explained by differences in how plausible the facts were when associated with the objects. A similar analysis was conducted on 10 object&#x02013;info pairings from each condition matched on concreteness (averaged ratings ranged from 3.00 to 3.17).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn8">8</xref> Again, this matched subset showed a significant recall advantage for the functional facts, <italic>M</italic><sub>Functional</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.60, <italic>SD</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.23; <italic>M</italic><sub>Nonfunctional</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.39, <italic>SD</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.24, <italic>t</italic>(18)&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.96, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.03, Cohen&#x02019;s <italic>d</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.88, one-tailed. This result suggests that matching items for concreteness does not diminish the effect. Finally, the same procedure was applied to items matched on imageability (averaged ratings ranged from 3.00 to 3.20).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn9">9</xref> Although the functional facts were better remembered than the nonfunctional facts for this subset, the difference did not approach significance, <italic>M</italic><sub>Functional</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.57, <italic>SD</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.24; <italic>M</italic><sub>Nonfunctional</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.47, <italic>SD</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.23, <italic>t</italic>(18)&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.95, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.18, Cohen&#x02019;s <italic>d</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.43, one-tailed. This suggests that the capacity to form images relating to the items and their suggested function may be implicated in the observed recall advantage.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>General discussion</title><p id="Par48">Two experiments investigated the mnemonic potency of functional information by utilising functionally ambiguous objects and pairing each object with either a functional or nonfunctional fact. The first experiment established that functional facts are better remembered than nonfunctional facts, and that recall of item names is not influenced by type of fact attached to the objects. Experiment 2 replicated the main finding of the previous experiment and also revealed that functional information is especially sensitive to confirmatory feedback.</p><p id="Par49">Post hoc analyses on matched subgroups suggested that the recall advantage did not seem to be related to concreteness or plausibility but may be related to how easy the object&#x02013;info pairings were to imagine. It would be of interest for future studies to investigate this further. For example, is the effect of imageability in these tasks related to self-reference effects? Do higher imageability scores relate to the ease with which the object&#x02013;info pairings can be visualised in terms of self-related actions (whether imagining oneself using the object, or imagining the object used on oneself), and is this related to subsequent recall? The possibility that the encoding task produces a larger self-reference effect for functional information compared with nonfunctional information is a question that requires more empirical work. Thinking about the function of an object usually involves imagining engaging with it personally (e.g., performing the function). Encoding the nonfunctional facts related to the objects is unlikely to involve similar levels of imagined personal engagement (although this is something that should be empirically established in future studies).</p><p id="Par50">There are other potential mechanisms worth considering, such as the influence of relevance/value. It seems self-evident that facts about an object&#x02019;s function will be seen as more important than nonfunctional facts, so the observed pattern of results could also be a consequence of this prioritisation (and the question of where this relevance comes from and how it interacts with feedback can be a focus for future work). Any difference in the relevance or value placed on the two forms of information could also mean that we are also seeing an effect of motivation, as people may be intrinsically more motivated to think about the potential uses for ambiguous objects than they are to think about nonfunctional facts (and the question of how motivation interacts with feedback could be another focus for future work).</p><p id="Par51">In suggesting possible mechanisms for the observed recall advantage, it is important to note that identifying mechanistic explanations does not necessarily invalidate the suggestion that the mnemonic advantage serves a specific function, as functional and mechanistic explanations can complement each other and should not be considered exclusive (see Shapiro, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2017</xref>). If it is indeed adaptive to prioritise functional information in memory, then this, for example, may be achieved by making functional information easier to imagine. Furthermore, the suggested mechanisms cannot fully explain the pattern of results observed in Experiment 2. The finding that the type of feedback interacts with the nature of the information suggests a more complex picture than can be painted by appealing to mnemonic mechanisms, and this should also be a focus of future work.</p><p id="Par52">Finally, there is the possibility that imagining using objects is simply a more cognitively demanding task that combines multiple mechanisms. In comparison to the processing required for the nonfunctional facts, imagining how an object might be used in the way described by the presented information involves a series of processes that make sense of the object&#x02019;s physical constitution; the mechanics of how the object can be manipulated; a representation of the end-goal; and a personal involvement with the object that one is imagining the function of. This is arguably a much more involved encoding process than is needed for imagining an object being held in a museum (to use an example of a nonfunctional fact from the current stimuli). Because the post hoc ratings would have required similar processing, it is possible that the effects of these multiple mechanisms influenced the ratings of concreteness, plausibility, and imageability for the functional facts, inflating their ratings compared with the nonfunctional facts. Again, these suggestions should be empirically established in future work.</p><p id="Par53">This research began with a question about whether different kinds of semantic information might be treated differently by memory systems depending on its adaptive utility. This way of formulating hypotheses is not common in mainstream memory research, but good arguments can be made about why this kind of thinking is appropriate in the field (Nairne &#x00026; Pandeirada, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2010</xref>). It should be recognised that there has been no independent verification of the &#x0201c;adaptive value&#x0201d; ascribed to functional facts. It is possible that other factors underpin the mnemonic priority that functional facts seem to enjoy.</p><p id="Par54">Future studies should aim to establish the effect further and investigate its boundary conditions and mechanisms. It would be especially informative to utilise object&#x02013;info pairings that had been specifically matched in advance on mnemonically relevant variables.</p><p id="Par55">The current data suggest that semantic information is not uniform in nature. The reasons why some semantic information is treated differently by mnemonic systems compared with other semantic information is something that needs to be incorporated into theoretical models of memory. It may (or may not) be the case that functional facts are better remembered because of the adaptive value that remembering such things had for our ancestors over evolutionary time.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec15"><title>Appendix</title><table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Functional/Nonfunctional facts and nonword names for 44 stimulus objects.

Firstly, a normality test was conducted on the distribution; Shapiro&#x02013;Wilk statistic&#x02009;=&#x02009;.974, <italic>df</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;51, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;.308.

Additionally, the ANOVA was rerun after cases were weighted according to the relative proportion of trials in each feedback condition (e.g., a case in which there were 22 trials in each feedback condition was given a weighting of 0.5). After this weighting, the main results were unchanged from the original analysis; no main effect of feedback type, <italic>F</italic>(1,17)&#x02009;=&#x02009;.53, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;.478, &#x003b7;<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup>&#x02009;=&#x02009;.03; main effect of information-type, <italic>F</italic>(1,17)&#x02009;=&#x02009;11.44, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;.004, &#x003b7;<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup>&#x02009;=&#x02009;.40; and a significant interaction, <italic>F</italic>(1,17)&#x02009;=&#x02009;6.04, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;.025, &#x003b7;<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup>&#x02009;=&#x02009;.262.
