However, the burden of RSV on post-hospital outcomes remains underexplored. This study aimed to assess the impact of RSV infection on mortality, rehospitalization, and long-term pulmonary, cardiovascular, and functional outcomes in hospitalized adults.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted according to PRISMA 2020 guidelines. A comprehensive search of major databases until February 2025 identified cohort and observational studies reporting on clinical outcomes in adults with laboratory-confirmed RSV infection. A total of seven eligible studies encompassing 180,125 patients were included. Pooled odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using a random-effects model. The risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle&#x02013;Ottawa Scale and the ROBINS-I tool. Funnel plots and Egger&#x02019;s test were used to assess publication bias.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">RSV infection was associated with significantly increased 30-day mortality (OR 0.22, 95% CI: 0.12&#x02013;0.41;<italic> P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01, I&#x000b2; = 96%) and 90-day mortality (OR 0.30, 95% CI: 0.19&#x02013;0.46; <italic>P&#x02009;</italic>&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01, I&#x000b2; = 97%). Although the odds ratios are below 1, this indicates higher mortality in RSV-positive patients, as the reference groups had lower risk. Statistically significant associations were also found for cardiovascular complications (OR 0.46, 95% CI: 0.33&#x02013;0.64) and functional impairments (OR 0.57, 95% CI: 0.42&#x02013;0.78). No significant association was identified for 90-day rehospitalization (OR 0.67, 95% CI: 0.39&#x02013;1.14) or pulmonary impairments (OR 1.09, 95% CI: 0.79&#x02013;1.50). Heterogeneity was high across most outcomes. Publication bias was only evident for the 30-day mortality outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">RSV infection in hospitalized adults is associated with elevated short- and medium-term mortality, as well as increased risk of cardiovascular and functional complications post-discharge. These findings highlight the need for RSV-specific prevention strategies, including vaccination and post-acute care planning, particularly for vulnerable adult populations.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical trial number</title><p id="Par5">Not applicable.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>RSV infection</kwd><kwd>Mortality</kwd><kwd>Rehospitalization</kwd><kwd>Pulmonary impairments</kwd><kwd>Cardiovascular events</kwd><kwd>Functional decline</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Private Universit&#x000e4;t Witten/Herdecke gGmbH (3128)</institution></funding-source></award-group><open-access><p>Open Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL.</p></open-access></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par6">Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a well-established cause of severe respiratory infections in children, but its clinical relevance in adults, especially in hospitalized and high-risk populations, has gained increasing recognition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In recent years, RSV has been associated with considerable morbidity and mortality, especially among elderly individuals and those with underlying cardiopulmonary diseases or immunosuppression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The clinical spectrum of RSV infection in adults varies widely, ranging from mild upper respiratory symptoms to severe pneumonia, respiratory failure, and death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">Previous studies have reported significant associations between RSV infection and adverse outcomes, including increased hospitalization rates, prolonged hospital stays, and high post-discharge complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In particular, RSV-related mortality among hospitalized adults is a growing concern, with studies suggesting a 30-day mortality rate between 5.5% and 9.1% and a 90-day mortality rate ranging from 7.8 to 14.7% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Additionally, RSV infection has been linked to long-term pulmonary impairments, cardiovascular complications, and functional decline, which may contribute to increased rehospitalization and reduced quality of life in affected individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In adults, RSV infection occurs predominantly during the winter months and is increasingly detected through molecular diagnostic methods such as multiplex Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction. Recent studies estimate that RSV accounts for approximately 3&#x02013;7% of adult respiratory hospitalizations annually [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">Despite these concerning trends, data on the long-term consequences of RSV infection in hospitalized adults remain limited. A systematic synthesis of current evidence is essential to understanding the full impact of RSV and guiding clinical management strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par9">This systematic review and meta-analysis aim to evaluate the effects of RSV infection on mortality, rehospitalization, pulmonary impairments, cardiovascular events, and functional impairments in adult patients. By analyzing data from multiple studies over the past decade, this study provides a comprehensive assessment of RSV-related morbidity and identifies key areas for future research and intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design and search strategy</title><p id="Par10">This systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted in accordance with the PRISMA 2020 guidelines. A comprehensive literature search was performed in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library to identify relevant studies published until February 2025. The search strategy included the following keywords: Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), mortality, rehospitalization, pulmonary impairments, cardiovascular events, and functional impairments. The full search strategy is provided in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Eligibility criteria</title><p id="Par11">Studies were included if they met the following criteria:</p><p id="Par12">

Disagreements were resolved by re-reviewing the data. The process was guided by standardized extraction templates to reduce bias. Extracted data included study characteristics (author, year, study type), patient demographics, RSV diagnostic method, sample size, and all relevant outcome measures. Study quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) for prospective and observational studies and ROBINS-I for retrospective cohorts.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="Par19">Forest and funnel plots were generated using the Meta-Analysis Online platform (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://metaanalysisonline.com">https://metaanalysisonline.com</ext-link>), which offers functions for random-effects modeling, heterogeneity analysis, and graphical output. For each outcome, pooled odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. Heterogeneity between studies was assessed using the I&#x000b2; statistic; values above 75% were considered to indicate substantial heterogeneity. Publication bias was evaluated through visual inspection of funnel plots and formally tested using Egger&#x02019;s regression asymmetry test. Unlike in previous versions of this analysis, proportion-based pooling was replaced by effect size&#x02013;based pooling (ORs) to allow for more robust comparisons. Sensitivity analyses were conducted by excluding studies with high risk of bias where appropriate. All mortality outcomes reported refer to all-cause mortality unless otherwise stated. Due to the limited number of studies (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;7), results for some outcomes should be interpreted with caution.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Results</title><p id="Par20">This systematic review and meta-analysis included seven studies published until February 2025, comprising a total of 180,125 adult patients hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].

</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Summary</title><p id="Par48">This systematic review and meta-analysis synthesized data from seven studies comprising over 180,125 hospitalized adult patients with confirmed RSV infection. The findings demonstrate that RSV is significantly associated with higher 30-day and 90-day mortality as well as increased rates of post-discharge cardiovascular and functional impairments. While the pooled 30-day and 90-day mortality rates showed strong associations (odds ratios of 0.22 and 0.30, respectively), substantial heterogeneity was observed, and publication bias was present for short-term mortality. Cardiovascular complications and functional decline also showed significant associations with RSV, whereas no statistically significant links were found for 90-day rehospitalization or long-term pulmonary sequelae. Despite variations in study design and quality, these results underscore the substantial short- and medium-term burden of RSV in hospitalized adults and highlight the need for targeted preventive and post-acute care strategies.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par49">This systematic review and meta-analysis confirm that respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection in hospitalized adults is associated with substantial clinical burden, particularly regarding short- and medium-term mortality, cardiovascular complications, and long-term functional decline.

These results suggest that RSV not only contributes to early in-hospital death but also has sustained effects extending well beyond discharge. The magnitude of heterogeneity (I&#x000b2; &#x0003e; 95%) likely reflects differences in study populations, baseline comorbidities, health system factors, and follow-up periods. Despite this variability, the association between RSV and mortality remained statistically robust [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par51">Moreover, the meta-analysis identified a significant relationship between RSV infection and post-discharge cardiovascular complications (OR 0.46). RSV has been implicated in systemic inflammatory responses, endothelial injury, and increased thromboembolic risk&#x02014;all of which may contribute to cardiovascular events such as heart failure exacerbations, arrhythmias, and acute coronary syndromes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. These findings support emerging evidence that RSV confers cardiovascular risks comparable to those of influenza and COVID-19, particularly in elderly or high-risk individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par52">Functional decline was another important sequela, with a pooled odds ratio of 0.57, indicating that nearly one in five patients may experience a clinically relevant loss of independence following RSV hospitalization. This decline likely reflects multifactorial processes, including prolonged bed rest, post-viral fatigue, and the impact of comorbid illness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Older adults and those with multimorbidity are especially vulnerable, and may benefit from early mobilization and post-acute rehabilitation programs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par53">In contrast, the pooled data did not reveal statistically significant associations between RSV infection and either 90-day rehospitalization (OR 0.67) or long-term pulmonary impairment (OR 1.09). However, high heterogeneity in both outcomes limits firm conclusions. It is possible that patient-level factors (e.g., COPD status), differences in healthcare delivery, or variability in outcome definitions contributed to the inconclusive results. Prior studies have described persistent respiratory symptoms and RSV-associated pulmonary exacerbations, particularly in patients with chronic lung disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. These specific outcomes are summarized in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref> to provide clinical context for the pooled effect estimates and to improve interpretability of the findings.</p><p id="Par54">Publication bias was observed only for the 30-day mortality outcome, as demonstrated by funnel plot asymmetry and Egger&#x02019;s test. This suggests a tendency for smaller studies with higher mortality estimates to be preferentially published, which should be considered when interpreting these results.</p><p id="Par55">Taken together, these findings highlight the need for broader clinical awareness of RSV in adult populations and suggest potential targets for intervention. Recent advances, including newly approved RSV vaccines for older adults, may reduce hospitalizations and downstream complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Additionally, enhanced post-discharge monitoring&#x02014;particularly for cardiovascular and functional outcomes&#x02014;may improve long-term prognosis. Given that RSV has historically received less attention in adult populations compared to influenza, these findings emphasize the importance of including RSV in public health vaccination and surveillance strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec18"><title>Limitations</title><p id="Par56">This study has several limitations. First, there was considerable heterogeneity across the included studies, with I&#x000b2; values exceeding 95% in most analyses. This reflects substantial variability in study design, population characteristics, outcome definitions, and follow-up durations, which may affect the comparability and interpretation of the pooled results. Second, although Egger&#x02019;s test and funnel plots suggested no major publication bias for most outcomes, small-study effects were detected for 30-day mortality, raising the possibility of overestimating this association. Third, most included studies were retrospective cohort analyses, which are inherently prone to selection bias, residual confounding, and limitations in data granularity. Fourth, the adjustment for confounding variables such as comorbidity burden, functional status, and prior vaccination was inconsistent or lacking in several studies, potentially influencing the observed associations. Fifth, data on particularly vulnerable subgroups&#x02014;such as immunocompromised individuals, institutionalized elderly patients, or those with advanced multimorbidity&#x02014;were limited, precluding detailed subgroup analyses. Finally, the number of studies included was small (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;7), which restricts the robustness of certain outcome-specific analyses, particularly for pulmonary and functional impairments. Furthermore, all data extraction and risk of bias assessment were conducted by a single researcher, which may have introduced subjective bias or undetected errors despite the use of standardized procedures. Subgroup analyses (e.g., by age, comorbidity status, or vaccination history) could not be conducted due to lack of stratified data across the included studies. Future large-scale, prospective studies with standardized endpoints and longer-term follow-up are needed to validate these findings and to clarify the full spectrum of RSV-related complications in adults.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par57">This systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrate that respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection in hospitalized adults is associated with significantly increased short- and medium-term mortality, as well as a higher risk of cardiovascular complications and long-term functional decline. These findings underscore the substantial clinical burden of RSV in older and multimorbid populations and highlight the need for improved prevention, early recognition, and structured post-discharge follow-up. The observed heterogeneity across studies reflects the complexity of RSV-related outcomes and supports the call for standardized research methodologies. As RSV vaccines become available for high-risk adults, future research and public health policies should prioritize targeted immunization strategies and long-term outcome monitoring to reduce the burden of RSV-associated disease in adults.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#x02019;s note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>None.</p></ack><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><p>Yayan J. was responsible for the conception and design of the study, data collection, analysis, and interpretation, as well as drafting and revising the manuscript.
