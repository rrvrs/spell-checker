Psychosocial and mental health-related variables are crucial determinants of individuals&#x02019; lives in society and their roles within organizations, especially in educational institutions that are characterized by social complexities. In this regard, this research aims to determine the levels of emotional intelligence among teachers in educational institutions in the Department of Magdalena.</p></sec><sec id="sec9384"><title>Objectives</title><p>Determine the levels of emotional intelligence among teachers in educational institutions in the Department of Magdalena</p></sec><sec id="sec9385"><title>Methods</title><p>Methodologically, it is situated within the empirical-analytical paradigm with a quantitative approach, using the descriptive method.

Furthermore, 6.4% agree, and 5.2% strongly agree with the statement that they let their feelings affect their thoughts.</p><p>As for thinking about their mood constantly, 16.7% strongly disagree, and 39.1% somewhat agree. Moreover, 6.9% strongly disagree, and 21.4% somewhat agree with the statement that they pay a lot of attention to what they feel.</p><p>Only 1.1% strongly disagree with being able to frequently define their feelings. and only 1.7% strongly disagree, and 10.2% somewhat agree with the expression &#x0201c;I often become aware of my feelings in different situations.&#x0201d; 34.1% strongly agree, and 26.6% completely agree with the statement &#x0201c;I can always tell how I feel.&#x0201d; Finally, 5.1% strongly disagree, and 19.4% somewhat agree with the statement &#x0201c;Sometimes I can tell what my emotions are.&#x0201d;</p></sec><sec id="sec9387"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, the study emphasizes in the importance of teachers&#x02019; emotional intelligence and its potential impact on their performance and students&#x02019; learning outcomes. It also highlights the need for intervention strategies to strengthen this psychosocial variable in educational institutions in the Department of Magdalena.</p></sec><sec id="sec9388"><title>Disclosure of Interest</title><p>None Declared</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="1"/></counts></article-meta></front></article>
