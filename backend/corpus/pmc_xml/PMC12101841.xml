To address vaccine supply constraints, heterologous prime-boost strategies were adopted in Korea and other countries. Although studies have explored the effectiveness of heterologous prime-boost SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, comprehensive research on its adverse events (AEs), particularly severe serious AEs (SAEs), remains lacking. As an observational study, this study aims to compare severe SAEs across vaccination strategies and examine factors, including heterologous vaccination, associated with 42-day mortality among patients with severe SAEs, without implying causality. Our retrospective cohort study involved 358 cases of severe SAEs following prime-boost SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in Gyeonggi Province, South Korea, from February 26, 2021, to March 15, 2022. In patients with severe SAEs, the heterologous vaccination was associated with a higher risk of mortality than the homologous viral vector vaccination. Vaccinations performed at vaccination centers were associated with a lower risk of mortality. Furthermore, among patients with severe SAEs, the heterologous group exhibited a higher rate of respiratory diseases and genitourinary diseases compared to the homologous viral vector group. Moreover, the rate of deaths from genitourinary diseases among patients with severe SAEs was significantly higher in the heterologous group compared to the homologous viral vector group. We believe that our study, while limited to associations and not establishing causality, provides critical insights that could inform decision-making in scenarios where heterologous vaccination is necessitated by vaccine shortages or other constraints, particularly in managing severe SAEs and improving patient outcomes.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>Soonchunhyang University Research Fund</institution>

In 2021, South Korea authorized the use of four vaccines: mRNA-1273 (Moderna) and BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) vaccines, which are mRNA-based, as well as Ad.26.COV2.S (Janssen) and ChAdOx1-S/nCoV-19 (Oxford-AstraZeneca) vaccines, which are viral vector-based [<xref rid="pone.0323736.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. By March 2022, 85.9% of the residents of Gyeonggi Province had received complete severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccination.</p><p>Due to vaccine supply constraints, a heterologous prime-boost vaccination strategy for SARS-CoV-2 was implemented. This approach aimed to accelerate global vaccination efforts and enhance control of the pandemic [<xref rid="pone.0323736.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In addition to South Korea, countries such as the USA, UK, and Sweden have adopted heterologous vaccine strategies, with relatively fewer issues related to vaccine supply. However, heterologous vaccines have been implemented in countries such as Bhutan as a solution to vaccine scarcity [<xref rid="pone.0323736.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Recent systematic reviews and network meta-analyses have explored heterologous and homologous booster regimens, showing acceptable safety profiles and robust immunogenicity in adults [<xref rid="pone.0323736.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0323736.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Although studies have investigated adverse events (AEs) linked to heterologous vaccination [<xref rid="pone.0323736.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323736.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], comprehensive research on this topic remains limited. In particular, data on the associations between various vaccination strategies, including heterologous regimens, and severe serious AEs (SAEs) are lacking.</p><p>Hence, the objectives of our study are to (1) assess differences in patient-specific and external factors among individuals who experience severe SAEs following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, when categorized by vaccination strategies; (2) examine factors, including heterologous vaccination, associated with 42-day mortality among patients who experience severe SAEs; and (3) assess differences in the etiologies of severe SAEs across vaccination strategies and analyze the etiologies of deaths among severe SAEs across these strategies. We believe that our study provides critical insights that could inform decision-making in scenarios where heterologous vaccination is necessitated by vaccine shortages or other constraints.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Study design</title><p>We conducted a retrospective cohort study based on a community healthcare database analyzing physician- or self-reported severe SAEs temporally linked to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in Gyeonggi Province, a prominent local governmental entity in South Korea inhabited by approximately 13 million people, representing almost one-third of the nation&#x02019;s population, from February 26, 2021, to March 15, 2022. We examined differences in severe SAEs across vaccination strategies and evaluated the impact of specific strategies, including heterologous vaccination, on 42-day mortality among severe SAEs.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Data collection</title><sec id="sec005"><title>Passive surveillance on AEs following immunization.</title><p>A government-led passive surveillance program was established to monitor adverse events following immunization (AEFIs) caused by SARS-CoV-2 vaccination [<xref rid="pone.0323736.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. To encourage active participation, the Korean government provided expert feedback and monetary compensation for cases with a possible association between the vaccine and reported AEs. To address the limitations of passive surveillance, Gyeonggi Province implemented additional measures, including regular monitoring of reporting rates across all hospitals at the provincial level and distributing updated educational resources to in-hospital infection control centers to promote timely and accurate case reporting.</p><p>The Gyeonggi Infectious Disease Control Center (GIDCC) addressed all reported AEFI cases by thoroughly reviewing hospital electronic medical records and drug utilization review data provided by the Korean Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service. Additionally, the GIDCC conducted interviews with patients or their primary caregivers and discussed with relevant medical personnel to evaluate the cases.</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>Definition of cases.</title><p>The reported severe SAEs were defined as either deaths; events requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission; life-threatening events; incidents resulting in permanent sequelae; or AEs of special interest (AESIs), such as anaphylaxis, thrombotic thrombocytopenia syndrome, myocarditis, pericarditis, and Guillain&#x02013;Barr&#x000e9; syndrome, which were temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.</p><p>Severe SAEs were defined as events that &#x0201c;result in significant morbidity or mortality,&#x0201d; encompassing ICU admissions, life-threatening conditions, severe damage, or deaths. For the sake of brevity, the term &#x0201c;severe SAEs&#x0201d; throughout the manuscript implies the occurrence of substantial morbidity or mortality.</p><p>The &#x0201c;homologous mRNA group&#x0201d; refers to patients with severe SAEs who exclusively received mRNA vaccines up to the second or third (booster) dose. The &#x0201c;homologous viral vector group&#x0201d; refers to patients with severe SAEs who exclusively received viral vector vaccines up to the second or third (booster) dose. The &#x0201c;heterologous group&#x0201d; represents patients with severe SAEs who received a viral vector vaccine followed by an mRNA vaccine up to the second or third (booster) dose. Notably, all individuals in the heterologous group in South Korea, including those in our study, received a viral vector vaccine followed by an mRNA vaccine.</p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>Cohort and longitudinal follow-up.</title><p>Among the 38,828,691 administered SARS-CoV-2 vaccine doses, a total of 105,409 AEs were reported from February 26, 2021, to March 15, 2022. Among these, 687 patients were reported to have experienced severe SAEs temporally linked to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. For the study, 23 cases were excluded as they did not meet the criteria of requiring ICU admission, being life-threatening, fatal, or resulting in long-term sequelae (N&#x02009;=&#x02009;23). To facilitate a comparison between the homologous and heterologous groups, we excluded individuals who did not complete the vaccine series and received only one dose (N&#x02009;=&#x02009;305) and an individual who received an inactivated vaccine (Sinopharm BBIBP-CorV) (N&#x02009;=&#x02009;1).

The main findings of this study include: among patients with severe SAEs, (1) the heterologous group was associated with a higher risk of mortality compared to the homologous viral vector group; (2) vaccinations performed at vaccination centers were associated with a lower risk of mortality; and (3) the heterologous group exhibited increased rates of severe SAEs involving respiratory and genitourinary diseases, as well as a higher rate of deaths related to genitourinary diseases among patients with severe SAEs. To our knowledge, this study is the first to examine the differences in severe SAEs across prime-boost vaccination strategies and evaluate the impact of specific strategies, including heterologous prime-boost vaccination, on 42-day mortality among severe SAEs.</p><p>Our findings indicate that the heterologous group was associated with poorer survival outcomes compared to the homologous viral vector group in patients with severe SAEs, though this does not imply causation. Notably, this finding was significant after adjusting for vaccination site and stratifying by CCI. Excessive and unintended immune responses, sometimes triggered by molecular mimicry, may be the primary cause of a significant proportion of AEFIs [<xref rid="pone.0323736.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Hence, it is crucial to scrutinize immunogenicity variations among different vaccination strategies. Studies have shown that heterologous viral vector-primed mRNA vaccinations are more immunogenic than are homologous viral vector vaccinations [<xref rid="pone.0323736.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In the heterologous viral vector-primed mRNA vaccination, both humoral response (as evidenced by SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike IgG concentrations) and cellular response (measured through IFN&#x003b3; ELISpot) were notably elevated [<xref rid="pone.0323736.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Furthermore, from a clinical perspective, higher systemic reactogenicity following the booster dose was observed with heterologous prime-boost vaccination than with homologous prime-boost vaccination [<xref rid="pone.0323736.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Therefore, increased immunogenicity and reactogenicity could explain the higher mortality risk associated with the heterologous group.</p><p>Patients with severe SAEs vaccinated at vaccination centers were associated with better survival outcomes than those vaccinated at other sites. This difference may reflect the influence of preexisting health conditions on vaccination location. For example, during the early vaccination phase, mobile individuals aged 75 years and older were directed to vaccination centers, while residents of long-term care facilities received on-site vaccinations [<xref rid="pone.0323736.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Because the preventive effect of vaccination may be consistent irrespective of underlying medical conditions [<xref rid="pone.0323736.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], it is believed that vaccination remains necessary.</p><p>Finally, the heterologous group demonstrated an increased rate of severe SAEs associated with respiratory and genitourinary diseases, as well as a higher rate of deaths attributed to genitourinary diseases among patients with severe SAEs. Of the 34 severe SAEs with identifiable diagnoses associated with respiratory diseases, only four cases were not related to respiratory pneumonia. Exceptions included one case of acute epiglottitis in the homologous mRNA group and one case each of acute respiratory failure, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and acute exacerbation of COPD in the heterologous group. In genitourinary diseases, among the 10 severe SAEs with identifiable diagnoses, all but one were urinary tract infections, except for acute renal failure in the homologous viral vector group. In these cases, all cases of mortality were due to urinary tract infection. Although caution is warranted owing to the absence of a clearly defined mechanism, we consider transient lymphopenia as a potential reason for the predominance of pneumonia and urinary tract infection. Transient lymphopenia was observed in a dose-dependent manner following mRNA vaccination [<xref rid="pone.0323736.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Because lymphopenia is associated with an elevated risk of infection and subsequent risk of mortality [<xref rid="pone.0323736.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], we hypothesize that this may account for the predominance of pneumonia and urinary tract infections in the heterologous group, which may have experienced higher levels of reactogenicity than the other groups.</p><p>This study has certain limitations that warrant acknowledgment. First, the study focuses exclusively on patients with severe SAEs, which may limit the generalizability of the findings to the general population. Caution is warranted when applying these results to broader groups, as the study population represents a specific subset with distinct characteristics. Second, in each vaccine strategy group, there is a mixture of patients who received either a second or third dose (booster). Specifically, in the heterologous viral vector-primed mRNA group, there is a combination of patients who received mRNA vaccination at either the second or third dose. This variability may contribute to differences in detailed immunogenicity. Third, because this study is purely observational, it identifies only associations between variables and does not establish any causal relationships. However, the temporal links identified in our study offer valuable insights that can guide future investigations into causation. Fourth, it is important to note that the increased mortality associated with the heterologous group may be partly attributable to factors other than the vaccination strategy itself, such as selection bias, reporting bias, and unmeasured confounders, including time interval between vaccine doses, socioeconomic status, healthcare access, and the severity of severe SAEs. Although our analysis adjusted for known confounders, residual confounding cannot be completely ruled out. Fifth, the number of deaths related to SARS-CoV-2 infection during the follow-up period was not fully accounted for, which may have influenced the interpretation of mortality outcomes. Nationwide time-series analyses exploring the relationships between SARS-CoV-2 infection, vaccination, and deaths following severe SAEs could help clarify these temporal associations. Lastly, passive surveillance might be affected by underreporting bias; however, we implemented measures to address this issue, as explained in the Methods section. Additionally, milder cases may be underreported, while more severe cases could potentially be overrepresented. We conducted comprehensive follow-up assessments of patients with severe SAEs to minimize potential bias from participant attrition.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec017"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, our study revealed the following important insights: (1) in patients with severe SAEs, heterologous viral vector-primed mRNA vaccination may be associated with a higher risk of mortality compared to homologous viral vector prime-boost vaccination; (2) among patients with severe SAEs, those vaccinated at vaccination centers were associated with better survival outcomes; and (3) heterologous viral vector-primed mRNA vaccination demonstrated increased severe SAEs attributed to respiratory and genitourinary diseases, as well as increased deaths associated with genitourinary diseases in this patient population. Our study, while limited to associations and not establishing causality, provides critical insights for decision-making when heterologous vaccination is needed, such as during vaccine shortages, to manage severe SAEs and improve patient outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="sec018" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material id="pone.0323736.s001" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S1 Text</label><caption><title>Clinical diagnoses using the international classification of diseases 10th revision (ICD-10) and ICD-10 clinical modification classification schemes, grouping them into specific etiological categories.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0323736.s001.docx"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors express gratitude to the entire team at the Gyeonggi Infectious Disease Control Center for their dedication to public health and their support for the study.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0323736.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>She</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Hou</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Bi</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Song</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name>. <article-title>Challenges of vaccination and herd immunity in COVID-19 and management strategies</article-title>. <source>Clin Respir J</source>. <year>2022</year>;<volume>16</volume>(<issue>11</issue>):<fpage>708</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>16</lpage>. <comment>doi: </comment><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1111/crj.13543</pub-id>
