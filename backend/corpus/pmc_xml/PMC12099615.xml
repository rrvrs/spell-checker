Fractions obtained using hexane (HE), dichloromethane (DCM), and ethyl acetate (EA) were found to suppress LPS-induced nitric oxide (NO) production and the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). Additionally, these fractions inhibited the phosphorylation of key mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), including extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2), p38, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), as well as the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-&#x003ba;B) subunit p65. The HE, DCM, and EA fractions also promoted the nuclear accumulation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and increased the expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). Notably, the suppression of HO-1 activity using zinc (II) protoporphyrin IX (ZnPP) reversed the NO-inhibitory effects of these fractions. Furthermore, treatment with the HE, DCM, and EA fractions enhanced phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) activation, whereas PI3K inhibition by LY294002 attenuated HO-1 expression and nuclear Nrf2 translocation. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging by N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) similarly reduced PI3K activation and the upregulation of HO-1 and nuclear Nrf2. Collectively, these findings indicate that the HE, DCM, and EA fractions mitigate NO production by downregulating iNOS expression through the suppression of MAPK and NF-&#x003ba;B signaling, while also engaging the ROS/PI3K/Nrf2/HO-1 pathway to exert anti-inflammatory effects.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Anti-inflammation</kwd><kwd>macrophages</kwd><kwd>mushroom</kwd><kwd><italic toggle="yes">Pleurotus citrinopileatus</italic></kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Inflammation is regarded in the human body as a complex biological response to protect against noxious stimuli, such as invading pathogens and damaged cells [<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].

However, under pathological conditions, excessive NO production is known to play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases [<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Therefore, suppressing excessive NO production is considered a crucial therapeutic molecular target in treating inflammatory diseases [<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In practice, the inhibition of NO production is widely utilized as a direct indicator of anti-inflammatory activity, owing to the close correlation between excessive NO generation and the induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines [<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. To evaluate the anti-inflammatory activity of <italic toggle="yes">P. citrinopileatus</italic>, we analyzed the extent to which the crude extract and various fractions of <italic toggle="yes">P. citrinopileatus</italic> inhibit LPS-induced NO production. The results revealed that the crude extract did not suppress LPS-induced NO production. However, the HE, DCM, and EA fractions significantly inhibited NO production, whereas the BU and water fractions exhibited only weak inhibitory effects (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). These findings suggest that the active compounds responsible for inhibiting NO production are predominantly concentrated in the n-hexane, dichloromethane, and ethyl acetate fractions. As such, these fractions are likely to serve as critical sources of anti-inflammatory bioactive compounds derived from <italic toggle="yes">P. citrinopileatus</italic>. The lack of activity in the crude extracts could be due to the presence of these active compounds in low concentrations, which became enriched through fractionation. The weak activity observed in the BU and water fraction indicates that polar compounds contribute only minimally to NO inhibition. Based on these findings, subsequent studies focused on the HE, DCM, and EA fractions of <italic toggle="yes">P. citrinopileatus</italic>. Because inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) is responsible for NO production, the regulation of iNOS is also considered a key strategy in the management of inflammatory diseases [<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. As shown in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1B</xref> and <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>, the HE, DCM, and EA fractions dose-dependently inhibited LPS-induced NO production and iNOS expression in RAW264.7 cells. Moreover, the HE, DCM, and EA fractions exhibited no detectable impact on the viability of RAW264.7 cells (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). These findings suggest that the HE, DCM, and EA fractions suppress NO production by downregulating iNOS expression.</p></sec><sec><title>Effect of HE, DCM, and EA Fraction of <italic toggle="yes">Pleurotus citrinopileatus</italic> on the MAPK and NF-&#x003ba;B Signaling Pathway in LPS-Stimulated RAW264.7 Cells</title><p>To examine the role of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-&#x003ba;B) signaling pathways in the suppression of nitric oxide (NO) production and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression by HE, DCM, and EA fractions in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW264.7 cells, we assessed whether these fractions influence LPS-induced phosphorylation of key signaling molecules. As illustrated in <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, treatment with the HE, DCM, and EA fractions resulted in a marked decrease in the phosphorylation levels of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2), p38, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and the NF-&#x003ba;B subunit p65 compared to cells exposed to LPS alone. These findings indicate that the anti-inflammatory effects of these fractions are closely linked to their capacity to interfere with LPS-triggered MAPK and NF-&#x003ba;B activation. Previous studies have demonstrated that inhibiting the MAPK cascade, including ERK1/2, p38, and JNK, effectively reduces inflammation in various in vivo models using mice and rats [<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Additionally, NF-&#x003ba;B activation is a well-established mechanism that amplifies inflammatory mediator production, contributing to the progression of chronic inflammation [<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Given that both pathways play pivotal roles in inflammatory responses, their concurrent suppression is recognized as a valuable strategy for developing anti-inflammatory agents [<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The ability of HE, DCM, and EA fractions to simultaneously modulate both MAPK and NF-&#x003ba;B pathways highlights their potential as multi-target regulators of inflammation. Overall, these findings suggest that the HE, DCM, and EA fractions effectively mitigate LPS-induced inflammatory responses by jointly targeting the MAPK and NF-&#x003ba;B pathways. This dual inhibition likely accounts for their ability to suppress NO production and iNOS expression, underscoring their potential therapeutic relevance in managing inflammation-related disorders.</p></sec><sec><title>Effect of HE, DCM, and EA Fraction of <italic toggle="yes">Pleurotus citrinopileatus</italic> on Nrf2/HO-1 Signaling Pathway in RAW264.7 Cells</title><p>As a master regulator of oxidative stress response, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) orchestrates the expression of genes involved in cellular protection [<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Under basal conditions, Nrf2 remains sequestered in the cytoplasm by Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1), which acts as its negative regulator. Following oxidative stress, Nrf2 is released from Keap1 and migrates into the nucleus where it activates cytoprotective genes like heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) by binding to the antioxidant response element (ARE) [<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The anti-inflammatory role of Nrf2, particularly in sepsis-induced models, has been well established in prior studies. Notably, Nrf2-deficient mice display heightened inflammatory responses following LPS exposure, emphasizing its crucial function in mitigating inflammatory damage [<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Additionally, HO-1, a downstream target of Nrf2, has been shown to mediate anti-inflammatory responses in RAW264.7 macrophages by suppressing the production of LPS-induced inflammatory mediators [<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The findings imply that the Nrf2/HO-1 axis contributes both to oxidative stress protection and to the modulation of inflammatory pathways. To determine whether the suppression of NO production and iNOS expression by HE, DCM, and EA fractions involves the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway, we examined their impact on nuclear Nrf2 and HO-1 protein levels. As depicted in <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3A</xref> and <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>, cells treated with these fractions exhibited a significant increase in nuclear Nrf2 and HO-1 protein expression compared to untreated controls. These results indicate that the HE, DCM, and EA fractions effectively activate the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway in RAW264.7 cells. Furthermore, the functional role of HO-1 in this process was confirmed by treating cells with zinc (II) protoporphyrin IX (ZnPP), a selective HO-1 inhibitor. As shown in <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>, ZnPP treatment attenuated the NO-suppressing effects of the HE, DCM, and EA fractions, suggesting that HO-1 induction is essential for their anti-inflammatory activity. Overall, these findings demonstrate that the HE, DCM, and EA fractions modulate inflammatory responses by activating the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling cascade. Their ability to enhance cellular defense mechanisms and suppress excessive inflammation underscores their potential as promising therapeutic candidates for managing inflammation and oxidative stress-related disorders. Furthermore, these insights lay the groundwork for future research into the therapeutic applications of HE, DCM, and EA fractions in inflammation-associated conditions.</p></sec><sec><title>Effect of PI3K on the Activation of Nrf2/HO-1 Signaling Pathway by HE, DCM, and EA Fraction of <italic toggle="yes">Pleurotus citrinopileatus</italic> in RAW264.7 Cells</title><p>Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) has been reported to play a critical role in regulating the activation of the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway, a key mechanism for protecting cells against oxidative stress and inflammation [<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. To investigate whether PI3K contributes to the activation of the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway mediated by the HE, DCM, and EA fractions, we examined whether these fractions activate PI3K and whether inhibition of PI3K attenuates the activation of the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway induced by these fractions. As shown in <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>, treatment with HE, DCM, and EA fractions increased PI3K phosphorylation. The observed increase in PI3K phosphorylation upon treatment with these fractions confirms their ability to activate PI3K. Furthermore, inhibition of PI3K by LY294002 reduced the HE, DCM, and EA fraction-induced increases in nuclear Nrf2 and HO-1 protein levels compared to cells treated with the fractions in the absence of PI3K inhibition (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figs. 4B</xref> and <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4C</xref>). These findings demonstrate the essential role of PI3K as an upstream regulator in the activation of the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway. In conclusion, the ability of the HE, DCM, and EA fractions to activate PI3K, leading to the downstream activation of the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway, highlights their potential as promising therapeutic agents in the treatment of oxidative stress and inflammation-related diseases.</p></sec><sec><title>Effect of ROS on the Activation of PI3K/Nrf2/HO-1 Signaling Pathway by HE, DCM, and EA Fraction of <italic toggle="yes">Pleurotus citrinopileatus</italic> in RAW264.7 Cells</title><p>Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a pivotal role in regulating the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway, as previously documented [<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Additionally, ROS have been identified as upstream modulators of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) [<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], suggesting their involvement in the regulation of the PI3K/Nrf2/HO-1 signaling axis. Given these findings, we investigated whether ROS contribute to the activation of this pathway in response to HE, DCM, and EA fractions. To assess this, we examined the impact of ROS inhibition on the fraction-mediated phosphorylation of PI3K, as well as nuclear Nrf2 and HO-1 protein levels. As shown in <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>, treatment with N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), an ROS scavenger, significantly reduced PI3K phosphorylation induced by the HE, DCM, and EA fractions. This suppression of PI3K activation was accompanied by a decrease in nuclear Nrf2 and HO-1 protein expression (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figs. 5B</xref> and <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5C</xref>), demonstrating the crucial role of ROS as upstream regulators in the PI3K/Nrf2/HO-1 pathway. Furthermore, previous studies have indicated that ROS can also modulate NF-&#x003ba;B signaling by exerting inhibitory effects on its activation [<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Although this study did not directly assess the influence of ROS on NF-&#x003ba;B inhibition mediated by the HE, DCM, and EA fractions, the findings suggest that ROS may contribute to their anti-inflammatory action through multiple pathways, including both PI3K/Nrf2/HO-1 activation and potential NF-&#x003ba;B suppression.</p><p>Edible mushrooms are widely recognized for their bioactive compounds, including polysaccharides, phenolic derivatives, indolic compounds, mycosteroids, fatty acids, carotenoids, vitamins, and biometals, which contribute to their anti-inflammatory properties [<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Among these, many compounds have been reported to suppress inflammation by inhibiting NF-&#x003ba;B signaling [<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Notably, mushrooms from the <italic toggle="yes">Pleurotus</italic> genus have been shown to attenuate NF-&#x003ba;B activation, reinforcing their anti-inflammatory potential [<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Consistent with these findings, our study demonstrates that the HE, DCM, and EA fractions of <italic toggle="yes">P. citrinopileatus</italic> effectively downregulate NF-&#x003ba;B signaling, aligning with the well-established anti-inflammatory mechanisms of edible mushrooms. Additionally, our results expand on prior studies by showing that these fractions also inhibit the MAPK signaling pathway, further contributing to their inflammation-suppressing effects. A key distinction of this study is the identification of an alternative anti-inflammatory mechanism mediated by ROS/PI3K/Nrf2/HO-1 signaling activation. While previous research on <italic toggle="yes">Pleurotus</italic> species has predominantly focused on NF-&#x003ba;B inhibition, our findings suggest that <italic toggle="yes">P. citrinopileatus</italic> exerts a dual regulatory effect. Specifically, it not only suppresses pro-inflammatory signaling through NF-&#x003ba;B and MAPK inhibition but also enhances antioxidant and cytoprotective responses via the PI3K/Nrf2/HO-1 axis. This integrated mechanism results in reduced iNOS expression and subsequent NO suppression, further supporting the potential therapeutic value of <italic toggle="yes">P. citrinopileatus</italic> in inflammation-associated conditions.</p><p>However, this study has several limitations. First, while the HE, DCM, and EA fractions demonstrated anti-inflammatory activity, the specific bioactive compounds responsible for these effects were not identified. Further investigations are required to isolate and characterize the active components within these fractions to gain a deeper understanding of their mechanisms of action. Previous research has identified a nonlectin glycoprotein from <italic toggle="yes">P. citrinopileatus</italic> that inhibits iNOS expression and NO production via NF-&#x003ba;B suppression in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells [<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Thus, we cannot rule out the possibility that nonlectin glycoproteins contribute to the observed anti-inflammatory effects of the HE, DCM, and EA fractions. Second, as this study was conducted in vitro, its findings may not fully translate to in vivo conditions. To confirm the proposed anti-inflammatory mechanisms, additional in vivo studies using animal models are necessary. These studies will help clarify the therapeutic potential and safety profile of the HE, DCM, and EA fractions. Despite these limitations, this study provides valuable insights into the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of <italic toggle="yes">P. citrinopileatus</italic> and serves as a foundation for future research aimed at exploring its potential in therapeutic applications.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This study was supported by a grant from the National Institute of Forest Science (grant number: FE0100-2023-04-2023) funded by the Korea Forest Service and the R&#x00026;D Program for Forest Science Technology (Project No. RS-2024-00405196) provided by the Korea Forest Service (Korea Forestry Promotion Institute).</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>
