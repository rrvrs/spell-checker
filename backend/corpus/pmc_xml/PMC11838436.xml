Polyamines are small, organic molecules that play a pivotal role for growth and differentiation, and a dysregulation of polyamine pathways is implicated in AD pathology. However, their role in DS-associated AD is unclear.</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>METHODS:</title><p id="P5">We analyzed polyamines and their metabolite levels in mouse hippocampal cells and human DS-AD and AD hippocampal tissue and assessed the effects of the ODC inhibitor difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) on A&#x003b2;42 aggregation and protein expression in DS fibroblasts.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>RESULTS:</title><p id="P6">Amyloid-&#x003b2;42 increased polyamine levels via ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activation in a dose-dependent manner. DFMO reduced A&#x003b2;42 aggregation, decreased amyloid precursor protein (APP) levels, and normalized proteins linked to AD pathology in DS fibroblasts. Polyamine levels were elevated in DS-AD hippocampal tissue, with colocalization of ODC and A&#x003b2;42 aggregates.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>CONCLUSION:</title><p id="P7">These findings suggest that polyamine biosynthesis may exacerbate A&#x003b2;42 toxicity and APP expression, contributing to AD progression in DS.

The amyloid precursor protein (<italic toggle="yes">APP</italic>) gene, a known risk factor for AD, is triplicated in DS, and is located on human autosome 21 [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. This results in high levels of toxic cleavage products including amyloid-beta (A&#x003b2;), with accumulation of amyloid plaques typically beginning in DS after 30 years of age. Other genes on Chr. 21, including e.g. the superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) gene, genes for several interferon receptors, dual specificity tyrosine phosphorylation regulated kinase 1A (Dyrk1A) and regulator of calcineurin 1 (RCAN1) are known to affect AD pathology including the amyloid, phospho-tau, and neuroinflammatory and oxidative stress pathways in the brain [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The amyloid plaque load increases progressively, beginning in the frontal cortex and eventually reaching all brain regions, although diffuse plaques have been observed in the hippocampus in those with DS in their teens and 20s [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Shortly after the accumulation of the first amyloid plaques, intracellular aggregation of hyperphosphorylated tau (p-Tau) forming neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) begins, eventually leading to a Braak stage of V-VI in most individuals with DS, along with additional co-pathologies including neuronal loss, activation of glial cells, and hippocampal atrophy [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p id="P9">Numerous hypotheses exist to explain the cumulative and widespread death of neurons in both cortical and subcortical brain regions and the emergence of amyloid plaques and NFTs that characterize AD (for review see [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]). The amyloid cascade hypothesis posits that increased APP abundance causes A&#x003b2; peptide to aggregate into plaques, inducing oxidative damage and mitochondrial dysfunction, in turn leading to cell death [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Previous work has shown that by accumulating in the mitochondrial matrix, A&#x003b2; promotes the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to neuronal apoptosis [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. However, the progression of AD-like pathology in those with DS is a complex process, involving interactions between many genetic aberrations as described above.</p><p id="P10">Polyamines (PAs) are ubiquitous small polycations involved with numerous functions in cells, including cellular proliferation, gene regulation, and autophagy through their ability to interact with negatively charged molecules [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. They are also known to respond to reactive oxygen species (ROS) with increased levels which is further exacerbated by the presence of A&#x003b2; [<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Previous animal and human studies including <italic toggle="yes">post-mortem</italic> AD brain analyses have shown increased levels of key enzymes in the PA pathway [<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Furthermore, metabolomic studies show alterations in the PA pathway in both DS and AD [<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. An increase in PA levels, otherwise known as the &#x0201c;PA response,&#x0201d; results in enhanced PA biosynthesis with similar increases in exogenous PA uptake [<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The rate-limiting step of the synthesis of PAs occurs when ornithine is processed by ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) to yield putrescine, followed by spermidine and spermine through the addition of amine groups. These small molecules are capable of regulating their own production broadly through inhibition of ODC by translational control or individually by catabolism to revert to former PAs. However, catabolism can lead to increased potential for oxidative damage by the production of the ROS hydrogen peroxide [<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] and the toxic aldehyde acrolein [<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The subcellular location of ODC, as well as ODC and PA levels, are dysregulated in AD brains, suggesting that alterations in the PA biosynthesis occur as a result of AD pathology, or may be involved in the accumulation of AD pathology [<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].</p><p id="P12">Research findings on the role of PAs in AD pathogenesis have been paradoxical, suggesting that accumulations of PAs can be both protective and harmful to the cell via many different pathways and neuronal/glial interactions [<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. However, understanding their roles in disease could lead to development of novel therapeutic targets [<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. For instance, <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> evidence suggests that PAs have the capacity to facilitate protein aggregation [<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. However, the mechanism of action <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> is not fully understood, specifically in pathological conditions where amyloidosis plays a critical role.</p><p id="P13">Here we hypothesized a relationship between PAs and A&#x003b2; accumulation, through the modulation of the ODC enzyme. Furthermore, we hypothesized that a dysregulation of the PA pathway contributes to A&#x003b2; oligomerization leading to neuronal dysfunction in DS-AD and AD. We utilized cell models of A&#x003b2; accumulation as well as brain tissue derived from normosomic and DS adults with AD and found that PA levels are increased in AD brain tissue, suggesting an interaction between PAs and A&#x003b2;<sub>42</sub> aggregation. Additionally, we determined that ODC inhibition via the L-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) inhibitor could reduce A&#x003b2;-mediated apoptosis as well as A&#x003b2; aggregation, thus potentially slowing AD pathology in a neuronal cell system.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="S7"><title>Reagents</title><p id="P14">Lipofectamine 2000, Lipofectamine 3000, Opti-MEM, Dulbecco&#x02019;s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM), were purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA).

Interestingly, the drug affected the aggregation process both in cells that had an artificially added or transfected with A&#x003b2;<sub>42</sub> and in naturally APP over-expressing cells (Htk cells), providing increased scientific rigor for its validity as an amyloid-reducing drug.</p></sec><sec id="S41"><title>Effects of DFMO Treatment in normosomic and trisomic Human Fibroblasts.</title><p id="P48">Densitometry revealed significant changes in relative protein concentrations both between the normosomic and trisomic fibroblasts as well as in cell cultures treated with 5.0 mM DFMO for 48 hours.

Spermine/spermidine acetyltransferase 1 (SAT1) was not significantly affected by the addition of DFMO, nor was it altered significantly in T21 fibroblasts (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>).

Neither EOAD or LOAD differed from the control in Arginase 1, but the DS-AD brain showed twice the density (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A</xref>). EOAD had the greatest significant increase in ODC levels compared to the HC, with DS-AD following, but the levels of ODC in LOAD cases were not significantly different from the HC cases (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8B</xref>). Spermine synthase levels were not significantly different from HC in the EOAD group, but the levels were significantly increased in the DS-AD group and to a lesser extent in the LOAD group (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8C</xref>). Spermidine synthase levels were only significantly elevated in the LOAD brain compared to all other groups (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8D</xref>).

Our findings demonstrated significantly elevated levels of all three major PAs - putrescine, spermidine, and spermine - in hippocampal tissue from AD patients compared to HC, and abnormal levels of PA synthesizing enzymes in the hippocampus of DS-AD, LOAD, EOAD cases compared to HC. This broad dysregulation of PA metabolism aligns with previous studies showing altered PA levels in AD brain tissue [<xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>,<xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. The concurrent elevation of spermidine and spermine levels suggests a comprehensive disruption of PA homeostasis rather than a pathway-specific alteration, and differences in dysregulation mechanisms between DS-AD and AD brains. The relatively small sample size (n=3), though yielding statistically significant results, underscores the need for validation in larger cohorts to confirm these preliminary findings. This study unveils a previously underexplored facet of AD and DS-AD pathophysiology, suggesting that the excessive accumulation of higher-order PAs could contribute to the underlying pathophysiology of AD, as evidenced by multiple in vitro models presented herein.</p><p id="P54">Our data suggest that A&#x003b2; increased levels of PAs in a dose dependent fashion, possibly via increased expression of ODC (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). This upregulation of ODC could be driven by A&#x003b2;-induced cellular stress, as A&#x003b2; is known to activate pathways like the MAPK signaling cascade [<xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] and the unfolded protein response (UPR) [<xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], both of which are associated with the regulation of stress-responsive genes, including ODC. Consequently, this may represent an adaptive cellular attempt to buffer oxidative damage and mitigate the toxic effects of A&#x003b2;. Inhibiting ODC with the irreversible inhibitor DFMO decreased the deleterious effects of A&#x003b2; aggregation, oxidative stress, and in turn apoptosis in mouse hippocampal neurons. Together, these data provide the first evidence of the relationship between PAs and A&#x003b2;-induced toxicity and cell death, which has not been explored previously but is a vital step in understanding the complex mechanisms of dysfunction in the development of AD and may also lead to development of novel treatment avenues. Others have found direct and indirect evidence that elevated A&#x003b2;<sub><italic toggle="yes">42</italic></sub> levels can increase PA concentrations from analyses of rat embryonic hippocampal cells transfected with A&#x003b2;<sub><italic toggle="yes">42</italic></sub>, AD brain tissue, and hair samples from AD patients [<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Our findings here expand previous findings, leading to the conclusion that PAs are upregulated by A&#x003b2;<sub><italic toggle="yes">42</italic></sub> in a dose dependent manner and thatthe amount of A&#x003b2;<sub><italic toggle="yes">42</italic></sub> aggregation is directly correlated to the intracellular concentration of PAs. Indeed, levels of PAs are reported to increase in AD brain tissue [<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Although biogenic PAs can accelerate the rate of fibrillation of A&#x003b2;<sub>42</sub> significantly [<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], the expression of PAs in cell lines transfected with A&#x003b2;<sub><italic toggle="yes">42</italic></sub> had not been explored prior to this study. On the other hand, reduced putrescine and elevated spermine and spermidine levels in temporal cortex of patients with AD have previously been reported [<xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], suggesting a complex relationship between amyloid and PA metabolismThis dysregulation of the PA pathway could be involved not only in amyloid aggregation processes, but also in more fundamental and basic neuronal function such as calcium flux and glutamate homeostasis [<xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>], and had not been examined in the DS-AD or DS brain prior to the present studies to our knowledge</p><p id="P55">Previous work suggests that A&#x003b2;<sub><italic toggle="yes">42</italic></sub> aggregation upregulates PA levels by increasing expression of ODC, the rate-limiting enzyme of the PA biosynthesis pathway, responsible for the conversion of ornithine into putrescine [<xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>,<xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. In addition, ODC has previously been shown to exhibit increased activity in the presence of oxidative stress as well as translocation from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in AD brain tissue [<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. As expected, there was a significant increase in the ODC/actin ratio in cells exposed to increasing levels of A&#x003b2;<sub><italic toggle="yes">42</italic></sub> compared to cells exposed to IRES at the 24-hour timepoint. The ratio of ODC to beta-actin was greater in the A&#x003b2;<sub><italic toggle="yes">42</italic></sub> transfected lysates, allowing us to draw the conclusion that A&#x003b2;<sub><italic toggle="yes">42</italic></sub> increases PA levels by increased expression of ODC. The number of ODC immunoreactive neurons have been found to be increased in AD brains relative to control brains [<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] further providing a link between A&#x003b2;<sub>42</sub> toxicity and ODC expression and supporting our findings presented herein. While previous studies have shown that oxidative stress leads to greater ODC activity [<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], the findings presented in <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> are novel and warrant further investigation into the relationship between A&#x003b2;<sub>42</sub> expression and ODC levels. This upregulation of PAs could be directly linked to the increase in ODC driven by A&#x003b2;-induced cellular stress response [<xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>,<xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>].</p><p id="P56">In addition to the effects of A&#x003b2;<sub>42</sub> on PAs observed <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic>, A&#x003b2;<sub>42</sub> aggregation kinetics were altered <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> by the addition of putrescine (100 &#x003bc;M), strongly suggesting a direct effect of this PA precursor on the aggregation properties of A&#x003b2;<sub>42</sub>. It has been shown earlier that PAs are capable of promoting A&#x003b2; fibrillation via modulation of aggregation pathways and [<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] suggested that this could be due to the fact that the three PAs share a similar binding mode to monomeric A&#x003b2;<sub>42</sub> peptide, leading to the acceleration of the aggregation process of A&#x003b2;<sub>42</sub>. Luo and collaborators suggested that this process was different for each PA, suggesting that very specific targeting molecules may have to be developed to successfully reduce amyloid aggregation via the PA pathway.</p><p id="P57">Having established that A&#x003b2;<sub><italic toggle="yes">42</italic></sub> aggregation increased PA levels in HT22 cells at least partially via increase of ODC, we subsequently investigated whether inhibition of PA synthesis by ODC inhibition would affect A&#x003b2;<sub>42</sub> levels.

The Caviedes group demonstrated that A&#x003b2;<sub>42</sub> overexpression in cortical Ts16 neurons was directly related to cell death [<xref rid="R62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>], confirming the results observed herein. Further, when treated with DFMO, we found a reduction of amyloid fluorescence in the DS-Htk trisomy cell line &#x02013; a cell that naturally over-expresses APP and amyloid [<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="R63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Htk cells displayed a significant decrease in A&#x003b2; aggregation (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). Further, upon treatment with DFMO, there was a significant decrease in PA levels in the Htk cells which was not significantly different from H1b control cells in both putrescine and spermine levels (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5 C</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">E</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest that DFMO treatment could potentially reduce the aggregation of A&#x003b2; peptide in individuals with DS-AD, which could lead to a successful intervention strategy since DFMO has been proposed already as a treatment for other conditions, for example for neuroblastomas [<xref rid="R64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>] or in diabetes to preserve &#x003b2;-cells [<xref rid="R65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>].</p><p id="P59">As reported by others [<xref rid="R66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>], BACE1 levels were significantly increased in DS-AD brain tissue, to a much greater extent than the increase seen in LOAD or EOAD brain tissues (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>). Since BACE1 expression levels are driven by APP levels [<xref rid="R67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>], this is mostly likely because the APP gene is located on the Chr. 21 [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], and highly responsible for the early onset of AD pathology in DS. DFMO substantially reduced BACE1 expression in vitro, pointing to an interaction of the PA pathways also for cleavage of APP. According to our results, PA levels may modulate BACE1 expression through its transcription, potentially offering a mechanism through which PA imbalance could enhance amyloid-&#x003b2; production in DS-AD. This observation aligns with recent studies exploring the role of PAs in neurodegenerative processes, such as the work by Polis et al., 2021, which proposes AD as a chronic maladaptive PA stress response [<xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>].</p><p id="P60">Significant differences were observed in terms of the PA synthetic enzymes between the DS-AD and LOAD or EOAD cases.

Moving forward, research should aim to establish the temporal relationship between PA accumulation and AD progression, clarifying the cellular mechanisms underlying the selective elevation of spermidine and spermine. Investigating these dysregulated PA levels across various brain regions and disease stages may yield insights into their role in AD pathogenesis and a potential development of DFMO for treatment options.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM1"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="SD1" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>1</label><media xlink:href="NIHPP2025.01.31.635912V2-supplement-1.pdf" id="d67e1179" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S46"><title>Acknowledgements:</title><p id="P63">Supported by an R21 from the NIA R21AG070297, R01 AG061566-02, a grant from the Bright Focus Foundation (CA2018010), CONICYT for funding of Basal Centre, CeBiB, FB0001 and P09-022-F from ICM-ECONOMIA (Chile) and ICBM Enlaces at the University of Chile (570266).</p></ack><fn-group><fn id="FN4"><p id="P64"><bold>Consent</bold>: All brain tissues used for this study were obtained via a materials transfer agreement between DU and CU Anschutz.
