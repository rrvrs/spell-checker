We followed a cohort of patients in Zhytomyr, Ukraine for effectiveness, safety, tolerability and feasibility of bedaquiline &#x00026; delamanid-based treatment regimens under programmatic conditions. This was a single-arm implementation study. All consenting persons with RR/MDR-TB were enrolled between 1 April 2019 and 31 May 2021 and followed up 12-months after treatment completion. We assessed quality of life and depression symptoms between start and end-of-treatment. We enrolled 300 patients. Overall, 212 (71%) patients were cured, 22 (7%) patients completed treatment, median time to culture conversion was 58 days (IQR:30&#x02013;75), and 21% and 27% of patients had at least one serious or Grade 3/4 adverse event, respectively. The overall BREF-WHO/Quality of Life score improved between baseline and end-of-treatment, from average 52.64(std. dev:21.63) to 57.15(std. dev:21.43) while Patient Health Questionnaire-9(PHQ-9) score decreased from 6.67(std. dev:4.75) at baseline to 5.34(std. dev: 5.18) at end-of-treatment. Twelve months post-treatment 174/234(74%) were alive and recurrence-free, 17(7%) patients died, one (&#x0003c;1%) had recurrent TB, while 42 (18%) were lost from the post-treatment follow-up. All-oral short-term regimens showed high success under programmatic conditions in Ukraine, despite extreme implementation challenges during the COVID-pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war. Moreover, this was a cohort of patients with high levels of co-morbidities and substance use. A multidisciplinary, psychosocial support model might have contributed to satisfactory treatment outcomes, improved quality of life and decreased symptoms of depression among people living with RR/MDR-TB.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="author-summary"><title>Summary</title><p>We evaluated all-oral regimens for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in Zhytomyr, Ukraine, achieving 78% success, despite high rates of co-infections and substance use.

Although the past decade has seen remarkable promise in the treatment of RR/MDR-TB with effective new and re-purposed drugs being used successfully, global experience with regimens containing these drugs remains limited [<xref rid="pgph.0003983.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>In 2019, while awaiting the completion of several randomized controlled trials aimed at optimizing RR/MDR-TB treatment, the World Health Organization (WHO) called for structured operational research to be carried out by TB programs on the use of all-oral, shorter regimens [<xref rid="pgph.0003983.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The recommendation aimed to promote implementation science, improving access to newer agents&#x02014;including bedaquiline, delamanid, and linezolid&#x02014;while enabling the structured collection of data on the performance of all-oral regimens in real-world conditions, particularly in settings and populations often excluded from formal clinical trials [<xref rid="pgph.0003983.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Such operational research could also afford the opportunity to collect data on other aspects of RR/MDR-TB care&#x02014;including person-centered approaches&#x02014;that might be relevant during programmatic scale-up of newer regimens [<xref rid="pgph.0003983.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>From 2019 to 2022, MSF, along with the National TB Institute and the Ministry of Health in Ukraine, conducted operational research to demonstrate a person-centered model of ambulatory care along with the use of all-oral short-course regimens for RR-TB in Zhytomyr oblast. This study took place during an extremely challenging period marked by national health reform, followed by the COVID-19 pandemic, and the Russia-Ukraine war. Here, we present the treatment outcomes, including 12-month recurrence-free survival, safety, tolerability, and feasibility of using all-oral short-course regimen as part of a comprehensive person-centered model of care.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Study design</title><p>We conducted an uncontrolled, single-arm clinical and feasibility study in the Zhytomyr Oblast of Ukraine. Enrollment of RR/MDR-TB patients commenced on 1 April 2019 and concluded on 31 May 2021. The treatment duration ranged from 9 to 12 months. The participants were monitored until 12 months after the successful completion of the treatment.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Study setting</title><p>The study was conducted in the Zhytomyr oblast of Ukraine. In 2017, the city of Zhytomyr had a tuberculosis prevalence rate of 106.2 cases per 100,000 people, which was higher than the national average of 76.6 cases per 100,000 people. The oblast is served by a regional TB referral hospital located in Zhytomyr. This hospital also coordinated the ambulatory care for patients at outpatient facilities which included health posts, TB-units, ambulatory care facilities, family doctors, and polyclinics, and post-treatment follow-up. The health system for TB care in the oblast is presented elsewhere<sup>7</sup>.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>RR-TB/MDR-TB treatment and monitoring protocol</title><p>Baseline assessments were conducted for all study participants at enrollment. These included bacteriological assessment (Xpert MTB/RIF&#x000ae; assay for all patients, if found RR by Xpert MTB/RIF&#x000ae; assay, Genotype MTBDRplus&#x000ae; MTBDRsl, culture and phenotypic DST), clinical assessment, laboratory assessment (for HIV, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, liver function test, renal function test, etc.), chest radiograph, and an electrocardiogram (ECG).</p><p>As per the national guidelines during the study period, all patients were hospitalized for the entire duration of their TB treatment. However, patients enrolled in this study were discharged to ambulatory care after achieving a smear-negative result. This approach contrasted with the national guidelines, which mandated prolonged hospitalizations. To ensure quality care during the ambulatory phase, the study team conducted an assessment of the outpatient facilities throughout the oblast and in close proximity with the patients&#x02019; residences and provided support to strengthen the care available at these sites [<xref rid="pgph.0003983.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>All patients received a treatment regimen that lasted for a period ranging from 9 to 12 months. All clinical decisions were made by the oblast level RR-TB consilium based out of the regional TB hospital in Zhytomyr. Individuals lacking any evidence of fluoroquinolone resistance were administered bedaquiline (BDQ), linezolid (LZD), levofloxacin (LFX), clofazimine (CFZ), and cycloserine (CS). Individuals with evidence of fluoroquinolone resistance were administered bedaquiline (BDQ), linezolid (LZD), delamanid (DLM), clofazimine (CFZ), and cycloserine (CS).</p><p>The first follow-up assessment occurred two weeks following treatment initiation. This encompassed the evaluation for adverse events and included an ECG for all. Subsequently, monthly follow-ups were conducted until the completion of treatment. The following procedures were conducted: sputum analysis for smear and culture, evaluation of adverse events, laboratory testing, ECG, assessment of adherence, provision of adherence support, and counselling. If a patient had a positive culture at or after three months of treatment, both baseline and follow-up isolates were subjected to phenotypic DST for new and repurposed drugs, including MIC testing if resistance to any new or repurposed drugs was detected.</p><p>The BREF WHO Quality of Life BREF (WHOQoL-BREF) and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) 9 questionnaires were administered at baseline and then at months 3, 6, 9, and 12. HIV viral load testing was conducted at months 6 and 12, and CD4 count was performed at month 12 for those who tested positive for HIV.</p><p>Post-treatment follow-up assessments were conducted until 12 months after the completion of treatment. A nurse contacted the patients via home visits or telephone calls, while during the COVID-19 pandemic and post-war, this communication was mainly telephonic. After three failed attempts to contact a patient within one month, we considered them as post-treatment lost to follow-up.</p><p>An important element of this study was providing extensive and multidisciplinary patient support beyond the national guidelines. This encompassed various activities, such as treatment literacy, intensive adherence support and monitoring, psychosocial support during both hospitalization and ambulatory care, and community involvement (<xref rid="pgph.0003983.box001" ref-type="boxed-text">Box 1</xref>). All patients with alcohol use disorder were provided care by a psychiatrist and psychologist to enable them to continue their treatment. The alcohol use disorder (AUD) care package and its results are presented elsewhere [<xref rid="pgph.0003983.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].

Consequently, all psychological counseling and support sessions were conducted via phone calls. Additionally, nurses incorporated infection control education into their sessions and distributed personal protective equipment (PPE). To minimize contact, only one mobile team member interacted directly with the patient while distributing social support packages. Despite these challenges, all services outlined in the treatment protocol were delivered timely. Upon discharge from the hospital, transportation for patients to their homes using taxis was provided. This measure aimed to prevent patients from exposure to potentially infected individuals in public transportation.</p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>Adaptations to implementation post-war period.</title><p>The onset of the war had a detrimental impact on the ambulatory treatment of TB patients. Public transportation became inaccessible for many, and military checkpoints on roads made it extremely difficult or even impossible for patients to reach medical facilities. Additionally, the closure of stores led to a shortage of essential products and hygiene items for patients. During the war, we continued to provide continuous support through a multidisciplinary team comprising a nurse, social worker, and psychologist. The contents of the monthly food packages provided to patients were increased with an aim to cover 70% of their nutritional needs. The MSF mobile teams also facilitated the transportation of sputum samples to the laboratory and delivered medications to patients in the field.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Study population</title><p>All bacteriologically confirmed RR-TB patients diagnosed during the study period were included.

Time to culture conversion was defined as the time between treatment initiation and the time-point of the specimen collection of the first negative culture.</p><p>Adverse Events were graded on a scale of 1&#x02013;4, with 1 being mild and 4 being life-threatening. The grading followed the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID) grading system and a selection of relevant terms from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) [<xref rid="pgph.0003983.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pgph.0003983.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Serious adverse events (SAE) were defined as any adverse event that resulted in either death, permanent/significant disability or incapacity, hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization to manage the adverse event or was categorized as life-threatening. We used Hy&#x02019;s criteria for liver dysfunction, which includes an ALT and AST of more than three times the upper limits of normal and a total bilirubin of more than two times the upper limit of normal and no other reason can be found to account for these elevations. A permanent change in the treatment regimen was defined as the decision by the consilium to stop one or more medications in the treatment regimen for more than 30 days.</p><p>Hazardous and harmful drinking was defined and measured using the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) followed by evaluation by a psychologist and a psychiatrist [<xref rid="pgph.0003983.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Hazardous and harmful drinking was defined as AUDIT scores of 8&#x02013;13 for females and 8&#x02013;15 for males and &#x0003e;13 for females and &#x0003e;15 for males, respectively. For WHOQoL-BREF and PHQ-9 assessments, the baseline was defined as the first measurement within 30 days before or after treatment initiation. The end of treatment was defined as an assessment 30 days before or after the end of treatment.</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Data collection and analysis</title><p>All patient information was collected using standardized study forms and encoded into EndTB Bahmni&#x000ae;.

For the analysis of time to culture conversion, the outcome of interest was culture conversion achieved at six months of treatment (as a categorical variable). Log-binomial regression analysis was used to explore associations between selected demographic and clinical characteristics and unfavorable outcomes. We included variables with a p-value &#x0003c;0.2 in the initial multivariable model, as well as factors that made sense clinically, even if their p-value was slightly above 0.2.

These successful outcomes were sustained over a 12-month follow-up period after treatment completion. However, there was notable LTFU in the post-treatment period, as well as death and recurrent TB. That these results were achieved during the COVID-19 pandemic and a period of active war in Ukraine, suggests a high functional utility of our approach over a range of program settings.</p><p>The landscape for treating RR/MDR-TB has changed dramatically in the past five years. There are now multiple randomized controlled trials showing the utility of all-oral regimens lasting six to nine months. Some of these studies used regimens with a high pill burden [<xref rid="pgph.0003983.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Others utilized drugs that are not commonly available in programmatic settings, such as pretomanid or delamanid [<xref rid="pgph.0003983.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgph.0003983.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In addition, treatment regimens used in randomized controlled trials tend to perform better than those same regimens used under program conditions and in populations that would normally be excluded from formal trials. Our results are similar to those seen in other cohort studies assessing all-oral shorter regimens for RR/MDR-TB<sup>1</sup> [<xref rid="pgph.0003983.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgph.0003983.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>In addition to the all-oral shorter regimens used in our study, we offered a comprehensive package of patient support services beyond those routinely provided by the national TB program, including counseling, intensive nursing care, management of AUD and other comorbid conditions, and nutritional and social support. Our goal in offering these supporting services was to provide a person-centered experience for the patients being treated [<xref rid="pgph.0003983.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Our study found successful treatment outcomes among patients with AUD, people living with HIV and other comorbid conditions, along with significant improvements in quality of life and depression measures, pointing to the success of our inclusive approach. While much attention has been given to newer drugs and shorter regimens, offering psychosocial and socioeconomic support during RR/MDR-TB is likely to be just as important, especially under program conditions, where high rates of LTFU during treatment are still being reported despite the use of shorter regimens [<xref rid="pgph.0003983.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Given the high rates of substance use and other co-morbidities seen in our cohort, such support may have been even more important [<xref rid="pgph.0003983.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The impact of such support was likely even higher in the times of COVID-19 and the ongoing war with Russia. Our study methodology did not allow for separating the impact of the support package from the drug regimen on treatment success rates, and this is a limitation. We determined, however, that there was value in combining the two approaches from a humanitarian and programmatic point of view.</p><p>Although our operational research project showed high success rates overall, there were some worrisome findings. First, our study continued to show high rates of toxicity, with more than 20% of our patients experiencing a serious adverse event. Although these rates are similar to those reported in other studies, they emphasize the need for regimens that are both safer and better tolerated by people undergoing treatment for RR/MDR-TB. Second, there was a high rate of LTFU in the post-treatment period, where 18% of people with successful treatment outcomes at the end of treatment could not be assessed for long-term outcomes. This may have been due to disruptions in the country due to COVID-19 and the war, but it is possible that these patients may also have developed recurrent TB or died. In fact, when the post-treatment period is considered, only 172 of 300 patients (57.3%) could be confirmed as having treatment success. Most TB programs do not continue to follow patients after they have successfully completed treatment, even though the WHO recommends such follow-up. Our results suggest that investment in such follow-up is needed to determine the long-term impact of RR/MDR-TB treatment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec021"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, we report a high rate of successful treatment outcomes along with an improvement in the quality of life of patients amidst challenging conditions of the COVID-19 pandemic and war in Ukraine through the implementation of a person-centered model of care with all-oral short-course regimen. With the encouraging results from multiple randomized controlled trials with short course regimens it is time to also focus on developing person-centered models of care to deliver these regimens in a manner that, along with achieving successful treatment outcomes, leads to an improvement in the quality of life of people with RR-TB.</p></sec><sec id="sec022" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material id="pgph.0003983.s001" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Type of drugs with permanent change (interruption &#x0003e;30 days) among RR-TB patients in Zhytomyr Oblast, Ukraine, April 2019 &#x02013; March 2022.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pgph.0003983.s001.docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pgph.0003983.s002" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>Reason of permanent drug changes (interruption &#x0003e;30 days) among RR-TB patients in Zhytomyr Oblast, Ukraine, April 2019 &#x02013; March 2022.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pgph.0003983.s002.docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pgph.0003983.s003" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S3 Table</label><caption><title>Outcome of patients with at least one permanent change on their regimen (interruption &#x0003e;30 days) among RR-TB patients in Zhytomyr Oblast, Ukraine, April 2019 &#x02013; March 2022.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pgph.0003983.s003.docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pgph.0003983.s004" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S1 Checklist</label><caption><title>Inclusivity in global research.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pgph.0003983.s004.docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pgph.0003983.s005" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>STROBE Checklist.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pgph.0003983.s005.docx"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pgph.0003983.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book">Global Tuberculosis Report 2023. <publisher-name>World Health Organization</publisher-name>; <year>2023</year>.

(Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)</p><p>Reviewer #1:&#x000a0;Overall, this is a well conducted observational study assessing person level outcomes for the treatment of MDR/RR-TB using oral, short treatment regimens. Given the difficult context in which the study was conducted, these data are important to demonstrate how such treatment can be provided and good outcomes achieved. The study is therefore relevant to a wide reader audience.</p><p>Major comment:</p><p>The manuscript would be greatly improved by following STROBE guidance for presentation of observational studies; see <ext-link xlink:href="https://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/strobe/" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/strobe/</ext-link> This would include clearer presentation of the baseline characteristics of the study cohort and a flow diagram describing eligibility, inclusion and exclusion for the study.</p><p>Other comments:</p><p>&#x02022; Lines 108-109: there is mention of treatment education, but a much more detailed description is given later &#x02013; perhaps to exclude here?</p><p>&#x02022; Lines 110-112: the section describing the provision of ambulatory care as different from national policy could be clarified.</p><p>&#x02022; Line 147: how was adherence assessed?</p><p>&#x02022; Define acronyms at first use, eg. PWID</p><p>&#x02022; Box 1: How was the community engaged to provide support to patients and families?</p><p>&#x02022; Under results, there appear to be 2 sections titled &#x0201c;end of treatment outcomes&#x0201d;.</p><p>&#x02022; Please revise language to refer to &#x02018;treatment failure&#x0201d; rather than &#x0201c;failed&#x0201d;, which implies that the individuals themselves have failed in some way.</p><p>&#x02022; Were any post-treatment outcomes available for people who had treatment outcomes of &#x0201c;treatment failure&#x0201d; or LTFU? I see this is described in the discussion, but could be presented in the results.</p><p>&#x02022; For table 5, please add a description of each scenario to the table legend.</p><p>&#x02022; For the time to culture conversion analysis, was it not possible to censor for death and LTFU? Rather than exclude these patients completely? Additionally, you report time to culture conversion by alcohol use, but no other factors; were any other relevant factors significant? Eg. extent of drug resistance or previous TB treatment?</p><p>&#x02022; Perhaps to clarify why pregnancy during treatment might be considered an adverse event?</p><p>&#x02022; The methods mention deep sequencing, but no data pertaining to this is presented. What was the purpose of deep sequencing of TB isolates?</p><p>&#x02022; To clarify that the majority of patients would have completed treatment by the time of the Russian invasion of Ukraine in Feb 2022 &#x02013; does this mean that the modified treatment provisions were perhaps only relevant for the post-treatment period for most patients?</p><p>Reviewer #2:&#x000a0;General Comments:</p><p>The treatment of rifampin-resistant TB (RR-TB) has changed dramatically over the past 10 years&#x02014;most notably with the change from 18-24 month injectable-based regimens to 6-9 month all-oral regimens incorporating new and repurposed medications. Many prior cohort studies have reported RR-TB treatment outcomes from a variety of programmatic settings around the world. Context is often key, however, when interpreting and comparing results from different countries as some settings lack access to newer diagnostics or medications, while others may partner with NGOs to provide additional patient-centered support.</p><p>In this manuscript, authors from Medecins Sans Frontieres report their experience supporting an RR-TB program in Ukraine over a time period spanning both the emergence of the COVID pandemic and the start of the war with Russia.</p><p>Clearly, the real-life challenges to providing (and completing) RR-TB care in this setting are vast, yet the authors demonstrate that they were able to achieve startlingly favorable end-of-treatment outcomes. The paper is very well-written and clear (though there are a number of typographical and formatting errors). Importantly, the authors emphasize not only the mechanics of providing treatment, but also of supporting patients socially to ensure treatment completion. Participants were administered quality-of-life questionnaires. Of particular value is that the authors also captured post-treatment outcomes 12-months after treatment completion. They note high rates of LTFU in this post-treatment period and raise the possibility that relapse/death could be much higher in the long-term, even if end-of-treatment outcomes were favorable. The data are a valuable contribution to the literature and should serve as a model to others trying to set up or maintain RR-TB services in conflict-areas.</p><p>Specific Comments:</p><p>ABSTRACT</p><p>1) Line 47, Results: Suggest delete the word &#x0201c;and.&#x0201d;</p><p>INTRODUCTION</p><p>1) Why are dates of enrollment are highlighted throughout the manuscript?</p><p>2) Line 98: &#x0201c;prevalence&#x02026;&#x0201d; Suspect that the authors mean &#x0201c;incidence&#x0201d; here.</p><p>3) Line 100: Would consider using a word other than &#x0201c;Dispensary.&#x0201d; Although this is what they are called in Ukraine, the term &#x0201c;dispensary&#x0201d; in the rest of the world more often refers to a pharmacy. Could say &#x0201c;TB referral hospital&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;TB specialist hospital/center&#x0201d; instead.</p><p>4) Line 100: &#x0201c;The dispensary also coordinated the ambulatory care&#x02026;&#x0201d; How so? Do patients go there for outpatient care or does the dispensary arrange for patients to be seen at some decentralized clinic instead?</p><p>5) Line 114: &#x0201c;&#x02026;outpatient facilities&#x02026;&#x0201d; See comment above. How close are these facilities? Are they spread out over a wide geographic area? Close to patients&#x02019; homes?</p><p>METHODS</p><p>1) No methods are provided for the logistic regression presented in the Results. How were covariates selected for the multivariable model?</p><p>RESULTS</p><p>1) Line 244: &#x0201c;End&#x02026;&#x0201d; is not bolded while the rest of the heading is.</p><p>2) Line 247: &#x0201c;(Table &#x00026; 3)&#x0201d;: Typo</p><p>3) Lines 250-1: The placement of the percentages and p-values in the sentences is confusing.</p><p>4) Lines 255-6: &#x0201c;Of our patients, 233 (78%) were male, had a median age of 45 years&#x02026;&#x0201d; Grammatical error. Would rephrase.</p><p>5) Line 258: Would avoid the non-person-centered term &#x0201c;smoker&#x0201d; (suggest &#x0201c;smoked cigarettes&#x0201d;).</p><p>6) Line 260: &#x0201c;Error! (Reference source not found)&#x0201d;&#x02014;Likely typographical error.</p><p>7) Line 261-269: This paragraph appears to have been completely duplicated ( lines 244-252)</p><p>8) Line numbers start again from 1 halfway through the RESULTS.</p><p>9) Second line 4: Suggest &#x0201c;&#x02026;with a median time to death of 7.9 months&#x02026;&#x0201d;</p><p>10) Second lines 34-6: &#x0201c;&#x02026;45 died or were LTFU before six months and were excluded from the 6-month culture-conversion analysis.&#x0201d; There are many different philosophies about the best approach in the longitudinal analysis of culture conversion. Excluding those who die or who are LTFU clearly introduces a survival bias to even be eligible for the analysis. One could argue that Death prior to culture conversion is, itself, strongly associated with NOT converting. That said, not everyone who is LTFU necessary fails to convert (just as not everyone who dies does so from TB) so including them in the analysis may negatively skew the results. Regardless, however, the authors should simply provide a clear justification of their approach and explain why their approach will minimize certain biases while acknowledging that it may introduce others.</p><p>11) Second line 49: Would suggest providing the number of participants as well as the total number of AEs.</p><p>12) Second Line 52: &#x0201c;experience&#x0201d; should be &#x0201c;experienced.&#x0201d;</p><p>13) Second Line 53: &#x0201c;The full list of&#x02026;&#x0201d; Sentence appears to have been truncated erroneously.</p><p>14) Second Line 54: &#x0201c;Table.&#x0201d; (Is there a table missing? Not numbered. Typo?)</p><p>DISCUSSION</p><p>1) Second line 117: Suspect that the authors mean &#x0201c;serious&#x0201d; rather than &#x0201c;severe.&#x0201d;</p><p>TABLES/FIGURES/BOXES</p><p>Box 1:</p><p>1) The verb tense varies in the &#x0201c;expected outcomes&#x0201d; column (e.g., &#x0201c;Patients realize&#x02026;.&#x0201d; vs. &#x0201c;Patients learned&#x02026;.&#x0201d; vs. &#x0201c;Family members understand&#x02026;.&#x0201d; Would encourage consistent use of one tense (probably present or future if this an &#x0201c;expected&#x0201d; rather than observed outcome).</p><p>2) Define abbreviations in the Box (AUD, SUD, VOT, SAT, etc).</p><p>3) In the last section (&#x0201c;Community Support&#x0201d;), part of &#x0201c;Involving communities&#x0201d; is bolded in error.</p><p>Table 1</p><p>4) See earlier comment about the term &#x0201c;smoker.&#x0201d;</p><p>Table 2</p><p>5) The number 6 in the footnotes should be a superscript.</p><p>Table 6</p><p>6) How were characteristics selected for inclusion in the multivariable analysis? Three of the four included covariates had a p-value &#x0003e;0.1 even in bivariate analysis.</p><p>Table 7</p><p>7) Second line 60: Footnote 2: Suggest deleting the word &#x0201c;which.&#x0201d;</p><p>8) Second line 62: Suggest deleting the first clause and beginning with &#x0201c;Defined as the decision&#x02026;&#x0201d;</p><p>9) In this table it says that 79 participants had a permanent change in regimen due to AEs, but in supplemental table S2 this number is only 13.</p><p>Table 8</p><p>10) Footnotes are not provided for 1-5?</p><p>Supplementary Table S1</p><p>11) Although mention is made in the Methods about &#x0201c;Permanent changes.,&#x0201d; the supplementary tables are not referenced anywhere in the main text.</p><p>12) Hard to interpret this table without knowing how many patients got each drug. It looks as though levofloxacin is very poorly tolerated. It might be more helpful if Tables S1 and S2 were combined so that one could see WHY each drug was stopped (I suspect that levofloxacin was stopped for resistance, while clofazimine was stopped for side effects).</p><p>13) What is the denominator for this table? Participants? Why only 95?</p><p>**********</p><p>6.
