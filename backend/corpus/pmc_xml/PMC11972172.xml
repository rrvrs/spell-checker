Central to this inquiry lies a longstanding yet unresolved question: Do languages inhabit shared or distinct neural territories? This debate has spurred extensive research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], yielding mixed findings. Some studies show significant L1-L2 overlap [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], suggesting a common neural landscape, while others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] identify discrete brain regions dedicated to each language. Recently, intraoperative electrical stimulation mapping (ESM) during awake brain surgeries has proven effective for localizing language areas in bilingual patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. However, infiltrating lesions (e.g., brain tumors) often induce functional reorganization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], complicating efforts to pinpoint the &#x0201c;putative&#x0201d; neural signatures of L1 and L2.</p><p id="Par3">Here, we examined language representation in two highly proficient Basque-Spanish bilinguals, with similar multilingual exposure and daily language-switching. Both harbored small benign left temporal lobe lesions. Unlike prior ESM studies involving bilinguals with infiltrating brain tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], our patients had &#x0201c;neurotypical&#x0201d; brains, free from tumor-driven reorganization. This unique opportunity allowed us to examine L1 and L2 production in early (&#x0003c; 3&#x000a0;years) bilinguals who used both languages interchangeably. Despite lesion location differences, surgical resection followed a similar approach, revealing overlapping regions of functional stimulation alongside the temporal lobe. By combining a bilingual picture-naming task with online ESM, we functionally mapped cortico-subcortical language pillars across L1 and L2, identifying structure-to-function relationships in neural tissue unaffected by adaptive plasticity.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Clinical cases</title><p id="Par4">The study involved two highly proficient, right-handed individuals fluent in both Basque and Spanish, actively contributing to professional roles in a multilingual environment.

ESM targeting the left STG&#x02014;a key region involved in control monitoring during speech production&#x02014;elicited selective aphasia-like symptoms in either L1 or L2, experimentally validating clinical instances of this condition. Conversely, stimulation of the left MTG and the IFOF&#x02014;primarily involved in lexical-semantic processing&#x02014;revealed common language sites. Although anomia was the most frequent error, we also found a functional anterior&#x02013;posterior dissociation: posterior stimulation produced semantic paraphasias, whereas anterior stimulation caused dysarthria. These findings are discussed in detail below.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn1">1</xref></p><sec id="Sec10"><title>Evidence for language-specific microcircuits within the left STG</title><p id="Par12">Since Wernicke&#x02019;s seminal work in 1974, the left STG has been recognized as central to speech perception and production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In our study, ESM over the left STG resulted in aphasic-like symptoms (i.e., word-retrieval difficulties) during a sentence completion task requiring overt picture naming. This aligns with evidence from aphasic patients linking anomia to atrophy in both anterior and posterior segments of the left STG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Likewise, previous ESM studies in tumor patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], show that anomia can be elicited via stimulation of the left STG, reinforcing its critical role in speech production. A key finding, however, was the localization of distinct sites for L1 and L2 errors within the STG. Contrary to accounts of overlapping L1&#x02013;L2 representation in highly proficient individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], our results provide direct ESM evidence of language-specific effects. This suggests that, even in early, highly proficient bilinguals, the network supporting language production exhibits language-dependent variations at the microcircuit level in the left STG (see Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>). Further, it underscores how MRI, though invaluable for mapping broad neural networks, may miss fine-grained functional organization within language areas (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] for evidence supporting the microcellular arrangement of the STG).</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Evidence for overlapping L1 and L2 representation along the left MTG</title><p id="Par13">Two positive-stimulation clusters emerged along the left MTG, where ESM triggered transient anomia with no language specificity. Interestingly, a recent meta-analysis of lesion-symptom mapping studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] highlights this region's critical involvement in the early stage of word production, namely during lexico-semantic retrieval. Furthermore, evidence shows that, even after controlling for visual and motor-speech deficits in chronic stroke patients, only the left mid-posterior MTG and its adjacent white matter area were significantly linked to performance in picture naming [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Additionally, our findings in the left MTG mirrored the gradient observed along the STG, with posterior MTG stimulation producing semantic paraphasias and anterior stimulation resulting in dysarthria. While posterior MTG are involved in lexico-semantic aspects of word retrieval, more anterior regions contribute to sentence-level processing and integrating lexico-semantic and grammatical information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Given that our sentence-completion task required number and gender agreement, disrupting this combinatorial process likely explains the observed effects. Overall, these findings underscore the left MTG&#x02019;s pivotal role in integrating and producing fluent speech, irrespective of the language in use.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par14">These findings highlight the coexistence of shared and distinct regions for language production, depending on the linguistic processes engaged. Clinically, this underscores the importance of personalized care that accounts for both linguistic and neural uniqueness. Understanding bilingual brain organization, both pre- and intraoperatively, is crucial for fully preserving all spoken languages.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.<supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM1"><media xlink:href="701_2025_6508_MOESM1_ESM.docx"><caption><p>Supplementary file1 (DOCX 477 KB)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="Fn1"><label>1</label><p id="Par19">See also the Supplementary Material for additional considerations.</p></fn><fn><p>Manuel Carreiras head of the research group.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Highlights</bold></p><p> 1.
