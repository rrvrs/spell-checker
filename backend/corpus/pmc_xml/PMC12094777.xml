</self-uri><abstract><p>We conducted a systematic review to examine whether changes in social determinants can contribute to the prevention of depression, in order to provide input for policy development and to highlight research gaps. Social determinants were defined as the structural conditions in which people live that shape their health and were categorized according to whether they pertained to societal arrangements, material resources distributed through these arrangements, or social resources that follow from interactions between people. To capture all relevant evidence we included studies that measured depressive disorders, depressive symptoms, psychological distress, mental health and prescription rates of antidepressants. We searched three databases (Medline, Embase and Psychinfo) from their inception till December 2022 and supplemented our search by reference and citation searching of the included studies. Studies were synthesized qualitatively and we used the Validity Assessment tool for econometric studies to assess study quality. Prospero submission number CRD42021236132 A total of 31,103 titles were identified, 135 studies met our inclusion criteria. The majority of studies were conducted in the United States (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;45) or the United Kingdom (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;39). Studies used longitudinal data (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;61); repeated cross-sectional data (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;20); or evaluated an intervention study (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;7). Study designs included natural experiments (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;19), while some used propensity score matching to construct a quasi-experiment (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;11). Analysis methods included difference-in-difference approaches (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;30) or regression analysis in varying forms. We found evidence that strategies that promote paid employment and parental leave policies can reduce risk of depression whereas reduced entitlements to social welfare (particularly when accompanied by obligations to enter employment), loss of income, instability of housing and collective insecurity increase depression risk. A number of studies examined moderation by gender, age category or ethnicity and of these gender was the most commonly observed moderator. Few studies tested underlying causal mechanisms with formal mediation analyses. These studies provide important indications of how intervening on social determinants of health can shape risk for depression. However, the included studies do not fully capture the complexity of the relationships between determinants and the mechanisms driving them. Future studies could take this into account, for instance by using systems approaches.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The author(s) received no specific funding for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="1"/><table-count count="4"/><page-count count="54"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All relevant data are within the article and its <xref rid="sec047" ref-type="sec">supporting information</xref> files.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All relevant data are within the article and its <xref rid="sec047" ref-type="sec">supporting information</xref> files.</p></notes></front><body><sec id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Globally, depression is one of the leading causes of burden of disease worldwide (ranked 13<sup>th</sup> among all illnesses) with 279.6 million people living with depression in 2019. [<xref rid="pone.0323378.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In high-income countries, prevention interventions have mainly focused on the screening, identification and treatment of those at high-risk of developing depression across the life course, particularly in children and young people, young mothers, people of working age and older people [<xref rid="pone.0323378.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323378.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Prior research indicates that selective and indicated prevention interventions are important in reducing depressive symptoms in young adults [<xref rid="pone.0323378.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and in preventing the incidence of a (new) depressive episode in the population in general [<xref rid="pone.0323378.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Although such interventions can have an impact, a recent meta-analysis showed that incidence was only reduced by 20%, leaving 80% unaccounted for [<xref rid="pone.0323378.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. One reason for this may be that interventions target individual-level behaviours, cognitions and strategies, while the social and economic drivers of depression are rarely targeted.</p><p>There is increased acknowledgement of the role of social determinants of health in depression [<xref rid="pone.0323378.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323378.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Social determinants of health are defined as &#x0201c;non-medical factors affecting health outcomes&#x02026;the conditions in which people are born, grow, work, live and age and the wider set of forces and systems shaping the conditions of daily life&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pone.0323378.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. These include factors such as the built environment (e.g., blue/green space) [<xref rid="pone.0323378.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], institutional structures (e.g., policy, healthcare services) [<xref rid="pone.0323378.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323378.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], and social conditions (e.g., social cohesion, neighbourhood crime) [<xref rid="pone.0323378.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323378.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The importance of the impact of social determinants is evidenced by the inequalities in depression rates between population sub-groups, i.e., the prevalence of depression is often higher in groups such as ethnic minorities and groups with a low socioeconomic status or with high deprivation, in which exposure to unfavourable social conditions is higher [<xref rid="pone.0323378.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0323378.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>The evidence-base for the role and impact of social determinants on mental health outcomes, including depression is growing [<xref rid="pone.0323378.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323378.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323378.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0323378.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. However, in existing studies it is often not clear whether a <italic toggle="yes">change</italic> in exposure to social determinants will also lead to a <italic toggle="yes">lower risk</italic> of depression. Establishing causality is fraught with difficulty and the increased application of counterfactual methodologies to this field has helped to clarify causality [<xref rid="pone.0323378.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. While there have been reviews of the evidence for changes in mental health and depression in relation to changes in income [<xref rid="pone.0323378.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and social security eligibility [<xref rid="pone.0323378.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], an overview of the impact of a broad range of social determinants is missing. This is necessary to establish which types of (policy) interventions have the potential to improve population mental health, in particular depression, as well as to inform policy makers on possible adverse mental health effects of certain policies.</p><p>The aim of this review is to examine whether change in a diverse set of social determinants can contribute to depression prevention. The results will provide insights for policy development and highlight research gaps.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><p>We conducted a systematic review to identify social determinants for which there is evidence for an impact on the risk of depression or depressive symptoms following changes in those determinants.

Three bibliographic databases were examined; Medline (including MeSH terms), Embase, and PsycINFO. The database searches were supplemented by reference and citation searching of the included studies and previously published reviews on similar topics. Search terms included three major concepts comprising a range of social determinants such as natural, structural and social environments, social and economic policy domains such as social welfare, housing, employment; outcomes (mental health and&#x000a0;well-being, depression), and methods (quantitative).

An extraction table was developed to contain general information and study characteristics (author, year of publication, country, study design, sample size), population characteristics (gender, age, ethnicity), outcome measure as described by the authors (e.g., mental health; psychological distress; depressive symptoms; depression; etc), type of social determinant studied (income, social cohesion etc.).

As stated in our registered protocol, we originally planned to use the Dahlgren and Whitehead model of social determinants of health [<xref rid="pone.0323378.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] as a framework to classify identified determinants at the individual, community, or societal level; however in practice it was difficult to apply this framework. For example, the introduction of a minimum wage can be categorised as a societal-level intervention but has an impact on individual-level income in those to whom it applies [<xref rid="pone.0323378.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. We therefore grouped studies based on the&#x000a0;aforementioned&#x000a0;categorisation building on Hahn [<xref rid="pone.0323378.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]: societal arrangements; material resources; and social resources.</p><p>Outcomes were considered as statistically significant if they were below the conventional p-value cut-off of 0.05.

However, both tools were inappropriate due to their focus on traditional study methods. We used the Validity Assessment tool for econometric studies by Barr et al. [<xref rid="pone.0323378.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], a tool developed for econometric studies, which better suited the studies included in this review. The Validity Assessment includes nine component rating sections (unit of analysis; comparison approach; sample selection; number of time points of data; response bias; exogeneity of policy exposure, confounding, sample size/power and statistical methods). Overall scores ranged from 0 to 27. Consistent with Simpson et al [<xref rid="pone.0323378.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], we considered studies scoring 18 or higher as high quality.

Strengths included use of random population samples, inclusion of multiple covariates in models, large sample sizes and appropriate analyses; specifically, recent studies (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;33) were more likely to employ a difference-in-difference analysis strategy. The most common weaknesses were the limited number of data-points included in the analysis, with most studies including two time points; high risk of bias through low response rates; 31 studies scored low (1 out of possible 3 points) on the &#x02018;exogeneity of policy measure&#x02019; component of the instrument used.</p><p>The majority of studies (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;126) used questionnaires to operationalise outcomes. Mental health and psychological distress were measured using the SF-12/36/MHI-5 (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;16), GHQ (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;23), the K-6/K10 (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;12). Depressive symptoms were measured mostly using the CES-D (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;26). Other instruments used include the Beck Depression Inventory and the Hopkins Symptom Checklist. Eight studies used short (&#x0003c;12 items) non-validated questions/questionnaires, e.g., mental health questions as part of a broader population heath survey. Only eight studies (nine reports) used a diagnostic clinical interview for depression. Finally, four studies analysed records of antidepressant prescriptions and seven studies used treatment claims or hospital admission data.</p><p>Results are classified in <xref rid="pone.0323378.t001 pone.0323378.t002 pone.0323378.t003" ref-type="table">Tables 1&#x02013;3</xref> according to a single social determinant, although some studies analysed several determinants, which is reflected by those studies being mentioned more than once in <xref rid="pone.0323378.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. </p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>Study findings: Societal arrangements</title><p>Included studies were sub-divided into welfare reform policies, minimum wage policies, educational policies, public transportation policies and environmental interventions, and are shown in <xref rid="pone.0323378.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="pone.0323378.t001"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0323378.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Studies addressing societal arrangements.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="pone.0323378.t001" id="pone.0323378.t001g" position="float"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Reference<break/>&#x00026; country</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Intervention</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Target population, sample size</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Study design</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Analysis</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Data source</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Outcome and measure</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Results</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Sub-group analysis (moderation)</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mechanisms<break/>(mediation)</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">QA</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" colspan="11" rowspan="1">

The EITC, implemented in 1975, was designed as a refundable tax credit to offset the rise in payroll, increasing household income. A study by Boyd-Swan et al. [<xref rid="pone.0323378.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] among mothers suggests that expanding eligibility in the EITC in 1990 reduced depressive symptoms but only in married mothers. Shields-Zeeman et al. [<xref rid="pone.0323378.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] leveraged variation in the size of the EITC to study the impact of changes in income and found a 2&#x02013;3% of a standard deviation decrease in psychological distress per US$1000 increase in income. Two other studies found no effects of EITC payments and other income policies (including the Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) and Minimum wage policies) on psychological distress or depression risk in the short term [<xref rid="pone.0323378.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323378.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec014"><title>Minimum wage policies.</title><p>A UK study by Reeves et al [<xref rid="pone.0323378.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] evaluated the effect of introduction of the National Minimum Wage legislation in 1999 and found lower probability of psychological distress among recipients compared to similar persons who were not covered under the conditions of the new legislation. Another UK study by Kronenberg et al [<xref rid="pone.0323378.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] of the same policy and using the same data source however did not observe an association. The difference in findings between the two studies maybe due to difference in construction of treatment and control groups as well as in the way wages were measured. A third UK study, by Maxwell et al [<xref rid="pone.0323378.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] studied increase in minimum wage phased in over three years (2016, 2017 and 2018) and found no association with mental health. In a US study, Buszkiewicz et al [<xref rid="pone.0323378.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] used state-level variation in minimum wage legislation to evaluate the association with psychological distress but found no association in the population as a whole, or on the basis of gender, age, race/ethnicity (non-white/Hispanic or white), employment status.</p></sec><sec id="sec015"><title>Expanding access to health insurance.</title><p>In 2008, the US state of Oregon opened a waiting list for a limited number of spots in its Medicaid program for low-income adults. This took the form of a lottery among the people who signed up. Finkelstein et al. [<xref rid="pone.0323378.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] showed that in the first year after the lottery, winners had 10% higher probability of screening negative for depressive symptoms relative to the control group. More recently, in the context of the covid-19 pandemic, a US study by Mukhopadhyay compared data from states that expanded Medicaid entitlements with states that did not introduce such legislation. They included persons who had lost employment during the pandemic and found that those living in Medicaid expansion states were less likely to have moderate to severe mental distress following their job loss compared to those living in non-expansion states [<xref rid="pone.0323378.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Another US study examined the effect of the Affordable care act (2014) on eligible women.

[<xref rid="pone.0323378.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] showed that a series of welfare reforms introduced in 1999 in the UK (including in-work tax credits and welfare-to-work programmes) was associated with a decrease in psychological distress among single mothers but not in the two control groups (married and single women). Explanatory analysis indicated that the difference in trends was accounted for by markers of longer-term financial deprivation rather than employment. Harkness examined the same UK welfare reforms but restricted the categorisation of single mothers to those that had been single for more than a year in order to account for &#x02018;transition effects&#x02019; on mental health in newly single mothers. Results indicate that being in work was associated with a significant, 12.1% reduction in psychological distress among single mothers while the effects for married mothers were not statistically significant. Overall, working lone mothers had no greater risk of psychological distress than partnered mothers [<xref rid="pone.0323378.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. In another UK study, Barr et al [<xref rid="pone.0323378.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] found that reforms that re-evaluated eligibility of out-of-work disability welfare benefits (implemented in 2010) were associated with higher anti-depressant prescriptions and higher self-reported depression at the regional level. Analysing the impact of the same reform but using individual-level data Curnock et al [<xref rid="pone.0323378.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], showed that transitioning from receiving disability benefits into either paid work or to &#x02018;unemployment status&#x02019; was associated with improvement in overall mental health: scores on the SF-12 increased by 5.9 points and 3.1 points respectively.</p><p>Katikireddi et al [<xref rid="pone.0323378.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] examined the impact of the &#x02018;Lone Parent Obligation&#x02019; (LPO) reform which entailed reducing income support and mandated seeking work for welfare once women&#x02019;s youngest child reached a threshold age. They found lower mental health scores in parents obliged to seek work compared with the group not exposed to reform (i.e., whose children were younger than the threshold age).</p><p>Wickham et al. [<xref rid="pone.0323378.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] investigated the impact of Universal Credit reform, which was intended to provide greater incentives for claimants to enter employment. The results indicated higher psychological distress and poorer mental health in those eligible for Universal Credit after implementation of the reform. Williams [<xref rid="pone.0323378.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323378.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] also examined the mental health impacts of restrictions on unemployment benefit (Job Seekers Allowance), in the form of benefit sanctions, implemented between 2010 and 2012. The results indicated that for every 10 additional sanctions applied per 100,000 population the rate of antidepressant prescriptions was 1.74 items higher (2019 study). Analyses in a larger number of districts showed higher rates of self-reported anxiety and depression (2021 study). For both outcome measures (antidepressants prescriptions, self-reported depression), a further increase was observed after the sanction policies became more severe (from end of 2012): every 10 additional sanctions applied per 100,000 population were associated with 4.57 additional antidepressants prescribing items (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001).</p><p>We included three US studies on welfare reforms that aimed to move single mothers from welfare to work. Jagannathan et al. [<xref rid="pone.0323378.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] studied the New Jersey Family Development experiment, showing that women in the intervention, which stressed welfare-to-work experienced higher odds of clinical depression (based on Medicaid claims) compared to controls that continued to receive traditional welfare benefits. Rote et al [<xref rid="pone.0323378.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] studied the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (PRWORA) which requires mothers to work in return for assistance and limits total federal lifetime TANF eligibility to 60 months. After reform, welfare recipients reported significantly more depressive symptoms than other women living in poverty when compared to the period before reform. Morris [<xref rid="pone.0323378.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] also examined health impacts of the PRWORA by focussing on whether emphasis on quick job entry and/or personal attention in making the transition to employment made a difference in depressive symptoms. Clients of programs in the highest quartile of emphasis on quick job entry, particularly those with preschool children, experienced higher depressive symptoms based on CES-D score, when compared to the control group (clients not subject to changes in welfare package). Personalised support by caseworkers had no effect on depressive symptoms.</p></sec><sec id="sec017"><title>Parental leave policies.</title><p>We found nine studies that examined the impact of parental leave policies, all published in the past eight years. Most studies leveraged changes in maternal or family leave policies as a natural experiment.</p><p>We included four studies from the US. In a longitudinal study among 72 couples expecting their first child, Cardenas et al. [<xref rid="pone.0323378.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] found that mothers whose partners took paid paternity leave had smaller prenatal-to-postpartum increases in depressive symptoms, whereas no difference was observed in the fathers themselves. Three studies examined the impact of implementation of paid family leave policy in California, which was the first US state to implement such a policy, in 2004. In a difference-in-difference analysis, all three studies [<xref rid="pone.0323378.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0323378.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] showed reduced psychological distress levels after the implementation of that policy, both among mothers and fathers.</p><p>Australia adopted a national paid parental leave policy in 2011.

In addition, Bilgrami et al. [<xref rid="pone.0323378.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] showed that the impact on mental health was larger among those mothers whose partners had access to a complementary policy specifically for partners.</p><p>The three European studies showed similar results. Avendano et al. [<xref rid="pone.0323378.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>] used data from the SHARE study, a panel survey of a representative sample of the European population aged 50&#x02009;+&#x02009;, finding that paid maternity leave in seven European countries was associated with lower depressive symptoms in older age. The other two studies were designed as natural experiments, and studied the impact of policy changes in Norway and Denmark [<xref rid="pone.0323378.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323378.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. In Norway, a national paid maternity leave arrangement was implemented in 1977 and B&#x000fc;tikofer et al [<xref rid="pone.0323378.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>] found improved maternal mental health after the introduction of this policy. On the basis of complementary research on explanatory variables, the authors suggest that improvements were mainly driven by the mother spending more time at home after childbirth [<xref rid="pone.0323378.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. A Danish study on the impact policy reform that increased in the length of maternity leave (from 24 to 46 weeks of fully compensated leave) did not show a reduction in hospitalisation due to depression or use of anti-depressant medication among mothers [<xref rid="pone.0323378.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec018"><title>Pension policies.</title><p>We found two studies that examined the impact of increasing pension age. In the Netherlands, de Grip et al. [<xref rid="pone.0323378.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>] found that a 2006 reform that increased pension age from 62 years and three months to 63 years and four months had a sizable impact on depressive symptoms: two years after the policy change high depressive symptoms were about 40% higher in participants exposed to the reform as compared to those not exposed. This was particularly so in participants that experienced a larger income loss because of the reform. In a UK study among women Carrino et al. [<xref rid="pone.0323378.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>] found that a reform that gradually increased the State Pension Age from 60 to 66 years within a short time-frame (10 years) led to an increased the likelihood of psychological distress and poor mental health. This effect was confined to women in jobs with high demands and low control.</p><p>In a Korean study, Kim et al. [<xref rid="pone.0323378.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>] examined the introduction of a Basic Old-Age Pension (BOP) in 2008, which provided a fixed pension for older persons in the lowest income category considering household income and assets. The association between receiving the BOP and depressive symptoms was not statistically significant, however, the authors reported that although the BOP improved income, it was not substantial enough to resolve poverty or relative deprivation, which may explain the lack of effect observed.</p></sec><sec id="sec019"><title>Housing benefits.</title><p>A UK study by Reeves et al.

[<xref rid="pone.0323378.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>] examined the impact of the introduction of free bus passes to adults aged 60 years and older. Results showed that public transportation use increased after introduction of the policy and the policy was associated with a reduction of depressive symptoms. Based on the results on the association between transport use and possible explanatory factors the authors suggest that the benefits may stem from reduced loneliness, increased participation in volunteering activities and increased contact with children and friends.</p></sec><sec id="sec022"><title>Educational policies.</title><p>We found only one study that examined the impact of years of education on depressive symptoms. Hamad et al. [<xref rid="pone.0323378.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>] took advantage of variation in United States state-level compulsory schooling laws, a natural experiment that was associated with geographic and temporal differences in the minimum number of years that children were required to attend school.

We present the main findings according to our categorisation of whether interventions addressed societal arrangements, material resources distributed through these arrangements, and social resources that follow from interactions between people.

Most studies examined <italic toggle="yes">restriction</italic> of entitlements to social welfare and found that restriction of entitlements was associated with increased risk of depression. This finding is largely consistent with another recent review [<xref rid="pone.0323378.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, some studies reported that reforms in work incentives and employment also resulted in a <italic toggle="yes">reduction</italic> in depression risk. In the latter group of studies, changes in entitlements were accompanied by a wider package of incentives such as tax credits [<xref rid="pone.0323378.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] or transitioning to another category of entitlement [<xref rid="pone.0323378.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. The studies on expansions of welfare entitlements, such as tax credit policies, showed either reduction in risk of depression or no effect (in the short-term). In this category and consistent with a recent review by Heshmati et al, paid parental leave policies most convincingly showed a positive effect, in particular among mothers [<xref rid="pone.0323378.ref166" ref-type="bibr">166</xref>].

Becoming unemployed, for example, was related to increased risk of depression and was observed by studies in the US, Norway, Netherlands, Canada, UK, Spain and New Zealand, Sweden, South Korea, Japan, France, Belgium, Germany, Finland and Australia. Study quality was mixed, of the 28 studies related to employment, 11 scored less than 20 and of these five scored less than 18 points. Thus our findings regarding employment may be biased, although they were similar to those of previous reviews and meta-analyses [<xref rid="pone.0323378.ref167" ref-type="bibr">167</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323378.ref168" ref-type="bibr">168</xref>]. The association between employment and risk of depression was consistent over time but may have changed in recent years due to changes in the labour market. For example, an ageing workforce, technological advancements, and economic shocks such as the global pandemic as well as the rise of the gig economy [<xref rid="pone.0323378.ref169" ref-type="bibr">169</xref>]. Ten of the 26 studies identified in our review were conducted post-2010, potentially capturing the effect of these changes, particularly the studies examining labour market trajectories/precarity [<xref rid="pone.0323378.ref098" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323378.ref100" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0323378.ref103" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>]. However, the design of these studies means it is not possible to identify the conditions in the labour market that impact on the association between employment and mental health. This indicates a need for additional studies on the mental health impacts of (un)employment, that clarify the conditions under which employment can contribute to reducing risk of depression.</p><p>Evidence for the effect of income loss was much stronger than for a gain in income, although study quality was generally lower than for other determinants studied with 6/12 studies scoring higher than 20 points. Our finding is consistent with the results of a meta-analysis that also included low- and middle-income countries [<xref rid="pone.0323378.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The negative effect of income loss was found to be stronger in those with lower income levels or close to poverty, as is also discussed by Shields-Zeeman and Smit [<xref rid="pone.0323378.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In our review only two of the seven studies found this negative effect of income to be specific in lower income groups [<xref rid="pone.0323378.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323378.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>] implying that in the case of high-income countries the underlying mechanism for this effect is not restricted to absolute poverty. It is likely that experiencing relative poverty might act, for example, through perceptions regarding societal standing (status anxiety) or stigma associated with being poor.</p><p>Studies on housing at the collective-level, through urban regeneration showed mixed results. About half of these studies indicated no positive impact on risk of depression. The other half indicated an impact, primarily within subgroups (e.g., women) or in areas with higher realised investment.</p></sec><sec id="sec041"><title>Social resources that follow from the interaction between people</title><p>This was the least studied set of social determinants. Improvement and deterioration of social disorder at the neighbourhood level was consistently associated with a lower and higher risk of depression respectively. Three of the five studies on social participation showed that increase therein was followed by a reduction in risk of depression, although study quality was low, with low numbers of participants</p></sec><sec id="sec042"><title>Determinants with limited evidence</title><p>For a number of social determinants examined by studies in this review, we had insufficient evidence to draw a conclusion on its (in)effectiveness. This specifically applied to expansions in access to social welfare other than paid parental leave policies, societal arrangements other than welfare reforms, increased income, urban regeneration programmes, and social participation. The reasons for the insufficiency of the evidence varied from a limited number of studies with limited variation in settings (e.g., expansions to social welfare through Earned Income Tax Credit programmes or access to health insurance), mixed results without having insight into the reasons for this (e.g., urban regeneration programmes) or too limited to draw a conclusion (e.g., social capital). For housing security, the results were inconsistent across spatial levels; at the individual level, studies consistently indicated a change in risk of depression, negative and positive following deterioration or improvement respectively of housing insecurity, affordability or threat of eviction. Studies at the neighbourhood level, including urban regeneration yielded mixed results which cannot be ascribed to low study quality; only one of the 11 studies scored &#x0003c;18 on the Quality Assessment scale. The difference in results between these two types of studies may be due to the fact that in studies at the individual level, the exposure consisted of a clearly defined improvement or deterioration, e.g., housing eviction, whereas the change in exposure at the neighbourhood level, in urban renewal programmes, was less clearly defined, often including multiple unspecified changes. Interestingly, studies aimed at the social and community environment with a more specific focus, such as crime levels [<xref rid="pone.0323378.ref128" ref-type="bibr">128</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323378.ref129" ref-type="bibr">129</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323378.ref160" ref-type="bibr">160</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323378.ref161" ref-type="bibr">161</xref>], social cohesion [<xref rid="pone.0323378.ref159" ref-type="bibr">159</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323378.ref165" ref-type="bibr">165</xref>], gave a more consistent picture, i.e., improvements in depression risk with improvement in exposure.</p></sec><sec id="sec043"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>The focus of this review was on depression. However, the majority of the studies included measure more general constructs like psychological distress or mental health. There is a dearth of research on the impact of changes in social determinants on rates of depression at the population level. While this information is highly relevant, obtaining such data is highly challenging. Moreover, the field is currently moving more towards broader outcomes such as wellbeing and functioning. In order to capture as many studies focused on intervening on a social determinant as possible we chose to expand our inclusion to these broader outcomes.</p><p>We aimed to develop an overview of potential policies and intervention that act on social determinants of mental health relevant for high income country contexts, and we may have missed specific mechanisms at play in low and middle-income country contexts. Excluding low and middle-income countries in our search means that we might have missed capturing the mechanisms underlying the association between these determinants and depression. However, the influence of the social determinants can be very context-specific. For example, the level of economic development is likely to influence the impact of such interventions, especially progressive policies like parental leave, although there is likely to be variation in contextual factors between high-income countries as well.</p><p>Our search strategy was very broad and we did not include a limitation on publication date to avoid missing older studies. The broad inclusion of determinants means that we were only able to conduct a qualitative synthesis of the included papers and relied on authors&#x02019; reporting for any quantitative evaluation of findings in terms of meaningful effects. We also may have missed some relevant articles, as our search terms may not have been exhaustive for some topics, such as social participation, which can be operationalised in a variety of different ways, including social cohesion or social capital [<xref rid="pone.0323378.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. We conducted our search in three major databases (Medline, Embase and Psychinfo) so some relevant papers may have been missed. To compensate, we conducted a thorough search of the reference lists of included studies and published reviews. Finally, we restricted our focus on studies that examined change in both determinant and outcome, which likely explains the limited numbers of studies included on some topics, specifically, on social resources which has been the topic of other reviews [<xref rid="pone.0323378.ref170" ref-type="bibr">170</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323378.ref171" ref-type="bibr">171</xref>]. Nonetheless, we believe our approach helped capture the state of the art with regards to the potential for interventions to prevent depression across a broad range of social determinants.</p></sec><sec id="sec044"><title>Implications for further research</title><p>Limiting our search to studies that included change in both determinants and outcomes was useful in expanding our understanding of what can be expected from interventions addressing social determinants; as not all associations between such determinants and depression are causal. Consequently, a broad range of determinants, identified in observational studies, has not been included in this review. For example, social norms towards mental illness, social pressure, status anxiety, excessive use of social media, exposure to noise, green/blue space etc [<xref rid="pone.0323378.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323378.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323378.ref172" ref-type="bibr">172</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323378.ref173" ref-type="bibr">173</xref>]. This emphasizes the need for studies with similar designs as included in our review on a much broader range of social determinants than currently studied.</p><p>The included studies used a variety of instruments and outcome measures, some of which specifically assessed depressive symptoms. An important area for consideration in future research is to ensure that large cohort studies, also those that include clinical assessment of depression, expand measures to include a variety of social and economic risk factors, either by adding these variables to their data collection process or linking their data to other databases on (changes in) social determinants.</p><p>As previously mentioned, studying change in the social determinants of health is fraught with difficulty, e.g., populations cannot be randomized to a particular condition to adhere to the gold standard of a randomized controlled trial (RCT). A number of the included studies used natural experiments or instrumental variables where an RCT may not have been possible or appropriate. However, the application of such methodologies remains limited and could be explored more by researchers as could the potential of applying new causal inference methods in the evaluation of interventions. Further, although many authors discussed potential mechanisms underlying the relationships observed few studies included in our review employed formal mediation analysis to try and unravel such mechanisms which indicates the need for more mechanistic studies in this field.</p><p>Although alternative experimental designs, causal inference and mediation analysis help expand our understanding of the role of individual social determinants in depression, they do not reflect complex reality, where multiple factors act at different levels of influence, ranging from the individual- to the social- and environmental-levels. This need is perhaps mostly clearly illustrated by the studies evaluating widely divergent, multi-component interventions (i.e., urban renewal interventions), studies with differential effects depending on population characteristics and in studies with no clear direction of effect, such as studies of policies to incentivise employment. To capture this complexity, there is a need to apply systems approaches [<xref rid="pone.0323378.ref174" ref-type="bibr">174</xref>] and realist approaches [<xref rid="pone.0323378.ref175" ref-type="bibr">175</xref>], focusing on questions such as: under which conditions do changes in social determinants influence depression and for whom; how do different determinants of mental health/depression (e.g., social cohesion and economic improvement in a neighbourhood or in the urban environment interact in their impact on mental health? In taking this approach it is important to include consideration of the role of political, economic, or logistical constraints in adoption of policy to address the social determinants of health.</p></sec><sec id="sec045"><title>Implications for policy</title><p>Traditional approaches to improve mental health or prevent depression often target the individual and their role in shaping their own outcomes. This focus on the individual suggests that the responsibility to overcome barriers such as poverty lies with the person rather than with allocation of resources by governments and institutions [<xref rid="pone.0323378.ref176" ref-type="bibr">176</xref>]. Focusing on social determinants as a way to impact depression levels proceeds from the premise that even relatively small shifts in the distribution of depressive symptoms at the population-level could be expected to have large benefits for the population as a whole [<xref rid="pone.0323378.ref177" ref-type="bibr">177</xref>]. This is relevant considering the relatively high societal and healthcare cost of even mild depressive symptoms [<xref rid="pone.0323378.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323378.ref178" ref-type="bibr">178</xref>].</p><p>We found consistent evidence for policies aimed at providing paid parental leave; promoting paid employment; and preventing income loss/financial distress. Importantly, our review has shown the importance of mitigating financial insecurity (through austerity measures) in a context of financial crisis, as well as preventing job insecurity.</p><p>Our review also highlights the importance of considering the unintended consequences of policies. For instance, reforms that incentivise employment may impact other factors the influence mental health. The Job Seekers Allowance in the UK [<xref rid="pone.0323378.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0323378.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] and the introduction of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act in the US [<xref rid="pone.0323378.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323378.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]), were both consistently followed by an increase in depression risk, probably through their restriction of welfare benefits. Other negative effects of incentivising work maybe due to increased need for childcare or insecurity due to having to take on menial, unstable work.</p><p>The lack of clear-cut evidence on many of the other determinants included in this review was due to limited numbers of studies or methodological issues, thus we cannot conclude that they are not relevant for policy.</p><p>Overall, the broad spectrum of actions needed to address population-level depression risk implies there is a need for a comprehensive approach that involves collaboration between different policy domains. In addition, the complexity of addressing population mental health, given interactions between different determinants, differential effects across populations and unintended consequences implies careful consideration of the local context in developing policy, preferably using system dynamic approaches.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec046"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This review builds upon reviews of observational and longitudinal studies that show an association between social determinants and risk of depression. We wanted to extend that evidence by studying whether this association can be influenced/changed through policy or intervention and to identify gaps in evidence. Overall, we found evidence that population-level depression risk can be reduced by policies ensuring the provision of paid parental leave; prevention of income loss/financial distress; and the promotion paid employment. Whereas reduced or conditional entitlements to social welfare, loss of income and financial distress, loss of employment and collective insecurity can increase depression risk. We argue that there is a need for studies on a broader set of social determinants using systems and realist approaches to understand the complex interactions between determinants and contextual factors.</p></sec><sec id="sec047" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material id="pone.0323378.s001" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S1 Data</label><caption><title>Search strategies.</title><p>(XLS)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0323378.s001.xls"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pone.0323378.s002" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S2 Data</label><caption><title>Overview of included and excluded papers.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0323378.s002.xlsx"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0323378.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><collab>GBD 2019 Mental Disorders Collaborators</collab>. <article-title>Global, regional, and national burden of 12 mental disorders in 204 countries and territories, 1990-2019: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019</article-title>. <source>Lancet Psychiatry</source>. <year>2022</year>;<volume>9</volume>(<issue>2</issue>):<fpage>137</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>50</lpage>. <comment>doi: </comment><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/S2215-0366(21)00395-3</pub-id>

The aim of this review is to examine whether change in social determinants can result in depression prevention using a systematic review. Social determinants of health are essentially non-medical factors affecting health outcomes.</p><p>Study characteristics were clearly and concisely summarized. The presentation of the results were structured into societal arrangements, material resources, and social resources, with sufficient details. Table 4 (Summary of Findings) is an essential table for readers to grasp a better understanding of the relationship between change in social determinants and depression.</p><p>We thank the reviewer for her/his positive evaluation of our review. We have also checked table 4 to ensure that it accurately reflects the included papers.</p><p>The following are the specific comments:</p><p>1. This study demonstrates a connection between social determinants and depression risk, highlighting several key factors that policymakers should take into account when developing policies or interventions to reduce population-level depression risk. While this review may not specifically address potential barriers or challenges in implementing such policies and interventions, such as political, economic, or logistical constraints, these factors are indeed crucial for policymakers to consider when making decisions. It may be worth discussing the potential barriers or challenges that could arise in implementing policies or interventions aimed at reducing depression risk.</p><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. Based on this we have more strongly highlighted the issue of unintended consequences of policies (lines 1203-1212) and have mentioned the importance of inter-sectoral collaboration in forming policy, using systems approaches (lines 1219-1225). We have also restructured the discussion to ensure that the implications for policy are condensed in one section so that they are more accessible to readers (lines 1199-1224).</p><p>Beyond these changes, we have not elaborated on the barriers of challenges in implementing policies at this was beyond the aim of our review. To do so would require a different kind of approach than what we have taken. However, we do agree that this is an important issue to consider in future research and included the following comment in paragraph outlining the implications for research: In taking this approach it is important to include consideration of the role of political, economic, or logistical constraints in adoption of policy to address the social determinants of health. (lines 1184-1186)</p><p>2. Moreover it would be beneficial for policymakers to have information on the relative impact of these factors in reducing depression risk. This would enable them to prioritize policies and interventions, with the constraints of limited resources.</p><p>If we understand this comment correctly, the reviewer is suggesting that we rank interventions according to their relative impact. Our findings highlight a number of interventions that have been consistently shown to reduce population risk of depression as well as policy actions with adverse effects. To emphasise these we have added the following text in the first paragraph of the discussion: We found most, consistent and high quality of evidence for changes in a number of social determinants, where a positive development led to a reduction on risk of depression 1) paid parental leave (8/10 studies) 2) gaining employment (9/10 studies); or, conversely, where a negative development led to increased risk of depression 1) reduction in income or transitioning into poverty (12 studies), 2) losing employment (14/17 studies), 3) work incentives coupled with reduction/loss of welfare ((8/12 studies), 4) collective insecurity (economic crisis) (14/18 studies), instability of housing (9 studies). (lines 764-770).</p><p>However, we add that: The lack of clear-cut evidence on many of the other determinants included in this review was due to limited numbers of studies or methodological issues, thus we cannot conclude that they are not relevant for policy. (lines 1217-1219).</p><p>Thus we also add:</p><p>Overall, the broad spectrum of actions needed to address population-level depression risk implies there is a need for a comprehensive approach that involves collaboration between different policy domains. In addition, the complexity of addressing population mental health, given interactions between different determinants, differential effects across populations and unintended consequences implies careful consideration of the local context in developing policy, preferably using system dynamic approaches. (lines 1220-1225).</p><p>3. The review includes studies of various methodological rigor and quality (Validity Assessment scores ranging from 18 to 26). Although studies with a score of 18 or higher were considered to be of high quality, some with relatively lower score (eg 19) may indicate that the existence of potential biases or confounding factors in these studies, which could impact the strength and generalizability of the findings. Please explain how these scores be taken account in the discussion/conclusions.</p><p>We have included an evaluation of the evidence base on the VA scores in describing our main findings in the summary of our findings and in other sections of the discussion.</p><p>With regard to welfare reforms: The majority of studies on societal arrangements assessed the impact of welfare reforms. All of the studies can be considered high quality, i.e. &#x0003e;18 points on the Validity Assessment scale. Of those, five studies scored 19-20 points. (lines 779-781).</p><p>In relation to (un)employment: Study quality was mixed, of the 28 studies related to employment, 11 scored less than 20 and of these five scored less than 18 points. Thus our findings regarding employment may be biased, although they were similar to those of previous reviews and meta-analyses [167, 168]. (Lines 309-312).</p><p>Also: Studies at the neighbourhood level, including urban regeneration yielded mixed results which cannot be ascribed to low study quality; only one of the 11 studies scored &#x0003c;18 on the Quality Assessment scale. (lines 391-393)</p><p>4. This review does not provide specific details on the types of policies and interventions that may be effective in reducing population-level depression risk. This may limit the applicability of the findings for policymakers and practitioners seeking to implement evidence-based interventions.</p><p>As mentioned in our response above, we have restructured the discussion section to bring the evidence for policy together to make our findings more accessible. In this paragraph we emphasize the findings for which there is greater evidence but the goal of this review was not to rank policies, but to present evidence on policies which might have an effect on mental health. However, we also highlight the importance of considering local context and unintended consequences. For example, having paid parental leave has an impact on mental health of the family members and may also contribute to better mental health outcomes of the children later in life, but how that paid parental leave is embedded into policy measures (or combined) with other policies may be country specific. See also our response above.</p><p>5. The conclusion acknowledges the need for studies that consider different populations and conditions. This will be more useful to elaborate more on this point so that a specific guidance can be formulated on how to tailor interventions to different contexts or how to account for potential variations in effectiveness across settings.</p><p>We appreciate this comment, the relevance of context and potential unintended consequences is clear. We hope that the adjustments made in our manuscript are sufficient to meet the suggestions of the reviewer. Importantly, we want to emphasise that a comprehensive analysis on how to tailor interventions is beyond the scope of this review. We do suggest that further research, using systems and/or realist approaches might provide more specific insights for tailoring to context and population.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="aggregated-review-documents" id="pone.0323378.r004" specific-use="decision-letter"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0323378.r004</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision Letter 1</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>De-Chih</given-names></name><role>Academic Editor</role></contrib></contrib-group><permissions><copyright-statement>&#x000a9; 2025 De-Chih Lee</copyright-statement><copyright-year>2025</copyright-year><copyright-holder>De-Chih Lee</copyright-holder><license><ali:license_ref xmlns:ali="http://www.niso.org/schemas/ali/1.0/" specific-use="textmining" content-type="ccbylicense">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</ali:license_ref><license-p>This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution License</ext-link> , which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.</license-p></license></permissions><related-article ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.1371/journal.pone.0323378" id="rel-obj004" related-article-type="reviewed-article"/><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>Submission Version</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></front-stub><body><p>

</p><p>RE manuscript PONE-D-23-23924R1</p><p>Preventing depression in high-income countries &#x02013; a systematic review of studies evaluating change in social determinants</p><p>Dear editorial team,</p><p>Thank you for allowing is to resubmit our manuscript &#x0201c;Preventing depression in high-income countries &#x02013; a systematic review of studies evaluating change in social determinants&#x0201d;.</p><p>As you are aware, this manuscript was recently rejected but is now being resubmitted after appeal. We would first like to summarise the facts. Initial submission was in July 2023 but took some time to be assigned to an editor. We received notification of the difficulties in assigning an editor on the 30th of October and then notification in November that an editor had been assigned. Reviewer comments were provided in February 2024, recommending revision of the manuscript, which we completed at the end of March. In June we received notification that the manuscript was again delayed due to changes in editors. Finally, on the 25th of June we received a rejection letter from the editor newly assigned to our paper.</p><p>The new editor names a number of reasons for rejection of our paper. However we would argue that some of the issues mentioned do not align for the overall aim and rationale for our review. Below we provide a response (in italics) to the comments made by the editor.</p><p>a) First, this manuscript only searches three journal databases, which may miss important information or references.</p><p>Three to four databases for systematic reviews are widely accepted in publications, also in other systematic reviews published in PLOS One. I can appreciate that 4-5 databases is more common in 2024 (also considering Google Scholar as a common database). If this was an issue it should have been flagged up in the first or second review of the article, when the authors could have chosen to search an additional database or take the review for consideration elsewhere. We discuss this in the paper and our strategy to overcome this shortcoming (page 83): &#x0201c;We conducted our search in three major databases (Medline, Embase and Psychinfo) so some relevant papers may have been missed. To compensate, we conducted a thorough search of the reference lists of included studies and published reviews&#x0201d;</p><p>b) The literature included by the author consists of quantitative and qualitative research. The author conducts the discussion using a qualitative method. Using qualitative research methods to perform a quantitative literature review will miss much information and is unscientific and unobjective.</p><p>Firstly, we only include quantitative research in our search, so this is a mistaken impression.</p><p>Secondly, our use of a narrative review is justified by the broad range of topics studied. Our aim was to provide a broad overview of the topic, including many determinants. A meta-analysis was not possible given the design of our review.</p><p>Narrative descriptions of evidence is not unscientific or unobjective, and we also rated the quality of the evidence included in the review, which is systematic and more objective.</p><p>c) The author excludes patients with diabetes and heart disease. What about other illnesses such as cancer, mental disorders, etc.? What is the basis for the exclusion?</p><p>As explained on page 8 of the manuscript, we excluded studies in specific clinical populations or all patient groups, of which persons with diabetes, heart disease are an example. Our aim is to give an overview of strategies that could be employed to prevent depression in the general population. We justify our exclusion of patient groups as the social determinants underlying depression risks in patients differ from these in de general population.</p><p>d) The authors exclude low-income and middle-income countries. Are these countries not providing social support? For example, China. When these countries are excluded, the conclusions of this manuscript will be biased.</p><p>We aimed to develop an overview of potential policies and intervention that act on social determinants of mental health relevant for high-income country contexts, and we acknowledge that we may have missed specific mechanisms at play in low and middle-income countries (page 83). However, the focus on high-income countries was based on the expectation that differences in context would have an influence on the relationship between social determinants and mental health. This does not imply that social determinants are not relevant for low and middle income countries, as the editor suggests. Understanding the relation between social determinants and mental health in those settings simply goes beyond the aim of this specific paper.</p><p>To further expand on this point in the manuscript we expanded somewhat on this point in the discussion, lines 874-880 where we added the text:</p><p>&#x0201c;Excluding low and middle-income countries in our search means that we might have missed capturing the mechanisms underlying the association between these determinants and depression. However, the influence of the social determinants can be very context-specific. For example, the level of economic development is likely to influence the impact of such interventions, especially progressive policies like parental leave, although there is likely to be variation in contextual factors between high-income countries as well&#x0201d;.</p><p>If this was an issue it should have been brought up in previous revisions of the systematic review, not already more than a year after in the review process of PLOS one.</p><p>e) In the abstract, the authors find evidence that strategies such as promoting paid employment and parental leave can reduce the risk of depression. What is the author's evidence? Is it through statistical analysis? I haven't seen any system evidence of this.</p><p>The evidence is in the included studies in our review showing this, but also here: How do income changes impact on mental health and wellbeing for working-age adults? A systematic review and meta-analysis (thelancet.com) and here: National or population level interventions addressing the social determinants of mental health &#x02013; an umbrella review | BMC Public Health | Full Text (biomedcentral.com). This is not an opinion of the authors, but of the evidence synthesized in this review. The aim of a narrative systematic review is not do a statistical analysis. Our analysis is based on a rigorous evaluation of the evidence, which have been judged as &#x02018;sound&#x02019; by the reviewers. In addition, it is not clear to us what the editor means with &#x02018;any system evidence&#x02019;?</p><p>f) Finally, using qualitative methods for the literature review of quantitative studies was permissible in the past when tools were not available. However, many software tools are now available to assist researchers in conducting more objective and scientific analyses. In particular, this manuscript includes many references, most of which are quantitative. Using traditional manual methods to organize and summarise would have missed much important information and would not have been objective.</p><p>We are of course aware of the availability of software tools to quantitatively summarize the results of multiple studies in a systematic review. However, the aim of our paper was NOT to quantitatively assess the strength of the association. Instead, the rationale of our study was to assess evidence for a causal relationship between social determinants and depression. As explained in line 81 and further: However, in existing studies it is often not clear whether a change in exposure to social determinants will also lead to a lower risk of depression. Establishing causality is fraught with difficulty and the increased application of counterfactual methodologies to this field has helped to clarify causality.</p><p>For this reason, the quantitative assessment as suggested by the editor goes beyond the aim of our paper.</p><p>g) In addition, the literature search and the inclusion criteria make this manuscript subject to serious bias and will miss important information or literature. It is recommended that the authors expand the literature search and adopt a quantitative method. Authors may include too wide a range of variables for quantitative methods can not be used. Authors are advised to focus on the research topic and expand the search of journal databases.</p><p>As explained in our previous reactions, this would entail a completely new approach, with a different research question.</p><p>We would like to point out that the views of the two reviewers that evaluated our (revised) manuscript were satisfied with the adjustments made. On initial evaluation of our manuscript one of the reviewers comments &#x0201c;The manuscript undertakes systematic review on a very pertinent topic highlighting whether changes in social determinants can prevent depression and its symptoms in high income countries&#x0201d;. Critical comments were made by both reviewers which we had responded to. Both reviewers answered gave a positive response to the question &#x0201c;is the manuscript technically sound, and do the data support the conclusions?&#x0201d;</p><p>We look forward to further consideration of this work.</p><p>With kind regards,</p><p>Mary Nicolaou, on behalf of the co-authors</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="editor-report" id="pone.0323378.r006" specific-use="decision-letter"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0323378.r006</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision Letter 2</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>oi</surname><given-names>katsuya</given-names></name><role>Academic Editor</role></contrib></contrib-group><permissions><copyright-statement>&#x000a9; 2025 katsuya oi</copyright-statement><copyright-year>2025</copyright-year><copyright-holder>katsuya oi</copyright-holder><license><ali:license_ref xmlns:ali="http://www.niso.org/schemas/ali/1.0/" specific-use="textmining" content-type="ccbylicense">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</ali:license_ref><license-p>This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution License</ext-link> , which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.</license-p></license></permissions><related-article ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.1371/journal.pone.0323378" id="rel-obj006" related-article-type="reviewed-article"/><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>Submission Version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></front-stub><body><p>
