Dropping out of school is associated with an increased risk of unemployment, low salaries, and receiving social security or disability benefits. In this study, we interviewed participants in &#x02018;Guttas Campus&#x02019; (The Boys&#x02019; Camp), which is a group-based intervention that aims to support disengaged boys from the 9<sup>th</sup> grade and through their transition to high school. The intervention consists of a two-week learning camp. The students subsequently participate in mentoring groups, with teachers and other camp participants, for a period of 18 months.</p></sec><sec id="sec9264"><title>Objectives</title><p>We present a study of a school dropout prevention program.</p></sec><sec id="sec9265"><title>Methods</title><p>
16 students were interviewed qualitatively. The interview data were analysed by drawing on the method of Grounded Theory.</p></sec><sec id="sec9266"><title>Results</title><p>When the students who have completed the learning camp were asked what they believed were the most important and useful parts of the intervention, some common themes emerged: 1) The learning camp community provided a safe environment and helped give the participants learning and coping experiences that increased their self-confidence. 2) The students brought up the method of teaching, which they described as more persistent, adaptive and encouraging than they had been used to from regular school. 3) The students also mentioned the intervention&#x02019;s focus on character strengths such as willpower, self-control and optimism as central to increasing their motivation to learn.</p></sec><sec id="sec9267"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The students that were interviewed were generally positive to the intervention, as mentioned several factors that they believed were useful in increasing their motivation and ability to learn.</p></sec><sec id="sec9268"><title>Disclosure of Interest</title><p>None Declared</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="1"/></counts></article-meta></front></article>
