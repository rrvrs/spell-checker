Its activity controls the maternal decidual response at early post-implantation stages of development. The present experiments demonstrate surprisingly that Blimp1 activity in the uterus is required for tissue remodelling at sites of embryonic failure. Moreover Blimp1 mutant females are refractory to RU486 induced decidual shedding. RNA-seq together with immunostaining experiments strongly suggest that the failure to up-regulate expression of the matrix metalloprotease Mmp10 in combination with insufficient suppression of BMP signalling, likely explain Blimp1-dependent phenotypic changes. In the post-partum uterus Blimp1 together with Mmp10 are highly upregulated at sites of tissue repair following placental detachment. Conditional Blimp1 removal significantly impairs the re-epithelization process and severely impacts involution of the endometrium and luminal epithelium. Overall these results identify Blimp1 as a master regulator of uterine tissue remodelling and repair.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="web-summary"><p id="Par2">The uterus undergoes successive rounds of pregnancy associated tissue remodelling.

Local disruption of the luminal epithelial layer and rapid stromal cell decidualization during implantation results in envelopment of the embryo by maternal tissue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Subsequent interactions between the invading fetal trophoblasts and the maternal decidual cells promote vascular remodelling to connect the developing fetal-placental unit with the maternal circulation. After parturition, in response to falling levels of progesterone, the uterus subsequently undergoes a process of involution to remodel the luminal epithelium and regenerate lost and damaged tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Following detachment and expulsion of the placenta, localized tissue regeneration is required to restore the integrity of the luminal epithelial layer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Remarkably female mice immediately re-enter oestrus and mate following birth of their offspring. Via involution, the uterus rapidly acquires a receptive state within 3-4 days post-partum. Additionally throughout gestation, the mouse uterus has the ability to respond to failure of abnormal embryos. This poorly understood process, termed &#x0201c;resorption&#x0201d;, results in focal clearance of embryonic remnants and associated maternal tissues. Localized tissue remodelling leads to regeneration and repair of the stroma and luminal epithelial layer.</p><p id="Par4">We recently described essential contributions made at early stages of pregnancy by the zinc-finger SET domain transcription factor Blimp1. Blimp1 mutant embryos fail at 10.5 days post coitum (dpc) due to defective placental morphogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. We showed that Blimp1 expression in the embryonic trophoblast lineage is required for specification of the highly specialized spiral artery trophoblast giant cells that mediate invasion of the maternal deciduum and remodelling of the maternal blood vessels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Expression is locally induced at implantation sites in the uterine luminal epithelium and then robustly up-regulated in the primary decidual zone (PDZ) immediately surrounding the embryo<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Conditional inactivation of Blimp1 activity in the uterus using the well described progesterone receptor Cre (PRCre) deleter strain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> does not disturb stromal decidualization but rather results in defective formation of the PDZ barrier and abnormal trophectoderm invasion causing embryonic lethality at day 6.5<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Surprisingly here we discovered in PrCre Blimp1 mutant females that the residual decidual swellings, while devoid of viable embryos, fail to be reabsorbed during gestation. The uterine tissue is unable to remodel and remarkably at the equivalent of up to four weeks post-partum (PP) decidual structures formed at implantation persist and occlude the uterine horns.</p><p id="Par5">To further investigate Blimp1 functional contributions during uterine damage and repair we also examined Blimp1 expression following RU486 mediated termination of pregnancy. In RU486 treated wild type females expression is highly up-regulated in peripheral decidual cells prior to their detachment from the uterine wall and release of the decidual mass into the lumen. Expression is subsequently observed at sites of uterine repair and re-epithelialization. By contrast Blimp1 deficient decidual tissues remain fully attached to the uterine wall following RU486 administration. Our transcriptional profiling experiments strongly suggest that Blimp1 suppresses BMP signalling that normally precedes decidual detachment. Additionally Blimp1 is required for up-regulated expression of the extra-cellular metalloproteases that likely mediate RU486 induced tissue shedding.</p><p id="Par6">Interestingly we found in the wild-type post-partum uterus that Blimp1 expression is localized to the stroma immediately adjacent to the over-lying luminal epithelial layer and is strongly up-regulated at the sites of placental detachment undergoing repair and re-epithelialization. Similarly at early post-partum stages we observe robust induction of Mmp10 expression in the stroma at sites of placental detachment as well as along the length of the uterine epithelium. Conditional removal of Blimp1 at PP day 2 is associated with loss of Mmp10 expression. Moreover loss of Blimp1 expression significantly impairs re-epithelialization of the detachment sites and severely impacts involution and remodelling of the uterine epithelium. Our fate mapping studies suggest that Blimp1+ stromal cells fail to contribute to the luminal epithelium during repair and involution, but rather act to promote the re-epithelialization process. Collectively the present findings demonstrate that Blimp1 expression in the endometrial stroma plays essential roles during uterine remodelling and damage repair.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Blimp1 dependent resorption of maternal decidual tissues</title><p id="Par7">We previously reported that Blimp1 functional loss from the uterine stroma and luminal epithelium using the progesterone receptor Cre deleter strain (PRCre) disrupts formation of the PDZ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> and consequently embryonic development arrests at early post-implantation stages (6.5 dpc). Here we characterize Blimp1 requirements during the process of decidual resolution and uterine repair that normally occurs following embryonic failure. Surprisingly we discovered in Blimp1 PRCre females (hereafter referred to as Blimp1 mutants) at 9.5 dpc, some 72&#x02009;h after embryonic disintegration, that the uterine horns contained normal numbers of decidual swellings (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). Moreover histological analysis revealed that these deciduae retain a normal cellular architecture with the luminal surface covered by a discrete layer of cytokeratin (CK) positive epithelial cells (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). Additionally CK staining highlighted the persistence of coherent patches of centrally located embryo-derived trophoblast giant cells (TGCs) that closely resemble the post-mitotic primary giant cells derived from the trophectoderm and ectoplacental cone shortly after implantation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>).

Normally in wild type females uterine tissue is rapidly re-modelled and re-epithelialized at the sites of placental shedding to restore the integrity of the uterine lumen (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). This process of tissue repair, in combination with global remodelling of the myometrium and endometrium in response to reduced levels of circulating progesterone, normally prepares the uterus for implantation by the subsequent round of embryos at around 4 days following birth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. In contrast in mutant females, decidual masses encapsulated by luminal epithelium are still present within the uterine horns at the equivalent of PP day 5 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>, Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). The presence of these decidual occlusions leads to an accumulation of fluid causing the horns to adopt a swollen cystic morphology. Moreover CK staining highlights the persistence of residual TGCs. By contrast the architecture of the uterus at intra-implantation sites including the myometrial layer, endometrial stroma, luminal and glandular epithelium appears normal. The decidual remnants, encapsulated in a layer of uterine epithelium, persist at PP d14 and PP d28, the latest stage examined (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Histological examination of ovarian tissues shows the presence of corpus lutea and maturing follicles (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Mutant females continue to cycle normally and thus the inability to resolve decidual remnants cannot be explained by impairment of the hormonal axis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Blimp1 expression during RU486-mediated pregnancy termination</title><p id="Par9">Administration of the abortifacient RU486, a potent antagonist of the progesterone receptor, causes shedding of the implantation sites at early stages of pregnancy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, that is rapidly followed by remodelling and repair of the damaged uterine tissues. To learn more about Blimp1 function during this process next we examined uterine horns recovered following RU486 administration to 5.5 dpc wild type females (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). As expected<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, in control females robust Blimp1 expression is largely confined to the PDZ surrounding the developing embryo, and decidual cells located predominantly on the antimesometrial side, with only scattered Blimp1+ cells present at the periphery of the deciduum. By contrast 14&#x02009;h post RU486 treatment when the embryo has disintegrated, and the deciduum lacking its normal compact cellular architecture has become infiltrated by maternal blood cells, the pattern of Blimp1 expression dramatically changes. Expression is retained in the PDZ immediately surrounding the embryo, but markedly down-regulated within the central region of the deciduum, while cells at the peripheral margin of the deciduum display robust ectopic expression.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><title>Wild type decidua display dramatic changes in the pattern of Blimp1 expression 14&#x02009;hours post RU486 treatment.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Reduced cell-cell contact and accumulation of erythrocytes at the periphery of decidual regions (H&#x00026;E RU486 panel) in wild type 6.0 dpc decidua (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;3) within 14&#x02009;h of RU486 treatment (150&#x02009;&#x003bc;g, IP).

Eomes deficient blastocysts implant normally and elicit a decidual response, but arrest shortly thereafter due to Eomes requirements in the trophoblast lineage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Deciduae were recovered from heterozygous Eomes intercrosses at 9.5 dpc. At this stage decidual swellings containing homozygous mutant embryos are readily discernable due to their reduced size.

In other mammals, including humans, cycling is accompanied by shedding of the uterine endometrium via the process of menstruation. During menstruation and following parturition the damaged endometrium is rapidly regenerated to restore uterine integrity and tissue architecture<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par30">Here we demonstrate that the zinc finger transcription factor Blimp1 plays an essential role in decidual tissue during pregnancy. Blimp1 inactivation within the highly specialized decidual tissue via PR-Cre mediated deletion renders it refractory to the process of breakdown that normally follows embryonic failure. Rather the decidual swellings, devoid of the embryo proper, and containing only pockets of residual post-mitotic primary TGCs, persist fully 3-4 weeks after their original induction. Thus Blimp1 appears to have essential roles in mediating localized resorption and uterine remodelling normally triggered in response to embryonic loss during gestation. By contrast Blimp1 is not required for hormonally regulated endometrial remodelling and homeostasis during the oestrus cycle since virgin Blimp1 PR-Cre mutant females cycle normally and ovulate appropriately<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. However following the first pregnancy decidual tissues fail to be shed and resorbed, and rather become encapsulated by luminal epithelium leading to occlusion of the uterus. The presence of these long-lived decidual masses has no impact on subsequent oestrus cycles, but prevents subsequent fertilization of released ova.</p><p id="Par31">Remarkably we discovered that Blimp1 deficient decidual tissues fail to detach from the uterine wall and are completely resistant to RU486 treatment. It is well known that blocking progesterone activity results in abrupt termination of pregnancy associated with the rapid loss of embryo viability and sloughing of the associated maternal tissues. In the mouse this process is initiated within a few hours following RU486 administration. We exploited this model to investigate Blimp1 functional contributions during gestational uterine remodelling and repair. Our experiments demonstrate a dramatic alteration in the distribution of Blimp1+ decidual cells in response to RU486 treatment. With 14&#x02009;h of administration at either at 5.5 dpc or 8.5 dpc, cell populations located at the periphery of the deciduum show robust up-regulated Blimp1 expression. Blimp1 expression persists in the mesometrial decidual cells 10&#x02009;h later following release of the residual decidual mass from the uterine wall. Blimp1 expression is also locally retained in the stroma and epithelial cell layer undergoing repair.</p><p id="Par32">Previous studies have established that Bmp2 plays a critical role during decidualization in mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> and that RU486 treatment specifically results in loss of Bmp2 protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Interestingly we found here that retention of the Blimp1 deficient decidual swellings is associated with persistent BMP signalling. In wild type females RU486 treatment causes a dramatic down-regulation of Bmp2 and Smad9 transcription and loss of pSmad 1/5/9 staining throughout the deciduum. Our transcriptional profiling experiments show that genes down-regulated in RU486 treated wild type deciduae overlap with those known to be down-regulated in Bmp2 null deciduae. By contrast BMP signalling is retained throughout the decidual tissue in RU486 treated Blimp1 mutants suggesting that enhanced BMP signalling contributes to the survival of the mutant decidual cell population. Recent single-cell profiling studies have shown that primary TGCs express multiple TGF&#x003b2;-signalling pathway components including BMP receptors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. Thus increased BMP signalling observed here in the absence of Blimp1 probably contributes to the persistence of TGC within the decidual swellings.</p><p id="Par33">In RU486 treated wild type females expression of two metalloproteases namely Mmp10 and Mmp13, that actively degrade components of the extra-cellular matrix is rapidly up-regulated.

Mmp13 and Mmp10 up-regulation at the end of pregnancy correlates with a marked decline in progesterone levels in the maternal circulation. Moreover siRNA mediated silencing of the progesterone receptor in human myometrial cells results in dramatically increased Mmp10 mRNA expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par34">In wild type females robust levels of Mmp10 protein are detected in peripheral decidual cells and in the PDZ within 14&#x02009;h of RU486 administration. Notably these sites correspond to those in which Blimp1 is up-regulated. Blimp1 deficient deciduae fail to up-regulate Mmp10 in response to blocking progesterone receptor signalling. These results strongly suggest that induction of Blimp1 expression in response to progesterone receptor blockade is required either directly or indirectly for up-regulation of these important remodelling proteases to promote decidual shedding in the wild type uterus.</p><p id="Par35">Interestingly, as for sites of RU486 induced decidual shedding during gestation, we find robust induction of Blimp1 expression within the uterine stroma following parturition. Blimp1 is broadly expressed at the sites of tissue damage associated with release of the individual placental structures. Moreover Blimp1+ expression demarcates a sub-set of the stromal population lying immediately adjacent to the luminal epithelium along the length of the uterine horns which persist until at least PP day 7. Here we find that conditional removal of Blimp1 activity from the post-partum uterus significantly impacts the process of repair and involution. By day 2, in the areas of the lumen denuded of epithelium as a result of placental expulsion, the process of tissue repair is significantly impaired, leading to a delay in re-epithelization and inappropriate release of blood and cellular debris into the uterine lumen. Generalized loss of Blimp1 activity from the stroma also leads to a failure to reduce and remodel the expanded epithelium and endometrium which normally occurs within the first 5 days after parturition. Blimp1 is thus essential to both promote the re-epithelialization process and restore the endometrium in preparation for embryo implantation.</p><p id="Par36">The process of re-epithelization of the mouse uterus has been investigated extensively and a number of differing models proposed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>.

Consistent with this latter possibility at PP day 2 we find islands of Blimp1+ stroma adjacent to denuded areas resulting from placental detachment and which are undergoing rapid re-epithelialization. However our fate mapping experiments conclusively establish that by PP day 5 the Blimp1+ cells do not give rise to the newly repaired epithelial surface but rather are confined to the stroma immediately underlying the epithelial surface, and thus do not represent a multipotent progenitor cell population.</p><p id="Par37">Blimp1 deficient uterine horns are blocked in their ability to undergo normal involution, the process that returns the entire organ to the pre-pregnancy state. Very few studies have assessed the cellular mechanisms underlying involution, with most focused on identifying potential stem cell populations within the myometrium and endometrium responsible for cyclical repair and remodelling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. At the end of pregnancy, the endometrium and epithelial surface has expanded several fold but after birth resolves within a 5-day period. This coordinate and highly dynamic diminishment in tissue mass occurs via a poorly understood process. Here we have uncovered a key transcription factor Blimp1 expressed within the stroma underlying the uterine epithelial layer that orchestrates resolution of the endometrium and associated luminal epithelium. Degradation effectors including multiple matrix metalloproteases are known to be induced in response to the fall in progesterone levels that occur at parturition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. Additionally in the human uterus multiple metalloproteases are induced during post-menstrual endometrial regeneration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. Our current studies have established that both upregulated expression of Mmp10 and Mmp13 fails to occur in the absence of Blimp1. However to date single loss of function mutations in for example Mmp7 and Mmp3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>, also known to be upregulated in the post-partum uterus, as well as either loss of Mmp10 or Mmp13 have no impact on uterine involution or female fertility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. An attractive possibility that warrants future investigation is that Blimp1 activity is required to coordinate the expression of a network of tissue remodelling genes necessary to drive both repair and involution during uterine homeostasis. Given the apparent conservation of uterine repair mechanisms between humans and mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> it will be interesting to examine possible Blimp1 involvements in human menstruation and post-partum uterine remodelling.</p><p id="Par38">Since its original identification as a silencer of &#x003b2;-interferon gene expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup> and a master regulator of plasma cell maturation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>, Blimp1 has been shown to govern development within numerous additional tissues, including specification of the mammalian germ line, maturation of the gut epithelium, mammary gland homeostasis, and formation of the placenta during pregnancy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. Its activity as a transcriptional repressor during B-cell maturation involves recruitment of chromatin-modifying factors such as histone deacetylases and methyl transferases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. However the possibly common mechanisms by which it regulates target gene expression in these distinct tissue contexts remain largely unknown. Here we have discovered an essential role for Blimp1 during uterine repair and involution. An important future goal is to identify Blimp1 transcriptional targets and the associated gene regulatory networks that underpin the critical roles it plays in the context of uterine remodelling.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec13"><title>Animal care and use</title><p id="Par39">All animal experiments were performed in accordance with the UK Home Office regulations and approved by the University of Oxford Local Ethical Committee.
