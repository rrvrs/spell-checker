The burden for those living in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where 90% of the world&#x02019;s adolescents live [<xref rid="pone.0323907.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], is exacerbated by a lack of access to care in these settings [<xref rid="pone.0323907.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Mental health attitudes and barriers to the uptake of services and mitigation strategies vary from one sociocultural context to another [<xref rid="pone.0323907.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. These cultural differences co-occur with socioeconomic variations. In Kenya, poor health care infrastructure, poorly trained and empowered health workers, and lack of preventive and integrated mental health services are known barriers that come in the way of ensuring youth well-being [<xref rid="pone.0323907.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Young people become particularly vulnerable from middle childhood years onwards to a sequela of psychosocial risks that can trigger mental, neurological, and substance use disorders [<xref rid="pone.0323907.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Schooling, peer relationships, and the opportunity to engage in one&#x02019;s own networks are known to be protective factors in buffering adolescent and youth mental health [<xref rid="pone.0323907.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>The COVID-19 pandemic led to dramatic essential service disruptions, including schooling, health, and social services in Kenya, resulting in a high burden of additional needs impacting young people. These include an unmet need for psychological first aid and impaired access to mental health care and psychosocial support [<xref rid="pone.0323907.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323907.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Systematic data on the mental health impact of COVID-19 on young people in such settings is still lacking [<xref rid="pone.0323907.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, research suggests that the COVID-19 pandemic&#x02019;s social and economic impact on adolescents and young adults in Nairobi, Kenya, is highly gendered, with young women and girls most affected [<xref rid="pone.0323907.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323907.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Disproportionate risks and impacts shouldered by adolescent girls and households during the COVID-19 pandemic are associated with increased risk for mental health problems, including the stress of food insecurity, risk of household violence, and forgoing necessary medical care [<xref rid="pone.0323907.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>A study in Nairobi among youth seeking mental health services at the Kenyatta National Referral Hospital found that they preferred to be offered both medication as well as psychosocial interventions over other forms of care. It was also found that young people were not inclined to believe in supernatural or traditional beliefs around mental illnesses; however, they did think stigma and family stressors were a considerable source of distress [<xref rid="pone.0323907.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], often exacerbating mental distress.</p><p>As adolescents face a high prevalence of mental disorders coupled with limited access to care, delay in seeking care, or not seeking it altogether, a more understanding of adolescents&#x02019; perceptions and knowledge about mental health and illness is needed. Identifying the barriers that prevent adolescents from seeking care for mental disorders and modifiable factors to reduce adolescents&#x02019; risk and increase resilience is essential. This study aimed to explore adolescents&#x02019; and caregivers&#x02019; knowledge, perceptions, and insights about adolescent mental health living in two low-income settings in Nairobi.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Study design</title><p>A qualitative approach leveraging lived experiences was thought would capture perspectives, experiences, and individuals&#x02019; reflections on adolescent mental health.

</p></disp-quote></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec019"><title>Discussion</title><p>The findings illustrated that adolescents experience significant psychological pressures and disturbances in their everyday lives, and there are familial, peer, and individual level triggers of these problems, as also reported in other studies [<xref rid="pone.0323907.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0323907.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. These disturbances disrupt learning and significantly impair the social functioning of the affected adolescent. The disturbed adolescent could manifest rebelliousness, substance use, social withdrawal, suicidal behavior, and deteriorating school performance as a result of the mental distress experienced.</p><p>In response to their knowledge about mental illnesses, adolescent participants mostly described overt mental health conditions. The respondents identified triggers of mental health conditions as sexual abuse, poverty, economic challenges, dysfunctional family relationships such as parents fighting, and misunderstandings between parent and child. Additional triggers that were reported were negative peer pressure, low self-esteem, especially during the period of adolescent physical changes, and attaining poor grades in school. Caregivers demonstrated knowledge of subtle symptoms of psychological disturbances.</p><p>Our findings corroborate with evidence from other research studies that have also associated mental illness with increasing poverty brought out by severe economic challenges [<xref rid="pone.0323907.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323907.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] in resource-constrained households. In terms of their attitudes, stigma towards persons with mental disorders was identified as a key problem that caregivers and adolescents struggled with, and this includes the use of stigmatizing language in describing persons with mental illnesses. This is a hindrance to seeking intervention in the community and with young people themselves.</p><p>In response to our questions about practices and behaviors towards individuals, especially adolescents and young people with psychological disturbances, our caregivers pointed out that parents feel guilty that they failed to protect their child when it is the youth who becomes unwell. We found that community members seek out spiritual interventions through prayers, and some community members demonstrate apathy towards persons with mental disorders. Young participants were very sensitive about this and mentioned that they think greater support and positive attitudes need to be shown towards vulnerable individuals living with mental illnesses.</p><sec id="sec020"><title>Caregiver mental health is a predictor of offspring&#x02019;s physical and mental health</title><p>A study carried out in Kangemi and Kariobangi informal settlements found that adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) were highly prevalent [<xref rid="pone.0323907.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In tandem with cross-cultural evidence on the family stress model, this study found that maternal ACEs are robust predictors for poor child mental health. These findings also apply to adolescents. Adolescents&#x02019; experiences of adversity and sexual or physical abuse have been associated with increased vulnerable attachment toward parents/caregivers. Poor socioeconomic status was also associated with higher problem behavior development as well as an insecure attachment with caregivers [<xref rid="pone.0323907.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Secure attachment, among others, was also reported as a protective factor for high-risk behaviors and the development of mental health problems later in life [<xref rid="pone.0323907.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec021"><title>Limitations</title><p>We conducted this study during the COVID-19 pandemic, so we could not freely and closely interact with our participants and observe their nonverbal expressions. We were also unable to obtain male caregivers; therefore, their views were not represented.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec022"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Psychosocial disturbance significantly affects the mental well-being of adolescents and impairs their performance of daily routine functions. This has far-reaching negative consequences for adolescents and caregivers, including violence, depression, and suicidal behavior. Therefore, it is imperative to develop sustainable community interventions that loop in the caregivers and all other key stakeholders to help reduce harmful exposures, strengthen resilience to recover from exposure to adverse experiences, and improve coping with everyday stressors. For instance, faith-based organizations and primary health centers can play a crucial role in promoting adolescent and community mental health by bridging gaps in mental health knowledge, reducing stigma, and increasing access to appropriate youth-friendly psychosocial interventions. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic had significant negative effects on the mental well-being of both adolescents and caregivers. Therefore, community mental health programs should address contemporary issues that are potential triggers of psychological disturbance. In the current context, caregiver and adolescent mental health needs to be addressed through prevention and mental health promotion campaigns. Community-based support would ensure that individuals maintain some resilience through this challenging period and build themselves better now and in the post-pandemic world.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Authors would like to thank other mentors in INSPIRE Kenya work, adolescents and their caregivers who participated, and a fantastic team of community health workers and health facility workers of Kariobangi and Kangemi for their support.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0323907.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Cortina</surname><given-names>MA</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Sodha</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Fazel</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Ramchandani</surname><given-names>PG</given-names></name>. <article-title>Prevalence of child mental health problems in sub-Saharan Africa: a systematic review</article-title>. <source>Arch Pediatr Adolesc Med</source>. <year>2012</year>;<volume>166</volume>(<issue>3</issue>):<fpage>276</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>81</lpage>. <comment>doi: </comment><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1001/archpediatrics.2011.592</pub-id>

</p><p>2. We note that the grant information you provided in the &#x02018;Funding Information&#x02019; and &#x02018;Financial Disclosure&#x02019; sections do not match.&#x000a0;</p><p>When you resubmit, please ensure that you provide the correct grant numbers for the awards you received for your study in the &#x02018;Funding Information&#x02019; section.</p><p>3. Thank you for stating the following financial disclosure:&#x000a0;</p><p>&#x0201c;Research reported in this publication was supported by the Fogarty International Center of the National Institutes of Health under Award Number K43TW010716, which also supported the contributions of MK to this work. The content is solely the responsibility of the authors and does not necessarily represent the official views of the National Institutes of Health. The qualitative inquiry is part of an embedded study protocol for the Measurement of Mental Health of Adolescents at population level (MMAP) led by UNICEF and the inquiry reported here was partially supported by UNICEF Innocenti office.&#x0201d;</p><p>Please state what role the funders took in the study.&#x000a0; If the funders had no role, please state: "The funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript." If this statement is not correct you must amend it as needed.&#x000a0;</p><p>Please include this amended Role of Funder statement in your cover letter; we will change the online submission form on your behalf.</p><p>4. Please note that funding information should not appear in the Acknowledgments section or other areas of your manuscript. We will only publish funding information present in the Funding Statement section of the online submission form. Please remove any funding-related text from the manuscript.&#x000a0;</p><p>5. We note that you have indicated that there are restrictions to data sharing for this study. For studies involving human research participant data or other sensitive data, we encourage authors to share de-identified or anonymized data. However, when data cannot be publicly shared for ethical reasons, we allow authors to make their data sets available upon request. For information on unacceptable data access restrictions, please see <ext-link xlink:href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability#loc-unacceptable-data-access-restrictions.&#x000a0;" ext-link-type="uri">http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability#loc-unacceptable-data-access-restrictions.&#x000a0;</ext-link></p><p>Before we proceed with your manuscript, please address the following prompts:</p><p>a) If there are ethical or legal restrictions on sharing a de-identified data set, please explain them in detail (e.g., data contain potentially identifying or sensitive patient information, data are owned by a third-party organization, etc.) and who has imposed them (e.g., a Research Ethics Committee or Institutional Review Board, etc.). Please also provide contact information for a data access committee, ethics committee, or other institutional body to which data requests may be sent.</p><p>b) If there are no restrictions, please upload the minimal anonymized data set necessary to replicate your study findings to a stable, public repository and provide us with the relevant URLs, DOIs, or accession numbers. Please see <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.bmj.com/content/340/bmj.c181.long" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.bmj.com/content/340/bmj.c181.long</ext-link> for guidelines on how to de-identify and prepare clinical data for publication. For a list of recommended repositories, please see <ext-link xlink:href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/recommended-repositories." ext-link-type="uri">https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/recommended-repositories</ext-link>. You also have the option of uploading the data as Supporting Information files, but we would recommend depositing data directly to a data repository if possible.</p><p>Please update your Data Availability statement in the submission form accordingly.</p><p>6. In this instance it seems there may be acceptable restrictions in place that prevent the public sharing of your minimal data. However, in line with our goal of ensuring long-term data availability to all interested researchers, PLOS&#x02019; Data Policy states that authors cannot be the sole named individuals responsible for ensuring data access (<ext-link xlink:href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability#loc-acceptable-data-sharing-methods)." ext-link-type="uri">http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability#loc-acceptable-data-sharing-methods</ext-link>).</p><p>Data requests to a non-author institutional point of contact, such as a data access or ethics committee, helps guarantee long term stability and availability of data. Providing interested researchers with a durable point of contact ensures data will be accessible even if an author changes email addresses, institutions, or becomes unavailable to answer requests.</p><p>Before we proceed with your manuscript, please also provide non-author contact information (phone/email/hyperlink) for a data access committee, ethics committee, or other institutional body to which data requests may be sent. If no institutional body is available to respond to requests for your minimal data, please consider if there any institutional representatives who did not collaborate in the study, and are not listed as authors on the manuscript, who would be able to hold the data and respond to external requests for data access? If so, please provide their contact information (i.e., email address). Please also provide details on how you will ensure persistent or long-term data storage and availability.</p><p>7. When completing the data availability statement of the submission form, you indicated that you will make your data available on acceptance. We strongly recommend all authors decide on a data sharing plan before acceptance, as the process can be lengthy and hold up publication timelines. Please note that, though access restrictions are acceptable now, your entire data will need to be made freely accessible if your manuscript is accepted for publication. This policy applies to all data except where public deposition would breach compliance with the protocol approved by your research ethics board. If you are unable to adhere to our open data policy, please kindly revise your statement to explain your reasoning and we will seek the editor's input on an exemption. Please be assured that, once you have provided your new statement, the assessment of your exemption will not hold up the peer review process.</p><p>8. Your ethics statement should only appear in the Methods section of your manuscript. If your ethics statement is written in any section besides the Methods, please delete it from any other section.&#x000a0;</p><p>9. Please include a separate caption for each figure in your manuscript.</p><p>10. Please review your reference list to ensure that it is complete and correct. If you have cited papers that have been retracted, please include the rationale for doing so in the manuscript text, or remove these references and replace them with relevant current references. Any changes to the reference list should be mentioned in the rebuttal letter that accompanies your revised manuscript. If you need to cite a retracted article, indicate the article&#x02019;s retracted status in the References list and also include a citation and full reference for the retraction notice.</p><p>[Note: HTML markup is below.

We will only publish funding information present in the Funding Statement section of the online submission form. Please remove any funding-related text from the manuscript.</p><p>Response:</p><p>5. We note that you have indicated that there are restrictions to data sharing for this study. For studies involving human research participant data or other sensitive data, we encourage authors to share de-identified or anonymized data. However, when data cannot be publicly shared for ethical reasons, we allow authors to make their data sets available upon request. For information on unacceptable data access restrictions, please see <ext-link xlink:href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability#loc-unacceptable-data-access-restrictions." ext-link-type="uri">http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability#loc-unacceptable-data-access-restrictions</ext-link>.</p><p>Before we proceed with your manuscript, please address the following prompts:</p><p>a) If there are ethical or legal restrictions on sharing a de-identified data set, please explain them in detail (e.g., data contain potentially identifying or sensitive patient information, data are owned by a third-party organization, etc.) and who has imposed them (e.g., a Research Ethics Committee or Institutional Review Board, etc.). Please also provide contact information for a data access committee, ethics committee, or other institutional body to which data requests may be sent.</p><p>Response: There are no ethical or legal restrictions on sharing data set. Our study received ethical approval from Kenyatta National Hospital-University of Nairobi Ethics review committee (<ext-link xlink:href="https://erc.uonbi.ac.ke/" ext-link-type="uri">https://erc.uonbi.ac.ke/</ext-link> ), whose contact is uonknh_erc@uonbi.ac.ke</p><p>b) If there are no restrictions, please upload the minimal anonymized data set necessary to replicate your study findings to a stable, public repository and provide us with the relevant URLs, DOIs, or accession numbers. Please see <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.bmj.com/content/340/bmj.c181.long" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.bmj.com/content/340/bmj.c181.long</ext-link> for guidelines on how to de-identify and prepare clinical data for publication.

You also have the option of uploading the data as Supporting Information files, but we would recommend depositing data directly to a data repository if possible.</p><p>Response: Thank you, we have uploaded our anonymized data as Supporting information file.</p><p>Please update your Data Availability statement in the submission form accordingly.</p><p>Response:</p><p>6. In this instance it seems there may be acceptable restrictions in place that prevent the public sharing of your minimal data. However, in line with our goal of ensuring long-term data availability to all interested researchers, PLOS&#x02019; Data Policy states that authors cannot be the sole named individuals responsible for ensuring data access (<ext-link xlink:href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability#loc-acceptable-data-sharing-methods)." ext-link-type="uri">http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability#loc-acceptable-data-sharing-methods</ext-link>).</p><p>Data requests to a non-author institutional point of contact, such as a data access or ethics committee, helps guarantee long term stability and availability of data. Providing interested researchers with a durable point of contact ensures data will be accessible even if an author changes email addresses, institutions, or becomes unavailable to answer requests.</p><p>Before we proceed with your manuscript, please also provide non-author contact information (phone/email/hyperlink) for a data access committee, ethics committee, or other institutional body to which data requests may be sent. If no institutional body is available to respond to requests for your minimal data, please consider if there any institutional representatives who did not collaborate in the study, and are not listed as authors on the manuscript, who would be able to hold the data and respond to external requests for data access? If so, please provide their contact information (i.e., email address). Please also provide details on how you will ensure persistent or long-term data storage and availability.</p><p>Response: Our study received ethical approval from Kenyatta National Hospital-University of Nairobi Ethics review committee (<ext-link xlink:href="https://erc.uonbi.ac.ke/" ext-link-type="uri">https://erc.uonbi.ac.ke/</ext-link> ), who can be contacted on email via uonknh_erc@uonbi.ac.ke</p><p>7. When completing the data availability statement of the submission form, you indicated that you will make your data available on acceptance. We strongly recommend all authors decide on a data sharing plan before acceptance, as the process can be lengthy and hold up publication timelines. Please note that, though access restrictions are acceptable now, your entire data will need to be made freely accessible if your manuscript is accepted for publication. This policy applies to all data except where public deposition would breach compliance with the protocol approved by your research ethics board. If you are unable to adhere to our open data policy, please kindly revise your statement to explain your reasoning and we will seek the editor's input on an exemption. Please be assured that, once you have provided your new statement, the assessment of your exemption will not hold up the peer review process.</p><p>Response: this is a qualitative data which can potentially be used to identify participants if several alternations are not made. We prefer not to share interview transcripts open-access but the senior author can provide upon reasonable request when contacted via email.</p><p>8. Your ethics statement should only appear in the Methods section of your manuscript. If your ethics statement is written in any section besides the Methods, please delete it from any other section.</p><p>Response: Thank you, we have deleted it from elsewhere and retained it in the methods section only</p><p>9. Please include a separate caption for each figure in your manuscript.</p><p>Response: Thank you, we have included figure captions (please see pages 5 and 8)</p><p>10. Please review your reference list to ensure that it is complete and correct. If you have cited papers that have been retracted, please include the rationale for doing so in the manuscript text, or remove these references and replace them with relevant current references. Any changes to the reference list should be mentioned in the rebuttal letter that accompanies your revised manuscript. If you need to cite a retracted article, indicate the article&#x02019;s retracted status in the References list and also include a citation and full reference for the retraction notice.</p><p>Response: Thank you, we have reviewed the references</p><p>Review Comments to the Author</p><p>Reviewer #1: It is an interesting topic; "If I tell you my problems, how will you perceive me?&#x0201d;: A Qualitative Appraisal of Mental Health Knowledge, Barriers, and Opportunities for Care among Kenyan adolescent's ."</p><p>1.
