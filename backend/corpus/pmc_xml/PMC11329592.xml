We aimed to determine the effects of a 4-week intervention with either an Acacia fiber (AF) with prebiotic properties or a probiotic <italic>Bifidobacterium Lactis</italic> (BLa80) supplement, compared to a control supplement, on stool pattern, IBS symptoms and Quality of Life (QoL), in IBS-C individuals.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">A parallel, double-blind, randomized controlled trial involving 180 subjects meeting the ROME IV criteria for IBS-C was conducted. Following a 4-week observation period, subjects received either AF (10&#x000a0;g), Probiotic BLa80 (4&#x000a0;g; 2&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>11</sup> CFU/g) or a maltodextrin placebo (10&#x000a0;g) daily for 4 weeks. Subjects reported daily information on stool pattern and gastrointestinal complaints. Before and after each 4-week period, questionnaires on symptom severity, constipation symptoms, anxiety and depression and QoL were completed.

It is characterized by abdominal pain associated with defecation or with changes in stool frequency or consistency. Around 30% of people with IBS suffer from IBS with predominant constipation complaints (IBS-C) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Constipation is characterized by straining, hard stools, and infrequent bowel movements, and greatly impacts individuals&#x02019; quality of life (QoL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Constipation in general increases the risk for diseases such as colorectal cancer, Parkinson&#x02019;s disease, cardiovascular disease, and all-cause mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par27">To date, no adequate treatment for IBS-C is available. This is partially due to the heterogeneity of people with IBS, the variability of symptoms over time, and the complicated pathology in which not all mechanisms are fully understood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. IBS is a multifactorial disease in which the intestinal cell wall, immune system, enteroendocrine cells, and the gut microbiota all have an important role [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The first therapeutic approach for people with constipation consists of diet and lifestyle changes, such as adequate fluid and fiber intake and regular exercise. For patients who do not respond to these modifications, laxatives are the mainstay of pharmacologic treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Long-term use of laxatives, however, can have side effects like metabolic disturbances and potentially harmful effects on the colon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Diet is a known trigger for IBS symptoms and the majority of people with IBS have reported a reduction or increase in symptoms with changing their diet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. It is, however, hardly known what the underlying mechanism is and what kind of nutrition and dietary compounds have the biggest impact. The need for therapies that effectively treat or relieve symptoms of IBS-C, and are safe to use on a chronic basis, remains unfulfilled [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par28">Studies that include various (prebiotic) fiber and probiotic compounds have indicated an improvement in stool frequency and consistency, and may be a promising solution to alleviate IBS-C-related complaints [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Probiotics have been studied most in relation to IBS, but it remains unclear which individual species and strains are most beneficial. Moreover, studies with prebiotic treatment appear to be sparse in people with IBS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Some of the reported effects of prebiotics and probiotics may have been mediated by increasing the <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> abundance in IBS-C patients, who have shown to have a relatively lower abundance of <italic>Bifidobacteria</italic> in their gut [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Previous research on acacia fiber (AF) has shown its prebiotic properties, with significant increases in <italic>Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium</italic> and <italic>Prevotella</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and its high digestive tolerance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] due to the slow fermentation rate throughout the colon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. In-house in vitro studies related to intestinal tryptophan metabolism and serotonin-related pathways, screening 45 compounds, have furthermore indicated that the AF and probiotic <italic>Bifidobacterium animalis</italic> subsp. Lactis (BLa80) may have beneficial effects on intestinal peristalsis (data not shown).</p><p id="Par29">Therefore, the objectives of the current study were to determine the effects of a 4-week intervention with either the AF supplement or the probiotic Bla80 supplement on stool pattern, which includes stool frequency, stool consistency, and stool mass, on gastrointestinal (GI) complaints, and on Quality of Life (QoL), in patients with constipation-predominant IBS (IBS-C).</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p id="Par30">This randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled human intervention study covered a total duration of 8 weeks, including three parallel treatment arms (See Fig <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref> supplementary data). The study consisted of an observation period of 4-weeks (week 1&#x02013;4), which was similar for all treatment arms, followed by a 4-week intervention period (week 5&#x02013;8). The observation period was added to assess the variation, without any treatment, for all outcome measures to be included as baseline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. During the intervention period subjects received either a probiotic supplement, a fiber supplement, or a placebo supplement, to serve as control. Stratified randomization, using random numbers, ensured balanced allocation across treatment groups for BMI, age, and sex. An independent, unblinded scientist conducted the randomization and assignment to the treatment groups after enrollment. Successful randomization was confirmed by the balanced distribution of baseline characteristics between the three treatment groups (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Study subjects and investigators remained blinded until all analyses were completed.</p><p id="Par31">The primary outcomes of this study were stool frequency, stool consistency and stool mass. Secondary outcomes, were IBS severity, constipation symptoms, anxiety and depression scores and QoL. Before the start of the study subjects were informed about all study procedures via an online information meeting. At the start and at the end of both study periods, subjects completed the validated questionnaires, consisting of irritable bowel severity scoring system (IBS-SSS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], the patient assessment of constipation symptoms (PAC-SYM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], the patient assessment of constipation Quality of Life questionnaire (PAC-QOL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], the Hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], and the Food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) to measure their habitual dietary intake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. During both study periods, subjects also completed short daily questionnaires via ecological momentary assessment (EMA) application on their phone (LifeData LLC, Marion, IN, USA), which recalled stool frequency and consistency, GI-complaints, and supplement compliance. Stool consistency was a self-reported scale and scored on the Bristol Stool Scale (BSC), ranging from hard pellets (score 1) to watery diarrhea (score 7) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. In case of a stool frequency of &#x0003e;&#x02009;1 stool per day, the BSC of the first stool was scored. The last 5 days of both the observation and intervention period, subjects were asked to collect and weigh all of their stools, in order to record a 5-day stool mass. To standardize this measurement subjects received a measurement scale and strict collection instructions. During the entire study, subjects were requested to maintain their normal routines concerning their diet and exercise patterns.</p><p id="Par32">The study was performed from March until July 2021 in the Netherlands and was conducted in a corona-proof setting, completely at home and online. An online information meeting was organized prior to the start of the study, to explain all study procedures and measurements. Ethical approval for the NUTRIC study was obtained from the Medical Ethical Committee of Utrecht. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04798417) and conducted according to the declaration of Helsinki. A digital written informed consent was obtained from each participant prior to inclusion in the study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study subjects and compliance</title><p id="Par33">We aimed to include 180 subjects with IBS-C in the study.

The daily dose was also divided in two sachets: one sachet (5&#x000a0;g) in the morning and one sachet in the evening. The same gradual increase from 5&#x000a0;g to 10&#x000a0;g divided over two sachets was chosen for the placebo (control) supplement consisting of maltodextrin (WeCare biotechnology Co., Ltd, Jiangsu, China), which is a frequently used placebo compound in IBS trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. For all supplements, the most effective and regularly consumed dosage was chosen in consolidation with literature and providers of the supplements.

According to the US FDA&#x02019;s guideline, a clinically meaningful change for IBS-C patients is an increase of more than 1 stool per week. Based on the delta values in our study, we observed that after 4-week consumption of AF, there was an increase of on average &#x00394;1.3 (&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.9) stools per week compared to the observation period. This increase exceeded the threshold established by the US FDA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. The effects of AF and probiotic BLa80 supplements on stool consistency and stool mass were not different from placebo. Probiotic Bla80 supplementation resulted in a significant decrease in IBS-SSS compared to placebo. AF supplementation resulted in a trend (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.10) towards higher responder rates for PAC-SYM compared to placebo, possibly due to increased stool frequency, which may result in relieving constipation-related complaints. Overall, the AF group seemed to have fewer constipation complaints at baseline compared to placebo, and all treatment groups reported softer stools at the start of the observation period (2.6&#x02013;2.9) compared to the ROME IV criteria for constipation (mostly scores 1&#x02013;2). All subjects were, however, classified with IBS-C based on those criteria during screening. The baseline values seem to have little impact on the results, but may have limited the room for improvement. All treatment groups reported mild GI symptoms (abdominal pain, bloating, and flatulence), indicating that supplements were well-tolerated.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Probiotic treatment and IBS-C</title><p id="Par66">The decrease in IBS-SSS for the probiotic BLa80 group may be attributed to an increase in <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> abundance, since prior studies indicated a relatively lower abundance of <italic>Bifidobacteria</italic> in patients with IBS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Although, the observed improvement cannot definitively be attributed to an increase in the abundance of Bifidobacteria within this study, since the abundance was not evaluated within this trial. Previously, it has been suggested that an increase in Bifidobacteria might alleviate IBS symptoms due to the potential increase in fecal bacterial mass and colonic motility, leading to a decreased transit time and improvements in immune function due to effects on inflammatory cytokine production and gut barrier function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].</p><p id="Par67"><italic>Bifidobacterium lactis</italic> was previously reported to have beneficial effects on stool pattern in patients with constipation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], and to result in overall symptom severity relief in 34 people with IBS-C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. However, the latter study did not use a validated method to measure symptom severity. The reduction of more than 50 points on the IBS-SSS after 4 weeks probiotic BLa80 treatment in significantly more (53% probiotic vs. 29% placebo) patients is considered a clinical meaningful change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], and is comparable or even higher compared to studies with a longer treatment period using other probiotic strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. The increase in stool frequency after BLa80 treatment (&#x00394;0.8&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;2.0 stools/week), however, is somewhat lower compared to previous research. A recent meta-analysis of 6 RCTs, involving 663 IBS-C patients with a duration of 2&#x02013;4 weeks, showed that Bifidobacterium lactis supplementation resulted on average in a significant increase of 1.51 stools per week [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Overall, these data indicate that probiotics with Bifidobacterium seem to reduce IBS symptoms, but not all in a similar manner and to a similar extent. This variability could be linked to both the dosage of Bifidobacterium administered and the level of colonization achieved in the gut. In the present trial, a dosage of 4&#x000a0;g containing 2 times 10<sup>10</sup> CFU/g was administered, whereas dosages of Bifidobacterium in prior trials involving IBS patients ranged from 10<sup>7</sup> CFU/day to 1.25&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>9</sup> CFU/day, indicating lower levels compared to those used in the current trial.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Prebiotic treatment and IBS-C</title><p id="Par68">Studies investigating the effect of fibers with prebiotic properties on IBS-C relief appear to be sparse. Although not studied before in patients with IBS, previous human studies with AF demonstrated its prebiotic properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], which can potentially increase colonic biomass, fecal bulk and subsequently affect stool frequency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. This might explain the observed increase in stool frequency in IBS-C patients after AF treatment (&#x00394; 1.3&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.9 stools/week). Earlier in-house in vitro experiments suggest that this effect of AF might be attributed to an induced increase in intestinal serotonin levels (data not shown), which is previously linked to an increased stool frequency and reduced constipation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Compared to other studies with prebiotic or soluble fibers, AF seems to have a comparable or even more pronounced effect on stool frequency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Meta-analyses on constipation show an average improvement of 1.01 stools per week with 10&#x02013;15&#x000a0;g prebiotic inulin or galacto-oligosacharides supplementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>], whereas psyllium fiber supplementation resulted in an improvement of 0.9 stools per week [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. In accordance with earlier conducted human studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], AF was well tolerated in IBS-C patients. This might be linked to the specific progressive fermentation of AF through the distal part of the colon as measured with a Twin Shime experiment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Importance of a placebo controlled trial</title><p id="Par69">High placebo response rates, between 27% and 34%, are common in studies among patients with IBS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Some of the subjective study parameters showed improvements over time, independent of treatment group. For IBS symptom severity, a placebo responder rate of 29% was observed in our study, which is in line with previous studies involving IBS patients. This underlines the importance of including a parallel placebo group in intervention studies among patients with IBS. The susceptibility of this study population to placebo effects, and high interindividual variation in subjective complaints, potentially limits the chance of finding additional significant effects of specific dietary supplements.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Strengths</title><p id="Par70">All 180 study participants were recruited and included in the same period (March 2021, &#x02013; May 2021), reducing the impact of external factors such as seasonal changes. Despite the high number of participants and relatively long study duration compliance to study procedures was high. A preceding observation period of 4 weeks may have diminished the placebo effect in patients with IBS, as people were already accustomed to be involved in a study.</p><p id="Par71">This study included self-reported outcome measures, which is common in studies involving IBS patients, since there are no conclusive objective outcome parameters for IBS. All measures were validated questionnaires. Participants recorded daily stool frequency and GI symptoms to mitigate potential recall biases. Collecting daily data is important in this population, as the day-to-day variability in stool pattern differs greatly between and within IBS-C patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. When only questioning and reporting a weekly average, the effects of a treatment may go unnoticed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>], and this may introduce recall biases.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Limitations and recommendations</title><p id="Par72">The current study encountered a higher drop-out rate than initially anticipated, resulting in a slightly underpowered analysis with 55 to 57 subjects per treatment group for the primary outcome parameters. A minimum of 58 subjects were required according to our sample size calculation. However, we do not expect this shortfall to have had a significant impact on our results. Future studies should consider including a larger study population, to even more effectively surpass the strong placebo effect. A longer study period (&#x0003e;&#x02009;3 months) may also help diminish the strong placebo effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>], although this may be challenging for compliance and drop-out rates. Additionally, subpopulation analyses or stratification for habitual dietary intake, symptom severity, serotonin or transit time-related effects should be considered, which could provide further insight into potential underlying mechanisms. Since prebiotic fibers and probiotics are potentially complementary to each other, future studies could also explore incorporating a synbiotic group to assess the synergistic effects.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par73">This study shows that 4-week daily supplementation with 10&#x000a0;g AF or 4&#x000a0;g (2&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>11</sup> CFU/g) probiotic BLa80 has a beneficial effect on stool frequency in IBS-C patients. The effect of AF on stool frequency was a clinical meaningful change, while probiotic BLa80 also improves IBS symptom severity. Both supplements may aid in relieving IBS constipation symptoms. Placebo effects may have influenced the size of significant treatment effects and hampered the identification of additional effects of supplementation on more subjective outcome markers. Further research is needed to obtain better understanding of IBS pathogenesis and the mechanisms of action of potential treatments.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.</p><p>
