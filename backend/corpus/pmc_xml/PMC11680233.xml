Human transferrin receptor 1 (hTfR1) has been identified as the main receptor for JUNV for virus entry into host cells. To date, no treatment has been approved for JUNV. Herein, we investigated 12 anti-hTfR1 VHH (variable domain of the heavy chain of heavy-chain antibody) antibodies and confirmed their interaction with hTfR1. Most of them could bind to the hTfR1 apical domain, which is the glycoprotein 1 (GP1) binding domain of JUNV.

We also verified that 18N18 blocked the interaction between hTfR1 and JUNV GP1. In addition, 18N18 could neutralize another New World arenavirus, the Machupo virus. Using AlphaFold 3-based simulation of 18N18&#x02013;hTfR1 docking, we determined that 18N18&#x02019;s binding epitope was located at the JUNV GP1 binding epitope. 18N18 represents a candidate for JUNV treatment and provides a potential approach that could be applied to New World arenaviruses.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Jun&#x000ed;n viruses</kwd><kwd>Machupo viruses</kwd><kwd>VHH antibody</kwd><kwd>transferrin receptor 1</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>This research received no external funding.</funding-statement></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-viruses-16-01951"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Several New World arenaviruses cause human hemorrhagic fevers. Among them, Argentine hemorrhagic fever, caused by Jun&#x000ed;n virus (JUNV) infection, and Bolivian hemorrhagic fever, triggered by Machupo virus (MACV) infection, are two severe hemorrhagic fever diseases that are mainly prevalent in South America [<xref rid="B1-viruses-16-01951" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Both exhibit high mortality rates of about 15&#x02013;30%, thus posing a significant public health threat [<xref rid="B2-viruses-16-01951" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. These diseases are mainly transmitted to humans via rodents. The clinical features include fever, severe myalgia, bleeding tendency, shock, nerve abnormalities, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia. The rodents, the drylands vesper mouse (<italic toggle="yes">Calomys musculinus</italic>) and the large vesper mouse (<italic toggle="yes">Calomys callosus</italic>), are the primary natural hosts of JUNV and MACV, respectively [<xref rid="B2-viruses-16-01951" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-viruses-16-01951" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. For rodents, infection is usually mild or asymptomatic. However, humans can be infected through contact with the rodents or their secretions, excretions, contaminated food, or virus-carrying aerosols, subsequently developing hemorrhagic fever.</p><p>To date, research on MACV has been limited, and there are no approved vaccines or specific therapeutics for MACV. For JUNV, there are only a few vaccines and antibodies in development. Candid#1, a live attenuated vaccine for JUNV, is only applied in the adult population at high risk in epidemic zones. Utilization of Candid#1 has been associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of AHF. Candid#1 was attenuated using a pathogenic JUNV isolate (XJ), serially passed through guinea pigs and mice in cell culture [<xref rid="B4-viruses-16-01951" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However, there is a greater safety risk associated with administering live attenuated vaccines to children, pregnant women, and individuals with weakened immune systems [<xref rid="B5-viruses-16-01951" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-viruses-16-01951" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Moreover, there are no specific antiviral medicines available for the clinical treatment of JUNV infections. Ribavirin and favipiravir, categorized as broad-spectrum antiviral drugs, have exhibited some activity against the JUNV and have been utilized in specific clinical scenarios [<xref rid="B7-viruses-16-01951" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-viruses-16-01951" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, these drugs are only moderately effective in primate models [<xref rid="B9-viruses-16-01951" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-viruses-16-01951" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-viruses-16-01951" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>The only standard specific treatment for this disease is the transfusion of convalescent plasma [<xref rid="B1-viruses-16-01951" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Researchers have demonstrated that antibodies titers in immune plasma correlate directly with the therapeutic efficacy achieved [<xref rid="B12-viruses-16-01951" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Nevertheless, treatment using this method is effective only during the first week of infection [<xref rid="B12-viruses-16-01951" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-viruses-16-01951" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-viruses-16-01951" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Furthermore, plasma therapy has many drawbacks, such as some advanced neurological syndromes in patients treated with plasma, the limited availability of immune plasma, and the risk of transfusion-transmitted diseases [<xref rid="B1-viruses-16-01951" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Although experts suggest using Candid#1 immune plasma as an alternative, the neutralizing antibody titers in vaccinated individuals are significantly lower compared with those in convalescent patients [<xref rid="B15-viruses-16-01951" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>To circumvent the above risk, antibody-based therapies play a crucial role in countering viral infections. Various targets are under investigation to generate antibodies against JUNV [<xref rid="B16-viruses-16-01951" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-viruses-16-01951" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-viruses-16-01951" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Neutralizing antibodies targeting the JUNV glycoprotein precursor (GPC) are among the most extensively studied. Similarly to other arenaviruses, envelope GPC forms the spike on the surface of the virus, which is essential for viral adhesion to host cells and membrane fusion. GPC consists of stable signaling peptides (SSPs), envelope glycoprotein-1 (GP1), and envelope glycoprotein-2 (GP2). The head of the glycoprotein spikes is made up of a GP1 trimer [<xref rid="B19-viruses-16-01951" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Therefore, relevant antibodies typically prevent the virus from binding to its receptor by targeting GP1. GD01 and OD01 [<xref rid="B20-viruses-16-01951" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], two of the earliest JUNV-neutralizing antibodies, have been subjected to detailed structural studies, making substantial contributions to the body of knowledge regarding JUNV neutralization [<xref rid="B21-viruses-16-01951" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-viruses-16-01951" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. A humanized antibody, hu99, has shown some protective efficiency in non-human primates [<xref rid="B18-viruses-16-01951" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In another study, various neutralizing antibodies were isolated from an individual vaccinated with Candid#1, and their binding epitopes and broad spectrum were analyzed [<xref rid="B23-viruses-16-01951" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In that study, CR1-28 was identified as a neutralizing antibody against JUNV with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) of 0.09 &#x003bc;g/mL. CR1-07 is another neutralizing antibody, which has an IC<sub>50</sub> of 0.63 &#x003bc;g/mL. In addition, some antibody candidates targeting GP1, such as JUNV1 [<xref rid="B24-viruses-16-01951" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and J99 [<xref rid="B25-viruses-16-01951" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], have also been verified in pseudoviruses or in live attenuated vaccine Candid#1 to have certain neutralizing activities. Antibodies targeting the viral N protein have also been screened to neutralize Candid#1; however, they failed to block the pathogenic JUNV strain [<xref rid="B17-viruses-16-01951" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Although there are already some JUNV-neutralizing antibodies, they have a limited efficacy against MACV and other New World arenaviruses. In particular, antibodies that target GPC have difficulty achieving broad-spectrum neutralization, possibly because of substantial sequence variability at the receptor binding site. The GP1 segment exhibited a sequence identity that varied between 24% and 44% in JUNV, MACV, and certain other New World arenaviruses [<xref rid="B23-viruses-16-01951" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Specifically, MACV has a longer loop 10, which is different from JUNV and other New World arenaviruses, and this poses a barrier to antibody cross-neutralization. This has been analyzed in studies of OD01, GD01, and CR1-28 [<xref rid="B23-viruses-16-01951" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B26-viruses-16-01951" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>There is evidence that the human transferrin receptor 1 (hTfR1) acts as the primary infectious receptor for both JUNV and MACV. The expression of hTfR1 in hamster cell lines substantially enhanced infection by JUNV and MACV pseudoviruses [<xref rid="B27-viruses-16-01951" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Some properties of hTfR1 suggest a potential role in the replication and pathogenesis of arenaviruses. For instance, hTfR1 can be rapidly endocytosed into an acidic vesicle, which is consistent with the requirement for an acidic environment for viral infection [<xref rid="B28-viruses-16-01951" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. hTfR is expressed at high levels on rapidly dividing cells, including macrophages and activated lymphocytes, which are also prime targets for arenavirus infection [<xref rid="B15-viruses-16-01951" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B27-viruses-16-01951" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In addition, hTfR1 is highly expressed in endothelial cells, which are considered pivotal in the pathogenesis of viral hemorrhagic fevers [<xref rid="B29-viruses-16-01951" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Moreover, the upregulation of hTfR1 on immune cells activated by the infection could potentially enhance viral replication within these cells, which accounts for the observed high lethality [<xref rid="B27-viruses-16-01951" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Structural analysis of hTfR1 and virus GP1 confirmed that the viruses mainly bind to the apical domain of hTfR1 [<xref rid="B30-viruses-16-01951" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Moreover, JUNV and MACV bind to almost the same epitope of hTfR1 [<xref rid="B30-viruses-16-01951" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Therefore, antibodies targeting the receptor, hTfR1, might have a broad ability against New World arenaviruses. There are also antibodies targeting hTfR1 that are used to block JUNV infection; for example, Ch128.1 effectively inhibits the invasion of various New World hemorrhagic fever arenaviruses [<xref rid="B16-viruses-16-01951" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B31-viruses-16-01951" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><p>Most previously studied antibodies are traditional IgG antibodies and no anti-hTfR1 VHH antibody (variable domain of the heavy chain of heavy-chain antibody) has been developed for JUNV infection. A single-domain antibody (sdAb) is a fragment only containing the variable region of heavy-chain antibodies, including the VHH from camels or alpacas and the VNAR (variable domain of new antigen receptor) from rays or sharks [<xref rid="B32-viruses-16-01951" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. These sdAbs are only nano-sized; therefore, they are easier to engineer or construct with other drugs or antibodies [<xref rid="B33-viruses-16-01951" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. SdAbs have a long complementary-determining region 3 (CDR3), which provides access to cryptic epitopes that conventional monoclonal antibodies cannot reach [<xref rid="B33-viruses-16-01951" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Furthermore, their good water solubility is conducive to large-scale production and formulation development in the process of drug research and development [<xref rid="B33-viruses-16-01951" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B34-viruses-16-01951" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="B35-viruses-16-01951" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p><p>Herein, we describe a chimeric VHH antibody, 18N18, which was isolated from an alpaca immune library using phage display and fused with human Fc. 18N18 exhibited high affinity for hTfR1 and specifically bound to the apical domain. We tested the neutralization ability of 18N18 against both the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-vectored lentiviral Jun&#x000ed;n pseudoviruses and the recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-vectored Jun&#x000ed;n pseudoviruses. Then, using bio-layer interferometry (BLI) technology, we confirmed that 18N18 could block the interaction between JUNV GP1 and hTfR1. The neutralizing activity of 18N18 against HIV-vectored Machupo pseudoviruses, another New World arenavirus, was also assessed. The result indicated that 18N18 could also neutralize pseudotyped MACV. Subsequently, we simulated its interaction with hTfR1 computationally and confirmed the competitive inhibition between the antibody and JUNV GP1. In summary, 18N18 is a potential candidate molecule for JUNV- and MACV-neutralizing antibodies that target the receptor, providing a reference for future research into New World arenaviruses.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-viruses-16-01951"><title>2. Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2dot1-viruses-16-01951"><title>2.1. Immunization of the Alpaca</title><p>The alpaca (<italic toggle="yes">Lama pacos</italic>) was immunized with hTfR1. Briefly, purified hTfR1 was mixed with Ferund&#x02019;s complete adjuvant for the first immunization or with incomplete adjuvant for the following immunizations.

The result showed high structural conservation between MACV and JUNV GP1 (<xref rid="viruses-16-01951-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>B). By structure alignment, superposition, and replacement, a conjectural structure of the JUNV GP1&#x02013;hTfR1 complex was obtained (<xref rid="viruses-16-01951-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>C). AlphaFold 3 was then used to dock 18N18 and hTfR1, and the docking model with the highest ranking score was compared with the structure of JUNV GP1-hTfR1 (<xref rid="viruses-16-01951-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>D). Based on this model and evidence of competition from the BLI assay (<xref rid="viruses-16-01951-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>E), it was confirmed that 18N18 sterically hinders the interactions between JUNV GP1 and hTfR1 (<xref rid="viruses-16-01951-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>E,F). We also docked 18N13-1 and 18N15 to hTfR1 (<xref rid="app1-viruses-16-01951" ref-type="app">Figure S5</xref>). The binding sites of these two antibodies to TfR1 were distinct from the binding sites of JUNV GP1, which was consistent with the results of neutralization experiment, and also explains the difference between binding activity and neutralizing activity.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec4-viruses-16-01951"><title>4. Discussion</title><p>This study aimed to obtain an sdAb targeting hTfR1 that could neutralize JUNV. Through in vitro analysis, sdAb 18N18 exhibited neutralization ability against JUNV. In addition, we used BLI to confirm that the neutralizing effect of the sdAbs results from their blocking of the binding of Jun&#x000ed;n virus GP1 and hTfR1.</p><p>In previous studies, most antibodies targeted JUNV GP1, which is crucial for virus attachment. These neutralizing antibodies have different broad-spectrum neutralizing abilities due to their distinct binding epitopes. For instance, antibody CR1-07 could cross-neutralize MACV, whereas antibody CR1-28 could not. The reason for this difference is that, while the JUNV GP1 and MACV GP1 share a high degree of structural similarity, the distinctive loop 10 in MACV GP1 impedes the antibody binding of CR1-28. [<xref rid="B23-viruses-16-01951" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In addition, antibody epitopes targeting the virus might become inactivated if the virus undergoes mutations. Moreover, the high variability of GP1 among New World arenaviruses has also limited the development of broad-spectrum neutralizing antibodies.</p><p>Pathogenic New World arenaviruses bind to a shared region within the apical domain of hTfR1, where two major physiological ligands of hTfR1, transferrin (Tf) and hereditary hemochromatosis protein (HFE), do not bind [<xref rid="B39-viruses-16-01951" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="B40-viruses-16-01951" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="B41-viruses-16-01951" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Thus, developing antibodies targeting the apical domain of hTfR1 might be an effective therapeutic strategy to broadly inhibit infections by New World arenaviruses without substantially interfering with iron metabolism. Previous studies have confirmed that antibodies targeting hTfR1 can produce good neutralizing activity against JUNV [<xref rid="B31-viruses-16-01951" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In addition, because JUNV and MACV bind to similar epitopes of TfR1, antibodies that bind to those epitopes have the potential for broad-spectrum neutralizing activity, and this has also been verified in previous studies [<xref rid="B16-viruses-16-01951" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B30-viruses-16-01951" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In this study, we confirmed that 18N18 can also neutralize the MACV pseudovirus.</p><p>Prior studies also indicated that anti-TfR1 therapy might impact iron uptake. Researchers have revealed that antibodies against TfR1 can produce certain cytotoxicity to cells [<xref rid="B42-viruses-16-01951" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Indeed, studies have reported that anemia appeared in monkeys after the administration of anti-TfR1 antibodies [<xref rid="B42-viruses-16-01951" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="B43-viruses-16-01951" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The antibody&#x02019;s blocking of the interaction between Tf and TfR1, subsequently affecting iron uptake, was identified as a primary cause of this anemia. Additionally, some anti-hTfR1 antibodies have been reported to impact colony formation. The mouse anti-hTfR1 antibody V3/25, which does not inhibit Tf binding to hTfR1, the mouse IgG1 43/31, which inhibits the interaction between Tf and hTfR1, and the mouse anti-hTfR1 IgA 42/6, which inhibits Tf binding via steric hindrance, were studied [<xref rid="B34-viruses-16-01951" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="B44-viruses-16-01951" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The results of these studies suggested that the toxic effects of anti-hTfR1 antibodies depend partly on whether the antibody inhibits the binding of Tf to hTfR1. Moreover, Tf typically binds to the helical and protease-like domains of TfR1 [<xref rid="B45-viruses-16-01951" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Therefore, an antibody that binds to the apical domain of TfR1, which is farther from the Tf binding epitope, might be safer compared with antibodies that block Tf binding. Studies on antibody ch128.1 also confirmed that anti-hTfR1 antibodies targeting the hTfR1 apical domain appear to be safer than antibodies targeting regions that overlap Tf binding regions [<xref rid="B31-viruses-16-01951" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In our study, 18N18 targets the hTfR1 apical domain and does not interfere with the interaction between Tf and hTfR1; therefore, it might be safer than antibodies that block Tf. However, further experimental verification is needed.</p><p>18N18 is a VHH antibody, a type of antibody that exhibits several advantages in therapeutic development. They are easier to engineer because of their small size; therefore, they can be paired with other antibodies for enhanced neutralization, or conjugated with indicators to serve as research tools [<xref rid="B46-viruses-16-01951" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Moreover, VHHs are easily produced and highly soluble, which are good properties for medicinal use [<xref rid="B32-viruses-16-01951" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Indeed, several sdAbs have been approved for marketing, the first of which was Caplacizumab developed by Ablynx Inc., which is used to treat acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. There are also neutralizing VHHs under evaluation in clinical trials, such as ALX-0171, also developed by Ablynx Inc., which could be used to treat respiratory syncytial virus infections.</p><p>However, sdAbs are small, with a molecular mass of around 15 kDa; therefore, they are eliminated more quickly than IgG because of the clearance of small molecules by the kidneys. This results in a shorter half-life, which ranges from a few minutes to tens of hours. Therefore, various approaches are usually employed to prolong their half-life. Fusion with an IgG Fc fragment is a common method, and herein, we used this method to prolong the half-life of the sdAbs for future in vivo evaluation and to make it easier to purify them. Other methods, such as fusion with human serum albumin (HSA) binding domains [<xref rid="B47-viruses-16-01951" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] or with anti-HSA antibodies [<xref rid="B48-viruses-16-01951" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="B49-viruses-16-01951" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], are also frequently used in therapeutic antibody development. For conventional antibodies, a short half-life might be a disadvantage; however, for antibodies targeting the receptor, a short half-life helps sdAbs avoid long-term action in the body, which could affect the normal physiological functions of the receptor.</p><p>In this study, we obtained a series of anti-TfR1 VHH antibodies, among which 18N18 exhibited a good neutralizing effect against two types of JUNV pseudoviruses compared with other candidate antibodies. Its IC<sub>50</sub> against the HIV-vectored pseudovirus was 1.1168 nM. Moreover, in neutralization against the VSV-vectored pseudovirus, 18N18 also showed better neutralization, with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 0.0136 &#x003bc;M, compared with 18N20-1 and 18N20-2. Notably, it was found that the binding activity of the antibodies to the TfR1 apical domain (<xref rid="viruses-16-01951-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>D) was not consistent with their neutralization activity <bold>(</bold><xref rid="viruses-16-01951-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>C). For instance, both 18N13-1 and 18N18 exhibited strong binding to TfR1 apical domains, but 18N13-1 did not exhibit high neutralizing activity, which might be because 18N13-1 did not bind to the neutralizing epitopes. We also analyzed the binding epitopes of these antibodies to TfR1, including the detection of the antibodies&#x02019; binding activity to the TfR1 apical domain by ELISA, as well as the docking of 18N18 with TfR1 using AlphaFold 3. As an antibody targeting the human receptor, 18N18 exhibited a cross-protective ability against pseudotype of another New World arenavirus, MACV. Analysis of the interaction between 18N18 and hTfR1 confirmed that 18N18 blocked the binding of JUNV to hTfR1. In the future, the broad-spectrum neutralization ability of 18N18 could be investigated.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank Yunzhou Yu and Chen Gao for their valuable discussions on the results.
