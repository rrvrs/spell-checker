Relationships in the workplace serve a variety of purposes, such as task assistance, career advancement, and emotional support [<xref rid="pone.0323620.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. This study focuses specifically on workplace relationships in terms of nurse-physician, nurse- manager and nurse-to-nurse workplace relationships and will focus on both positive workplace relationships or collegiality, as well as negative workplace relationships or workplace violence (WPV). Positive workplace relationships foster collaboration, trust, open communication, mutual support and innovation, creating a safe and enjoyable environment [<xref rid="pone.0323620.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. A negative workplace relationship involves threats, abuse or assault that jeopardize an employee&#x02019;s health or wellbeing and safety, including during commuting [<xref rid="pone.0323620.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Decades of research on nurse&#x02010;physician workplace relationships showed that the main facilitators and barriers influencing the relationships included: (1) communication and collaboration; (2) roles and responsibilities; (3) hierarchy and education; and (4) liability [<xref rid="pone.0323620.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323620.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Positive relationships between nurses and physicians are associated with improved nurse-perceived patient safety and quality of care [<xref rid="pone.0323620.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0323620.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], with better communication and collaboration between the two professions resulting in improved patient and nurse outcomes, a positive practice environment, and decreased cost of healthcare [<xref rid="pone.0323620.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0323620.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Nurse management, leadership, and support of nurses are highly correlated with nurse outcomes, perceptions of the practice environment [<xref rid="pone.0323620.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], quality of care and patient safety [<xref rid="pone.0323620.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], as well as nurse and patient satisfaction [<xref rid="pone.0323620.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The nurse managers have a direct or indirect impact on the quality of care and patient safety. A direct impact is through outcomes such as staff satisfaction with job factors, staff health and wellbeing, and processes such as staff&#x02019;s relationships with work, their colleagues, and the organization [<xref rid="pone.0323620.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. An indirect association of leadership with quality of care and patient safety was found in patient mortality ([<xref rid="pone.0323620.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323620.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], complications of immobility [<xref rid="pone.0323620.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], medication errors [<xref rid="pone.0323620.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], patient falls [<xref rid="pone.0323620.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], pressure ulcers [<xref rid="pone.0323620.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], hospital-acquired infections [<xref rid="pone.0323620.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]) and length of hospital stay [<xref rid="pone.0323620.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>It is well documented that hospital environments are often plagued by vertical and horizontal workplace violence in the form of physical and psychological abuse, which disrupts collegial workplace relationships and healthcare delivery [<xref rid="pone.0323620.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Vertical violence is a pattern of behavior that is usually directed against subordinates and is directed at someone who occupies a position at a lower or higher level of the hierarchical scale. Several studies have identified nurse managers and senior staff members [<xref rid="pone.0323620.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], as well as physicians [<xref rid="pone.0323620.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] as perpetrators of workplace violence. In the 2019&#x02013;2020 American Nurses Association (ANA) and Healthy Nurse, Healthy Nation (HNHN) Survey, 23% of nurses reported having encountered vertical aggression or bullying from people in positions of authority [<xref rid="pone.0323620.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. A pattern of aggressive behaviors, such as bullying and intimidation, between nurses who are at the same rank level in the hierarchy is known as horizontal violence [<xref rid="pone.0323620.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In South Korea, 82% of nurses indicated being exposed to some form of horizontal violence [<xref rid="pone.0323620.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], while in Cape Town, South Africa, 44% of nurses working in public hospitals had experienced horizontal violence [<xref rid="pone.0323620.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>Workplace violence includes physical and psychological abuse. Physical workplace violence involves using force such as shoving, biting, pinching, shooting, kicking, slapping, stabbing, or sexual assault, regardless of injury [<xref rid="pone.0323620.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Psychological abuse is defined as using offensive language or words that disrespect an individual&#x02019;s dignity and worth, leading to abusive, humiliating, intimidating, and insulting behaviors [<xref rid="pone.0323620.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Furthermore, Khoshknab et al. [<xref rid="pone.0323620.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] are of the view that although physical and psychological violence is common, psychological violence occurs more frequently. According to a recent review by Mobaraki et al. [<xref rid="pone.0323620.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], the most prevalent forms of workplace violence are, in order of prevalence from most to least common: verbal, physical and psychological.</p><p>A substantial amount of research has been done concerning workplace violence and its effect on the nurse, but less is known about its eroding effect on quality of care and patient safety [<xref rid="pone.0323620.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Internationally workplace violence have been linked to compromised quality of care and patient safety [<xref rid="pone.0323620.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] resulting in adverse events such as hospital acquired infections [<xref rid="pone.0323620.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] patient mortality [<xref rid="pone.0323620.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], medication errors [<xref rid="pone.0323620.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], patient falls and pressure ulcers [<xref rid="pone.0323620.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. However, there is a dearth of such literature in developing countries.</p><p>A systematic review [<xref rid="pone.0323620.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] revealed that 62.3% of nurses experienced workplace violence in Africa, with recent studies done in Botswana [<xref rid="pone.0323620.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], Nigeria [<xref rid="pone.0323620.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], Ethiopia [<xref rid="pone.0323620.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] and Ghana [<xref rid="pone.0323620.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] all indicating poor nurse-physician collaboration within developing countries leading to a breach in patient safety [<xref rid="pone.0323620.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Although recent studies in South Africa concluded that patient and families were the main perpetrators of workplace violence in emergency units [<xref rid="pone.0323620.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] and psychiatric hospitals [<xref rid="pone.0323620.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] but in the private healthcare sector horizontal workplace violence was the most common [<xref rid="pone.0323620.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].</p><p>Although much is published on the effect of workplace violence on the nurse, less is known about the effect on quality of care and patient safety, especially in the African context [<xref rid="pone.0323620.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323620.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Therefore, this study will focus on how workplace relationships influence the quality of care and patient safety as well as the frequency of work-related, personal and physical workplace violence between nurses and physicians, their managers and nursing colleagues.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec009"><title>Methods</title><p>South Africa has a dual healthcare system, namely a public sector that provides care to approximately 83% of the population of the country, and a private sector that provides care to the rest of the population [<xref rid="pone.0323620.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The study was conducted in the public healthcare sector of the North West Province (NWP) of South Africa. A cross-sectional survey design was applied in this study, using a valid and reliable self-administered, paper-based survey that measures five variables, namely the Practice Environment Scale of the Nurse Work Index (PES-NWI), Negative Acts Question Revised (NAQ-R), quality of care, patient safety, and adverse events, and selected nurse and unit demographics.</p><sec id="sec010"><title>Positive workplace relationships or collegiality</title><p>The PES-NWI was used to measure positive workplace relationships or collegiality regarding the nurse-physician relationship and the nurse-manager relationship. The following two subscales were used: nurse manager ability, leadership, and support of nurses; and collegial nurse-physician relations. This scale consists of 11 questions answered on a Likert scale from 1 to 4, where 1 represents strongly disagree and 4 strongly agree; a mean score of 2.5 and more indicates a positive practice environment. Scores on the PES-NWI are valid and reliable for measuring the nursing practice environment across samples in the United States (US) and non-US countries [<xref rid="pone.0323620.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0323620.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] with the subscales having a Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha of 0.88 (Nurse participation in hospital affairs); 0.84 (Nursing foundations for quality of care); 0.84 (Nurse manager ability, leadership, and support of nurses); 0.75 (Staffing and resource adequacy); and 0.89 (Collegial nurse-physician relationships) respectively.</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Workplace violence</title><p>Workplace violence was calculated using the NAQ-R (Negative Acts Questionnaire&#x02013;Revised). There are three subscales that make up the NAQ: work-related, personal, and physical workplace violence. In this study, only the personal and physical workplace violence subscales were included. These comprised 15 questions, with responses on a Likert scale of 1&#x02013;5, with 1 being never and 5 denoting daily. Subscale items are calculated and averaged to determine subscale scores.

Purposive sampling was also applied to select the hospitals in the public sector, including the regional and district hospitals (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;3) neighboring the largest tertiary hospital in the province. There is no central hospital in the NWP. When choosing the study&#x02019;s units and participants, all-inclusive sampling was used. The study covered every in-patient setting, including the emergency rooms and theatres. The participants included community service nurses, enrolled nurses, auxiliary nurses, registered nurses, and midwives. Nurses who have worked in the chosen hospital for less than three months may not be able to provide an overall assessment of factors such as the working environment, quality of care, or patient safety within their units or even hospitals since they are still new employees, this was used as an exclusion criterion. Participants were recruited through the researcher presenting the research project to eligible participants in every in-patient unit to both day and night shift, whereafter they had 24 hours to choose whether to participate or not. The distribution of 319 (N) surveys at the tertiary hospital resulted in 123 (N) returned surveys; distribution of 146 (N) surveys at the regional hospital resulted in 72 (N) returned surveys; and distribution of 76 (N) surveys at the small district hospital resulted in 41 (N) returned surveys. There was a total of n&#x02009;=&#x02009;236 nurses in the overall sample. For the class of models like the ones used in this study [<xref rid="pone.0323620.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] sample size of 200 provides sufficient statistical power to conduct the exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modelling. Statistical estimation involving a sample of 200 typically results in stable estimates of selected fit indices used to determine the degree of fit between the pattern of relationships in the data and those proposed in a model [<xref rid="pone.0323620.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec016"><title>Data collection</title><p>Data was collected from 11&#x02013;23 April 2021.

After receiving goodwill consent from the respective Chief Executive Officers, they served as gatekeepers and referred the researcher to the nursing service managers of the facilities, who acted as mediators for the study. The nursing service managers had to select an independent person to assist with data collection. When no independent person could be appointed, the principal investigator employed a research assistant for this purpose.</p><p>The researcher explained the project to potential participants in each of the units of the selected hospitals, in the presence of an independent person.

Descriptive statistics were used to present the demographic data of the participants. Confirmatory factor analysis, and Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha were conducted to ensure the validity and reliability of the scales. Factor scores were derived by calculating the means of the questions within each factor. The correlations between workplace relationships, quality of care, patient safety, and adverse events were conducted using Spearman&#x02019;s rank-order correlations. Independent t-tests, ANOVAs, and Spearman&#x02019;s rank-order correlations were conducted to determine the association between participant demographics and workplace relationships. Cohen&#x02019;s d effect sizes were used to determine the importance of the differences in means, where 0.2 is considered as small, 0.5 as medium, and 0.8 as large. The magnitude of correlations is regarded as the effect size, where 0.1 is considered as small, 0.3 as medium and 0.5 as large.

Regarding the PES-NWI, nurse manager ability, leadership, and support of nurses (M=2.45; SD 0.79) is below the mean of 2.5, indicating that it is not experienced as contributing towards a positive practice environment, although collegial nurse-physician relationships were experienced positively (M=2.86; SD 0.71). Regarding quality of care, nurses were only somewhat confident that patients and their caregivers could manage their care after discharge (M=2.52; SD 0.88), while other items such as quality of care delivered to patients (M=2.12; SD 0.78) and recommending your workplace to family and friends needing healthcare (M= 2.02; SD 0.96) were experienced positively. Patient safety issues included nurses being only somewhat confident that management would act to resolve problems in patient care that nurses identified (M=2.59; SD 0.99) and being neutral with regard to relying too much on temporary, float, or agency staff (M=3.28; SD 1.42), staff feeling that their mistakes are held against them (M=2.53; SD 1.27), and lack of support for staff involved in patient safety errors (M=2.71; SD 1.32).

On average, participants experience more personal workplace violence than physical workplace violence. A higher incidence of workplace violence was associated with specialty training. Personal workplace violence had more effect on quality of care, patient safety, and adverse events than physical workplace violence, both having the most impact on recommending their place of work to family and friends needing healthcare, communication errors, and lack of support for staff involved in patient safety errors. Overall, nurse managers&#x02019; ability, leadership, and support were not experienced as positively contributing to the practice environment and had the most effect on quality of care and patient safety, especially with regard to management resolving problems in patient care, communication errors, and recommending their place of work to family and friends needing healthcare. Collegial nurse-physician relationships were experienced as contributing positively to the practice environment, and after nurse managers&#x02019; ability, leadership, and support, these had the most effect on quality of care and patient safety, and specifically on adverse events, namely medication errors, patient falls after admission and healthcare-associated infections. The nursing category was linked to perceptions of leadership, management, and support of nurses. Finally, increased exposure to COVID-19 patients resulted in nurses having more positive perceptions of collegial nurse-physician relationships.</p><p>Leadership, management, and support of nurses were not perceived to be present in the practice environment; in addition, it was also perceived that managers/supervisors were most frequently the perpetrators of workplace violence.

It is apparent that managers/supervisors influence nurses&#x02019; exposure to workplace violence in both direct and indirect ways. Direct factors include using workplace violence as a disciplinary measure, to sustain hierarchical work practices, top-down driven leadership, leadership voids, and lack of interpersonal skills; while indirect factors include the normalization of workplace violence, indifference to ethical issues related to bullying, and/or a lack of managerial abilities to address the phenomenon [<xref rid="pone.0323620.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. A systematic review concluded that when nurse managers practice moral leadership and attentively address nurses&#x02019; individual concerns while maintaining their privacy, they are less likely to perpetrate workplace violence and reduce its occurrence. When nurses practice authoritarian leadership the likelihood of workplace violence increases [<xref rid="pone.0323620.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Furthermore, when levels of stress increase like they did during the pandemic, those with greater perceived power often express more aggression and those who perceive themselves as less powerful often believe that their only option is to submit and abide [<xref rid="pone.0323620.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>This is a problematic finding, as it is also leadership, management, and support of nurses that had the most impact on nurse-perceived quality of care and patient safety. It is well established from systematic reviews on nurse leadership [<xref rid="pone.0323620.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0323620.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] that leadership, management, and support of nurses have an impact on nurse, patient, and system outcomes. However, of all of the studies included in the systematic reviews, only two were from Africa [<xref rid="pone.0323620.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>], and these focused only on nurse outcomes. Authors agree that managers/supervisors have both a direct and indirect impact on patient outcomes: directly due to the fact that they make decisions about human resource variables (e.g., staffing and resources, overtime) that are connected to patient care outcomes [<xref rid="pone.0323620.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], and indirectly through the health and wellbeing of nursing staff that impact on work performance (e.g., job satisfaction, turnover intention) [<xref rid="pone.0323620.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>], as well as through the quality standards of the organization (e.g., consultation and involvement of nurses in decision making, education, and training) [<xref rid="pone.0323620.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>].</p><p>According to the systematic review of Wong et al. [<xref rid="pone.0323620.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] leadership directly impacts patient outcomes regarding five aspects: patient satisfaction; patient mortality; adverse events (behaviour problems, restraint use, complications of immobility, fractures, medication errors, patient falls, catheter use, pressure ulcers, inadequate pain management, and hospital-acquired infections); complications; and patient healthcare utilisation. These patient outcomes include patient reports, nurse-perceived assessments, and actual recorded incidents, all of which are considered reliable forms of measuring patient outcomes, especially nurse-perceived assessments [<xref rid="pone.0323620.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>].</p><p>A focus on leadership development, as well as the recruitment and retention of relationally orientated leaders, are therefore crucial to improving patient, nurse, and organizational outcomes. A systematic review on leadership education interventions [<xref rid="pone.0323620.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] has shown that although these interventions differ widely with regard to programme content, length, and delivery, most showed significant increases in self-reported leadership and observed leadership practices. However, such interventions must be evidence-based, theoretically grounded, and incorporate cultural, social, and the institution&#x02019;s contextual factors [<xref rid="pone.0323620.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>].</p><p>Collegial nurse-physician relationships were experienced as contributing positively to the practice environment, and after nurse managers&#x02019; ability, leadership, and support, this aspect had the most effect on nurse-perceived quality of care and patient safety, especially on the incidence of adverse events. This is in accordance with the international literature on the topic, where collegial nurse workplace relationships have positive effects on quality of care and patient safety, including patient satisfaction [<xref rid="pone.0323620.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>], recorded incidents of patient outcomes [<xref rid="pone.0323620.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and nurse-perceived assessments [<xref rid="pone.0323620.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0323620.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. An interesting finding from this study is that increased exposure to COVID-19 patients resulted in nurses having improved perceptions of physician-nurse collaboration. This may point to the fact that there was better collaboration and communication between nurses and physicians when caring for COVID-19 patients, due to the sheer volume and changes in the workplace environment related to the COVID-19 pandemic. This was also confirmed by Matusov et al. [<xref rid="pone.0323620.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>], who reported increased team interdependence and appreciation among nurses and physicians during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>Personal workplace violence was experienced more than physical workplace violence, and this finding is concurrent with those of international studies [<xref rid="pone.0323620.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. In Africa, studies have reported workplace violence rates ranging from as low as 26.7% in Ethiopia [<xref rid="pone.0323620.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>] to as high as 85% in South Africa [<xref rid="pone.0323620.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. In all cases, the most common type of workplace violence was found to be non-physical violence [<xref rid="pone.0323620.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Also, personal workplace violence had a greater effect than physical workplace violence on nurse-perceived quality of care, patient safety, and adverse events. Interestingly, workplace violence had the most effect on recommending their place of work to family and friends needing healthcare, communication errors, and lack of support for staff involved in patient safety errors. In a systematic review conducted by Lanct&#x000f4;t and Guay [<xref rid="pone.0323620.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], the outcomes of workplace violence include seven categories of consequences: physical, psychological, emotional, work functioning, relationship with patients/quality of care, social/general, and financial stress [<xref rid="pone.0323620.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Additionally, Lanct&#x000f4;t and Guay [<xref rid="pone.0323620.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] found that among the selected articles in their review, only ten of them addressed issues related to relationships with clients or quality of care [<xref rid="pone.0323620.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>], with most articles indicating a reduction in quality of care and patient safety. Again, workplace violence education interventions are linked to a decrease in workplace violence, due to the fact that identification of incidents is improved, reporting increases, and therefore situations can be addressed and dealt with; it also improves communication, clarification of roles and responsibilities between professionals, and knowledge of how to address workplace violence incidents [<xref rid="pone.0323620.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>].</p><p>Specialization level was linked to an increased perception of workplace violence, and this was also found by international studies [<xref rid="pone.0323620.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. Interestingly, it was not linked to specialty units, as found in other South African studies [<xref rid="pone.0323620.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. Also, perceptions of the practice environment with regard to leadership, management, and support of nurses were linked to nursing categories, with lower-ranked categories experiencing this subscale more positively than higher-ranked categories. It is generally found in regional and national literature that lower-ranked categories rate the practice environment, quality of care, and patient safety more positively than their higher-ranked counterparts [<xref rid="pone.0323620.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. The common argument for this is that education and training bring greater knowledge and awareness of the practice environment, quality of care, and patient safety.</p><sec id="sec025"><title>Limitations</title><p>Nurse-nurse relationships were only measured through the presence of workplace violence, and not collegial or positive relationships; this is a limitation considering that in all instances both nurse-physician and nurse-manager collegial or positive relationships had a greater impact on quality of care, patient safety, and adverse events than workplace violence or negative relationships did. There are two main instruments used to measure collegiality: a 72-item survey titled Nurse-Nurse Collaboration Scale (NNCS), with reliability scores of 0.66&#x02013;0.99 [<xref rid="pone.0323620.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>], and a 54-item survey titled Colleague Solidarity of Nurses Scale (CSNS), with reliability scores of 0.63&#x02013;0.80 [<xref rid="pone.0323620.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. Due to the extent of the scales, it was decided not to include these surveys in the study, and the PES-NWI does not dedicate a portion to nurse-nurse collegial relationships. Further study of workplace relationships is necessary, considering their implications for nurses, patients and organisations. There is also a specific need for studies addressing the management of workplace violence episodes, especially violence perpetrated by co-workers or patients, visitors and patient family members. As well as studies that assess the efficacy of associated measures. This study has some limitations, including its reliance on cross-sectional data, which makes it difficult to draw a conclusion on the causal relationship between collegial relationships and care quality, patient safety, and adverse events. The results of this study, which only included hospitals from the NWP of South Africa, cannot be applied to other contexts. In addition, the province&#x02019;s hospitals were purposefully sampled; nonetheless, despite the sampling&#x02019;s vast participant pool, it was not a probability sample.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec026"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study showed that collegial relationships or positive relationships had a greater impact on quality of care, patient safety and adverse events than workplace violence or negative relationships did. The most important collegial relationship was the nurse-manager relationship, as it had the most impact on quality of care and patient safety; this is problematic as quality of care and patient safety were not perceived as being present in the practice environment of the study participants, as well as the fact that nurse managers/supervisors were experienced as being the greatest perpetrators of workplace violence. Nurse-physician relationships had an impact on quality of care, patient safety, and especially adverse events, indicating that improved nurse-physician relationships improved perceptions of quality of care, patient safety, and adverse events. Also, increased care of COVID-19 patients improved nurses&#x02019; perceptions of the nurse-physician collegial relationship, indicating increased collaboration and communication between the professions. Personal workplace violence had a greater effect on quality of care, patient safety, and adverse events than physical workplace violence.</p><sec id="sec027"><title>Relevance to clinical practice</title><p>It is clear from the findings that urgent attention must be directed towards leadership development, as well as to the recruitment and retention of relationally orientated leaders, as this aspect is perceived negatively in the participants&#x02019; current practice environment, even though it is most highly correlated with quality of care and patient safety. It would seem that the best method to improve leadership practice is through leadership education interventions; these should be evidence-based, theoretically grounded, and based on the local culture, social practices, and context, as these show the most improvement in leadership practices. Researchers especially recommend the combination of experiential learning, such as mentorship and coaching, and action learning [<xref rid="pone.0323620.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Although workplace violence or negative relationships also impacted on quality of care, patient safety, and adverse events, it appeared from the findings that focusing on the development of collegial or positive relationships would have a greater impact not only on patient outcomes but also on nurse- and organisation outcomes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec028"><title>&#x02018;What does this paper contribute to the wider global clinical community?&#x02019;</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Positive workplace relationships or collegiality seemed to have a greater impact on nurse-perceived quality of care and patient safety than workplace violence.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Of all relationships, nurse-manager&#x02019;s/supervisors&#x02019; relationships had the greatest impact on nurse-perceived quality of care and patient safety.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Nurses&#x02019; perceptions of the nurse-physician relationship improved as their nursing exposure to COVID-19 patients increased.</p></list-item></list></sec></body><back><ack><p>None.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0323620.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Sias</surname><given-names>PM</given-names></name>. <article-title>Workplace relationship quality and employee information experiences</article-title>. <source>Commun Stud</source>. <year>2005</year>;<volume>56</volume>(<issue>4</issue>):<fpage>375</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>95</lpage>.</mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0323620.ref002"><label>2</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Colbert</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Yee</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name>, <name><surname>George</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name>. <article-title>The Digital Workforce and the Workplace of the Future</article-title>. <source>AMJ</source>. <year>2016</year>;<volume>59</volume>(<issue>3</issue>):<fpage>731</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>9</lpage>. <comment>doi: </comment><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.5465/amj.2016.4003</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0323620.ref003"><label>3</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><name><surname>Menard</surname><given-names>KI</given-names></name>. <source>Collegiality, the nursing practice environment, and missed nursing care</source>.
