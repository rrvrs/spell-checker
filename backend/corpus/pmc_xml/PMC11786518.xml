Nevertheless, it remains unclear how dementia-specific care is currently provided and what can be derived from this for the improvement of dementia-specific care. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the provision of dementia-specific care and related problems in German nursing homes.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">We used a holistic multiple case design with a total of four cases. The cases were defined as care units in which residents living with dementia were cared for. For data collection, we used problem-centered face-to-face interviews, document analysis, and context questionnaires and analyzed all qualitative data inductively and deductively using content structuring qualitative analysis. To identify case-specific and cross-case patterns and themes, we focused on similarities and differences between the cases. The reporting followed the EQUATOR reporting guideline for organizational case studies.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">We interviewed 21 professionals, 14 relatives and 8 residents living with dementia. Despite context-specific differences, we identified a variation of care practices and problems in applying person-centered, dementia-specific care in German nursing homes. In all cases, these belong to the following topics: 1) <italic>handling neuropsychiatric symptoms,</italic> 2) <italic>dealing with communication difficulties,</italic> 3) <italic>providing person-centered interaction and communication,</italic> 4) <italic>dealing with stress caused by experiencing dementia-specific symptoms</italic> and 5) <italic>using and sharing knowledge</italic>. Even though the problems were identified in all cases, we also found differences in the extent and perception of these problems across the analyzed cases.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par4">Despite existing conceptual recommendations and described care practices in our study, the identified problems showed that current care practices are perceived as problematic and partly are not person-centered. This highlights that person-centered requirements in dementia-specific care are not yet adequately addressed and that there is a need to give greater consideration to the identified problems when developing interventions to improve quality of care. Furthermore, the identified context-specific differences in the extent and perception of these problems show that the designs of new care models should allow for more flexibility, so that written recommendations can be implemented in practice and adapted to given contexts.</p></sec><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12912-025-02726-5.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Dementia-specific care</kwd><kwd>Person-centered care</kwd><kwd>Delivery of healthcare</kwd><kwd>Advancing nursing care</kwd><kwd>Residential facilities</kwd><kwd>Qualitative research</kwd><kwd>Case studies</kwd><kwd>Needs assessment</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Deutsches Zentrum f&#x000fc;r Neurodegenerative Erkrankungen e.V.

As a result, nursing home care is becoming more and more complex. At the same time, the majority of care in German nursing homes is provided by nursing staff, about 50% of whom have a nursing-specific vocational training (three years of non-academic education to become a registered nurse) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. These nurses with at least three years of non-academic education will be called &#x0201c;nurses&#x0201d; in the whole article. The other half of the nursing staff employed in German nursing homes are nursing assistants, who have one to two years&#x02019; of non-academic nursing or non-specific training, or non-qualified staff. The proportion of "specialized nurses" in nursing homes (nurses with three years of non-academic education and one to two years of additional training, e.g., in geriatric-psychiatry, or academically trained nurses with a bachelor&#x02019;s or master&#x02019;s degree) is currently less than 1% of the nursing staff [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Due to recent political developments (e.g., a new mandatory tool for calculating nursing staff in German nursing homes) it is expected that the proportion of nurses and nursing specialists will continue to decrease in future, whereas the proportion of nursing assistants will continue to increase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par9">To be able to provide high-quality dementia-specific care for residents living with dementia, the general context conditions in German nursing homes, such as different qualification levels of nursing staff (nurses, specialized nurses, nursing assistants), need to be viewed, analyzed and evaluated within other specific requirements for dementia care. Therefore, it is necessary to consider a new skill mix and new role allocations that are in line with the complexity of dementia care. This offers the opportunity to create prospects for staff development and to ensure high-quality intra- and interprofessional care for residents living with dementia with complex care needs by advancing nursing practices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. One way to achieve these goals may be to develop and implement a nurse-led care model. Nurse-led care models in residential care are characterized by the fact that residents' care, from assessment to evaluation, is steered and coordinated independent and within the responsibility of a nurse with an advanced skill set. Here, coordination of care refers to the collaborative work of several actors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. To develop a tailored nurse-led and dementia-specific care model for German nursing homes, this model has to take into account both organizational and contextual challenges as well as content-related requirements of dementia care.</p><p id="Par10">With respect to the requirements of dementia care, there are existing recommendations in regulations and guidelines that describe high-quality dementia care. Internationally, these include for example the Dementia Care Practice Recommendations by the Alzheimer&#x02019;s Association for quality care practices that illustrate that the person-centered focus is the core of quality dementia care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. For Germany, regulations and guidelines for dementia care include the S3 guideline on dementia, which focuses primarily on medical diagnostic procedures and treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], as well as the National Expert Standard "Fostering and sustaining relationships in care for people living with dementia&#x0201d;, which focuses primarily on nursing and caring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. National Expert Standards can be used to define, implement and evaluate the quality of performance. Therefore, they highlight the specific contribution of nursing care to the health care of patients, residents and their relatives with regard to key quality risks and offer a basis for continuous improvement in the quality of care in healthcare facilities and nursing homes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The National Expert Standard mentioned above embeds relational specific care within person-centered dementia care and describes criteria to evaluate the care of people living with dementia according to the person-centered care approach by Kitwood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. This approach gives priority to the person and highlights possibilities for high-quality interactions to understand the person living with dementia and their psychosocial needs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Comparable to international recommendations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], the criteria described in the National Expert Standard include, for instance, training courses, psychosocial intervention approaches and aspects of the environment and milieu design that are intended to maintain or promote the feeling of people living with dementia to be heard, understood and accepted as well as to be connected with other people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par11">The idea behind the National Expert Standard was to achieve significant quality improvements in dementia care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However, the implementation of the National Expert Standard is not obligatory, and sustainability in practice has thus far been rated well, to varying degrees [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Further, there have been reviews internationally to reflect on the implementation of person-centered intervention aspects in nursing homes, concluding that a successful implementation of person-centered care remains challenging and is associated with different prerequisites and contextual conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Nevertheless, studies on the implementation of person-centered intervention aspects in German nursing homes are limited: a mini intervention to use information about meaningful situations in planning and providing care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], dementia care mapping [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], dementia-specific case conferences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and experts in person-centered care for the elderly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Next to that, few international studies have investigated how dementia-specific care is currently provided and organized in nursing homes and which problems are associated with that [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Although few studies in Germany also identified organizational characteristics of usual and dementia-specific care units [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], there are no studies to date that describe in detail the current provision of dementia-specific care and associated problems in Germany.</p><p id="Par12">Therefore, what remains unclear is how dementia-specific care for people living with dementia is provided in different nursing home contexts and which problems persist in the care of residents living with dementia in German nursing homes. Nevertheless, this understanding of daily practices and problems as well as context-specific differences is relevant for developing a tailored dementia-specific, nurse-led care model that can be implemented under real-life conditions and improve dementia care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Furthermore, this knowledge can help to reveal existing problems in dementia care even more explicitly &#x02013; also for the international research landscape &#x02013; to be able to discuss appropriate solutions for providing high-quality dementia care.</p><p id="Par13">Therefore, the aim of this study was to explore how dementia-specific care is provided in German nursing homes and to investigate the problems associated with current dementia-specific care in different nursing home contexts to derive relevant topics for the development of a dementia-specific, nurse-led care model.</p><p id="Par14">Our research questions were as follows:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par15">

Additional File <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). No study protocol was registered.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Design</title><p id="Par18">This study is part of a qualitative multiple case study that also examined professional collaboration in the care of people living with dementia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The design of the case study corresponds to a holistic multiple case design according to Yin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. This design is characterized by the consideration of multiple cases (we included four cases), which are all analyzed holistically. The design thus enables a comprehensive, in-depth examination of the individual cases (holistic analysis) as well as the examination of similarities and differences between the cases (multiple cases) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><p id="Par19">The cases were defined organizationally at the care unit level so that each case represented a real-world organization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The period of data collection (February to August 2022) and the context of the nursing homes as well as their affiliation with the federal state of North Rhine-Westphalia (Germany) formed the temporal and spatial boundaries of the cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par20">A holistic multiple case study was suitable for this research objective, as including multiple cases helped to get more robust findings and made it possible to explore and compare various care realities during the data analysis. Dealing with dementia-specific requirements was further analyzed holistically, taking into account different perspectives and contexts for each case to achieve a holistic understanding of current care practices and existing problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Further, the holistic design was chosen to stay focused on our research interest to examine the provision of dementia-specific care and related problems in different nursing home contexts.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study setting and participants</title><p id="Par21">Representatives of organizations, including nursing homes the DZNE (Deutsche Zentrum f&#x000fc;r Neurodegenerative Erkrankungen) Witten collaborates with, received information about the study and the conditions for participation via email. The nursing homes that were interested in participating contacted the researchers and got further details about the study. According to Yin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] and Creswell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], we purposefully selected four care units from different nursing homes located in the federal state of North Rhine-Westphalia that represented typical care units in German nursing homes (typical cases) and served as replication of the research question and method. When selecting the care units, we tried to achieve a certain heterogeneity of the care units (variations in the size, ownership and location of the care units). However, the association to the federal state of North Rhine-Westphalia was the only fixed inclusion criteria. We further included both usual care units and dementia-specific care units. Other specific types of care units (e.g., palliative care units, green farms) were excluded. Potential participants were identified and informed by the nursing home or care unit manager using a recruitment form as well as written information. If potential participants were interested in participating, the researchers were contacted by the nursing home manager.</p><p id="Par22">Our participants were residents living with dementia, relatives of residents living with dementia and internal and external professionals. To ensure that we included the perspectives of the residents living with dementia, our inclusion criteria for residents was, that they had to have both a medical approved dementia diagnosis and cognitive impairment according to the Dementia Screening Scale (DSS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. This means that the residents needed to have a DSS score above two [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Moreover, only residents who had lived in the selected care unit for at least four weeks prior to data collection were included. Regarding relatives, we only included relatives of residents living with dementia of the selected care unit. Further, we only included professionals, who 1) were working in (internal professionals) or with (external professionals) the selected care unit, 2) were providing care for residents living with dementia of the care unit, 3) had at least one year of professional experience, and 4) had an educational training in a care-related field. This included nurses with a minimum of three years of education, social workers, physicians, therapists as well as pharmacists. All professionals with less than three years of educational training in a care-related field were excluded from the study. Further, all interview participants with insufficient German language skills or the inability to interact in an interview situation were excluded. For residents living with dementia, this meant that communication difficulties per se were not a reason for exclusion, although the ability to interact with the researcher in an interview situation with the support of their relatives was a requirement. In those cases where an interview with the resident living with dementia was not possible, we included the resident's file in our document analysis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Data collection</title><p id="Par23">The data collection process took place from February to August 2022, and all the data were collected either in a quiet room in the nursing home or in the physicians&#x02019; practice. We used different data sources to describe and explore the cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p id="Par24">First, we conducted face-to-face problem-centered interviews [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] with residents living with dementia and relatives of residents living with dementia as well as problem-centered expert interviews [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] with internal and external professionals. Using Helfferich's method of collecting, checking, sorting and subsuming questions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], interview guidelines were developed for each interview type (residents living with dementia, relatives and professionals) on the basis of the National Expert Standard &#x0201c;Fostering and sustaining relationships in care for people living with dementia&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] to ensure that all relevant topics were discussed (s. Additional File <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>). The interviews were supplemented by clarification questions, a postscript and short questionnaires to collect data on sociodemographic characteristics, the health-specific characteristics of the residents and the job-specific characteristics of the professionals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. We conducted one pretest for each interview guideline. All interviews were then digitally audio-recorded and transcribed by an external transcription service. To make the interview situation as stress-free as possible for residents living with dementia, these interviews were conducted together with a relative or a trusted person, which could also have been a staff member. To prevent the relatives from emphasizing their perspective during the interviews with residents living with dementia, they were interviewed immediately before the interviews with the residents. All other interviews were designed as individual interviews to encourage the participants to talk openly about their experiences and wishes.</p><p id="Par25">As a second data source, the first author analyzed the nursing records of the residents living with dementia and documented selective passages of the care plans and daily reports from the last six months as verbatim quotes that focused on dementia-specific aspects of care. For this purpose, a template that covered the topics of the National Expert Standard was used. This included the same categories as the interview guidelines (s. Additional File <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>): involvement of residents living with dementia and relatives; interaction, communication and relationship building; problems in dementia-specific care; and care activities and measures for dementia-specific care. Since the documents could only be made available for a short period of time, this procedure corresponded to an extraction of the data in relation to predefined topics for subsequent coding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. The document analyses were carried out with those residents living with dementia with whom or with whose relatives the interviews were conducted. Following Yin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], this served to understand, corroborate, and augment the evidence from the interviews and context questionnaires.</p><p id="Par26">Third, we used context questionnaires for the case descriptions that included structural, financial, staff- and resident-specific aspects of the care units and nursing homes (s. Additional File <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>) and the Dementia Care Questionnaire (DemCare-Q) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] to collect data on dementia-specific interventions that are already implemented at the resident level. The context questionnaire and the DemCare-Q were assessed in conversations with the nursing home manager and sociodemographic questions for the sample description were answered by the participating relatives or professionals before the interviews started. Questions about the care of the residents living with dementia as well as sociodemographic and health-specific aspects were answered during conversations between the researcher and the participating residents or the nurses, who were responsible for the resident&#x02019;s care and by referencing the resident&#x02019;s file.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Data analysis</title><p id="Par27">Following Yin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], all the data were first merged at the case level for the data analysis. The quantitative data were analyzed descriptively for sample description. All other standardized data were analyzed narratively to provide case context descriptions and to supplement the qualitative data.</p><p id="Par28">The qualitative data were then analyzed following the individual steps of the content-structuring analysis by Kuckartz and R&#x000e4;diker [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Using an inductive-deductive approach, the first author developed main categories based on the interview guideline. These main categories were initially independently coded by KS and JD in three interviews. Afterwards, they were discussed, revised and complemented with inductive main categories as well as specified in category definitions and tested in another two interviews. Once a common understanding of the main categories was developed, KS coded all the interviews and developed subcategories inductively for each case to identify case-specific themes and patterns (within-case analysis). Passages of the nursing records (care plans or daily reports) were either coded to existing categories or shaped new categories, and descriptive material from the context questionnaires (context units) was consulted to better understand single coding units. To discuss and clarify subcategories, category definitions and subjective impressions, JD (<italic>Case C</italic>) and AF (<italic>Case A</italic>) also coded one case each.

The existing care practices and problems relate to the following topics: 1) <italic>handling neuropsychiatric symptoms</italic>, 2) <italic>dealing with communication difficulties</italic>, 3) <italic>providing person-centered interaction and communication</italic>, 4) <italic>dealing with stress caused by experiencing dementia-specific symptoms,</italic> as well as 5) <italic>using and sharing knowledge</italic>. When analyzing the problems identified in our study through the lens of person-centeredness as represented in the National Expert Standard, we found that fostering and sustaining relationships with residents living with dementia is perceived as one of the key issues. This appears to be primarily due to the progression of dementia symptoms and feelings of being helpless to provide tailored, individual care according to the residents&#x02019; needs.</p><p id="Par41">Below, we illustrate our results according to the identified topics (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). For each topic, we firstly describe existing care practices that were identified to deal with dementia-specific requirements and to provide person-centered dementia care. These care practices were described as well-known and used in everyday care. Secondly, we outline the associated problems experienced by the interviewees or documented in the records by the professionals. All these results are part of the cross-case analysis, illustrating similarities as well as differences between the cases.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Identified care practices and related problems</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12912_2025_2726_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig></p><sec id="Sec13"><title>1) Handling neuropsychiatric symptoms</title><p id="Par42">Cognitive impairments and neuropsychiatric symptoms associated with dementia are perceived as challenging by relatives and professionals <italic>in all cases</italic>, as they lead to changes in personality and impulse control as well as in the perception of reality and contribute to residents&#x02019; increased need for protection. <italic>In all cases</italic>, similar known and used care practices to address these requirements and to provide person-centered dementia care were described by relatives and professionals. These include:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par43">Providing a safe space (ensuring care; minimizing danger; creating a familiar environment; providing (daily) structure and continuity)</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par44">Conveying calmness (taking time; radiating calm and actively listening; reducing stimuli)</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par45">Providing medication (giving medication as needed; referring to psychiatry)</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par46">Providing distractions and activities (offering care activities; distracting with social activities)</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par47">Designing care flexibly (waiting for phases and trying later; changing the person or procedure; individualizing offers)</p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par48">Despite these existing care practices, problems in handling neuropsychiatric symptoms were identified by professionals and relatives <italic>in all cases</italic>. What works or does not work feels often like random luck for the professionals, and there are few ideas on what to offer, how to distract someone or how to respond to feelings and emotions in critical situations. <italic>In all cases</italic>, this gives professionals a feeling of insecurity and helplessness. "<italic>When I &#x02018;ve applied all my ideas and they don&#x02019;t work, then I'm left looking stupid</italic>" (Case A, professional 2). Daily mood swings and individual personalities of residents living with dementia further complicate general measures and forward-looking planning. In particular, agitated and aggressive behaviors, walking tendencies and defensive behaviors were described as difficult to handle <italic>across all cases</italic>. A failure to address agitation, aggression and walking tendencies significantly increases the self-endangerment of residents living with dementia as well as the risk of harm to others. Further, unaddressed defensive behavior can contribute to the inability to obtain necessary medical tests or care and to the need to administer medication on suspicion, which may worsen the general conditions of the resident (<italic>Cases B, C</italic>). On the other hand, restraining residents with walking tendencies or carrying out care despite residents displaying defensive behavior often results in increased agitation and aggression. Overall, these problems in handling neuropsychiatric symptoms lead to increase feelings of failure and helplessness <italic>in all cases</italic>, since it seems either that the staff cannot reach the residents or applied psychosocial interventions are not successful for a particular resident.

This leads to staff being overwhelmed and &#x02013; depending on individual staff &#x02013; inadequate reactions to neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as arguing with residents living with dementia, ignoring their behaviors or quickly administering medication without any reflection (<italic>Cases A, C</italic>).</p><p>

The reasons for that are simultaneous crises involving several residents as well as missing strategies how to handle these situations lead to a feeling of lack of time.

While in <italic>Cases A</italic> and<italic> D,</italic> it is assumed that walking tendencies are problematic to handle but not avoidable, and a standard procedure has been established (such as calling the police and relatives to search for the resident), <italic>Cases B</italic> and<italic> C</italic> focus more strongly on trying to prevent residents from leaving the nursing home. They describe these attempts as well as the negative consequences as significantly more problematic. Similarly, noisy behaviors are experienced as less problematic for those affected in <italic>Cases A</italic> and<italic> B</italic>, so that the challenges in dealing with them relate primarily to raising awareness of relatives and roommates in the context of crisis talks. However, in the other cases, the inability to reduce the noisy behavior is seen as problematic for both the affected person and their environment. In these cases, measures to exclude these residents living with dementia from the group were described as helpful and positive for themselves and others (<italic>Cases C, D</italic>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>2)&#x000a0;Dealing with communication difficulties</title><p id="Par56">Due to communication difficulties, conversations with residents living with dementia and the identification of their needs are perceived as difficult by relatives and professionals <italic>in all cases</italic>. Therefore, a different type of communication becomes necessary. Known care practices described and used by relatives and professionals to address this are similar <italic>in all cases</italic> and include:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par57">Enabling communication (choosing appropriate, simple words; addressing residents by their first name and with the informal personal pronoun, which is normally used for people you are familiar with on a personal level (family, friends); using biographical aspects; talking about everyday life; communicating nonverbally; validation and, in <italic>Case B</italic>, ritualized communication, a form of integrative validation, which is based on ritualized sentences or touches at the beginning and end of each interaction),</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par58">Trying to understand residents&#x02019; behavior (trial and error; changing the perspective)</p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par59">Nonetheless, <italic>in all cases</italic> both professionals and relatives describe problems in understanding residents&#x02019; needs. These problems are prevalent when residents can no longer express themselves verbally and their gestures and facial expressions cannot be interpreted (<italic>Cases B, C, D</italic>) or when residents are already in an acute crisis and are difficult to reach (<italic>Cases A, B</italic>). Outcomes that are perceived problematic include having to accept that the need will not be understood or continuing to experiment without knowing what the specific problem is (<italic>Case C</italic>). For residents living with dementia, this can lead to a feeling of being misunderstood, a loss of trust, anxiety, inner restlessness or aggression (<italic>Cases A, C, D</italic>).

Comparing the cases, <italic>Cases A, C</italic> and <italic>D</italic> criticize that the success of the measure depends on the attitudes of residents and staff. Accordingly, how residents react to validation and whether validation can be harmful or have the opposite effect to that intended is perceived as very individual. Similarly, an extensive knowledge base in validation techniques is seen neither as a prerequisite nor as a guarantee for successful implementation. Conversely, much information about the resident's biography and the formulations of validation are deemed necessary, which makes a targeted application impossible not only for nursing assistants and non-qualified staff (such as supporting every-day activities and cleaning) but also for nurses in acute situations. The perceived lack of meaningfulness of this measure ultimately contributes to the fact that validation is not consistently practiced as a measure in <italic>Cases A, C</italic> and <italic>D</italic> or that the attempted implementation is even ridiculed (<italic>Case D</italic>).</p><p>

Therefore, ritualized sentences or touches to start and end an individualized conversation with each resident are defined and documented.

The devaluation and disrespect is demonstrated, for instance, in a disrespectful tone and insults when communicating with residents living with dementia (<italic>Cases A, C, D</italic>) as well as in the reduction of residents to their behavior (<italic>Cases C, D</italic>) and is described as a reaction to specific behaviors or the underlying dementia diagnosis (<italic>Cases A, C, D</italic>).

<italic>In all cases</italic>, problems in dealing with staff stress relate to the fact that either stress is not communicated within the team (<italic>Case A</italic>) or staff do not receive any breaks and are permanently exposed to intense stress factors (such as loud noises, aggressive or defensive behavior of the resident) (<italic>Cases B, C, D</italic>). This leads to anxiety, excessive demands, frustration, resignation, inadequate care and, above all, a high level of burden and dissatisfaction.

This is problematic if the basis of the residents' behaviors cannot be understood or if the appropriateness of the staff&#x02019;s own behavior cannot be reflected upon (<italic>Cases A, B, D</italic>).

Even though these problems were found in all cases, we were able to identify differences in the extent and perception of these problems across the analyzed cases. The illustration of these context-specific and cross-context problems provides valuable information that need to be considered when developing interventions to improve long-term dementia-specific and person-centered care.</p><sec id="Sec24"><title>Similarities between the cases</title><p id="Par98">Our results illustrate that caring for residents living with dementia contribute to more complex and demanding care. Correspondingly, in all cases, the care practices reported to meet dementia-specific requirements include more than just basic care or social activities, and can be mostly assigned to the quality measures described in the National Expert Standard "Fostering and sustaining relationships in care for people living with dementia &#x0201c; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Furthermore, the care practices mentioned implicitly embed aspects of person-centered care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], even if they were not named as &#x0201c;resident-centered &#x0201c; or &#x0201c;person-centered&#x0201d; by any of the participants or in the nursing records. This is consistent with the findings of Colomer and de Vries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>], who showed that although nursing assistants in Ireland indirectly described person-centered interventions in their care activities, they did not identify and name them as &#x0201c;person-centered&#x0201d;. In particular, a lack of knowledge and understanding of person-centeredness was cited as a reason for this [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. These aspects also played a central role in our cases.</p><p id="Par99">The identified problems are in all cases based on the fact that known care practices are not considered helpful or cannot be implemented to a sufficient extent. Across the cases, this is primarily due to the underlying general context conditions in German nursing homes. The relevance of these conditions is in line with the theoretical model of person-centered care &#x02013; although not dementia-specific &#x02013; from McCormack and McCance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], which explains relevant prerequisites and environmental factors to implement person-centered processes. In addition to the existing lack of staff and time, our findings showed that the problems in <italic>using and sharing knowledge</italic> as well as <italic>dealing with stress caused by experiencing dementia-specific symptoms</italic> can be understood as problematic aspects of the prerequisites and the working environment. Accordingly, the problems in these subject areas can be assigned to the categories of professional competence, appropriate skill mixes, effective working relationships, joint decision-making and supportive organizational structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>].</p><p id="Par100">Similarly, international studies confirm the relevance of these general conditions in providing high-quality care for people living with dementia. They argue that problems are mainly based on the need for dementia-specific expertise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>], supportive leadership and a supporting working environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>], as well as highly qualified nurses as key persons in person-centered dementia care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Owing to the current staff situation in Germany and initiated changes in staff levels (increasing number of nursing assistants) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], it is expected that the quota of nurses and nursing specialists will further decrease. Therefore, these new skill mixes and the higher quota of nursing assistants need to be addressed through dementia-specific training, the implementation of highly qualified nurses, clear role allocations and intra- and interprofessional exchange formats to positively influence residents&#x02019; care quality as well as nurses&#x02019; job satisfaction and self-efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>].</p><p id="Par101">Furthermore, we identified problems in <italic>handling neuropsychiatric symptoms, dealing with communication difficulties and providing person-centered interaction and communication</italic> that relate to the internal level of the implementation of person-centered processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] in all cases. These problems indicate that the person living with dementia is not considered holistically, and that resident-specific wishes as well as values are not fully taking into account either in decision-making processes or in everyday care. The identified problems are consistent with the results of international studies regarding the perceived excessive demands in dealing with neuropsychiatric symptoms, the strong focus on group harmony rather than individualized person-centered care, the lack of understanding and interpretation of behaviors and emotions, and partly derogatory and disrespectful interactions and communication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. In contrast to other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], rigid care routines, fixation measures and unsuccessful interactions were clearly associated with the residents' behavior by the participants in our cases and the commitment&#x02014;to provide needs-oriented care for the residents&#x02014;was basically seen as given. Instead, a lack of effective care practices as well as support structures in the transfer and implementation of the well-known dementia-specific knowledge in everyday life was highlighted. This illustrates that not only formal qualifications, further training and "<italic>a palette of strategies to meet different situations</italic> &#x0201c; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>] are necessary to improve care. In contrast, competencies that promote a dementia-sensitive approach and understanding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>] and allow for the intuitive and situational use of knowledge to respond directly to the fluid reactions of residents living with dementia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>] and to timely share their observations with the professional team [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>] are needed. Thus, teaching models such as hands-on training, coaching, feedback for observed interactions, group discussions and role-playing for better communication and interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>] and a holistic view of the person [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>] should be explicitly considered in new care models. Besides, successful combinations of theoretical knowledge and practical exercises still need to be investigated in research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>].</p><p id="Par102">All care units included in this study were guided by the National Expert Standard and had either written dementia-specific care concepts, which referred to the person-centered approaches of Kitwood (<italic>Cases A, B</italic>) and validation according to Naomi Feil or Nicole Richard (<italic>Cases B, D</italic>), or DCM (<italic>Cases B, C</italic>) as a measure implemented on the institutional level. However, neither these guidelines nor the DCM were mentioned in any of the interviews or documents. Instead, professionals continued to rate the involvement of residents living with dementia in decision-making processes as limited or impossible, and all participants (residents, relatives, and professionals) expressed a strong desire for more individual and needs-oriented care activities in all cases. This is in line with the results of a German study by Nygaard and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>], who interviewed residents living with dementia and found that tailored, needs-oriented care appears to be necessary.</p><p id="Par103">Fazio and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>], Kitwood and Brooker [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] as well as Doyle and Rubinstein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>], among others, have also discussed the fact that person-centered care is a concept of action that has thus far been internalized insufficiently and that its implementation is not just a question of implementation strategies but also requires comprehensive cultural change. This was also confirmed in the pilot implementation of the National Expert Standard [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. Our findings add that despite the underlying guidelines, the understanding of what is considered dementia-specific care in practice often differs from theoretical approaches of person-centered care. Accordingly, some care units continue to have a stronger focus on how to manage behaviors or deal with the outcomes rather than asking &#x0201c;<italic>What is this person expressing, what is causing this reaction, and how can we respond to reduce their distress?</italic>&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Therefore, it seems to be important not only to implement person-centered concepts in practice in a sustainable way through cultural change but also to continuously evaluate and reflect how the concepts are understood and how great the interpretation gap between the theoretical concept and practice is. Regular sessions with trained experts that are supported by the management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>] to reflect on one&#x02019;s own attitude and the implementation of the concept in everyday practice as well as case conferences that emphasize the lifeworld of both the resident and the staff [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>] could contribute to a better understanding of person-centered care. Including these aspects in new care models would further support the creation of an appropriate person-centered culture and organizational mindset as part of collaborative practice development.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Differences between the cases</title><p id="Par104">Comparing our cases, more problems in dementia-specific care were described in <italic>Cases C</italic> and<italic> D</italic> than in <italic>Cases A</italic> and <italic>B</italic>. These differences may be explained not only by the different general conditions of the care units and nursing homes (e.g., number of beds, staff ratio, availability of a dementia-specific care concept) but also by the respective approach to the topic of dementia, the underlying attitudes of the professionals and the understanding of person-centered care. <italic>Case B</italic> is quantitatively better staffed than the other care units due to an additional financial regulation for a dementia-specific care unit. Additionally, the nursing staff in <italic>Case B</italic> is better trained and has access to a greater number of underlying concepts and dementia-specific activities. <italic>Case A</italic> also has a specialized nurse in geriatric-psychiatry at the care unit level, who provides expertise in dementia care, as well as a person-centered concept that prioritizes the needs of the residents. This is not the case in <italic>Cases C</italic> and <italic>D</italic>, even though <italic>Case C</italic> also has slightly more staff than usual due to an additional agreement for a house community concept. International studies confirm that context conditions in nursing homes such as the education of staff [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>], the physical environment and atmosphere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>], the amount of activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>] and the scope of person-centered approaches guiding the care process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>] can have an impact on the quality of dementia care. Higher qualified staff and a person-centered approach that is in line with theoretical concepts could be identified only in <italic>Case B</italic> &#x02013; the dementia-specific care unit. One qualitative study has reported the benefits of dementia-specific care units in terms of relationship work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. However, a systematic review has not been able to show clear benefits of dementia-specific care units [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. One reason for this could be that, despite a person-centered care culture and established measures, the same general problems in providing care exist. Accordingly, due to the clientele (mostly residents with severe dementia) and the more frequent occurrence of several crises at the same time as well as the more pronounced communication deficits of the residents living with severe dementia, the included dementia-specific care unit (<italic>Case B</italic>) also reached its limits, so that well-known measures were not sufficient to cope with these situations. Furthermore, a study by Stranz and S&#x000f6;rensdotter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>] showed how differently person-centered approaches, which are based on theoretical concepts, can and should be lived in different contexts according to the existing problems. Thus, the problems identified in our case study provide deeper insight into cross-context topics that should be included as core elements as well as context-specific subtopics that should be operationalized as peripheral elements in new interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. For the development of a new dementia-specific, nurse-led care model, it seems, therefore, elementary to consider the necessary flexibility that the care model should have so that existing strengths can be taken into account and relevant context-specific problems can be addressed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p id="Par105">By using a holistic multiple case study design, we were able to provide in-depth insights into the current situation by describing existing care practices in dementia care and related problems. Our results show how current care can be improved to achieve better outcomes for people living with dementia and the professionals caring for them. Through comparison of the cases, we were further able to present differences between dementia-specific care at the organizational level that have not been investigated before. As our participants were informed and recruited by the nursing home managers, these managers may have been more likely to contact satisfied relatives and residents and/or positive-minded professionals. On the other hand, it is also possible that more critical relatives and residents were more likely to respond to the research team. Both could have influenced the results. The professional sample was further based on a high proportion of nursing staff, as this group was particularly interested in participating. This fact should be reflected in the interpretation of the results, even though it allowed us to focus more on the perspectives of nurses, whose insight into dementia care is particularly important for the development of a dementia-specific nurse-led care model. Furthermore, we were not able to include all professional groups in every case because of a lack of willingness to participate. Finally, we did not include observations as part of our data collection, as this would have been very time-consuming. However, observational data could broaden our findings and should be considered in future studies.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par106">Despite existing recommendations and care practices used for applying person-centered dementia care in the included nursing homes, current dementia care is perceived as problematic and not person-centered. This highlights that there is still a gap between theoretical knowledge and transformation of that knowledge into practice. Therefore, future research and practice development should give greater consideration to intervention aspects that help staff to use theoretical knowledge as well as existing and well-known care practices during acute crises and to scrutinize the current understanding of dementia-specific care to promote a person-centered attitude and care culture. Moreover, the identified cross-case differences show that the design of new care models should allow for more flexibility so that these models can be adapted to given contexts and their success can be evaluated realistically in comparison to usual care, which is anything but homogeneous.</p></sec><sec id="Sec28" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>
