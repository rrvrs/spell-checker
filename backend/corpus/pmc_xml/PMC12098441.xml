Climatic models predict increases in average temperature, alteration in intensity, severity, and frequency of long-term drought conditions, and a higher risk of heat stress. Maize is one of the most important crops worldwide, and its production, measured as grain yield, is affected by drought at all developmental stages, mainly affecting grain yield and grain quality (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Reynolds and Langridge, 2016</xref>). Therefore, improving drought tolerance is an important goal of maize breeding.</p><p>Not only the grain fraction is affected by drought conditions, but also the compositional dynamics of the cell wall. The plant cell wall is a complex network of polysaccharides, phenolic compounds, and proteins that plays a fundamental role in maintaining cell structure, shape, and size (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Carpita et&#x000a0;al., 2001</xref>). Beyond its structural function, it also contributes to plant defense against biotic and abiotic stresses. In response to environmental challenges such as drought, plants exhibit a range of morphological and physiological adaptations, including both transient modifications and permanent restructuring of the cell wall (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Tardieu et&#x000a0;al., 2018</xref>). A key component of these responses is lignin, which regulates cell wall rigidity and water permeability, influencing drought tolerance in various plant species (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Hu et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Liu et&#x000a0;al., 2021</xref>). While many plants exhibit increased lignin deposition under water deficit conditions (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Liu et&#x000a0;al., 2021</xref>), maize presents a more variable response (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Alvarez et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Hu et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>). It has been demonstrated that water deficit induces significant changes in the main components of the cell wall. <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Emerson et&#x000a0;al. (2014)</xref> showed a reduction of the cellulose, lignin, and hemicellulose content in maize stover. Similarly increases in &#x003b2;-O-4-linked H lignin subunits in response to water deficit, while reduced lignin and p-coumaric acid contents have also been reported (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">El Hage et&#x000a0;al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Virlouvet et&#x000a0;al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Alvarez et&#x000a0;al (2008)</xref> found, under drought conditions, changes in compounds derived from the phenylpropanoid pathway. They argued that accumulating the derived monolignols in the xylem sap may suggest decreases in lignin biosynthesis. They also found increases in peroxidase activity, which may indicate greater cross-linking of cell wall components in response to water deficiency (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Passardi et&#x000a0;al., 2004</xref>). Additionally, drought-induced cellulose deposition has been proposed as a mechanism to preserve cell wall integrity and maintain turgor pressure, ensuring continued growth under stress (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Legland et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The quantitative importance of lignin in the cell wall, their structure, and the cross-linkages between cell wall components have variable detrimental effects on cell wall carbohydrate degradation (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Barri&#x000e8;re et&#x000a0;al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Grabber et&#x000a0;al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Ralph et&#x000a0;al., 2004</xref>). The changes in cell wall concentration and distribution described in response to water deficit affect cell wall degradability. In water deficit scenarios, an increase in cell wall degradability was associated with reductions in lignin and p-coumaric content within the wall and its preferential localization in cortical regions (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">El Hage et&#x000a0;al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, as water stress increased, agronomic performance declined gradually. However, the digestibility of dry matter (DM) and cell wall (CW) increased consistently regardless of the severity of water stress, accompanied by cell wall composition and structure modifications (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">El Hage et&#x000a0;al., 2018</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">El Hage et&#x000a0;al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Virlouvet et&#x000a0;al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Main et&#x000a0;al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>Here, we present a histological and biochemical study of thirteen maize inbred lines evaluated over two years in two locations (Pobra de Broll&#x000f3;n, Spain, and Mauguio, France) under contrasting water availability scenarios. Our objectives are to investigate the environmental and genetic impacts on histological and biochemical profiles, assess the response of <italic>in vitro</italic> cell wall digestibility to water deficit, and explore how this response is linked to changes in cell wall composition structure and distribution.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="s2_1"><title>Vegetal material and experimental design</title><p>A set of 13 inbred lines was sown in two locations fields in 2022 and 2023: Centro de Investigaciones Agrarias de Mabegondo-CIAM (Pobra de Broll&#x000f3;n, GPS, N: 42&#x02019; 33&#x02019;&#x02019;15.23, W -7&#x02019; 23&#x02019;&#x02019; 18.59) and DiaScope Experimental Unit (Mauguio; GPS, N: 43&#x02019;36&#x0201d;52.438/E: 3&#x02019;58&#x0201d;34.419). The 13 inbred lines were selected based on prior experience: inbred lines from Spanish germplasm banks EP1, EPD1, EPD6, EP42, EP105, CO384, PB130 and W64A were chosen due to their differences in cell wall composition (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">L&#x000f3;pez-Malvar et&#x000a0;al., 2021</xref>), while inbred lines from French germplasm banks F4, F7, F252, F7019 and F7025 were selected to represent a wide range of lignin content and cell wall digestibility (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">El Hage et&#x000a0;al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In Pobra de Broll&#x000f3;n, the inbred lines were evaluated following a split-plot design. Each irrigation condition (control and drought), comprised three blocks. Each experimental plot consisted of two rows, each row with 20 kernel hills planted manually, spacing between consecutive hills in a row being 0.22 m and 0.75 m between rows, obtaining a final density of ~60.000 plants.ha<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. Local agronomical practices were fulfilled. The two irrigation conditions were implemented by using pairs of tensiometers in each block per condition at -40cm depth, and pluviometers. A drip irrigation system was applied in the control blocks (PBWW) every 1.5 m, to achieve uniform irrigation. Irrigation was scheduled to water three days a week based on the water availability of the experimental field; resulting in 26 mm/week. In the water deficit blocks (PBWD), no irrigation was applied throughout the development of the experiment.</p><p>Similarly, at Mauguio, the inbred lines were evaluated following a randomized block design within each irrigation condition in an incomplete Latin square. Each irrigation condition comprised three blocks. Each experimental plot consisted of two rows per condition, spacing between consecutive hills in a row being 0.19 m, obtaining a final density of ~95.000 plants. ha<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, with all conditions separated by a 20 m buffer area to avoid accidental irrigation of deficit conditions. The three irrigation conditions were implemented by using pairs of tensiometers in each block per condition at -30 and -60 cm depth, and pluviometers. The well-watered condition (MWW) was irrigated with ramp irrigation three times a week with 20 mm of irrigation, a moderate water deficit condition (MWD1) with ramp irrigation of 15&#x000a0;mm when hydric tension reaches &#x02013;125 kPa at -30cm, a severe water deficit condition (MWD) with ramp irrigation of 13 mm when hydric tension reaches &#x02013;300 kPa at -30 cm. The climatic data, including maximum and minimum temperatures and accumulated precipitation for both locations over the two growing seasons, are represented in <xref rid="SF2" ref-type="supplementary-material">
<bold>Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;2</bold>
</xref>. In Pobra de Broll&#x000f3;n, both maximum and minimum temperatures were lower in both years than in Mauguio; however, accumulated precipitation was higher. Additionally, temperatures in Mauguio appeared to be more stable over the two growing seasons. Due to the differences between locations, treatments will be considered independent within each location, and comparisons will be made separately for each site.</p><p>To assess the agronomic effects of water stress, plant height was measured at harvest. Plant height was recorded as the average height (in cm) of five plants per plot. Measurements were taken from the base of the plant to the flag leaf.</p></sec><sec id="s2_2"><title>Cell wall biochemical analyses</title><p>From each plot, at silage stage (the milky to pasty grain transition), five representative plants without the ear were weighed and crushed. A representative sample of fresh stover was weighed and then dried at 55&#x000b0;C in a forced air ovenand weighed again after 72h to estimate the dry matter content. The dry stover samples were ground in a Wiley mill with a 1 mm screen for biochemical analysis.</p><p>Cell wall residue was extracted by the Soxhlet water/ethanol (1.5L/1.5L) method (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Effland, 1977</xref>). <italic>In Vitro</italic> Cell Wall Residue Digestibility (IVCWRD) was determined following the methodology described by <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Lopez-Marnet et&#x000a0;al. (2021)</xref>. The procedure involves an initial pretreatment step, where 30 mg of dry matter is incubated in a 0.1 N HCl solution containing 2 g/L of pepsin at 40&#x000b0;C for 24 hours. After this, the sample undergoes a neutralization process, followed by enzymatic hydrolysis using an Onozuka R10 cellulase solution (1 mg/mL) at 40&#x000b0;C for another 24 hours. Lignin content was determined by treating approximately 7 to 8 mg of extracted cell wall (CW) with acetyl bromide [1 mL of reagent (a mixture of acetyl bromide and acetic acid in a 1:3 ratio)], following the acetyl bromide (ABL) method adapted from Fukushima and Hatfield (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Fukushima and Hatfield, 2004</xref>). Lignin monomeric composition and structure were analyzed by thioacidolysis, where 13 to 15 mg of extracted cell wall (CW) were treated with 1 mL of internal standard (long-chain hydrocarbons C19, C21, and C22, 0.5 mg/mL each) and 10 mL of dioxane/ethanethiol mixture (9:1, v/v) containing 0.2 M boron trifluoride etherate, for 4 h in an oil bath at 100&#x000b0;C. The reaction was carried out at 100&#x000b0;C for 4 hours in an oil bath. The resulting lignin subunits and &#x003b2;-O-4 linkages were quantified using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC&#x02013;MS), following the method described by <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Lapierre et&#x000a0;al. (1986)</xref>; hydroxycinnamic acids: p-coumaric acid ( pCA), Ferulic acid esterified (FAest) and Ferulic acid etherified (FAeth) were obtained after submitting the cell wall residue through mild (5 mL NaOH 2N) and severe (5mL NaOH 4N) alkaline hydrolysis as described in <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Mechin et al (2000)</xref>, following extraction adding and internal standard (p-anisic acid) and finally quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) according to <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Culhaoglu et&#x000a0;al.

The cross-sections were immersed in a FASGA solution, diluted in distilled water (1:8, v/v), and subjected to 24 hours of agitation.

Using a slide scanner controlled by the Metafer scanning and imaging platform (MetaSystems GmbH, Altlussheim, Germany), an image of each cross-section was obtained with a resolution of 5.17 &#x003bc;m per pixel (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Legland et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">El Hage et&#x000a0;al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Lopez-Marnet et&#x000a0;al., 2022</xref>; <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Main et&#x000a0;al., 2025</xref>). The histological profile of the maize internode cross-section images obtained was quantified by applying the automatic segmentation imaging workflow described by <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Lopez-Marnet et&#x000a0;al (2022)</xref> developed using the ImageJ/Fiji platform. This workflow segments maize internode cross-section images into 40 distinct tissues: two tissues in the epidermis, 19 tissues in the rind, 14 tissues in the pith, and 5 tissues in the bundles. The segmentation is achieved by integrating the Hue, Saturation, and Value (HSV) properties of each pixel along with the pixel&#x02019;s location in the FASGA-stained cross-section. Based on enzymatic digestion on cross sections, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Lopez-Marnet et&#x000a0;al.

To simplify the analysis of the 40 identified tissues, and based on our expertise, we grouped them based on lignification profile: lignified tissues stained red by FASGA and non-lignified tissues stained blue by FASGA. Additionally, we categorized them into three main tissue types: rind, medullary, and bundle tissues. This resulted in the following traits: Rind tissues red (RT_R: DRT2, DRT4, DRT5, DRT7, DRT8, DRT9; LRT2, LRT4, LRT5, LRT7, LRT8, LRT9), Rind tissues blue (RT_B: DRT1, DRT3, DRT6; LRT1, LRT3, LRT6), Medullary tissues red (MT_R: MT1, MT4), Medullary tissues blue (MT_B: MT2, MT5), Bundle tissues red (BT_R: BT1, BT3, BT4), and Bundle tissues blue (BT_B: BT2, BT5). For each individual tissue, the pixel surface area was normalized by the total pixel count of its corresponding main tissue category (rind, medullary, or bundle), allowing the calculation of its percentage relative to the total area within that category. It should be noted that out of the 40 tissues identified, 13 were not assigned due to their limited presence in the sections, which made their identification difficult using the FASGA staining method.</p></sec><sec id="s2_4"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Data was statistically analyzed using R version 4.4.2 (2024-10&#x02013;31 ucrt) (&#x02018;<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">R Core Team, 2024</xref>) and SAS program (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">SAS Institute, 2015</xref>).

The model included condition (location-condition combination), genotype, and their interaction (genotype&#x000d7;condition) as fixed effects, and the year was considered as a random effect. Similarly, for histological data, we used a GLIMMIX model and considered fixed effects genotype, condition (location&#x000d7;condition combination), and their interaction. Random effects for histological data were specified for year bloc (year&#x000d7;condition) genotype&#x000d7;year, and genotype&#x000d7;year&#x000d7;condition to account for variability across years, blocks, and their interactions with genotypes and conditions. For both models, Wald tests were used to assess the significance of fixed effects. Least square means (LSMeans) were calculated for condition and genotype, and pairwise comparisons were performed using the diff and lines options to identify significant differences. In parallel for all traits, the best linear unbiased estimator (BLUE) for each genotype&#x000d7;condition was calculated.</p><p>We performed a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the BLUEs of histological and biochemical traits separately, considering the interaction genotype&#x000d7;condition. In the PCA analysis, IVCWRD was considered as a spectator variable to explore its relationship with the principal components without influencing their calculation. The Principal Component Analysis was conducted using the first two principal components to reduce dimensionality, using the FactoMineR (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Le et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>) and factoextra (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Kassambara and Mundt, 2020</xref>) packages in R. To group the genotypes based on their histological and biochemical profiles, we applied hierarchical grouping and k-means grouping. For hierarchical clustering, we computed the distance matrix using the coordinates from the Principal Component Analysis. For k-means clustering, we assigned genotypes and conditions to groups based on the Principal Component Analysis coordinates, using the stats package. The resulting groups were used to create biplots, including ellipses representing each group, facilitating the visualization of genotype&#x000d7;condition distribution within histological and biochemical contexts, with the ggplot2 (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Wickham, 2016</xref>) package.

This allowed us to explore the different response profiles of the evaluated genotype panel. Based on these relative responses, we then examined the relationship between histological and biochemical traits and IVCWRD by applying a multiple linear regression model. In SAS, the stepwise method within the PROC REG procedure was used, with variables having a significance value below 0.15 excluded from the model. IVCWRD was treated as the dependent variable, while histological and biochemical traits that showed a significant condition effect in the variance analysis were used as independent variables.

Similarly, digestibility also varied significantly depending on the genotype and the environment, highlighting the differential adaptability of maize lines to water stress at both the structural and functional levels. These findings underscore the complex interplay between biochemical and histological traits in shaping IVCWRD response under water deficit, offering insights into genotype-specific adaptation strategies. Differences between environments (Mauguio and Pobra de Broll&#x000f3;n) are more important for well-watered than for drought conditions; probably due to the more favorable environmental conditions for maize growth in Mauguio under well-watered condition.</p><p>Histologically, water deficit resulted in reduced lignified tissue across all tissue types, highlighting a shift in tissue composition under stress. Moreover, this response was consistent across the entire histological profile. <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">El Hage et&#x000a0;al. (2018)</xref>, hypothesized differential patterns of lignin deposition as an effect of water deficit, showing a preferential deposition of lignified tissues in the rind in water deficit scenarios. Similarly, the correlations between biochemical and histological responses indicate that, under water-deficit conditions, these reductions in FASGA stained tissues at the rind and medullary level are accompanied by decreases in esterified pCA.</p><p>These variations in our dataset in the biochemical profile under water deficit were particularly evident in Mauguio, where levels of pCA, &#x003b2;-O-4 yield and subunits S were higher. In Pobra de Broll&#x000f3;n, although baseline concentrations were lower under irrigated conditions, pCA exhibited an even greater decrease under stress. These results highlight the differences between locations, supporting the consideration of treatments as independent and analyzed within each location. This pattern aligns with previous studies that highlight the strong interconnection between these traits in their response to water deficit, explaining their concurrent variation (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Emerson et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">El Hage et&#x000a0;al., 2018</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">El Hage et&#x000a0;al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Virlouvet et&#x000a0;al., 2019</xref>). However, unlike other studies that report changes in total lignin content (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">El Hage et&#x000a0;al., 2018</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">El Hage et&#x000a0;al., 2021</xref>), our results did not show significant differences in lignin levels between water conditions or locations. Under water deficit conditions, it has been suggested that carbon allocation shifts from phenolic compound synthesis toward the production of soluble metabolites involved in osmoregulation and storage, facilitating recovery upon rehydration (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Perrier et&#x000a0;al., 2017</xref>). This shift in carbon flux could reflect a strategy to maintain structural integrity while optimizing carbon use under stress. Likewise, this regulation may ensure lignin stability while redirecting carbon flux toward metabolic adaptation, thereby preserving plant integrity and optimizing resource allocation under drought conditions (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Perrier et&#x000a0;al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Main et&#x000a0;al., 2025</xref>).</p><p>In terms of IVCWRD response, significant increases were detected in response to water deficit. Beyond these observations, genotype-dependent response patterns were evident, revealing two distinct behavioral groups. One group exhibited a high level of responsiveness, while the other demonstrated more stable or even declining trends in response to the treatment. Crucially, in plastic genotypes, increases in IVCWRD in response to water deficit, were concomitant with reductions in pCA content and red-stained lignified tissues. Notably, pCA content and the presence of red-stained tissues in the rind together explain 49% of the variability in IVCWRD, with red-stained tissues alone accounting for an additional 4% once pCA content is included in the model. However, the relatively low additional contribution of red-stained tissues (only 4%) can be attributed to their positive correlation with pCA content. These results suggest that pCA content reduction in response to water deficit occurs mainly in the rind. This correlation indicated that changes in pCA content in response to drought, drive the observed variation in red-stained tissues, highlighting its key role in digestibility variation in response to drought. Interestingly, the histological and biochemical profiles were tightly interconnected. In this framework, integrating biochemical assessments of dry matter with histological profiling of the stem allows for identifying the specific areas where biochemical changes could occur in response to stress. Besides, those genotypes showing the greater decrease in pCA are also those showing the strongest response in terms of increased IVCWRD. This is often accompanied by a reduction in red-stained tissues in the rind in these highly plastic genotypes. However, some genotypes that do not respond with increasing IVCWRD significantly reduce their lignification in the rind. Specifically, increases of 15-25% IVCWRD in response to water deficit, are associated with decreases of 10-40% in pCA content. However, in the case of red tissues in the rind, a decrease in the lignified tissue surface alone does not guarantee a response increasing IVCWRD unless accompanied by a corresponding reduction in pCA content. That&#x02019;s the case of the inbred line EPD6 which showed a 20-30% reduction on lignified tissue surface in the rind in response to water deficit without increasing its IVCWRD. This may be explained by the fact that its pCA content does not change significantly in response to stress. The same is true for EP1 and EP42. In contrast, inbred lines EP105 and CO384, which showed plastic behavior, demonstrated increases in IVCWRD under water stress by reducing pCA content by 15&#x02013;20%, while showing only minor changes in the lignified tissue surface of the rind. On the other hand, the inbred line F4 reduced its pCA content and lignification in the rind under water-deficit conditions but did not show a significant increase in cell wall digestibility compared to the control. Notably, F4 consistently exhibited the highest digestibility across all water scenarios (data not shown), which may explain its limited response to water stress. Its inherently high digestibility likely leaves less room for improvement/response. In general, variations on those traits in Pobra de Broll&#x000f3;n are less evident than for Mauguio, which may explain the lack of significant differences in IVCWRD response to water deficit. The inbred line F4 stood out as a genotype with exceptionally high cell wall digestibility, comparable to that of several brown-midrib (bm3) mutant lines, as noted by <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Barri&#x000e8;re et&#x000a0;al. (2017)</xref>, which inherently presents low lignin and <italic>p</italic>-coumarate levels, compared to other genotypes. Besides, F4 presents a low lignified parenchyma and vascular bundles. Despite its high digestibility, attempts to introduce bm mutations into its genome did not significantly enhance this trait. This mutation typically impairs the biosynthesis of syringyl units, reducing the S/G ratio to lower values. However, in the case of F4bm3, the S/G ratio remained closer to that of normal lines, with only a slight reduction in syringyl units compared to other bm3 lines. Similarly, in this study, F4&#x02019;s digestibility remained stable under environmental conditions, such as water-deficit stress, which could increase cell wall digestibility in other genotypes that do respond (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Barri&#x000e8;re et&#x000a0;al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Most <italic>p</italic>-coumarate accretion occurs in tandem with lignification. In maize, lignins are acylated (primarily syringyl units) at the &#x003b3;-position by <italic>p</italic>-coumarates (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Ralph et&#x000a0;al., 1994</xref>). Acylation has a marked influence on the bonding mode of S lignin units, on the spatial organization of lignins, and consequently on their capacity to interact with polysaccharides. It is known that syringyl type lignin form a more linear structure (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Kishimoto et&#x000a0;al., 2005</xref>), with little or no branching and with a lesser degree of polymerization that extends further into the secondary wall, protecting a larger proportion of the polysaccharides in the wall from digestion; thus, reducing cell wall digestibility. Building upon this point, <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et&#x000a0;al. (2019)</xref> combined biochemical and histological approaches to characterize cell wall deposition and lignification during maize stem development. Their findings highlighted the spatial and temporal variation in cell wall component deposition and structure across the three main stages of cell wall development: fast deposition of the primary cell walls in whole cross sections; fast deposition of the secondary cell walls; slow deposition of the secondary cell walls in the cortical region. During the secondary cell wall development, rapid deposition of lignin with both C-C and &#x003b2;-O-4 bonds contributed to the fast lignification process. Subsequently, lignin with &#x003b2;-O-4 bonds became predominant during the late stages of lignification, primarily in the rind region. In our study, water deficit conditions were imposed in Mauguio 25 days after sowing. Conversely, in Pobra de Broll&#x000f3;n, the absence of irrigation naturally imposed water deficit conditions, particularly as sowing occurred around May 15th, coinciding with the onset of summer and higher temperatures. The strong correlations observed between rind lignification and pCA content response under water deficit suggest that these traits may vary in tandem. At the time the stress was imposed, the pith was fully lignified, as suggested by <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et&#x000a0;al. (2019)</xref>. However, in the rind, the lignification and deposition of secondary cell walls were still ongoing. As shown in the diagram presented in <xref rid="f9" ref-type="fig">
<bold>Figure&#x000a0;9</bold>
</xref>, for those plastic genotypes that responded to drought, under water deficit, we observed a reduction in rind lignification, which was accompanied by decreases in pCA content, S-lignin subunits, and &#x003b2;-O-4 linkage yields. This suggests that the plant may adapt by limiting secondary wall deposition in this region under stress. Such a response highlights the complex biochemical and structural adjustments in maize stems and points to a distinct stress adaptation strategy in these tissues (<xref rid="f9" ref-type="fig">

The pCA content in PBWW did not differ significantly from that in MWD and MWD1, yet a greater reduction in PBWD was still observed. Regarding lignification in the rind, changes in lignin content alone, if not accompanied by corresponding reductions in pCA, were insufficient to enhance digestibility, as previously suggested. Furthermore, in the Pobra de Broll&#x000f3;n trial, the levels of syringyl units and the &#x003b2;-O-4 yield were significantly lower than in Mauguio, and these traits were strongly positively correlated with pCA content. These lower concentrations may indicate the presence of a more globular lignin type, as opposed to the linear structures often associated with syringyl-type lignin. Globular lignin could limit their extension into the secondary wall, reducing the shielding effect on polysaccharides and thereby enhancing cellulose accessibility to enzymes. This structural difference could lead to increased cell wall digestibility (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Kishimoto et&#x000a0;al., 2005</xref>). These differences in biochemical composition also result in the genotypes from Pobra de Broll&#x000f3;n grouping separately from those in Mauguio in the Principal Components Analysis-based clustering.</p><p>Our study highlighted the complex, genotype-dependent responses to water deficit, emphasizing the significant role of plasticity and stability in shaping the impact on maize cell wall digestibility. The observed variation in lignification patterns at the histological level and biochemical traits, particularly the interaction between lignified tissues, pCA levels, and digestibility, provide valuable insights into potential breeding strategies. The presence of distinct behavioral groups&#x02014;ranging from highly plastic to stable genotypes&#x02014;suggest different ideotypes depending on water availability conditions. In the absence of water deficit risk, selecting maize varieties that are easily digestible, regardless of their response, would be advisable. However, in high drought-risk conditions, it may be beneficial to select genotypes that exhibit a strong stress response, capitalizing on increased digestibility and all associated traits. Such an approach could pave the way for implementing targeted breeding programs aimed at developing crop varieties better adapted to specific stresses or agroecological contexts. Incorporating this knowledge into breeding programs will provide an effective strategy for developing maize varieties that are not only more resilient to drought but also better suited for sustainable agricultural practices in the face of climate change.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank all members of the &#x02018;Biomass Quality and Interactions with Drought&#x02019; team at IJPB and the &#x02018;Maize Genetics and Breeding&#x02019; team at Misi&#x000f3;n Biol&#x000f3;gica de Galicia for their valuable support throughout the development of this study.
