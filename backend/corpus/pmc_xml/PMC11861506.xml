It was filled out by medical workers from January 2021 to November 2022.</p><p>The sample consisted of 314 medical workers (57 men and 255 women), whose average age was 36.97&#x000b1;11.93. According to the level of education, the sample included specialists with secondary general education (4.14%), with secondary special education (19.4%), with incomplete higher education (11.46%), with higher education (59.87%) and PhD (5.1%). 35 people (11%) of the surveyed medical workers worked in the red zone.</p></sec><sec id="sec5505"><title>Results</title><p>When medical workers experience severe Emotional Exhaustion and Depersonalization, they often try to help themselves by drinking alcohol (r=0.156; p=0.005; r=0.184; p=0.001), eating (r=0.227; p=0.000; r=0.151; p=0.007), taking medications (r=0.204; p=0.000; r=0.212; p=0.005), solitude (r=0.204; p=0.000; r=0.133; p=0.019), watching TV series (r=0.173; p=0.002; r=0.146; p=0.01). With an increase in the Reduction of professional skills, medical workers also eat more (r=-0.148; p=0.009) and try to learn something new, engage in self-development (r=-0.137; p=0.015). It is important to note that the desire to seek psychological help is associated only with Emotional Exhaustion (r=0.121, p=0.032), that is, he/she may be aware at an early stage of professional burnout, when the symptoms of depersonalization and reduction of professional skills have not yet occurred.</p></sec><sec id="sec5506"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Thus, all the considered self-help methods are already used with pronounced symptoms of professional burnout, but do not lead to its pronounced decrease. It is important to note that seeking psychological help is possible with awareness of emotional exhaustion, but not with depersonalization and reduction of professional skills.</p><p>Disclosure: Research is supported by the Russian Science Foundation, project No. 21-18-00624.</p></sec><sec id="sec5507"><title>Disclosure of Interest</title><p>None Declared</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="1"/></counts></article-meta></front></article>
