Here, we characterized effect sizes for the association between functional connectivity and time-varying positive and negative daily affect in a nonclinical cohort. Data were analyzed from 24 adults who attended four research visits, where participants self-reported daily affect using the PANAS-X questionnaire and completed 39&#x02005;min of functional magnetic resonance imaging across three passive viewing conditions. We modeled positive and negative daily affect in relation to network-level functional connectivity, with hypotheses regarding within-network connectivity of the default mode, salience/cingulo-opercular, frontoparietal, dorsal attention, and visual networks and between-network connectivity of affective subcortical regions (amygdala and nucleus accumbens) with both default mode and salience/cingulo-opercular networks. Effect sizes for associations between affect and network-level functional connectivity were small and nonsignificant across analyses. We additionally report that functional connectivity variance is largely attributable to individual identity with small relative variance (&#x0003c;3%) accounted for by within-subject daily affect variation. These results support previous reports that functional connectivity is dominated by stable subject-specific connectivity patterns, while additionally suggesting relatively minimal influence of day-to-day affect. Researchers planning studies examining functional connectivity in relation to daily affect, or other varying stable states, should therefore anticipate small effect sizes and carefully consider power in study planning.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>affect</kwd><kwd>dense sampling</kwd><kwd>functional connectivity</kwd><kwd>functional magnetic resonance imaging</kwd><kwd>precision imaging</kwd><kwd>variability</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>Canadian Government | Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)</funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source>Canadian Government | Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)</funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Hotchkiss Brain Institute, University of Calgary (HBI)</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="doi">10.13039/100009003</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source>U of C | Alberta Children's Hospital Research Institute (ACHRI)</funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>cover-date</meta-name><meta-value>December 2024</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Significance Statement</title><p>Brain functional connectivity has been suggested as an affective disorder biomarker, but inconsistent results may be related to affective disorder symptoms varying greatly over short time periods. We used a method called &#x0201c;dense sampling,&#x0201d; where participants are measured at multiple sessions, to characterize how brain functional connectivity and affect vary within people over time. We studied 24 adults who attended four research visits, where they reported feelings of daily affect (mood) and functional connectivity was measured with an MRI scan. We found that functional connectivity is most strongly related to individual differences with minimal influences of daily affect. Future applications of dense sampling to assess variable clinical and nonclinical states must carefully consider study design in anticipation of small effects.</p></sec><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Functional connectivity has been proposed as a potential biomarker for affective disorders (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Caseras et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al., 2023</xref>), yet reported associations between clinical symptoms and functional connectivity have limited reproducibility (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Taylor et al., 2021</xref>). One consideration is that many affective disorders can be described in terms of both trait-like diathesis and substantial state-like symptom variation. Suicidal ideation, for example, can vary widely across short periods of 4&#x02013;8&#x02005;h (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Kleiman et al., 2017</xref>), while also relating to stable risk factors including neuroticism (i.e., a tendency toward negative affect in response to stress; <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Brezo et al., 2006</xref>). Identifying a biomarker of suicidality would therefore require quantifying state-like suicidal ideation fluctuations independent of trait-like neuroticism tendencies. Functional connectivity also has trait-like and state-like qualities, such that whole-brain functional connectivity patterns are primarily driven by group features and trait-like individual variation with smaller contributions from state-like task activations or daily variation (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Gratton et al., 2018</xref>) . Here, we considered the contribution of daily affective state to varying functional connectivity in an adult community sample (without a clinical diagnosis) as a foundational step toward disentangling stable affective states and traits in clinical populations.</p><p>Affect will be defined here as subjective experiences of feeling which include emotions (affective experiences related to overt or implicit engagement with the world) and mood (affective dispositions toward a particular emotional response lasting over hours, days, or weeks; <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">VandenBos, 2015</xref>). Networks involved in affective processing have been primarily investigated using task-evoked emotions, which support the importance of default mode, salience, executive control, and visual networks as key functional affective networks. The default mode network (DMN) has been implicated in self-referential thinking (for review, see <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Raichle, 2015</xref>) which may support conceptualization of embodied experiences including evaluation of physiological affective signals (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Barrett and Satpute, 2013</xref>) or contextualization of affective experiences with prior knowledge (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">K. A. Lindquist et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Roy et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Barrett and Satpute, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Barrett, 2017</xref>). The salience network is implicated in self-referential processing and monitoring of physiological affective responses (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Seeley, 2019</xref>). Integration of homeostatic signals by the default mode and salience networks are supported by subcortical regions, particularly the amygdala and nucleus accumbens (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Barrett and Satpute, 2013</xref>). Executive and control networks may support multiple affect-related processes, including contextualizing affective experiences via episodic recollection (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Barrett, 2009</xref>, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>) or orienting attention toward internal evaluation of affective states (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">K. A. Lindquist et al., 2012</xref>). The visual cortex is frequently identified in emotion meta-analyses (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Kober et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Fusar-Poli et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">K. A. Lindquist et al., 2012</xref>), particularly for negative emotions (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">K. A. Lindquist et al., 2012</xref>). Meta-analysis of task-evoked emotion studies also support the perspective that affect is an interactive process across distributed regions and networks (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Barrett, 2017</xref>).</p><p>One avenue for investigating state-like variability is &#x0201c;precision&#x0201d; functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and dense sampling, where high volumes of functional imaging data are collected from participants at multiple time points (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Ar&#x000e9;lin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Laumann et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Gordon et al., 2017</xref>). This approach has been applied previously to investigate associations between time-varying affect and resting-state functional connectivity in a single participant over 73 sessions, each with &#x0223c;10&#x02005;min of fMRI data (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Mirchi et al., 2019</xref>). Connectivity of default mode network regions, including the precuneus, anterior cingulate cortex, and medial orbitofrontal cortex, were reported to covary with positive affect while connectivity of visual cortex and executive control regions, like the paracentral cortex and lateral prefrontal cortex, covaried with negative affect (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Mirchi et al., 2019</xref>). Evidence was additionally presented for a multivariate network hypothesis, where greater positive affect generally related to elevated between-network connectivity while greater negative affect generally related to elevated within-network connectivity (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Mirchi et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>These results provide insight into affect-associated functional connectivity patterns and highlight the potential of dense sampling to examine relations between functional connectivity and time-varying behavioral features, but expansion to larger samples is required to demonstrate the generalizability of findings. Collecting more per-person data additionally increases participant burden, highlighting the value of carefully considering protocol design prior to clinical research implementation. Here, we used dense sampling to examine associations between self-reported positive and negative daily affect and network-level functional connectivity in a community sample of adults. At each of four sessions, participants rated daily affect and fMRI data were collected across three naturalistic passive viewing paradigms with varying levels of engagement. Dynamic naturalistic stimuli were selected here as they can elicit activity in multiple networks, including those involved in emotion, attention, and sensory processing (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Bottenhorn et al., 2018</xref>), and it has been argued that naturalistic stimuli better replicate real-life cognitive demands while supporting generalizability outside of specific laboratory manipulations (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Nastase et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>We first considered several univariate hypotheses including relations between affect and within-network connectivity of specific functional networks (default mode, salience, frontoparietal, dorsal attention, visual). We hypothesized that greater positive daily affect would associate with increased default mode network connectivity; greater negative daily affect would associate with increased frontoparietal, dorsal attention, and visual network connectivity; and both positive and negative daily affect would associate with increased salience network functional connectivity. We further considered connectivity between key subcortical affective nodes (amygdala and nucleus accumbens) with default mode and salience networks. We hypothesized that greater positive daily affect would associate with greater subcortex to default mode connectivity and both positive and negative daily affect would associate with greater subcortex to salience network connectivity.</p><p>We then considered hypotheses regarding multi-network integration using the multivariate constrained network-based statistic (mv-cNBS) which is a Euclidean distance based approach (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Noble et al., 2022</xref>). A multivariate effect was examined across the whole brain (all within- and between-network connections), across all within-network connections, and across all between-network connections. In line with previous work (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Mirchi et al., 2019</xref>), we hypothesized that greater positive daily affect would associate with a general multivariate pattern of elevated between-network connectivity while greater negative daily affect would associate with a general multivariate pattern of elevated within-network connectivity. To support future study design, we additionally characterized the contribution of daily affect relative to other factors which relate to functional connectivity (age, sex, session, viewing condition, head motion, drowsiness).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2A1A"><title>Participants</title><p>Data reported here were collected as part of a larger precision imaging study which collected repeated imaging and behavioral data from a cohort of children and their parents.

The minimum probability threshold was selected to include as many vertices as possible during analysis.

The cNBS statistic was selected here due to reports of increased sensitivity for network-level inference (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Noble et al., 2022</xref>) and because permutation-based significance estimations avoid the normality assumptions required when comparing to a theoretical probability distribution (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Fisher, 1935</xref>; <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Pitman, 1938</xref>). To this end, edgewise null distributions were estimated via permutation by repeating mixed-effects models with shuffled outcomes. Specifically, for each edge, functional connectivity was shuffled across sessions, preserving session and subject structure (i.e., all functional connectivity data collected at the same session remained together, and shuffling did not occur between subjects). Network-level observed effect sizes were estimated as the mean across edges within a network, and, at each permutation, a network-level null value was calculated as the mean of permuted edge-level effect sizes. Network-level significance was determined by comparison of the network-level observed effect to the simulated 1,000 permutation network-level null distribution.</p><p>Based on the hypotheses described above, network-level effects were investigated for the default mode, salience/cingulo-opercular, frontoparietal, dorsal attention, and visual networks.

We report small effect sizes which did not reach significance at the level of individual hypothesized networks and when considering multivariate effects across networks. Finally, we show that daily affect either accounted for no or small (&#x0003c;3%) amounts of variance in functional connectivity compared with other sources of variance including individual identity, which is not accounted for in cross-sectional designs. These findings suggest that daily affect variation has a relatively small impact on functional connectivity in healthy adults. Here, we consider these findings alongside prior work and offer suggestions for future studies applying dense sampling to investigate stable varying states.</p><p>Based on a prior functional connectivity study of affect variation in a single individual (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Mirchi et al., 2019</xref>) and meta-analyses on evoked emotions (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Barrett and Bliss-Moreau, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">K. A. Lindquist et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Barrett and Satpute, 2013</xref>), we first considered positive and negative daily affect for hypothesized effects on within-network connectivity of default mode, salience/cingulo-opercular, frontoparietal, dorsal attention, and visual networks alongside connectivity of subcortical affective nodes (amygdala and nucleus accumbens) with default mode and salience/cingulo-opercular networks. We report no association between positive or negative daily affect in relation to any of the hypothesized network-level connectivity patterns considered. In our exploratory analyses, we observed an uncorrected association between negative daily affect and between-network connectivity of dorsal attention to the visual network, dorsal attention to the auditory network, and within-network connectivity of the parietal occipital network. Although these findings did not survive multiple-comparisons correction in the context of many comparisons here, they could be used to derive hypotheses for future work. More generally, our results point to relatively small or negligible effects of normative daily affect variation on univariate network functional connectivity. Affect is a broad and integrative process with widely distributed associations across the brain (for reviews, see <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Duncan and Barrett, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Barrett and Bliss-Moreau, 2009</xref>). We therefore considered several multi-network hypotheses here, reporting no associations between positive and negative daily affect and pooled multivariate network patterns when assessed with mv-cNBS.</p><p>These findings contrast with previously reported associations between session-to-session affect and functional connectivity (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Mirchi et al., 2019</xref>). As the study by Mirchi and colleagues examined a single individual over 73 sessions, it's likely that there was increased sampling variability across diverse affective states. Assessing a single subject with this many sessions would additionally increase the power for modeling within-subject variation, though generalizability in a multi-subject context could not be examined. It could be that previously reported relations between session-to-session affect and functional connectivity were true but small effects that the present study was not sufficiently powered to detect. Alternatively, it may be that the generalizability of this pattern is limited across individuals. When considering generalizability, this previous work used a data-driven method to identify affect-associated functional network patterns (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Mirchi et al., 2019</xref>) which could be more sensitive to individual-specific associations. Other work has highlighted that distinct inter-individual functional network patterns should be considered to detect associations with other variable states like mind-wandering (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Kucyi et al., 2024</xref>). Given several limitations of single-subject modeling and <italic toggle="yes">n</italic>-of-1 studies, including generalizability and potential feasibility for all populations of interest, we endeavored to expand findings from one such study (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Mirchi et al., 2019</xref>) to a densely sampled precision cohort with reduced per-participant burden. The null results presented here, at minimum, suggest that single-subject findings related to affect should not be expected to generalize across differences in context and methodology. Future studies with more samples per individual could have statistical power to fit random subject slopes, which may be important to assess whether associations are shared across the group or vary at the individual level. Further knowledge regarding to what extent affect, and other varying states, have individualized representation will illuminate the feasibility of functional connectivity as a biomarker at the level of individual and diagnostic group.</p><p>To support planning future studies relating affect and functional connectivity, we examined the relative contribution of daily affect to explaining network-level functional connectivity variance. Across analyses, subject identity explained the greatest magnitude of variation in functional connectivity while daily affect accounted for either no variance or a small (&#x0003c;3%) proportion of the variance. The finding that connectome variance is strongly influenced by individual connectivity patterns, above task activation or session-to-session variability, concurs with prior work (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Gratton et al., 2018</xref>). Our findings further align with work in clinical patients with major depressive disorder, where group-level clinical features (diagnostic traits and treatment response) accounted for only a small portion of the variance in functional connectivity while &#x0003e;95% of the variance was explained by common shared underlying architecture and individual differences (<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">van der Wijk et al., 2023</xref>). We note that in the present study, stable individual features could not be disentangled from shared group features. As the individual effect here was not quantified in proportion to an additional group effect, estimates of the individual effect are inflated as compared with these previous works (e.g., individual associated variance at &#x0223c;35&#x02013;40% in <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Gratton et al., 2018</xref>). Nevertheless, the results presented here, in addition to reports from previous studies (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Gratton et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">van der Wijk et al., 2023</xref>), suggest that daily variations are expected to explain small amounts of functional connectivity variance while stable individual and group effects will have the largest impact on functional connectivity variance.</p><p>Participants in the present study rated positive and negative affect by reflecting on the past 24&#x02005;h, mirroring many measures of affective disorder symptoms which are often reflective as well (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Furukawa, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Cerimele et al., 2019</xref>). While null results were reported here when affect was considered at the level of daily assessment, that doesn't preclude that state-like changes can be detected in the brain at more granular timescales. This includes functional connectivity changes in response to evoked emotions (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Barrett and Bliss-Moreau, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">K. A. Lindquist et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Barrett and Satpute, 2013</xref>) or reports that functional connectivity within a session can be associated with moment-to-moment changes in arousal (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Chang et al., 2013a</xref>, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>). The results presented here, alongside previous work, suggest that future studies aiming to use functional connectivity as a biomarker may wish to consider functional connectivity at either the stable individual or moment-to-moment timescales. However, the clinical relevance of moment-to-moment fluctuations is less clear, as affective disorders are defined by prolonged or pervasive affective states lasting over longer timescales (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">VandenBos, 2015</xref>). If daily variability in cohort designs therefore remains of interest, researchers will likely need to plan appropriately in anticipation of small effect sizes.</p><p>The results presented here suggest small or negligible effects for the association between functional connectivity and daily affect variation. These results additionally emphasize previous reports that individual identity has a large influence on functional connectivity (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Gordon et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Gratton et al., 2018</xref>) despite partially accounting for inter-individual variation in functional network borders with a consensus parcellation here (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Dworetsky et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Hermosillo et al., 2024</xref>). Future studies aiming to model associations between functional connectivity and day-to-day variations will likely need to anticipate similarly small effect sizes and power their studies accordingly. This could be done by collecting more samples from fewer individuals to simultaneously increase within-subject variance while decreasing between-subject variance. In the previous study of a densely sampled individual, 73 sessions of data were collected to identify an association between functional connectivity and affect (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Mirchi et al., 2019</xref>). A recent precision imaging study of depression additionally reported associations between salience network connectivity and within-individual variability in anhedonia, which was detected within two participants with sufficient imaging data for single-subject modeling (62 and 39 sessions per participant; <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Lynch et al., 2024</xref>). In sum, investigations regarding associations between functional connectivity and day-to-day variations will likely need to carefully consider their sampling strategy to include more sessions per participant even if that reduces total sample size and subsequent generalizability.</p><p>Strengths of our approach included using several methods to increase power for detecting brain-behavior associations, such as the use of movies over resting-state imaging (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Finn and Bandettini, 2021</xref>), selection of statistical tools shown to have elevated sensitivity for network-level inference (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Noble and Scheinost, 2020</xref>; <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Noble et al., 2022</xref>), and efforts to increase precision in network-level functional connectivity estimates with a probabilistic atlas. However, there are a few limitations to be considered. In the community sample recruited for the present study, the variance of both positive and negative daily affect was likely reduced compared to other populations of interest, in particular mental health and affective disorders. Given the relation between effect size, power, and sampling variability (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Meyvis and Van Osselaer, 2018</xref>), reduced variance in affect here would impact sensitivity to detect an association between affect and functional connectivity. It's unclear whether the present study design would have been more sensitive to a relation between affect and functional connectivity if a clinical population with higher affect variability had been recruited such as patients with bipolar II disorders (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Henry et al., 2001</xref>) or if we had considered a different feature with greater variability such as suicidal ideation in a clinical sample (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Kleiman et al., 2017</xref>). Future studies examining within-individual variation in affect and other states should carefully consider behavioral assessment selection and weigh trade-offs between sensitivity to state-like variability and test-retest reliability. Parcellation choice can also greatly impact reported associations between functional connectivity and behavior (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Bryce et al., 2021</xref>), and it is unclear to what degree divergent findings here could be related to previous studies reporting regional-specific results obtained using finer-grained parcellations (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Mirchi et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Dense sampling and precision imaging study designs have been suggested as a candidate method for identifying associations between brain function and time-varying clinical states, such as affect. We applied a dense sampling protocol in a community sample of adults and found that associations between daily affect and functional connectivity across levels of network inference were generally small. In addition, daily affect either accounted for no proportional variance in functional connectivity or accounted for a small degree of the variance (i.e., 3&#x02013;125&#x000d7; smaller than the viewing condition). Future work aiming to assess links between functional connectivity and variable affect in clinical samples should carefully consider expected effect sizes, sampling strategy, and timescales of measurement to maximize study power.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="B1"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><string-name><surname>Ar&#x000e9;lin</surname>

When revisions are invited, a fact-based synthesis statement explaining their decision and outlining what is needed to prepare a revision will be listed below. The following reviewer(s) agreed to reveal their identity: Aaron Kucyi.</p></boxed-text><p>In this paper, the authors report an fMRI study of 24 individuals who underwent four neuroimaging sessions as well as self-report measures of positive and negative affect on each day of scanning. Analyzing functional connectivity (FC; estimated within each 6.5-minute fMRI run) between prespecified regions implicated in affective networks and performing more exploratory analyses, they report that day-to-day variations in self-reported affect largely does not explain variance in FC at the group level.</p><p>It is important to understand how day-to-day fluctuations in affect are reflected in brain activity and more specifically impact FC estimates, especially when considering that FC is actively being studied and considered as a trait-level biomarker of psychiatric illness. The paper is well-written and reports data analyses that are technically sound. However, I have concerns about how the authors are interpreting the findings and the overall message that is being conveyed (including recommendations for the field). There are also limitations in the study design and sample that should preclude strong conclusions regarding the relationship between affect states and FC.</p><p>Major concerns:</p><p>- While the data support a lack of relationship between FC and day-to-day variations in PANAS reports, this obviously does not mean that affect variations are not represented in the brain. The lack of relationship may be a product of the time scale at which PANAS ratings and fMRI scans were obtained. Experiences of affect fluctuate across various time scales, including within a single day and even on time scales of hours and minutes or less. As such, the single PANAS rating obtained at each visit may not be granular enough to capture relationships with FC dynamics. Due to these concerns, I believe that conclusions regarding the lack of relationship between FC and within-subject affect variation should be toned down and should always come with clear qualifiers regarding the time scale of measurements throughout the manuscript.</p><p>- It appears that several subjects showed minimal variation in PANAS ratings across sessions. The negative affect ratings are especially 'flat' across sessions (Fig. 1) in a large proportion of the sample. Of course relationships between FC and affect will not be found if there are no variations, or no meaningful variations, in affect. This issue should be better acknowledged throughout the manuscript and potentially addressed in analyses. Were the ratings normally distributed? This is important, considering that the authors main analyses relied on linear mixed effects models.</p><p>- Related to issues surrounding time scale of measurements, the authors minimally acknowledged extensive research on dynamic/time-varying FC and its potential relevance to affect fluctuations. For example, rigorous studies have shown that on time scales of tens of seconds, FC dynamics are associated with within-subject arousal (Chang et al., 2013a, 2013b), attention (Rosenberg et al., 2020), and mind-wandering (Kucyi et al., 2021). Moreover, spontaneous variations in affect and emotion during resting states relate to transient fMRI multivariate patterns of activity (Tusche et al., 2014; Kragel et al., 2016). I recommend incorporating these studies in a discussion of relevant time scales at which relationships between FC and affect may be found (see (Lurie et al., 2020) for detailed overview).</p><p>- Even if the affect variations reported by subjects are meaningful, it is possible that relationships with FC were not found at the group level due to individual differences in neural representations of these variations (a problem that this study is not powered to addressed). Indeed, recent work shows that FC variations that predict mind-wandering are explained by distinct functional-anatomical patterns in each individual (Kucyi et al., 2024). This issue deserves further attention, especially given points noted above regarding low within-subject variation in affect ratings.</p><p>- Overall, the paper and its interpretations are fMRI-centric, as the focus is on FC as a potential biomarker. However, variations in mood and affect at similar time scales (e.g. day-to-day or across hours) have been strongly linked to brain network functional dynamics in human intracranial electrophysiological recordings (Kirkby et al., 2018; Scangos et al., 2021). As such, brain representations of subjective affect variation can be detected at somewhat similar time scales to those reported here. How do the authors reconcile those non-fMRI findings with their results?</p><p>Minor concerns</p><p>- The introduction defines emotions as "affective experiences related to external stimuli." It should be acknowledged that this is not a universally agreed upon definition, or perhaps a more conventional definition should be stated.</p><p>- To clarify, did the authors not perform spatial smoothing?</p><p>References</p><p>Chang C, Liu Z, Chen MC, Liu X, Duyn JH (2013a) EEG correlates of time-varying BOLD functional connectivity.
