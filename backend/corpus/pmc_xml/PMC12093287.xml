However, its broader functions within the brain besides amyloid &#x003b2; generation remain largely unexplored. To investigate this, we utilized a mouse model overexpressing meprin &#x003b2; in neurons within the cortex and hippocampus, regions crucial for learning and memory. Behavioral assessments, employing the Morris' Water Maze paradigm test, revealed impaired cognitive functions in animals overexpressing meprin &#x003b2;. Furthermore, electrophysiological recordings in hippocampal slices using multielectrode arrays showed an impaired long&#x02010;term potentiation (LTP) in meprin &#x003b2;&#x02010;overexpressing mice compared to wild&#x02010;type counterparts. Intriguingly, concomitant with the LTP impairment, we observed an increased neuronal excitability. These findings underline the complicated interplay between meprin &#x003b2; abundance and behavioral manifestations, suggesting a broader impact on neural circuit dynamics. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying these observed deficits, western blotting analyses were conducted to address the expression of glutamatergic receptors. Neither the expression of the N&#x02010;methyl&#x02010;D&#x02010;aspartate (NMDA) nor the &#x003b1;&#x02010;amino&#x02010;3&#x02010;hydroxy&#x02010;5&#x02010;methyl&#x02010;4&#x02010;isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor showed variation relative to each other. The application of N&#x02010;terminomics identified brevican as a proteolytic substrate of meprin &#x003b2; and thus a potential key mediator linking meprin &#x003b2; overexpression to the observed effects. Previous studies have reported that brevican knockout in animal models influences learning and memory. Our data demonstrate that meprin &#x003b2; modulates brevican expression, likely contributing to the effects we have observed in our mouse model. These results shed light on the broader functional significance of meprin &#x003b2; in neurological processes.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical"><p>Meprin &#x003b2; was studied using mice overexpressing it in cortical and hippocampal neurons. N&#x02010;terminomics identified brevican, a key extracellular matrix protein associated with synaptic plasticity and memory, as a potential substrate of meprin &#x003b2;. Further analyses revealed that brevican levels are dependent on the catalytic activity of meprin &#x003b2;. These findings provide an explanation for the effects observed in the behavioral test and electrophysiological analyses, highlighting meprin &#x003b2;'s broader neurological role in cognitive function.<boxed-text position="anchor" content-type="graphic" id="fsb270616-blkfxd-0001"><graphic xlink:href="FSB2-39-e70616-g007.jpg" position="anchor" id="jats-graphic-1"/></boxed-text>

Meprin &#x003b2; is a membrane&#x02010;bound, zinc&#x02010;dependent metalloprotease that is a member of the astacin family of proteases [<xref rid="fsb270616-bib-0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The enzyme is anchored to the cell surface via a C&#x02010;terminal transmembrane domain, positioning it to interact with extracellular surface proteins [<xref rid="fsb270616-bib-0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Pro&#x02010;meprin &#x003b2; is cleaved and activated by Matriptase&#x02010;2 or other tryptic proteases [<xref rid="fsb270616-bib-0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Additionally, meprin &#x003b2; itself can be shed from the membrane and exert its functional role in a soluble form, where it is primarily involved in the cleavage of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, particularly procollagen and proteoglycans [<xref rid="fsb270616-bib-0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Moreover, Bond and Beynon [<xref rid="fsb270616-bib-0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] reported that cleavage of meprin &#x003b2; is crucial for tissue remodeling and regulating inflammatory responses, akin to other members of the astacin family. Key substrates of meprin &#x003b2; comprise E&#x02010;cadherin, procollagen, galectin&#x02010;3, and Mucin 2 [<xref rid="fsb270616-bib-0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="fsb270616-bib-0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="fsb270616-bib-0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="fsb270616-bib-0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="fsb270616-bib-0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In particular, the cleavage of Mucin 2 in the small intestine plays a key role in mucosal defense by aiding in the removal of bacteria through the breakdown of mucin networks. Additionally, meprin &#x003b2; is highly expressed in the brush&#x02010;border membranes of proximal tubule epithelial cells of kidneys, where it is involved in the regulation of ECM homeostasis. Dysregulation of its activity has been implicated in pathological conditions, including fibrosis and chronic kidney disease [<xref rid="fsb270616-bib-0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Recent studies have highlighted a role for meprin &#x003b2; in the central nervous system, where meprin &#x003b2; is expressed in various cell types including neurons, suggesting the likelihood of an additional function beyond its established roles in the intestine and kidney. We and others have demonstrated the role of meprin &#x003b2; in the cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), a mechanism linked to the generation of amyloid&#x02010;&#x003b2; peptides, which are essential to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease [<xref rid="fsb270616-bib-0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="fsb270616-bib-0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. This suggests that meprin &#x003b2; is an enzyme that exerts its function in the brain, which in turn could affect neurophysiological processes. Ligt et&#x000a0;al. [<xref rid="fsb270616-bib-0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] showed that meprin &#x003b2; is associated with severe cognitive diseases. Its involvement in cognitive processes is further supported by uncovering that meprin &#x003b2; knockout mice have shown improvements in learning and memory compared to wild&#x02010;type controls, as demonstrated by enhanced performance in the Morris Water Maze paradigm test [<xref rid="fsb270616-bib-0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. These findings may point to a potential role in brain ECM remodeling and therefore involvement in cognitive processes.</p><p>The ECM of the brain is different from that of other tissues. While fibronectins and collagens are abundant in the ECM of most tissues, the brain's ECM primarily consists of proteoglycans, tenascins, and hyaluronic acid [<xref rid="fsb270616-bib-0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Among the proteoglycans, brevican stands out as the shortest member of the aggrecan&#x02010;versican family. This group of proteoglycans is commonly referred to as the Lectican family, due to its structural similarities [<xref rid="fsb270616-bib-0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>Brevican is proteolytically processed by &#x0201c;A Disintegrin and Metalloproteinase with Thrombospondin Motifs&#x0201d; (ADAMTS4), resulting in an N&#x02010;terminal 50&#x02009;kDa fragment and a C&#x02010;terminal 90&#x02009;kDa fragment in&#x000a0;vivo. In addition to ADAMTS4, Brevican is also cleaved by several matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), including MMP&#x02010;1, 2, 3, 7, 10, and 13 [<xref rid="fsb270616-bib-0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Furthermore, Armbrust et&#x000a0;al.

First clean&#x02010;up was performed with SP3 beads (1:20 w/w protein to beads ratio) and ethanol (EtOH) added to 50% (v/v) with mixing for 15&#x02009;min at 25&#x000b0;C to induce protein binding. Then, supernatant was removed and beads were washed three times with 80% EtOH. To commence with TMT labeling, beads were resuspended in 22.5&#x02009;&#x003bc;L 6&#x02009;M Guanidine hydrochloride, 30&#x02009;&#x003bc;L 0.5&#x02009;M HEPES (pH&#x02009;8), and 4.5&#x02009;&#x003bc;L 125&#x02009;mM TCEP at 25&#x000b0;C for 30&#x02009;min. Isobaric tandem mass tags (0.8&#x02009;mg TMT6plex reagents (Thermo)) were dissolved in 57&#x02009;&#x003bc;L EtOH by occasional vortexing for 5&#x02009;min. Samples were separated with TMT6plex reagents and labeling was performed by adding a label to each beads&#x02010;bound protein sample (one tag per sample) and mixing for 1.5&#x02009;h at 25&#x000b0;C in the dark. Labeling was stopped by adding 8&#x02009;&#x003bc;L 8% hydroxylamine for 30&#x02009;min at 25&#x000b0;C. A second clean&#x02010;up was done by combining each group of samples and adding EtOH to 80% for 15&#x02009;min at 25&#x000b0;C. Then, supernatant was removed, and beads were washed three times with 80% EtOH. Beads were spun down to remove any remaining liquid then reconstituted in 200&#x02009;mM HEPES (pH&#x02009;8). Digestion was performed with trypsin (1:50 enzyme to protein ratio) overnight at 37&#x000b0;. Ten microliters of the supernatant (corresponding to 15&#x02009;&#x003bc;g of protein) was taken as a pre&#x02010;HUNTER and the rest (HUNTER) was labeled with undecanal by adding EtOH to 40%, 12&#x02009;&#x003bc;L undecanal 97% and sodium cyanoborohydride to 30&#x02009;mM final concentration for 1&#x02009;h at 37&#x000b0;C. Labeled peptide solution was then acidified with Trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) to pH&#x02009;3 and undecanal clean&#x02010;up was performed using Sep&#x02010;Pak tC18 Cartridges 1&#x02009;cc (Waters). Conditioning and equilibration were performed with methanol and 40% EtOH, 0.1% TFA, respectively. Samples were added and 0.1% TFA and flow through was collected. Collected fractions were dried in a Speedvac for 3&#x02009;h then freeze&#x02010;dried overnight. Desalting of the Pre&#x02010;HUNTER and HUNTER samples was done with 10&#x02009;&#x003bc;L Pierce C18 Spin Tips (Thermo) and Sep&#x02010;Pak C18 Cartridges 1&#x02009;cc (Waters), respectively. Eluted peptides were vacuum dried and stored at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C until analysis.</p><p>Samples were resuspended in 3% ACN with 0.1% TFA and injected for LC&#x02013;MS analysis. Chromatographic separation was performed on a Dionex U3000 nanoHPLC system equipped with an Acclaim pepmap100 C18 column (2&#x02009;&#x003bc;m particle size, 75&#x02009;&#x003bc;m&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;500&#x02009;mm) coupled online to a mass spectrometer. The eluents used were eluent A: 0.05% FA, eluent B: 80% ACN&#x02009;+&#x02009;0.04% FA. For pre&#x02010;HUNTER samples, the separation was performed over a programmed 90&#x02009;min run. Initial chromatographic conditions were 4% B for 2&#x02009;min followed by linear gradients from 4% to 50% B over 60&#x02009;min, then 50%&#x02013;90% B over 5&#x02009;min, and 10&#x02009;min at 90% B. Following this, an interrun equilibration of the column was achieved by 13&#x02009;min at 4% B. For HUNTER samples, the separation was performed over a programmed 220&#x02009;min run. Initial chromatographic conditions were 4% B for 2&#x02009;min followed by linear gradients from 4% to 50% B over 180&#x02009;min, then 50%&#x02013;90% B over 10&#x02009;min, and 13&#x02009;min at 90% B. Following this, an interrun equilibration of the column was achieved by 15&#x02009;min at 4% B. A constant flow rate of 300&#x02009;nL/min was employed.

Spatial learning and memory were assessed by the Morris' Water Maze hidden platform task performed as previously described with minor modifications [<xref rid="fsb270616-bib-0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Briefly, the water maze (diameter 120&#x02009;cm) was filled with clear water (21&#x000b0;C&#x02013;22&#x000b0;C) 1 cm above the platform. Prominent symbols around the maze provided abundant extra&#x02010;maze cues. The platform stayed in the same quadrant from days 1 to 4 and the animals were released from four different positions at the pool perimeter. Mice performed four trials per day on 4 consecutive days with a maximum length of 90s. Each day the animals were released into the water from different locations outside the platform (d1&#x02014;north, south, east, west; d2&#x02014;W&#x02010;E&#x02010;S&#x02010;N; d3&#x02014;S&#x02010;W&#x02010;N&#x02010;E; d4&#x02014;E&#x02010;N&#x02010;W&#x02010;S). If mice did not find the platform within the given time, they were guided to the platform. Mice were allowed to stay on the platform for 10&#x02009;s to memorize the surrounding cues. On the fifth experimental day, a probe trial (60&#x02009;s) without the platform was performed. Basal motor activity was evaluated by swim speed (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="fsb270616-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5</xref>). Learning was assessed by measuring the escape latency to find the platform. Memory capabilities were characterized by the number each mouse crossed the former platform location at probe trial and the latency to reach the location. To further assess the ability to memorize the location of the platform, the time spent in the right quarter of the platform was measured. For vision abilities, a visible platform task was done after the learning assessment at day 6. It consisted of three trials in a row starting opposite to the platform, which was indicated by a table tennis ball 15&#x02009;cm above the platform.

<sup>;wt/wt</sup> Mice</title><p>As changes in the brain ECM have been documented to influence AMPAR&#x02010;dependent excitability, we next investigated whether an overexpression of meprin &#x003b2; in the mouse hippocampus affects the AMPAR&#x02010;dependent excitability of the hippocampal neuronal network [<xref rid="fsb270616-bib-0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="fsb270616-bib-0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].

A series of electrical stimulations ranging from 0.5 V to 5 V, with step increases of 0.5 V, was applied to one electrode of the MEA located below the Schaffer collaterals in the CA3 region of the brain slice. The resulting extracellular fEPSPs were recorded with the MEA electrode below the target region in CA1.

Together with other lecticans, hyaluronic acid, and tenascin&#x02010;R, brevican plays a crucial role in the formation of perineuronal nets (PNNs). These nets are structures that surround the proximal dendrites and neuronal cell bodies, stabilizing synapses by acting as a barrier against the growth of nearby axons or dendrites [<xref rid="fsb270616-bib-0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="fsb270616-bib-0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="fsb270616-bib-0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Moreover, PNNs are essential for long&#x02010;term memory consolidation [<xref rid="fsb270616-bib-0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], extending the importance of brevican in the neuronal ECM and its role in synaptic transmission to behavioral and cognitive aspects. Brevican is a key contributor to spatial memory and memory retrieval function, as found previously through hippocampal proteoglycan isolation and characterization in rats that underwent the Morris' Water Maze spatial paradigm test [<xref rid="fsb270616-bib-0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Brevican&#x02010;deficient mice have also displayed impaired hippocampal CA1 LTP in previous studies, with LTP considered the most widely established underlying cellular mechanism for learning and memory consolidation [<xref rid="fsb270616-bib-0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Even within clinical cohorts, patients suffering from vascular dementia were found to have significantly decreased serum brevican levels compared to that of healthy controls [<xref rid="fsb270616-bib-0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="fsb270616-bib-0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="fsb270616-bib-0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="fsb270616-bib-0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="fsb270616-bib-0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="fsb270616-bib-0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], which prompted the suggestion of the use of fluid brevican as a biomarker for dementia&#x02010; and cognitive impairment&#x02010;related brain pathologies. In a recent study by Liu et&#x000a0;al. [<xref rid="fsb270616-bib-0039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], brevican was further implicated in ACD, Alzheimer's disease (AD), stroke, and depression, underscoring its potential utility as a biomarker for a more diverse array of diseases. Notably, Liu et&#x000a0;al. demonstrated that brevican exhibited no influence on movement, a finding that aligns with our observations (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="fsb270616-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5</xref>).</p><p>To better understand how meprin &#x003b2; overexpression influences synaptic function, we examined its subcellular localization using confocal microscopy on sagittal brain slices, specifically targeting the CA3 region of the hippocampus. This region was selected due to previously observed deficits in spatial learning in the Morris' water maze in meprin &#x003b2;&#x02010;overexpressing mice. Wild&#x02010;type animals showed meprin &#x003b2; predominantly localized around the nucleus, likely reflecting the endoplasmic reticulum. In contrast, overexpressing mice exhibited strong meprin &#x003b2; expression in the soma, axons, and notably at synaptic sites. Costaining with the postsynaptic marker PSD&#x02010;95 revealed a higher degree of overlap compared to the presynaptic marker VGLUT, supporting postsynaptic enrichment of meprin &#x003b2;. This subcellular distribution provides a potential anatomical correlate to the observed electrophysiological and behavioral changes.</p><p>While LTP induction is primarily an NMDA receptor (NMDAR)&#x02010;dependent mechanism, brevican has also been highlighted for its associations with AMPA receptors (AMPAR); namely their mobility and diffusion [<xref rid="fsb270616-bib-0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="fsb270616-bib-0040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] and the capacity at which they can facilitate short&#x02010;term synaptic plasticity [<xref rid="fsb270616-bib-0041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="fsb270616-bib-0042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Knockout of AMPAR subunit GluR1 in mice exhibits impaired learning and memory, which also highlights AMPA's role in synaptic plasticity and associative learning [<xref rid="fsb270616-bib-0043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="fsb270616-bib-0044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>].</p><p>On discovering that overexpression of meprin &#x003b2; resulted in the cleavage of such a main component of the neuronal ECM as brevican, the electrophysiology and behavioral results also became more coherent. The increase in basal excitability, seen by the significantly larger evoked input/output curve amplitudes in meprin &#x003b2;&#x02010;overexpressing mice compared to mep&#x003b2;<sup>Cre;wt/wt</sup> mice, is likely due to the increased AMPAR mobility and lateral diffusion in the postsynaptic CA1 pyramidal cells [<xref rid="fsb270616-bib-0040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Interestingly, it was shown that the surface compartments formed by the ECM&#x02014;of which brevican is a main component&#x02014;hinder lateral diffusion of AMPA receptors and may therefore decrease the capacity for short&#x02010;term synaptic plasticity [<xref rid="fsb270616-bib-0040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. With the digestion of brevican and therefore an at least partial breakdown of the impeding ECM, AMPARs, which are desensitized from use, can quickly be replaced by na&#x000ef;ve AMPARs moving from the extrasynaptic space to the postsynaptic density (PSD), ready for activation. This means that the number of postsynaptic receptors that are available for activation can be consistently replenished, enhancing the AMPAR&#x02010;dependent evoked activity responses seen from the input/output curve. A study by Favuzzi et&#x000a0;al. [<xref rid="fsb270616-bib-0045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] supports previous findings by demonstrating that the PNN surrounding parvalbumin (PV+) interneurons plays a critical role in regulating plasticity. The authors propose that brevican, a key component of the PNN, modulates cellular and synaptic plasticity by influencing the localization of potassium channels and AMPA receptors [<xref rid="fsb270616-bib-0045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].</p><p>The fact that meprin &#x003b2; cleaves a protein of the ECM within which the receptors are immobilized&#x02014;allowing a more fluid diffusion of synaptic receptors in the membrane, rather than cleaving or affecting those receptors directly&#x02014;brings with it some further inquiries. This assumes that total AMPAR and/or NMDAR subunit protein expression levels in the meprin &#x003b2;&#x02010;overexpressing mouseline should not be different from that of the mep&#x003b2;<sup>Cre;wt/wt</sup> controls, despite electrophysiological changes which are normally receptor concentration&#x02010;dependent. Indeed, quantitative western blot analysis confirmed that total expression levels for AMPAR and NMDAR subunits were equivalent for both animal groups (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="fsb270616-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>), owing to the point that it is not about whether the receptors (or their subunits) are increased or decreased in expression, but rather where they are in the membrane/ECM at any given moment. If meprin &#x003b2; was in fact actively degrading both NMDA and AMPA receptors, it would likely result in early mortality, given their developmental roles [<xref rid="fsb270616-bib-0046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Even if mortality did not occur, it would likely cause a distinct phenotype in the transgenic animals, since the meprin &#x003b2; overexpression is occurring from the beginning. Meprin &#x003b2;&#x02010;overexpressing mice, however, exhibit no developmental abnormalities and appear phenotypically normal (own observations). The absence of a clear phenotype of meprin &#x003b2;&#x02010;overexpressing mice might relate to the fact that the natural increase of brevican expression only normally occurs <italic toggle="yes">after</italic> birth [<xref rid="fsb270616-bib-0047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Supposedly, brevican is disposable in early development and not essential for fetal growth or embryonic development.</p><p>Additionally, the significant intergroup electrophysiological changes could be specifically due to receptor expression on the membrane surface, rather than to total expression. This was also thoroughly considered. Since there was a significant increase in evoked fEPSPs concomitantly with a significant decrease/loss of LTP in the meprin &#x003b2;&#x02010;overexpressing mice, a metaplasticity effect was hypothesized. In order to investigate this, a surface biotinylation assay on primary hippocampal neurons from mep&#x003b2;<sup>Cre;wt/wt</sup> and meprin &#x003b2; KO mouse brains was undertaken (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="fsb270616-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7</xref>). This assay showed no changes in membrane surface AMPAR subunit or NMDAR subunit expression, verifying that membrane surface receptor composition was not quantitatively altered between these groups, as well as implying that meprin &#x003b2; does not influence membrane surface receptor expression. Furthermore, we would like to emphasize that Brakebusch et&#x000a0;al. [<xref rid="fsb270616-bib-0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] reported an impairment in LTP maintenance in brevican KO mice, which was attributed to structural and functional changes in the ECM affecting synaptic signaling and maintenance. This finding supports our theory, since a similar effect is observed in meprin &#x003b2;&#x02010;overexpressing mice.</p><p>While the evoked network excitability and the LTP experiments proved significant differences between groups, the additional electrophysiological paired&#x02010;pulse ratio (PPR) experiments did not (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="fsb270616-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8</xref>). Although an increase in synaptic facilitation is generally seen with an accompanying increase in PPR, the significant increase of both the first and the second evoked response from the PPR protocol in these meprin &#x003b2;&#x02010;overexpressing mice meant that the overall ratio of the second response relative to the first was equivalent across groups. This is, however, in line with our hypothesis that the postsynaptic replenishment of naive AMPARs causes the significant enhancement of the evoked response amplitudes&#x02014;something which does not concern the presynaptic release probability (which is reflected by the PPR) but rather the postsynaptic AMPAR functional efficiency.</p><p>Of course, meprin &#x003b2; overexpression could also owe to morphological changes in neurons or their connectivity. The composition of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins critically impacts neuronal spine density and synaptic plasticity, which are vital for learning and memory [<xref rid="fsb270616-bib-0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Enzymes like MMP&#x02010;9 cleave ECM components, enhancing dendritic spine formation and stability [<xref rid="fsb270616-bib-0048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Such modifications may, of course, contribute to impairments in synaptic function and cognitive processes in the brain, showing the large impact proteolytic enzymes have on the ECM. For example, ADAMTS4&#x02014;a brevican&#x02010;cleaving proteolytic enzyme&#x02014;strongly influences neuronal spine density and is essential for synaptic plasticity [<xref rid="fsb270616-bib-0049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>, <xref rid="fsb270616-bib-0050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] as well as being linked to LTP [<xref rid="fsb270616-bib-0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Our data strongly reflect these changes: meprin &#x003b2; overexpression leads to lower brevican protein levels and ECM proteolysis, which then influences LTP formation and ultimately impacts learning and memory.</p><p>In conclusion, brevican emerges as a pivotal ECM component integral to synaptic plasticity, memory formation, and cognitive function. The interplay between brevican and meprin &#x003b2; highlights the dynamic regulation of synaptic receptors and neuronal connectivity, emphasizing how ECM proteolysis impacts neuronal signaling and plasticity. These findings not only underscore meprin &#x003b2;'s role in memory and synaptic transmission but also put forward its potential as a biomarker for cognitive disorders.</p></sec><sec id="fsb270616-sec-0027"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>C.U.P. designed the study.
