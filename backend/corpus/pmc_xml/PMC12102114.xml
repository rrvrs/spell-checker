This meta-analysis aims to provide a robust estimate of the longitudinal association between academic achievement and subsequent youth offending. We searched PsycINFO, ERIC, British Education Index, and Web of Science from inception to 2 April 2024 using a comprehensive search strategy. We identified eligible studies reporting on the association between academic achievement and subsequent youth offending, as measured using self-report or administrative records up to the age of 25&#x000a0;years. Correlation coefficients and odds ratios were pooled in a meta-analysis. Effect modifiers were investigated in a sub-group analysis, and other findings were narratively synthesised. PROSPERO record: CRD42023402103. Seventeen studies were included, of which eight were pooled in a meta-analysis. The findings showed a small but statistically significant association between lower academic achievement and youth offending (pooled Fisher <italic>z</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02009;&#x02212;&#x02009;0.21, 95% CI [&#x02212;&#x02009;0.29,&#x02009;&#x02212;&#x02009;0.12], <italic>I</italic><sup>2</sup>&#x02009;=&#x02009;98.4%). Sub-group analysis and narrative synthesis yielded mixed findings on the possible role of measurement timing and offence types. Lower academic achievement was associated with subsequent youth offending, underlining the need for a child-first approach to early prevention and intervention strategies in educational and forensic settings.</p><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s40865-025-00266-9.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Academic achievement</kwd><kwd>Youth offending</kwd><kwd>Delinquency</kwd><kwd>Systematic review</kwd><kwd>Meta-analysis</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000269</institution-id><institution>Economic and Social Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ES/W002531/1</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">In England and Wales, the year ending March 2023 saw a 9% increase in arrests of children and an 8% increase in sentencing occasions involving children compared to the previous year (Youth Justice Board for England &#x00026; Wales, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2024</xref>). There are substantial costs associated with youth offending, encompassing physical and mental health services, law enforcement, youth justice, and custody services (Hemphill et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2015</xref>). In the UK alone, reports reveal an expenditure of &#x000a3;158&#x000a0;m on youth custody services and &#x000a3;94&#x000a0;m on youth justice board services from 2020 to 2021 (National Audit Office, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2023</xref>). The social and economic cost of youth crime highlights the need for initiatives that prioritise early identification and protection of children against future involvement with the criminal justice system.</p><p id="Par3">It has long been recognised that educational experiences contribute to adolescents&#x02019; risk of engagement in criminal activities (Department for Education &#x00026; Ministry of Justice, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2023</xref>; Rutter et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">1979</xref>). One factor frequently explored within this context is the role of academic achievement (Farrington, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2003</xref>). Longitudinal studies have shown low academic achievement as a robust predictor of future criminal behaviour (Martins et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2022</xref>). This is in keeping with the integrated cognitive antisocial potential (ICAP) theory (Farrington, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2020</xref>). This theory attempts to explain the mechanisms underlying &#x02018;antisocial potential&#x02019;, a construct that represents an individual&#x02019;s potential to engage in antisocial behaviour, and how this potentially translates to criminal offending. In this context, &#x02018;school failure&#x02019; (alongside low income and unemployment) is proposed as a long-term contributor to antisocial potential. This is because individuals may turn to antisocial behaviour to satisfy their goals and motivations, both in terms of status and financial stability, if they are struggling to meet their needs through legitimate means (Farrington, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2020</xref>). Low academic achievement has been theorised to weaken social bonds and adherence to societal norms, impede the development of self-efficacy and positive sense of self, and limit economic opportunities (Donnellan et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2005</xref>; Farrington, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2003</xref>). Furthermore, low academic achievement leads to greater associations with delinquent peers and groups, heightening short-term AP by increasing the situational pressures on an individual to offend (Farrington, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2018</xref>).</p><p id="Par4">An advantage of concentrating on academic achievement is that it represents a modifiable risk factor that could potentially be targeted early in childhood and adolescence. If high academic achievement is associated with reduced offending or delinquency outcomes, then there is significant motivation to establish whether it has a causal role and develop school-based programmes aimed at improving educational outcomes. Understanding associations between academic achievement and violent behaviour or aggression was the focus of a meta-analysis by Savage and colleagues (Savage et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2017</xref>). This meta-analysis reported that academic achievement may be a stronger predictor of violent criminal behaviour than non-violent. Their findings support the differential aetiology of violence hypothesis (Savage &#x00026; Wozniak, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2016</xref>), which posits that violent behaviour should be distinguished from other forms of criminal behaviour. Savage et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2017</xref>) propose that poor academic achievement may be a specific predictor of violent offending due to the negative association between intelligence and violence. Other theories suggest that school problems lead to frustration and anger which can manifest as aggression (Eme, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2020</xref>).</p><p id="Par5">However, aspects of Savage et al.&#x02019;s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2017</xref>) study design limit our ability to generalise these findings to the association between academic achievement and youth offending more generally. First, their eligibility criteria excluded studies of &#x02018;delinquency&#x02019; as a general construct, because they wanted to be able to differentiate between associations specifically for violent versus non-violent offending. To fully capture associations between academic achievement and offending outcomes among young people, it would be important to capture studies of delinquency, this being a widely used term in the literature to describe law-breaking behaviour among juveniles. Second, Savage et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2017</xref>) included studies which measured physical aggression in general (such as intention to cause harm); while criminal offending is a potential outcome of aggression, they represent distinct constructs (Berlin et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2021</xref>), warranting a further investigation focusing on offending. Additionally, Savage et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2017</xref>) included cross-sectional studies. The current study only includes longitudinal studies where attainment is investigated prior to offending, allowing investigation of the temporal order of events that creates potential for making causal inferences. We exclusively focus on the impact of academic achievement, excluding studies investigating other education-related outcomes such as general intelligence. Our operationalisation of academic achievement is important as it measures a potentially modifiable outcome, students&#x02019; grades and scores, which determines further academic opportunities.</p><p id="Par6">The aim of the current meta-analysis was to investigate the association between academic achievement and subsequent youth offending. We hypothesised that there is an association between lower academic achievement and increased subsequent youth offending. Our secondary aims were to investigate whether this association varied according to offence type or by timing of achievement and offending measurements.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par7">This meta-analysis followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines (Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>) (Page et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2021</xref>).

This represents a significant period of biological and social change before fully mature adulthood (Sawyer et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2018</xref>). Furthermore, due to variations in the age at which compulsory education ends in different countries, this ensured a sufficient follow-up period for the offending outcome to occur.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Exposure and Outcome Variables</title><p id="Par10">Eligible studies reported on the relationship between academic achievement (exposure) and subsequent offending and delinquency (outcome). We included any measure of academic achievement (self- or informant-report or from administrative records) including, but not limited to, grades, grade point average (GPA), and test scores, in recognition that, internationally, different education systems measure academic achievement differently. However, school dropout, general intelligence, aptitude, or ability-only measures were excluded as constructs, which can be associated with, but are distinct from, academic achievement. Youth offending or delinquency could likewise be self- or informant-reported or derived from administrative records, and externalising problems and conduct disorder (CD) were excluded as distinct constructs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Study Design</title><p id="Par11">Included studies were quantitative, prospective longitudinal studies, to help infer a direction of effect. As a result, cross-sectional studies, case reports, clinical vignettes, exclusively qualitative studies, and retrospective studies were excluded. Studies were also original research reported in full, such that reviews, meta-analyses, commentaries, letters to the editor, opinion pieces, and editorials were also excluded. Furthermore, studies that aimed to conduct or evaluate an intervention during the study period were excluded, such as randomised controlled trials, as this might influence the observed associations. Due to limited resources for translation and time constraints, included studies were English and published in peer-reviewed journals. This excluded &#x02018;grey literature&#x02019;, such as books, reports, and theses. Finally, the full text had to be available, including reported associations between academic achievement and youth offending.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Search Strategy</title><p id="Par12">PsycINFO, Education Resources Information Centre (ERIC), British Education Index (BEI), and Web of Science were searched on 26 October 2021.

The searches included keyword combinations capturing the underlying concepts of (1) academic achievement, (2) offending, and (3) youth. We additionally included subject headings in the searches, which were adapted to each database&#x02019;s thesaurus. Full search strategies for each database can be found in Supplement 1.

Researcher agreement was 97% following independent title and abstract screening and 90% following independent full-text screening. Disagreements were adjudicated by co-author AW.

Any studies, which drew from the same longitudinal data sources, were recorded separately in data extraction due to the potential for providing insights into different covariates and effect modifiers. For the original search, ML conducted data extraction, and CC conducted independent second data extraction for 10%. Disagreements were adjudicated by AW. For the search update, CC and AW conducted data extraction.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Quality Assessment</title><p id="Par15">Risk of bias was assessed using a modified 11-item version of the Newcastle&#x02013;Ottawa Scale (NOS) for cohort studies (Wells et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">n.d</xref>.; Wickersham et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2021</xref>), which assesses participant selection, comparability, and outcomes (Supplement 2). Items were tailored to reflect the focus of this meta-analysis on academic achievement and youth offending, such as using administrative records compared to self or informant-report for exposure and outcomes measurements. Risk of bias was scored out of a total of 13 points (higher scores indicate better study quality). Scores of 10&#x02013;13, 6&#x02013;9, and 0&#x02013;5 indicate low, moderate, and high risk of bias, respectively (Epstein et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2020</xref>). For the original search, ML conducted quality assessment, and CC conducted independent quality assessment on 10%, with disagreements adjudicated by AW. Researcher agreement was 85%. For the search update, CC conducted quality assessment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Data Synthesis and Analysis</title><p id="Par16">Correlation coefficients were the most frequently reported effect sizes among the included studies and were, therefore, pooled in a meta-analysis. The second most frequently reported effect size was odds ratios (OR), which we transformed into correlation coefficients and also included in the meta-analysis (Borenstein et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2009</xref>). If studies reported relevant effect sizes for multiple timepoints, we took the effect size for the two most distal timepoints to investigate longitudinal effects. If studies still reported multiple relevant effect sizes for separate or overlapping subgroups, we took the mean average correlation coefficient (taken by averaging their Fisher&#x02019;s <italic>z</italic> transformations) and the total sample size. However, where it was not possible to estimate a total sample size for combined groups, we took the effect size for the largest subgroup instead. Any correlation coefficients that reported on the reverse association (i.e. academic underachievement and offending) were multiplied by&#x02009;&#x02212;&#x02009;1 to ensure all associations included in the meta-analysis were investigating the same direction. Correlation coefficients underwent Fisher&#x02019;s <italic>z</italic> transformations and were pooled in a random effects (restricted maximum likelihood estimator) meta-analysis in R (version 4.1.2) using the &#x02018;rma&#x02019; function in the &#x02018;metafor&#x02019; package (Viechtbauer, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2010</xref>). Heterogeneity was investigated using Cochran&#x02019;s <italic>Q</italic> and <italic>I</italic><sup>2</sup> statistics (Higgins et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2003</xref>), and publication bias was assessed using Egger&#x02019;s test and a contour-enhanced funnel plot (Egger et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">1997</xref>).</p><p id="Par17">We conducted subgroup analyses to assess whether using administrative records versus self- or informant-reports for exposure and outcome measurements impacted the observed association. We also conducted a subgroup analysis to assess whether the timing of academic achievement and youth offending measurements impacted observed associations. We categorised studies into two groups based on follow-up duration, using the mean follow-up period of 6&#x000a0;years across all eligible studies from the original search. Hence, studies with a follow-up of less than 6&#x000a0;years versus 6&#x000a0;years or greater were allocated to the shorter and longer follow-up subgroups, respectively. If studies included multiple follow-up periods, they were categorised according to the longest follow-up period. For these subgroup analyses, we first obtained the estimated average effects of the two subgroups using separate random-effect models.

However, Crosnoe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2002</xref>) only found this association to be significant in their non-college preparatory track, not in their college-preparatory track. One study reported an association in the opposite direction, with low academic achievement significantly predicting abstaining from delinquency compared to self-reported delinquency (Mercer et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2016</xref>). Across four studies which reported odds ratios (Farrington et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2016</xref>; Hemphill et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2016</xref>; Mercer et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2016</xref>; Zych et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2021</xref>), the reported adjusted odds ratios (which accounted for varying confounders) ranged from 1.31 (high drug use sample) to 3.24 (low family SES sample) (Hemphill et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2016</xref>).</p><p id="Par25">Included studies reported a wide range of potential covariates and confounders (Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>). Except for Hemphill et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2016</xref>), Dodge et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2008</xref>), Felson and Staff (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2006</xref>), and Crosnoe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2002</xref>) (college-preparatory track), most of the studies still found a statistically significant association between lower academic achievement and increased youth offending after controlling for various covariates and confounders. Felson and Staff (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2006</xref>) found this to be the case after controlling for various covariates in three of their models, but when attachment, commitment and effort were included in the model this became non-significant. Gremmen et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2019</xref>), in their network analysis, found that GPA only significantly negatively affected delinquency in 7th and 9th grades, not 8th grade. Farrington et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2016</xref>) found both that higher school attainment acted as a protective factor and lower school attainment as a risk factor. They also found that various factors moderated the effect of attainment, e.g. low &#x02018;troublesomeness&#x02019; (extent of getting into trouble, as rated by peers and teachers) protected against the effect of low school attainment on offending. Furthermore, ten studies that appeared to adjust for prior offending also still found a statistically significant association between lower academic achievements and increased subsequent offending.</p><p id="Par26">Regarding our secondary research question on offence types, one distinction made was between violent/aggressive offending (such as physical fighting and using a weapon during a fight) and non-violent/aggressive offending (such as shoplifting, painting graffiti and property damage) (Choi, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2007</xref>; Savage &#x00026; Ellis, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2019</xref>). Both studies found a stronger association between lower academic achievement and violent/aggressive offending, compared to non-violent/non-aggressive offending; however, these associations were not statistically tested. In contrast, Sabates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2008</xref>) found a significant association between lower educational attainment and conviction rates for burglary, theft and vandalism, and drug offences, but a non-significant association for violent offending. Smith et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2013</xref>) made an additional distinction by categorising crime into official arrest records, self-reported perpetration of intimate partner violence, self-reported general crime (including minor offences such as public rowdiness, and serious offences, such as robbery and assault with a deadly weapon), and self-reported violent crime (encompassing specific items of the general crime index such as robbery, assault and gang fights). They found significant associations between lower school GPA and all categories of crime, with the relationship between school GPA and official arrest records being the strongest.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par27">This meta-analysis provides comprehensive evidence for a weak but statistically significant association between lower academic achievement and increased risk for subsequent youth offending that appears to persist following adjustment for a number of confounders, such as prior offending. Included studies were very varied in their methodologies, although results did not appear to vary according to the source of exposure or outcome measurement, or the timing of these measurements, operationalised as the duration of follow-up. Our narrative synthesis indicated that the relationship may vary according to different offence types, but very few studies investigated this.</p><p id="Par28">Our findings are similar to a previous meta-analysis by Savage et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2017</xref>) which focused on academic achievement and violent behaviour. By expanding our analysis to capture studies of criminal offending and delinquency in general, we capture a wider literature showing associations between lower academic achievement and youth offending. Our meta-analytic findings were also consistent with other longitudinal studies exploring the association between academic difficulties and future offending behaviour (Farrington, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2003</xref>; Martins et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2022</xref>), and in our narrative review, we found that these associations remained robust following adjustment for various potential confounders such as SES, parental and family characteristics, and substance and alcohol use. Our findings also support the ICAP theory&#x02019;s suggestion that low academic achievement increases long-term antisocial potential (Farrington, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2018</xref>). Previous research shows how individual characteristics, such as self-control and sense of self, can moderate the impact of academic achievement on both short-term and long-term antisocial potential (AP). For example, Farrington et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2016</xref>) demonstrate how characteristics such as &#x02018;low troublesomeness&#x02019; may act as a protective factor, reducing the risk of an individual offending regardless of low academic achievement. This is consistent with ICAP theory&#x02019;s emphasis on the variable effect of risk and protective factors between individuals (Farrington, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2018</xref>).</p><p id="Par29">Our narrative synthesis showed mixed findings on the observed association for different offence types. Some studies tentatively suggested a stronger association between achievement and violent/aggressive offending compared to non-violent/aggressive offending, consistent with Savage et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2017</xref>). However, Sabates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2008</xref>) found a non-significant association between educational achievement and violent offending, compared to significant associations for all other investigated offence types. As such, findings on the differential association between academic achievement and violent and non-violent offending remain equivocal and warrant further investigation into offence-specific pathways. Examining factors including impulsivity, social pressures, and societal norms, is therefore crucial, as these variables have the potential to help identify the distinct mechanisms that underpin the relationship between academic achievement and different offending behaviour (Hoffmann, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2018</xref>; Zhu et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2024</xref>). By addressing wider social, educational, and personality factors, this offers an opportunity to broaden the application of the ICAP theory to account for variability across different offence types.</p><p id="Par30">A strength of this study was the use of a comprehensive search strategy applied to relevant electronic databases. We aligned keywords and subject headings closely to our research question to capture a large number of relevant studies that had not been captured by a previous meta-analysis in this area (Savage et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2017</xref>). We also took a robust approach to screening, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment with two independent reviewers. This supported our aim to produce as robust an estimate of the association between academic achievement and offending as possible.</p><p id="Par31">This study also has some limitations. Many included studies relied on self-reported measures, which may carry biases for measuring delinquency or attainment. Studies using self-reported offending measures may report higher offending rates than official records (Piquero et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2014</xref>; Pollock et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2015</xref>); however, there is generally moderate agreement between official and self-reported measures of offending (Piquero et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2014</xref>). The validity of self-reported attainment is also questionable and has been shown to vary according to students&#x02019; ability; for example, children with lower achievement may be more likely to self-report grades inaccurately (Kuncel et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2005</xref>; Teye &#x00026; Peaslee, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2015</xref>). Additionally, although our focus on longitudinal studies with prospective data collection allowed for better inference of a direction of association, some of the studies took approaches to longitudinal modelling which could not be incorporated into our meta-analysis. Our research also showed evidence of publication bias, and the exclusion of studies not published in the English language may have resulted in the omission of important research findings. This limitation also restricts the generalisability of our findings to countries not captured by this research. Our research predominantly captured eligible studies that were carried out in high-income North American or European countries. Furthermore, studies were of moderate quality overall and exhibited significant heterogeneity; our sub-group analyses did not identify any statistically significant study-level effect modifiers, such that understanding modifiers underlying this heterogeneity would be an important area for future research.</p><p id="Par32">In addition to offending outcomes, low academic achievement can have an extensive impact throughout an individual&#x02019;s life, contributing towards various negative outcomes such as unemployment, homelessness, poor health, and suicide (Almquist, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2013</xref>; Brakenhoff et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2015</xref>; Caspi et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">1998</xref>; S&#x000f6;rberg Wallin et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2018</xref>). Our research, alongside insights provided by Savage et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2017</xref>), demonstrates that lower academic achievement is associated with subsequent youth offending. This may have significant implications for youth and adult custody services and the education sector, particularly as youth justice practitioners navigate the recent shift away from risk-centric towards child-first approaches (Day, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2023</xref>).</p><p id="Par33">Tentatively, our findings suggest that child-first prevention approaches incorporating strategies to improve academic achievement may be beneficial, although further work establishing a causal pathway would be required. In keeping with the ICAP theory, it remains plausible that interventions to improve academic achievement could disrupt the pathway from low attainment to antisocial behaviour, particularly if tackled alongside other risk factors. Additionally, low or declining levels of academic attainment may be a readily available marker for schools to identify pupils who are potentially &#x02018;at-risk&#x02019; (Wickersham, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2024</xref>) and may benefit from educational interventions as well as behavioural and emotional skills interventions (Farrington et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2017</xref>).</p><p id="Par34">It should be acknowledged that achievement is just one aspect of the school journey and that other educational factors may also play an important role in this pathway, such as school absence and exclusion. By enhancing our understanding of the pathways from academic achievement to offending, and taking into account other educational factors, we can inform research-based initiatives aimed at promoting educational success, which might in turn reduce subsequent rates of offending and re-offending. Because education is compulsory for all young people in many countries, schools could present an ideal setting to identify pupils at increased risk of offending and offer appropriate support before problems escalate (Melendez-Torres et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2023</xref>)&#x02014;this could be the subject of further experimental trials.</p><p id="Par35">Future research must examine how sociodemographic characteristics, other education factors, and social care impact the association between academic achievement and youth offending, especially for youth &#x02018;at-risk&#x02019; of later offending. Identifying critical areas of intervention, such as early educational challenges, school absences, or exclusion, could enable targeted efforts to enhance student engagement and offer specialised social support (Melendez-Torres et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2023</xref>). Schools and other education services could implement early interventions which address the academic and psychosocial needs of at-risk youth by employing ICAP-informed practices. This has the potential to inform youth justice practices and educational policies that contribute to the broader application of comprehensive, child-focused approaches, with the aim of reducing youth offending rates.</p><p id="Par36">Although some included studies measured academic achievement and offending at multiple timepoints, future longitudinal studies could helpfully establish periods during an individual&#x02019;s academic career when changes in academic achievement most strongly associated with offending outcomes, potentially highlighting key timepoints for intervention. Methodological considerations would play an important role in designing such future studies; for example, while we found no modifying effect of where exposure and outcome measures were sourced from, it is notable that the two studies in our meta-analysis which found the weakest association between academic achievement and offending were also the only two studies which measured achievement on binary scales, rather than continuous scales or categorical scales with more categories (Dodge et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2008</xref>; Hemphill et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2016</xref>). Therefore, measuring achievement using more granular scales potentially affords greater sensitivity for detecting such associations. Future studies could also conduct more comprehensive investigations examining the role of potentially modifying factors, including various sociodemographic, educational and social care characteristics, and the impact on different offence types. This may yield more specific recommendations for front-line practice and for policy.</p><p id="Par37">In conclusion, we conducted a comprehensive meta-analysis and narrative synthesis on the association between lower academic achievement and later youth offending. We found evidence for a small but statistically significant association. Further investigations into this complex association are needed to establish early prevention and intervention initiatives that address the specific challenges and needs of individuals most at risk of later offending.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.<supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM1"><media xlink:href="40865_2025_266_MOESM1_ESM.docx"><caption><p>ESM 1 (DOCX 56.7 KB)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>M.
