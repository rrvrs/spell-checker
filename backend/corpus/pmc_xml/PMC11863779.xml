The programme established an SNT team, which determined intervention targeting criteria; identified, assembled, and reviewed relevant data sources; stratified malaria risk and its determinants to inform geographical targeting for each intervention; and used mathematical modelling to predict the impact of different intervention mix scenarios. The SNT analysis was performed at the district level, excluding the urban area of Conakry.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">Malaria incidence, malaria prevalence, and all-cause under-5 mortality were used for the epidemiological stratification of Guinea. Additional indicators relevant for decision-making including seasonality patterns, insecticide resistance, historical malaria interventions and vaccine coverage were also stratified. Stratified layers were used to inform the targeting criteria for each intervention to identify districts to prioritize for indoor residual spray, dual-action insecticide-treated nets, seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC), including number of cycles for each eligible district, malaria vaccine, and perennial malaria chemoprevention. Results of the SNT analysis were used to mobilize funding from the Global Fund for scale-up of dual-action nets and expansion of SMC.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">SNT allowed Guinea&#x02019;s national malaria programme to adapt their intervention strategy at the health district level, an unprecedented approach in the country. The use of local data to inform eligibility and prioritization allowed the programme to identify the optimal mix of interventions for each district and to successfully mobilize resources to support their plans.</p></sec><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12936-025-05302-z.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Subnational tailoring</kwd><kwd>Malaria</kwd><kwd>Guinea</kwd><kwd>Stratification</kwd><kwd>Interventions</kwd><kwd>Prioritization</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000865</institution-id><institution>Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>INV -048410</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par30">Malaria is the primary cause of outpatient visits and hospitalizations in children under five years of age in Guinea despite years of intense malaria control efforts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Guinea&#x02019;s national malaria programme, the Programme National de Lutte contre le Paludisme (PNLP), developed a national strategic plan for malaria covering the period 2023 to 2027, which includes the deployment of pyrethroid-based insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs), seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC), intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy (IPTp), introduction of a malaria vaccine, and treatment of symptomatic cases. The national strategy development process also considered second-generation ITNs, indoor residual spraying (IRS), and perennial malaria chemoprevention (PMC, then known as intermittent preventive treatment for infants) as interventions of interest should additional resources become available.</p><p id="Par31">Main funders for the malaria response in Guinea include the Global Fund against AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (50%), the US President&#x02019;s Malaria Initiative (PMI) (40%), with World Bank (3%), and domestic sources (7%). As is the case globally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], the total resources available for malaria response in Guinea are insufficient to fund all interventions necessary to achieve key targets.</p><p id="Par32">In 2023, the PNLP underwent a thorough prioritization exercise to review the malaria control plan for 2024 to 2026, aligned with the Global Fund funding cycle (GC7). This exercise aimed to maximize the impact of the resources available for the fight against malaria in Guinea, following the subnational tailoring of interventions (SNT) approach recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par33">In brief, SNT consists of using local data and additional contextual information available to malaria control programmes to inform decision-making. In the context of strategic planning and prioritization, SNT is used to determine the most appropriate mix of interventions and strategies for a given area. Through SNT, intervention plans are defined that achieve optimum impact on malaria burden either resource-agnostically in a strategic plan, or within a specific resource envelope. SNT can also be used to inform how new tools (such as malaria vaccines) can be integrated most effectively within existing plans, or for dynamic review of plans as additional funding opportunities become available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par34">Guinea&#x02019;s PNLP implemented SNT to respond to six questions related to the prioritization and implementation of five prevention interventions contemplated in their strategy, within the available domestic and international resource envelope, (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The questions were: which districts to prioritize for more effective vector control with (1) IRS or (2) dual-action Interceptor G2 (IG2) bed nets); (3a) which districts to target with SMC, and (3b) how many cycles of SMC should targeted districts receive; (4) which districts to prioritize for the malaria vaccine RTS,S/AS01 (RTS,S) given the limited supply of doses available in 2023; and (5) which districts to prioritize for PMC. An additional question was raised regarding the tailoring of the malaria response in the capital city Conakry, where the malaria transmission has significantly decreased and become increasingly more heterogeneous and focalized. Given the differential approaches and units of analysis required to address the first six questions and the last question, the SNT team split the exercise into two. This paper presents the activities and results obtained from the prioritization of interventions in areas outside of Conakry.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Overview of the SNT intervention prioritization and modelling process. The Guinea PNLP identified priority questions to inform the prioritization of several interventions within their strategy. An SNT team was established and targeting criteria determined. Data were assembled for each health district. Districts were stratified according to malaria risk and relevant determinants for decision-making. Targeting criteria were applied to identify priority districts per intervention.

The PNLP created and led a local SNT team under direction of the PNLP programme manager. The SNT team was responsible for the oversight of the entire SNT exercise, including ensuring that consensus was reached by all relevant stakeholders at each step of the process and all actors were ultimately aligned under a single, collectively-discussed plan. The team included members from the PNLP, WHO, Northwestern University, the Global Fund, PMI, Catholic Relief Services, and RTI-Notre Sant&#x000e9;. The PNLP regularly convened the SNT team until completion of the exercise.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par37">For each intervention under consideration, determination of criteria to identify areas to target or prioritize. The first task of the SNT team was to determine the criteria that would inform the targeting of each of the interventions under consideration by the PNLP and to determine the operational unit for SNT. The SNT team took WHO&#x02019;s available guidance and practical information for the implementation of each intervention during the period of this exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] as the basis for the criteria, and adapted them to their specific context. These criteria then established the types of information and data required for review and analysis (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The SNT team identified the health district (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) as the lowest operationally feasible administrative unit at which interventions ought to be prioritized. Together, the criteria and the identification of the unit for SNT analysis established the data needs for the SNT exercise and the analytical outputs required to inform decisions.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par38">Data collection and stratification of indicators required for decision-making. The SNT team identified and assembled all appropriate databases for analysis, then thoroughly assessed their quality. Next, the key indicators to inform about malaria transmission intensity patterns (clinical malaria incidence, prevalence, and mortality), and its determinants (including seasonality patterns, insecticide resistance, coverage of implemented malaria interventions, immunization coverage) were estimated and stratified into relevant categories for decision-making.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par39">Geographic targeting of each intervention at subnational level.

The SNT exercise also identified knowledge gaps for the understanding of the malaria epidemic and its determinants in specific parts of the country and highlighted the need for improved surveillance, data structuring and review systems, and data quality.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par42">Thirty-three health districts were included in the SNT analysis to prioritize the malaria response in Guinea (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Data assembly</title><p id="Par43">Data needs for each priority question were identified (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), and data were assembled from various sources within and outside the PNLP to estimate malaria risk and additional information of interest. Routine surveillance data were obtained from the District Health Information System 2 (DHIS2) of Guinea for the period 2018 to 2022 to estimate clinical malaria incidence and to inform case seasonality patterns. Indicators extracted per health facility included: all-cause outpatient visits, suspected malaria cases, tested malaria cases, confirmed malaria cases, treated malaria cases, all-cause hospitalizations, malaria hospitalizations, treated severe malaria cases, all-cause deaths, and malaria deaths. In total 694 health facilities that received outpatient consultations and hospitalizations, (563 public and 131 private), were included in this analysis. Health facility level data were reviewed for quality and completeness (see Supplementary File 1) and aggregated to the health district level for analysis. Population estimates per health district were obtained from the Institut National de la Statistique of Guinea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par44">Regional level estimates of malaria infection prevalence in children under the age of five (U5) were obtained from the 2012 and 2018 Demographic Health Surveys (DHS) or 2021 Malaria Indicator Survey (MIS), hereafter referred to collectively as DHS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The DHS of 2012 and 2018 also provided regional level estimates of all-cause under-five deaths at the community level. Both of these indicators were used to estimate annual prevalence and all-cause mortality estimates at the district level.</p><p id="Par45">Monthly rainfall data to inform seasonality patterns per district were obtained from ERA5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] for the period between January 2015 to December 2021, using the coordinates of the district centroid. Entomological data on pyrethroid resistance in 2022 were obtained from entomological sentinel surveillance sites throughout Guinea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par46">Historical intervention implementation information available to the PNLP included: for SMC, history of SMC implementation per district from 2018 to 2022, including number and timing of SMC rounds; for ITNs, number distributed in the three most recent mass distributions of 2016, 2019 and 2022, number of nets distributed routinely, and type of nets distributed; for immunizations in 2021, number of children vaccinated for each of the three Diphtheria-Tetanus-Pertussis (DTP) doses and for the first measles dose. Data on treatment rate of fever and access to and use of mosquito nets were extracted from the DHS or MIS of 2012, 2018, and 2021 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Care-seeking behaviour rates for a fever were calculated per sector of care (public or private) as the proportion of children U5 who had fever within the two weeks prior to the survey and sought care for the fever.

This approach adjusts crude incidence by the main factors that affect the final number of monthly confirmed cases reported per health facility in an additive fashion. The first adjustment aims to correct for varying testing rates of suspected cases. The resulting number of cases is further adjusted by the lack of reporting of data to DHIS2 for some health facilities and months. The final adjustment considers varying levels of care seeking of fevers outside of the public health sector [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. All adjustments were made separately for each health district between 2018 and 2022 and presented to the SNT team for review. See Supplementary File 1 for full methods on incidence adjustments.</p><p id="Par48">Maps per incidence indicator were produced per year and reviewed by the SNT team with the aim of identifying the most appropriate clinical malaria incidence metric and period of time for decision-making. Upon review of the assumptions and limitations of each estimate, a decision was made to use the median clinical malaria incidence adjusted for testing and reporting rates (second adjustment level) between 2018 and 2022. This was decided due to the geographical and temporal resemblance of the resulting estimates to the local understanding of transmission patterns after expert review.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title><italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> infection prevalence estimates in children under 5</title><p id="Par49">Estimates of <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> parasite rate (<italic>Pf</italic>PR) at health-district aggregation were provided by the Malaria Atlas Project (MAP). These estimates were generated using a geospatial model taking as response data the routine case data described above, augmented by geo-located cross-sectional data on malaria parasitaemia by RDT, non-malarial fever incidence in the two weeks prior to survey, and care-seeking for fever from MIS 2021 (Symons et al. pers. commun.). After adjusting the routine data for missingness and care-seeking in steps logically consistent with the approach outlined above, monthly estimates of <italic>Pf</italic>PR January 2015-December 2021 were inferred by reconciling the cross-sectional observations of RDT-positivity in children with the adjusted health-district-aggregated case counts via a semi-mechanistic Bayesian model accounting for (a) varying environmental and socio-economic receptivity using high-resolution remotely-sensed covariates; (b) the non-linear prevalence-incidence relationship; and (c) the role of non-malarial febrile illness as a driver of care-seeking for incidental fevers. This joint inference procedure ensures biological consistency between estimates of <italic>Pf</italic>PR and clinical incidence, in addition to informing the interpolation of <italic>Pf</italic>PR trends between surveys with routine case data.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>All-cause under-five mortality rate</title><p id="Par50">Estimates of the all-cause under-5 mortality rate (U5MR) by health district were obtained from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) for the period 2000&#x02013;2017 using a model that draws on birth history information collected in household surveys, census data, and other various mortality risk factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Ideally, estimates of malaria mortality would have been more appropriate for the stratification process. However, the precise estimation of malaria mortality in the community is difficult and uncertain due to under-reporting of deaths and low sensitivity of the public health and surveillance system to capture the malaria deaths that occur in the community. For this analysis, the distribution and relative intensity of mortality are more important than the magnitude. Therefore, for the purpose of this exercise, the SNT team assumed that areas with higher relative U5MR rates coincided with those with high malaria mortality rates.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Risk categorization and combining indicators</title><p id="Par51">A joint indicator of <italic>Pf</italic>PR, clinical malaria incidence adjusted for testing and reporting rates, and U5MR was used to obtain an estimate of overall malaria risk.

Ideally, identification of areas with short, intense seasonality suitable for SMC would be done through analysis of seasonality patterns in the number of monthly or weekly cases reported. The preliminary analysis of seasonality of cases revealed ambiguous patterns of seasonality that did not align with the country&#x02019;s reality. The SNT team agreed that routine data was biased by factors such as care-seeking behaviour, reporting rates, and the impact of SMC and other interventions implemented right before the rainy season. Therefore, rainfall trends were used instead to evaluate suitability of seasonality for SMC in each health district. Districts with <italic>Pf</italic>PR of 5% or higher were considered moderate to high transmission, which included all 33&#x000a0;districts in the analysis.</p><p id="Par55">A health district was considered seasonal when at least 60% of cases (or rainfall) occurred during four months of the year. To evaluate which health districts met this definition, the same algorithm was applied to monthly confirmed malaria cases and monthly rainfall data from CHIRPS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. For each indicator, a sliding window of four months was applied to each consecutive 4-month block of data. Seasonality peaks were defined as those 4-month blocks where the sum of cases (or rainfall) within the block was at least 60% of the sum of cases (or rainfall) in a 12-month block beginning with the same month. A district was considered seasonal if at least 50% of evaluated years contained one or more consecutive seasonal month-blocks. Results of the case and rainfall evaluations for each district were reviewed by the PNLP prior to final determination of SMC eligibility.</p><p id="Par56">Given that rainfall was used as a proxy to identify malaria case peaks, the trends in rainfall and cases were evaluated among districts with&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;5% prevalence with suitable seasonality patterns for analysis. Districts with clear disparities between cases and rainfall trends were discussed to identify additional determinants of malaria trends, such as agricultural practices or presence of other environmental factors, that could explain said disparities. SMC eligible districts according to rainfall trends with additional determinants that contribute to longer or no seasonal trends in cases were considered ineligible for SMC. Finally, districts with previous history of SMC implementation were also considered eligible for SMC.</p><p id="Par57">In Guinea, SMC is targeted to children U5, and monthly routine data on confirmed malaria cases in children U5 were used to determine the timing of SMC cycles for eligible districts. The beginning of the seasonal peak was defined as the month with an increase in cases of over 60% compared with the previous month. The proportion of cases that would be covered by four cycles, i.e. the fraction of annual cases that occur during months with SMC cycles, with SMC beginning in either June or July, was evaluated for all SMC-eligible districts.</p><p id="Par58">Given a 4-cycle schedule beginning in July, two options were explored for the month in which to introduce a 5th cycle in districts where the rainfall analysis found a peak of five months. Ideally, the 5th cycle would be placed in the month before (June) or after (November) the July&#x02013;October period that would maximize the number of cases averted. Thus, for each district eligible for five cycles, the proportion of cases occurring in June and November was assessed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Immunization dropout rate</title><p id="Par59">The&#x000a0;number of children receiving the first, second and third doses of DTP vaccine and the first dose of measles vaccine were obtained for each district for 2021 using routine data from DHIS2. To identify districts with strong immunization implementation where the malaria vaccine or PMC could be successfully implemented, dropout rates were calculated for DTP1 to DTP2, DTP2 to DTP3, and DTP3 to measles. Each dropout rate was calculated by dividing the difference between the number of children receiving the later dose and earlier dose by the number of children receiving the earlier dose. After review, the DTP1 to DTP2 and DTP2 to DTP3 dropout rates were determined to have greater data quality and were considered when determining priority districts for malaria vaccine.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Intervention targeting</title><p id="Par60">The criteria for each intervention, adapted from WHO guidelines, were then applied to Guinea&#x02019;s health districts according to the stratifications of epidemiology and malaria determinants described above to generate intervention mix maps relevant for each priority question.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Mathematical modelling for impact prediction</title><p id="Par61">Impact predictions were made with EMOD v2.20, an agent-based mathematical model of malaria transmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].

However, due to the limited quality of the immunization data the PNLP decided to choose 5 districts from category 1 for pilot malaria vaccine implementation (Gaoual, Mamou, Kankan, Siguiri and Yomou). The districts were selected due to their regional spread, high incidence, and their status as PNLP programmatic priority districts.

SNT provided solid support to justify programmatic decisions in Guinea&#x02019;s Global Fund funding request by demonstrating the expected significant impact of the expanded intervention package on malaria transmission. Guinea&#x02019;s Global Fund funding request was ultimately successful at securing funding for IG2 nets in all 33 districts, expanding SMC to three new districts, and implementing five cycles of SMC in all districts eligible for five cycles.</p><p id="Par93">The use of data for sound decision-making relies on the availability of sufficient data of appropriate quality. A surveillance assessment would allow the PNLP to systematically assess the quality of its surveillance system and identify areas for improvement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], but insights were also gained during the SNT process. Missingness of key malaria indicators in the routine data was low, testing and reporting rates were high, and there was good internal consistency between indicators. This level of quality demonstrates the long-standing efforts made by the PNLP and its partners to avoid stock-outs for diagnostic and treatment products and to improve data collection and reporting via the DHIS2 platform. However, other indicators such as data on inpatient admissions or deaths were not well-reported, and alternative proxies such as modelled all-cause under-five mortality rates had to be used. Furthermore, a substantial effort was required during the SNT process to assemble all routine and non-routine data. The PNLP would benefit from having a more structured malaria data repository containing all relevant data for decision-making.</p><p id="Par94">In Guinea, most facilities in the DHIS2 are in the public sector, and these facilities report more information than those in the private sector. A similar pattern is observed in other countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. In some health districts in Guinea, private health facilities may send their data through public health facilities located in their geographical area. Non-reporting or missing data from those private facilities would, therefore, not be visible during data quality assessments.</p><p id="Par95">Adjusting for care-seeking behaviour outside of the public health sector substantially increased the estimated incidence. Nevertheless, accurately estimating care-seeking remains difficult: fine-scale spatio-temporal data is lacking, including at the district level, and estimates for care-seeking in individuals above five years of age are often unavailable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Furthermore, the relationship between care-seeking reported in surveys and actual patterns of care-seeking for symptomatic malaria remains unclear. In Guinea, the PNLP did not find the incidence estimated after adjusting for care-seeking to reflect actual epidemiological conditions, and instead chose to use incidence adjusted only for testing and reporting rates to identify relative differences in burden between districts while acknowledging that this incidence was still likely to be an underestimate of the actual incidence. Better data and refined estimation approaches are needed to understand the true burden of malaria.</p><p id="Par96">Until measurements of malaria prevalence or mortality are sufficiently frequent and available at relevant spatial resolution in Guinea, spatio-temporal modelled estimates will be crucial for decision-making. To improve acceptability and utility from the PNLP, estimating these metrics should shift from a global to a local approach, incorporating locally collected subnational routine and non-routine information and adjusting methodologies to fit the country&#x02019;s context through strong partnerships that focus on developing local capacity.</p><p id="Par97">The SNT process highlighted the limited availability and quality of data on determinants of malaria transmission. Under constrained resources, vector control with dual-action insecticide ITNs or with IRS should be targeted at areas where vectors are resistant to lower-cost pyrethroid insecticides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Ideally, entomological surveillance would inform the SNT team of the degree of insecticide resistance in each district. However, in practice entomological data is collected in a few sentinel sites across Guinea, so while it is broadly informative of regional levels of insecticide resistance, it is not powered to inform at the district level. Good data on aspects of intervention implementation that could inform effectiveness at the routine and community level were also lacking. This limited the PNLP&#x02019;s ability to interpret epidemiological data, assess gaps, and make accurate predictions of local intervention impact.</p><p id="Par98">Impact predictions from the mathematical model have several key limitations, in addition to the limitations due to data inputs to the model already described above. Model results are limited by uncertainty around intervention coverages and effect sizes, especially at the district level; uncertainty of vector behaviour and susceptibility to insecticides; uncertainty in the true burden of malaria in each district; and uncertainty in case fatality rates of treated and untreated malaria. Due to the time constraints imposed by funding request deadlines, it was not possible to fully explore the sensitivity of model predictions to uncertainties in key parameters. However, future work would benefit from a quantitative understanding of impact of uncertainties, particularly to inform future data collection, via sensitivity analysis or more complex and comprehensive methods to estimate joint uncertainties.</p><p id="Par99">Consensus-building and constant review were essential elements of the SNT process, and consequently, SNT can only be automized to a certain extent. For example, Guinea&#x02019;s analysis of seasonality found that seasonality of rainfall and cases were not always the same, and districts with similar rainfall could have very different case patterns. The SNT team reviewed and discussed the seasonality by rainfall and cases on a district-by-district basis, bringing in local knowledge to guide the interpretation of the analysis results, and together made a determination for each district. A full automation of the SNT process would not have resulted in such a nuanced and informed determination of SMC eligibility, nor would it have given the PNLP and its partners a greater understanding of the utility and limitations of key data sources. Similarly, automation of the epidemiological stratification without adaptation after PNLP review would have misclassified the district of N&#x02019;z&#x000e9;r&#x000e9;kor&#x000e9; as low risk.</p><p id="Par100">By including partners at every step of the SNT process, under the leadership of the PNLP, there was team ownership of the results by the entire SNT team. The SNT team reviewed and discussed the data at every step, and decisions for whether and how to include data in the decision-making process were undertaken together, with the ultimate decisions made by the PNLP. Issues with quality or availability of certain data were identified for follow-up and future data collection. Bringing together all partners from the beginning enabled the SNT team to discuss and resolve sensitive issues together, and partners acquired a greater understanding of why decisions were made, resulting in greater buy-in for the decisions.</p><p id="Par101">Capacity does not yet exist within the PNLP to conduct every step of SNT without external support. Strong leadership, capacity to translate evidence and analytical outputs into policy, and thorough understanding of data availability and quality were already present at the initiation of this SNT exercise. For data management and analysis, the PNLP relied on external partners. The PNLP grew its capacity in data management and simpler analysis such as the epidemiological stratification during this SNT, as well as during workshops conducted by WHO after the SNT, and plans to be able to conduct these steps internally in future rounds of SNT. However, other analytical steps such as geostatistical modelling and mathematical modelling may take much longer before capacity is present within the PNLP.</p><p id="Par102">Prior to the use of SNT, Guinea&#x02019;s planning process used a homogeneous approach that applied interventions evenly in all districts regardless of suitability. The SNT process enabled the PNLP to, for the first time, use a targeted approach in their intervention planning and focus resources where they could have the most impact. The success of the process spurred the PNLP to adapt the principles of SNT to new questions after the submission of their funding request, including a microstratification of Conakry, a retrospective analysis of trends in incidence, and an exercise to reprioritize bed nets under further resource constraints.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par103">In the face of continued high burden of malaria, Guinea&#x02019;s national malaria programme adopted an innovative data-informed process, guided by local expertise and engaging multiple partners, to prioritize malaria interventions at the district level and successfully obtain funding for expanded intervention plans. This analytic approach was unprecedented in Guinea and allowed the PNLP to effectively decide how to prioritize their limited resources.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>
