The TRIM38 protein regulates host innate immunity and directly degrades some viral proteins through its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. This study demonstrated that Zika virus (ZIKV) infection can promote the expression of TRIM38 in human glioma cells (U251). TRIM38 overexpression restricted ZIKV replication in U251 cells, while TRIM38 knockout enhanced ZIKV replication. TRIM38 overexpression upregulated the RIG-I/MDA5 pathway and promoted the level of IFN-&#x003b2; early during viral infection, while TRIM38 knockout had the opposite effect. In addition, TRIM38 interacts with ZIKV non-structural protein 3 (NS3) and degrades the NS3 protein through a lysosome-dependent manner via the E3 ligase activity of TRIM38. Deletion of the RING domain of TRIM38 abrogates its interaction with NS3 and impairs the antiviral activity of TRIM38. Our results indicate that TRIM38 is a novel antiviral protein against ZIKV, and it exerts antiviral activity by upregulating the RIG-I/MDA5 pathway, increasing IFN-&#x003b2; levels, and degrading the viral NS3 protein.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Zika virus</kwd><kwd>TRIM38</kwd><kwd>NS3 protein</kwd><kwd>antiviral activity</kwd><kwd>ubiquitination</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>North Sichuan Medical College</funding-source><award-id>CBY22-ZDA06</award-id><award-id>CBY22-QDA08</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>This research was supported by the Research Fund of North Sichuan Medical College (No. CBY22-ZDA06) and the Research Fund for Doctoral Programs of North Sichuan Medical College (No. CBY22-QDA08).</funding-statement></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-viruses-17-00199"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Zika virus (ZIKV) is an important arbovirus belonging to <italic toggle="yes">Orthoflavivirus</italic> in the <italic toggle="yes">Flaviviridae</italic> family. Since its initial isolation from sentinel rhesus monkeys in Uganda in 1947, it remained a minor concern until 2016, when a significant outbreak in the Americas drew global attention. ZIKV is primarily transmitted by <italic toggle="yes">Aedes aegypti</italic> mosquitoes, and it can also be transmitted through mother-to-child transmission, blood transfusion, sexual contact, and potentially urine [<xref rid="B1-viruses-17-00199" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. As of February 2023, Zika virus transmission has been recorded in 89 countries and territories globally, including the Americas, Africa, Southeast Asia, and the Western Pacific [<xref rid="B2-viruses-17-00199" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The spread of ZIKV caused panic in Latin American and Caribbean countries, with an estimated 440,000 to 1.3 million cases recorded in Brazil during the 2016 outbreak. ZIKV infection generally causes mild symptoms. However, ZIKV infection during pregnancy can lead to miscarriage and severe congenital anomalies, such as microcephaly in newborn infants. Additionally, ZIKV infection has been associated with the development of Guillain&#x02013;Barr&#x000e9; syndrome in adults [<xref rid="B3-viruses-17-00199" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Due to the antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) reaction, there are currently no approved vaccines for ZIKV, and few vaccine candidates are undergoing clinical trials [<xref rid="B4-viruses-17-00199" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>ZIKV has a single-stranded RNA genome containing a 5&#x02032; untranslated region (UTR) (UTR), followed by a 10,272-nucleotide coding region and a 3&#x02032; UTR. The only open reading frame (ORF) codes a large polyprotein that can be cleaved into three structural proteins (C, prM, and E) and seven non-structural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5) by viral and cellular proteases. ZIKV is divided into two major genotypes (African and Asian), with the majority of outbreaks being attributed to the Asian genotype [<xref rid="B5-viruses-17-00199" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Currently, more than 80 distinct TRIM proteins have been identified, which regulate a variety of cellular processes, including apoptosis, antiviral immunity, inflammatory response, autophagy, and tumorigenesis [<xref rid="B6-viruses-17-00199" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The antiviral effects of TRIM proteins include interaction with viral proteins and regulation of host innate immunity. TRIM proteins affect antiviral innate immunity mainly by regulating the RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), DNA sensor cGAS, Toll-like receptors (TLRs), and IFN&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; receptor (IFNAR) signaling pathways [<xref rid="B7-viruses-17-00199" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Members of the TRIM family have a conserved domain architecture, from the N to the C terminus, consisting of a RING, one or two B-boxes (B1 box, B2 box), and a coiled-coil domain [<xref rid="B8-viruses-17-00199" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The RING domain of most TRIM proteins has E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, and some TRIM proteins can degrade viral proteins via the ubiquitin&#x02013;proteasome pathway [<xref rid="B9-viruses-17-00199" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. TRIM38 contains a RING, two B-boxes, a coiled-coil, and a C-terminal PRY-SPRY domain. TRIM38 expression can be induced by Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands, type I interferons (IFN-I), and viral infections, suggesting that TRIM38 may function as an interferon-stimulated gene (ISG). TRIM38 positively regulates the induction of downstream antiviral genes mediated by MDA5 and RIG-I. As an E3 SUMO1 ligase for MDA5 and RIG-I, TRIM38 catalyzes the sumoylation of MDA5 at K43/K865 and RIG-I at K96/K889. The sumoylation of MDA5 at K43 and RIG-I at K96 is essential for the effective initiation of the innate immune response to RNA viruses. TRIM38 is also a SUMO ligase for cGAMP synthase (cGAS) and a stimulator of interferon genes (STING). The sumoylation of cGAS and STING dynamically regulates the innate immune response to DNA virus infections [<xref rid="B10-viruses-17-00199" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. TRIM38 knockout mice infected with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV), or herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) had significantly higher viral titers in the brain and a higher mortality rate compared to wild-type mice, indicating that TRIM38 plays a crucial role in host defense against both RNA and DNA viruses [<xref rid="B11-viruses-17-00199" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-viruses-17-00199" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Studies have shown that TRIM38 overexpression inhibits hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication and viral gene expression by enhancing the expression of antiviral proteins [<xref rid="B13-viruses-17-00199" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>At present, the effect of TRIM38 on ZIKV replication has not been reported. In this study, we identified that TRIM38 could restrict ZIKV replication in vitro. TRIM38 could upregulate the RIG-I/MDA5 pathway and promote the level of IFN-&#x003b2; early during viral infection. We found that the antiviral function of TRIM38 against ZIKV is dependent on its ubiquitin E3 ligase activity. Furthermore, our findings suggest that TRIM38 interacts with the ZIKV NS3 protein and facilitates its degradation via a lysosome-dependent pathway.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-viruses-17-00199"><title>2.

The results of qRT-PCR showed that the IFN-&#x003b2;, RIG-I, MDA5, TBK1, and IRF3 mRNA levels in TRIM38 overexpressing cells increased by 2.8-, 1.9-, 1.6-, 1.5-, and 1.5-fold, respectively, compared with those in the negative control cells at 6 hpi. In uninfected cells, TRIM38 overexpression led to a 3.1-fold and 2.9-fold increase in RIG-I and MDA5 mRNA levels, respectively (<xref rid="viruses-17-00199-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>A&#x02013;E). Western blotting results showed that TRIM38 overexpression significantly enhanced the expression levels of RIG-I and MDA5 in both infected and uninfected cells. The expression levels of TBK1 and IRF3 were significantly increased in TRIM38 overexpressing cells after infection with ZIKV (<xref rid="viruses-17-00199-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>K). At 36 hpi, the mRNA levels of ISG15, ISG56, OAS1, OAS2, and OAS3 in TRIM38 overexpressing cells increased by approximately 1.4-, 1.5-, 1.5-, 1.5-, and 2.8-fold, respectively. These genes were expressed at low levels in uninfected cells (<xref rid="viruses-17-00199-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>F&#x02013;J). Western blotting results revealed that in infected cells, TRIM38 overexpression increased the expression of these proteins, while TRIM38 knockout decreased their expression. The expression of these proteins did not change significantly in uninfected cells (<xref rid="viruses-17-00199-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>L,M). These results indicated that TRIM38 positively regulates the RIG-I/MDA5 pathway and promotes the production of IFN-&#x003b2; early during viral infection.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot5-viruses-17-00199"><title>3.5. TRIM38 Interacts with the ZIKV NS3 Protein, Mediating Its Degradation Through a Lysosome-Dependent Pathway</title><p>To determine the specific interaction of TRIM38 with viral proteins, 293T cells in a 10 cm dish were co-transfected with plasmid pLVx-Flag-TRIM38-puro and plasmids expressing Myc-tagged ZIKV viral proteins. After 36 h of incubation, the cell lysates were collected for Co-IP assay. The results demonstrated that TRIM38 interacts with the ZIKV NS3 protein (<xref rid="viruses-17-00199-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>A,B). Furthermore, the immunofluorescence assay results showed that TRIM38 and ZIKV NS3 localize in the same cellular compartment in 293T cells, and they co-localize in the cytoplasm (<xref rid="viruses-17-00199-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>C). To investigate whether TRIM38 could influence the stability of ZIKV NS3 protein, 293T cells in a 6 cm dish were co-transfected with a fixed amount of pCMV-Myc-NS3 (3 &#x003bc;g) and with increasing amounts of Flag-TRIM38 (1, 2 and 4 &#x003bc;g), equalizing the DNA doses with the empty vector (Flag (EV)). The protein and mRNA levels of NS3 were analyzed by Western blotting and qRT-PCR, respectively, at 36 h post-transfection (hpt). The results showed that increasing doses of TRIM38 reduced the NS3 protein level without affecting its mRNA levels (<xref rid="viruses-17-00199-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>D,E). To confirm the specificity of TRIM38 in promoting NS3 degradation, 293T cells were co-transfected with the plasmid Flag-TRIM38 and overexpression plasmids encoding ZIKV C, E, NS1, NS3, or NS5 proteins. The cells were harvested for Western blotting at 36 hpt. The results showed that TRIM38 could promote the degradation of NS3, but had no significant effect on the other viral proteins (<xref rid="viruses-17-00199-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>F). To further explore the pathway through which TRIM38 mediates NS3 degradation, 293T cells in a 6 cm dish were co-transfected with Flag-TRIM38 (3 &#x003bc;g) and Myc-NS3 (3 &#x003bc;g). At 36 hpt, proteasome inhibitor MG132 (10 &#x003bc;M), lysosome inhibitor NH<sub>4</sub>Cl (30 mM), lysosome inhibitor chloroquine (30 and 50 &#x003bc;M), or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was added. After a 6-h incubation, the cells were harvested. Western blotting results revealed that the levels of NS3 protein were markedly reduced upon overexpression of TRIM38 in the presence of DMSO and MG132 treatments. Conversely, the levels of NS3 protein were restored following treatment with NH4Cl (30 mM) and chloroquine (50 &#x003bc;M) (<xref rid="viruses-17-00199-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>G&#x02013;I), indicating that TRIM38 mediates the degradation of NS3 via a lysosome-dependent pathway. In addition, we found that TRIM38 can also interact with the NS3 protein of the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) and promote its degradation (<xref rid="viruses-17-00199-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>J).</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot6-viruses-17-00199"><title>3.6. RING Domain Is Essential for the Interaction Between TRIM38 and ZIKV NS3, and for Inhibiting ZIKV Replication</title><p>Generally, the E3 ligase activity of most TRIM proteins depends on the RING domain. Therefore, we constructed a TRIM38 mutant with RING deletion, Flag-TRIM38-&#x00394;RING (deletion from residues 9 to 66). Co-IP results showed that TRIM38 with RING deletion failed to interact with NS3 (<xref rid="viruses-17-00199-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>A). 293T cells were co-transfected with plasmid Myc-NS3 along with the plasmids Flag-TRIM38, Flag-TRIM38-&#x00394;RING, or empty vector. Cell lysates were collected at 36 hpt for Western blotting. The results showed that TRIM38-&#x00394;RING led to a significantly diminished degradation of NS3 compared with wild-type TRIM38 (<xref rid="viruses-17-00199-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>B). In addition, we further determined the inhibitory effect of TRIM38-&#x00394;RING on ZIKV replication. In 293T and U251 cells, TRIM38-&#x00394;RING exhibited no significant antiviral activity against ZIKV compared with wild-type TRIM38 (<xref rid="viruses-17-00199-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>C&#x02013;H). These results indicated that the RING domain is essential for the interaction between TRIM38 and ZIKV NS3, and for inhibiting ZIKV replication.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot7-viruses-17-00199"><title>3.7. Self-Ubiquitination of TRIM38 in 293T Cells</title><p>To evaluate the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of the RING domain of TRIM38, 293T cells were co-transfected with Flag-TRIM38 or Flag-TRIM38-&#x00394;RING with or without His-Ub. Cell lysates were collected at 36 hpt for the Co-IP assay. The results showed that ubiquitination of TRIM38 was detected when Flag-TRIM38 was co-transfected with His-Ub. However, no significant ubiquitination was detected with TRIM38-&#x00394;RING compared to wild-type TRIM38 (<xref rid="viruses-17-00199-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>I). These results indicated that TRIM38 self-ubiquitinates in 293T cells and that the RING domain of TRIM38 is essential for its E3 ligase activity.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot8-viruses-17-00199"><title>3.8. TRIM38 Induces the Ubiquitination of NS3</title><p>To determine whether TRIM38 can mediate ubiquitination of NS3, 293T cells were co-transfected with plasmid Myc-NS3 together with the plasmids Flag-TRIM38, Flag-TRIM38-&#x00394;RING, or empty vector, in the presence or absence of His-Ub. After 36 h, cells were lysed with RIPA Lysis Buffer (Beyotime, Shanghai, China) containing 50 mM Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS. The supernatants were collected after centrifugation, and the ubiquitination level of NS3 was examined using a Co-IP assay. The results showed that the ubiquitination of NS3 was detected when Myc-NS3 was co-transfected with Flag-TRIM38 and His-Ub. However, TRIM38-&#x00394;RING did not cause significant ubiquitination of NS3 (<xref rid="viruses-17-00199-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>J). These results indicated that TRIM38 promotes the ZIKV NS3 ubiquitination.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec4-viruses-17-00199"><title>4. Discussion</title><p>The expression of TRIM38 protein is modulated by various viral infections. The expression of TRIM38 protein was significantly increased in primary macrophages infected with Sendai virus (SeV) [<xref rid="B14-viruses-17-00199" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Studies found that TRIM38 expression was significantly increased in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B patients, suggesting a potential association with the early treatment effects of peg-IFN-&#x003b1; and HBsAg clearance [<xref rid="B15-viruses-17-00199" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Our results showed that ZIKV infection markedly increased both the mRNA and protein levels of TRIM38 in U251 cells, and IFN-&#x003b2; upregulated TRIM38 expression in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that TRIM38 may function as an ISG involved in the innate immune response against ZIKV.</p><p>Studies have found that TRIM38 overexpression significantly reduced HBV mRNA, pgRNA, HBsAg, and HBeAg levels in HepG2.2.15 cells, while TRIM38 knockdown increased these levels. This indicates that TRIM38 can inhibit HBV replication. The antiviral proteins MX1, IFIT1, and STAT1 were upregulated in HepG2.2.15 cells co-treated with IFN-&#x003b1; and TRIM38 compared to those treated with IFN-&#x003b1; alone, indicating that TRIM38 can enhance the antiviral effect of IFN-&#x003b1; [<xref rid="B13-viruses-17-00199" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. One study found that TRIM25 overexpression in A549 cells could significantly reduce the viral titer of ZIKV. TRIM25 knockdown led to a slight increase in the RNA load of ZIKV but did not significantly affect the viral titer [<xref rid="B16-viruses-17-00199" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In this study, TRIM38 overexpression in U251 cells markedly inhibited ZIKV proliferation. In contrast, TRIM38 knockout in U251 cells promoted ZIKV proliferation. Our findings demonstrated that TRIM38 exerts an inhibitory effect on ZIKV proliferation.</p><p>The IFN-I response is critical for controlling viral infections and is initiated by the recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs), such as RIG-I and MDA5. Activated by viral RNA, RIG-I interacts with MAVS to recruit TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and I&#x003ba;B kinase &#x003b5; (IKK&#x003b5;), leading to the phosphorylation of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and/or IRF7 and their subsequent translocation to the nucleus, which triggers IFN-I expression [<xref rid="B17-viruses-17-00199" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. TRIM25 can induce oligomerization of RIG-I by modifying its CARDs with K63-linked polyubiquitin and facilitating its binding to MAVS, thereby triggering the expression of downstream antiviral genes to promote IFN-I production [<xref rid="B18-viruses-17-00199" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. TRIM4 promotes virus-triggered IFN-I responses by mediating K63-linked ubiquitination of RIG-I. TRIM4 overexpression potentiates SeV-triggered activation of IRF3, NF-&#x003ba;B, and the IFN-&#x003b2; promoter, while TRIM4 knockdown attenuates these activations [<xref rid="B19-viruses-17-00199" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. TRIM38 catalyzes the sumoylation of RIG-I and MDA5, antagonizing their K48-linked polyubiquitination and degradation, thereby enhancing their stability and improving the antiviral innate immune response [<xref rid="B11-viruses-17-00199" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In this study, TRIM38 overexpression in U251 cells increased the expression of RIG-I/MDA5 signaling pathway-related proteins, including RIG-I, MDA5, TBK1, and IRF3, at 6 h post-ZIKV infection, and also increased the IFN-&#x003b2; level. At 36 h post-ZIKV infection, the expression levels of interferon-induced antiviral proteins, including ISG15, ISG56, OAS1, OAS2, and OAS3, were increased by TRIM38 overexpression and decreased by TRIM38 knockout. We hypothesize that the upregulation of these ISGs may be attributed to increased IFN-&#x003b2; levels or enhanced efficiency in IFN-&#x003b2;-induced ISG production mediated by TRIM38, and this mechanism warrants further investigation. However, in uninfected cells, except for RIG-I and MDA5, the expression of other proteins did not change significantly, which may be attributed to their extremely low expression levels. During the later stages of infection, TRIM38 negatively regulates the TLR3/4 signaling, consequently suppressing the production of proinflammatory cytokines including TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-1&#x003b2;, and IL-6. This mechanism serves to prevent excessive and detrimental inflammatory responses during the later stages of infection [<xref rid="B20-viruses-17-00199" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. TRIM38 promotes the polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of NF-&#x003ba;B&#x02013;activating kinase-associated protein 1 (NAP1), thereby negatively regulating TLR- and RIG-I-mediated IFN-&#x003b2; production and antiviral responses [<xref rid="B14-viruses-17-00199" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. We propose that TRIM38 may exert bidirectional regulation on innate immune signaling in response to distinct viral infections or at different stages of infection.</p><p>Some TRIM proteins can exhibit antiviral effects by interacting with viral proteins. TRIM25 degrades the HBx protein of HBV and the VP3 protein of IBDV in a proteasome-dependent manner [<xref rid="B21-viruses-17-00199" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-viruses-17-00199" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], and it degrades the P protein of RABV via the autophagy pathway to inhibit viral replication [<xref rid="B23-viruses-17-00199" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. At present, few TRIM proteins have been reported to interact with flaviviruses. TRIM52 has been shown to interact with NS2A of JEV and degrade NS2A in a proteasome-dependent manner through its E3 ligase activity [<xref rid="B24-viruses-17-00199" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. TRIM22 inhibits ZIKV replication by interacting with ZIKV NS1 and NS3 proteins, leading to their degradation through the ubiquitin&#x02013;proteasome pathway [<xref rid="B25-viruses-17-00199" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. TRIM79&#x003b1; can mediate lysosome-dependent degradation of the NS5 protein of tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) to restrict viral replication [<xref rid="B26-viruses-17-00199" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. According to current research, TRIM proteins mediate viral protein degradation primarily through the proteasome pathway and occasionally through the lysosome pathway. In this study, the results of the Co-IP assay showed that TRIM38 interacts with ZIKV NS3 protein, and the immunofluorescence assay demonstrated that both TRIM38 and NS3 co-localize to the cytosol in 293T cells. However, the direct interaction between TRIM38 and NS3, as well as the existence of intermediate molecules between them, needs to be further confirmed by GST pull-down. The TRIM38- and NS3-overexpressing plasmids were co-transfected into 293T cells. With increasing doses of TRIM38, the NS3 protein was degraded. However, this degradation was reversed after treatment with inhibitors NH4Cl and chloroquine, indicating that TRIM38 mediates NS3 protein degradation via a lysosome-dependent pathway. Additionally, in our Co-IP experiment (<xref rid="viruses-17-00199-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>A), the ZIKV C protein interfered with TRIM38 expression, possibly making their interaction difficult to detect. Further investigation is needed to determine whether the C protein interacts with TRIM38 and promotes its degradation.</p><p>The NS3 protein is highly conserved among flaviviruses (WNV, JEV, DENV, ZIKV, and YFV), with approximately 67% sequence homology. NS3 plays a crucial role in viral RNA replication, polyprotein cleavage, and virion assembly [<xref rid="B27-viruses-17-00199" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. ZIKV NS3 is a multifunctional protein containing two functionally distinct domains: an N-terminal domain of 176 amino acids with protease activity and a C-terminal domain of 444 amino acids with helicase, nucleoside 5&#x02032;-transferase (NTPase), and 5&#x02032;-terminal RNA triphosphatase (RTPase) activities [<xref rid="B28-viruses-17-00199" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The NS2B-NS3 protease complex of ZIKV and DENV mediates the cleavage of the ER-localized reticulophagy receptor FAM134B to inhibit reticulophagy, thereby promoting viral replication [<xref rid="B29-viruses-17-00199" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. ZIKV NS3 binds to the scaffolding proteins 14-3-3&#x003b5; and 14-3-3&#x003b7; to block cytosol-to-mitochondria translocation of the sensors RIG-I and MDA5, thereby inhibiting antiviral signaling [<xref rid="B30-viruses-17-00199" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. We propose that the TRIM38-mediated degradation of NS3 protein may serve as an important mechanism in inhibiting ZIKV replication.</p><p>The RING domain of TRIM proteins is composed of 40&#x02013;60 amino acids and usually confers E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, which can mediate the ubiquitination or sumoylation of specific substrates, thereby playing a critical role in both the degradation of target proteins and innate immune signaling pathways [<xref rid="B9-viruses-17-00199" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. TRIM52 degrades JEV NS2A protein through the ubiquitin&#x02013;proteasome pathway, while deletion of the RING domain restores both NS2A protein levels and viral titers. This suggests that the RING domain of TRIM52 is required to mediate ubiquitin-dependent degradation of the NS2A protein and inhibit JEV replication [<xref rid="B24-viruses-17-00199" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. One study showed that, in contrast to wild-type TRIM38, the TRIM38 mutant with RING deletion exhibited no ubiquitination activity [<xref rid="B31-viruses-17-00199" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In this study, we constructed a TRIM38 mutant with RING deletion, Flag-TRIM38-&#x00394;RING (deletion from residues 9 to 66). The Co-IP results demonstrated that TRIM38-&#x00394;RING exhibited negligible ubiquitination activity compared to wild-type TRIM38. Additionally, TRIM38-&#x00394;RING failed to interact with ZIKV NS3 and exhibited no significant antiviral activity, suggesting that the RING domain is essential for the antiviral activity of TRIM38. Growth curves of ZIKV showed that the antiviral efficacy of TRIM38 was stronger during the later stages of infection than during the early stages (<xref rid="viruses-17-00199-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>F and <xref rid="viruses-17-00199-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>F). IFN primarily restricts viruses during the early stages of infection. We propose that the interaction between TRIM38 and ZIKV NS3 protein exerts a more significant direct antiviral effect on ZIKV replication post-infection.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec5-viruses-17-00199"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>This study demonstrates that TRIM38 overexpression inhibits ZIKV replication, whereas TRIM38 knockout enhances ZIKV replication in cells. TRIM38 overexpression upregulates the RIG-I/MDA5 pathway and increases IFN-&#x003b2; levels early during viral infection. Furthermore, TRIM38 interacts with the ZIKV NS3 protein and mediates its degradation through a lysosome-dependent pathway. The RING domain is essential for the interaction between TRIM38 and ZIKV NS3, and for inhibiting ZIKV replication. In summary, our study demonstrates that TRIM38 exerts antiviral activity against ZIKV by upregulating the RIG-I/MDA5 pathway, increasing IFN-&#x003b2; levels, and degrading the viral NS3 protein.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclaimer/Publisher&#x02019;s Note:</bold> The statements, opinions and data contained in all publications are solely those of the individual author(s) and contributor(s) and not of MDPI and/or the editor(s).
