We conducted a descriptive and analytical cross-sectional study among family caregivers of patients followed at the psychiatry outpatient clinic of the Hedi Chaker University Hospital in Sfax, during the period from February 2022 to July 2022.</p><p>
We used the Connor&#x02013;Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC) to assess resilience and the Zarit Burden Inventory to assess the level of burden. Higher scores indicate higher resilience and greater burden.</p></sec><sec id="sec6699"><title>Results</title><p>The sample included 90 family caregivers of patients with severe mental disorders. The average age was 50.68. They were the parents of patients in 40% of cases. Professionally active caregivers accounted for 57.8% of cases. Thirty family caregivers had a somatic&#x000a0;disorder&#x000a0;history (33.3%).</p><p>The median age of patients was 42 years. Ten patients (11.1%) were financially independent. The diagnosis was schizophrenia in 68.9% of cases. The mean duration of illness was 16.23 years. Irregular follow-up was noted in 10 patients (11.1%).</p><p>The mean scores of the Zarit Burden scale and the CD-RISC were 41.86&#x000b1; 10.33 and 58.46&#x000b1; 9.18 respectively.</p><p>Unemployed&#x000a0;caregivers and parents experienced&#x000a0;a higher&#x000a0;burden (p=0.001, p=0.03 respectively). The level of burden was higher in caregivers taking care of financially dependent patients (p=0.03), with a duration of the disease greater than 15 years (p=0.04), and with irregular follow-up (p=0.008).</p><p>A low level of resilience in caregivers was correlated with spousal relationship (p=0.001), cohabitation with the patient (p=0.05), widowhood (p=0.01), low level of education (p=0.02), the presence of a somatic disorder history in the caregivers (p=0.04).</p><p>A negative correlation was observed between CD-RISC and Zarit scores (p=0.04; r=-0.21).</p></sec><sec id="sec6700"><title>Conclusions</title><p>
Family caregivers of mentally ill patients experienced a significant level of caregiver burden, and it was lower in caregivers with higher levels of resilience.&#x000a0;Psycho-educational programs directed toward family caregivers are highly recommended.</p></sec><sec id="sec6701"><title>Disclosure of Interest</title><p>None Declared</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="2"/></counts></article-meta></front></article>
