Topic modeling revealed that discussions around vaccine safety peaked in 2015 before declining, while topics concerning vaccine effectiveness exhibited an opposite trend. Misinformation in topic "Scientific Warnings and Public Health Risk" in the sopposed-stance tweets reached a peak of 2.84% (47/1656) in 2012 and stabilized at approximately 0.5% from 2014 onward.

In 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) launched a strategy to eliminate cervical cancer, aiming to achieve 90% coverage rate for human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination by 2030 [<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In 2023, the WHO released estimates of first-dose vaccination coverage for women in 133 countries, with a global average of 62%, and 15 countries have already met the WHO&#x02019;s target [<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. However, Japan presents a unique case among high-income countries, where HPV vaccination rates have remained critically low. Both bivalent and quadrivalent HPV vaccines were licensed and subsequently included in the national immunization program for girls in 2013 in Japan [<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However, widespread reports of adverse events prompted the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) to suspend the proactive recommendation in 2013, leading to a sharp decline in public trust and a significant increase in cervical cancer incidence [<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>-<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. While proactive recommendations were reinstated in 2022, HPV vaccine uptake remains low [<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>-<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>To enhance HPV vaccination uptake in Japan, it is crucial to systematically analyze the trends of vaccine hesitancy. Existing literature reveals varying levels of hesitancy across different populations. Studies targeting parents consistently demonstrated significant hesitancy in the years preceding the updated recommendations, whereas surveys involving health care professionals, including those who are parents, showed higher confidence. A 2024 MHLW survey found comparable proportions of willingness, unwillingness, and uncertainty among both the target population and their parents. However, a critical gap in current research is the lack of longitudinal studies to track public attitudes toward HPV vaccination over time using consistent methodologies.</p><p>Understanding the factors influencing vaccine hesitancy is also essential. Studies have attributed this to persistent public distrust, misinformation, negative media coverage [<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>-<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], and prolonged government suspension of recommendations, which heightened public concern [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The WHO Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety emphasized the potential harm of policy decisions based on weak evidence, leading to the underutilization of safe and effective vaccines [<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. However, limited research has comprehensively investigated the long-term, dynamic influence of the key events and factors on HPV vaccine hesitancy in Japan.</p><p>In recent years, social media platforms have emerged as valuable resources for public health research. Comparing with the traditional survey research, social media can provide large volumes of real-time data that are readily accessible and searchable [<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Among all the social media platforms, the user base of Twitter (subsequently rebranded as X) in Japan has grown significantly, with its share of users increasing from slightly more than 20% of the population in 2014 to approximately 45% in 2021 [<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The platform&#x02019;s primary active user demographic, aged 13-39 years, substantially overlaps with the target age groups of vaccine-eligible adolescents and their parents, making it a relevant data source for analyzing public discourse on the HPV vaccine [<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Twitter analysis has been applied to investigate public discourse surrounding HPV vaccination in various countries [<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>-<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In Japan, Suzuki et al [<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] analyzed 208 geotagged tweets, revealing an uneven distribution of users disseminating information related to HPV vaccination. Terada et al [<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] examining 3623 tweets collected over a 7-month period, reported a predominance of negative sentiment associated with discussions pertaining to HPV vaccine safety and side effects. However, few works used large-scale social media analysis to comprehensively examine the evolution of public discourse concerning HPV vaccination over an extended period within the Japanese context.</p><p>Recent advancements in natural language processing (NLP) methodologies, particularly the integration of deep learning (DL) models, have significantly enhanced the accuracy and sophistication of social media analysis [<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. While traditional NLP techniques such as n-grams [<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and topic modeling [<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] have proven valuable, DL models, especially the large language models (LLMs), have demonstrated significant potential for conducting sophisticated and nuanced analyses of social media data [<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. However, the application of LLMs to investigate HPV vaccine hesitancy in Japan remains an underexplored area of research.</p><p>This study aims to address these gaps by analyzing the long-term evolution of public attitudes toward HPV vaccination in Japan from 2011 to 2021 through Twitter data. Specifically, we use advanced NLP techniques, including stance analysis, time series analysis, topic modeling, and logic analysis, to:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Examine the dynamics of HPV vaccine confidence over time;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Identify changes in key factors influencing vaccine hesitancy; and</p></list-item><list-item><p>Explore the relationship between key events and shifts in public opinion, including interaction between vaccines.</p></list-item></list><p>By leveraging state-of-the-art NLP and LLM methods, this study provides a systematic, data-driven understanding of vaccine hesitancy in Japan.

After excluding tweets with unrecognizable dates, 228,300 were retained for subsequent analyses. After data collection, the tweets were cleaned and preprocessed.

We compared several traditional NLP classification models with LLMs. Among the traditional models, we considered long short-term memory [<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) [<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], and DistilBERT [<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. For the LLMs, we used Gemma-2-2b [<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], Gemma-2-9b, and Llama-3.1-8b [<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. All uses of open-source LLMs in this work were conducted following approval and in strict accordance with their respective licensing agreements. We also evaluated the Gemini Pro 1.0 [<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] using Google AI Studio during the free trial.</p><p>A 2-layer bidirectional architecture is designed for the long short-term memory model. The tweets were tokenized using the <italic>Ginza</italic> Python package (Megagon Labs) [<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Owing to the manageable parameter size of this model, it was trained from scratch. For the BERT models, Tohoku BERT [<xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] and Line DistilBERT [<xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] were selected as baselines. A classification head was added to the first token of the final hidden layer of these models, and fine-tuning was performed using our tweet data, while keeping the BERT parameters frozen.</p><p>For LLMs, computational resource constraints prevented us from fine-tuning models with more than 10 billion parameters, whereas budgetary constraints precluded fine-tuning using application programming interfaces such as ChatGPT [<xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] or Claude [<xref rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Therefore, we opted for smaller open-source LLMs and tested both baseline, Quantization, and Low-Rank Adaptation fine-tuned versions on the tweet data [<xref rid="ref46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. For Gemini Pro 1.0, we fine-tuned the model directly using Google AI Studio. For all LLMs, we used the following prompt in Japanese, followed by the original tweet, as user prompts:</p><p>Does this tweet express a position against the HPV vaccine itself? Please classify this tweet as &#x0201c;advocate,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;oppose,&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;unknown.&#x0201d; Do not make subjective assumptions; base your decision solely on the content of the tweet. Answer only your position, and no explanation is required.</p><p>Given the significant class imbalance in the dataset, 5758 annotated tweets were split into training, validation, and test sets, with the proportion of each category maintained across the splits. To ensure a robust evaluation, 100 tweets from each category were randomly selected to form a test set. The remaining data within each category were partitioned into training and validation sets at a ratio of 4:1. Due to the training sample size limitation (&#x0003c;500) imposed by Gemini 1.0 Pro, a subset of 498 labeled tweets (distributed equally across the 3 categories at a ratio of 166:166:166) was used to fine-tune the model for the HPV vaccine stance classification task.

The remaining labeled data were used for the performance evaluation, and the 3 models exhibiting the highest performance were selected for the final inference. For each unlabeled tweet, the 3 models generated independent predictions. If 2 or more models agreed with the predicted label, they were assigned to the tweet. When all 3 models produced different predictions, the tweet was classified as &#x0201c;unknown.&#x0201d;</p></sec><sec><title>Time Series Analysis of Stances</title><p>Following the stance classification of all tweets, a comprehensive time series analysis was performed on the extracted data to examine the evolution of public sentiments toward HPV vaccines in Japan between 2011 and 2021. The HPV vaccine supply and injection data were collected from the official website of MHLW. The raw data for vaccine supply lack fine-grained annual data and can be across 2 years, so the annual supply for some years were based on estimation; details are provided in <xref rid="app1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Multimedia Appendix 1</xref>. We calculated the annual advocate rate from the tweets by <italic>(number of advocate tweets)/(number of advocate tweets + number of opposed tweets)</italic>. The difference between the monthly counts of tweets advocating for and opposing the HPV vaccine was calculated to capture the dynamic shifts and relative strength of each stance over time.</p><p>To identify significant structural breaks within the time series data, the pruned exact linear time (PELT) algorithm [<xref rid="ref47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], a computationally efficient method for change-point detection, was used. These identified change points correspond to major shifts in public opinion regarding the HPV vaccine, potentially linked to specific events or information dissemination campaigns. By juxtaposing the time series analysis results with a timeline of key news events and public health policies, a comprehensive interpretation of the observed trends was achieved. This approach facilitates a deeper understanding of the factors influencing the public acceptance of HPV vaccines and provides empirical evidence for future public health interventions and policy decisions.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Latent Dirichlet Allocation Topic Modeling Analysis</title><p>In this study, we used latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) [<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] topic modeling, a widely used technique for extracting latent thematic information from large volumes of text data, to analyze Japanese tweets related to the HPV vaccine between 2011 and 2021. Using LDA modeling, we aimed to gain a deeper understanding of the specific perspectives held by Japanese Twitter users across different stances toward the HPV vaccine. To determine the optimal number of topics that best represented the thematic structure of the dataset, we experimented with various topic numbers, ranging from 1 to 50. For each configuration, the performance of the model was evaluated using perplexity and coherence scores [<xref rid="ref48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Details of the optimal topic number selection are shown in Figures S1, S4, and S7 in <xref rid="app2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Multimedia Appendix 2</xref>. After the optimal number of topics was selected, qualitative analyses were conducted to refine and interpret the final thematic content. Similar to Niu et al [<xref rid="ref49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], we calculated the monthly average expectation of tweets belonging to different topics for a fine-grain time series analysis.</p><p>In line with prior research indicating that misinformation is an important factor in vaccine hesitation [<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="ref50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="ref51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], we also investigated the impact of misinformation on the HPV vaccine. First, we identified topics that were likely to contain misinformation through group discussion, focusing on tweets with an estimated probability of more than 80% of belonging to those topics. We then used the Claude-3-opus model [<xref rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] to assess whether each tweet attempted to disseminate misinformation regarding the HPV vaccine. To validate the accuracy of the model&#x02019;s classification, we randomly selected 25 tweets each categorized as misinformation and 25 categorized as non-misinformation by the model. Three independent volunteers evaluated the credibility of the information in these tweets by cross-referencing reputable news sources and data from the MHLW [<xref rid="ref52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. The verification process was repeated 3 times to estimate the classification accuracy of the model.</p></sec><sec><title>Explore Relationship Between HPV Vaccination and COVID-19</title><p>Considering the chronological overlap between the duration of data collection and the COVID-19 pandemic, which is a significant historical health event, this study investigated the potential relationship between HPV vaccination and COVID-19. Specifically, the objective of this study was to determine whether the COVID-19 pandemic had an impact on public attitudes toward HPV vaccination. From our dataset, all tweets comprising the keyword &#x0201c;COVID-19&#x0201d; in both Japanese and English were extracted. In addition to the time series analysis and LDA topic modeling previously described, the correlation between all HPV vaccine&#x02013;related tweets and the tweets incorporating the &#x0201c;COVID-19&#x0201d; keywords was examined. Moreover, specific time points where the total number of tweets and the tweets containing &#x0201c;COVID-19&#x0201d; keywords exhibited simultaneous increases were investigated. To estimate the percentage of tweets pertaining to pivotal events, 100 tweets were randomly selected 3 times at each time point. Three volunteers verified the number of tweets related to the paramount event, and the percentage of related tweets was calculated by averaging the 3 results and computing CIs. To gain a deeper understanding of the data spikes, the influence of COVID-19 vaccine&#x02013;related pivotal events on peak time points was also assessed.</p><p>Furthermore, we investigated the potential causality between the stance toward the HPV vaccine and the stance toward COVID-19. Specifically, we analyzed tweets containing &#x0201c;COVID-19&#x0201d; keywords and expressing either an advocate or opposed stance. We used logic analysis by LLM to determine whether the tweet used the HPV vaccine as an illustrative example to convey the author&#x02019;s perspective on COVID-19 and vice versa. The Claude-3-opus model was directly used for inference, with the prompt instructing it to read the tweet and provide an output of &#x0201c;HPV to COVID&#x0201d; if the tweet used the HPV vaccine as an example to express an idea about the COVID-19 vaccine, &#x0201c;COVID to HPV&#x0201d; if the reverse was true, or &#x0201c;Not related&#x0201d; if neither was applicable.

The <italic>F</italic><sub>1</sub>-scores of the fine-tuned larger models achieved better performance in most cases, except for Llama 3.1. This may be because it was not instruction tuned for Japanese corpora in advance. The fine-tuned Gemini 1.0 pro yielded the best results in our experiment, and we decided to perform the following steps based on Gemini 1.0 pro.

It is noticeable that vaccine supply between 2013 and 2017 is based on estimation because of lacking fine-grained annual data. The lowest advocate rate appeared in 2013, when the Japanese government decided to suspend its recommendations for the HPV vaccine, which was announced only 2 months ago [<xref rid="ref54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], leading to a sharp decrease of vaccine supply and injection 2014. The advocate rate recovered in 2 years and stayed to be around 50% until 2018, but the vaccine supply and injection stayed at an ignorable level. The advocate rate increased and stayed in a high level since 2019, during which 2020 witnessed numerous petitions urging the government to reinstate active recommendations and prompt policy reviews [<xref rid="ref55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>].

Our findings demonstrate that LLMs provide a more nuanced understanding of public attitudes than traditional sentiment analysis, revealing critical insights into factors influencing vaccine hesitancy, such as confidence, complacency, and convenience. Specifically, we observed a slight increase in public advocacy and vaccine confidence toward HPV vaccines over time, influenced by policy decisions, media coverage, and public communication efforts. The WHO&#x02019;s 3Cs model (Confidence, Complacency, and Convenience) proved instrumental in framing these dynamics and offers a pathway for policy makers to address vaccine hesitancy in Japan. We also observed some evidence of the positive influence of stance toward HPV vaccine on the stance toward COVID-19 vaccine.</p><p>Confidence pertains to trust in the vaccine&#x02019;s safety, efficacy, and the health care system responsible for its administration and plays a key role in the stance toward the HPV vaccine in Japan. In our analysis, we observed significant fluctuations in the public stance toward the HPV vaccine, which were closely linked to government policy decisions and media coverage. The 2013 suspension of the HPV vaccine recommendations by the Japanese government was a key moment that led to a sharp decline in public trust. This decline can be attributed to increased public uncertainty and fear regarding vaccine safety, as shown in the time series analysis. The LDA topic modeling results also support this, showing a decline in the proportion of tweets related to &#x0201c;HPV Vaccine Efficacy and Public Health Initiatives&#x0201d; (topic 2) where the stance is unknown after 2013, while &#x0201c;Opposition, Misinformation, and Activism Surrounding HPV Vaccination&#x0201d; (topic 3) gradually became the predominant theme since 2018, highlighting growing public distrust and misinformation. Conversely, the resurgence of advocacy in 2020 reflected an improvement in public confidence, which likely influenced efforts to reinstate vaccine recommendations. This is directly shown by the exponential increase in vaccine supply and vaccine uptake and also reflected in the increased proportion of tweets related to &#x0201c;Scientific and Media Discourse on HPV Vaccine Safety&#x0201d; within the advocacy stance, which showed a significant increase until 2015, followed by a gradual decline, indicating ongoing advocacy efforts. Our findings illustrate that confidence is highly sensitive to policy decisions and that restoring public trust after a decline requires consistent and clear communication.</p><p>Furthermore, we explored the role of misinformation in undermining public confidence regarding HPV vaccinations. The spike in the ratio of tweets containing misinformation in 2012 likely contributed to the significant drop in vaccine confidence observed the following year, which aligns with findings from other studies [<xref rid="ref59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>-<xref rid="ref61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. From 2014 onward, the ratio of misinformation exhibited slight changes but remained consistent. The overall number of misinformation tweets increased in most years, indicating the persistent and long-lasting impact of misinformation. Therefore, addressing misinformation is essential for restoring and maintaining public trust in vaccines, because unchecked misinformation can severely erode public confidence and contribute to vaccine hesitancy.</p><p>Complacency refers to the perceived necessity of vaccination, which diminishes when individuals consider the risk of vaccine-preventable diseases low. Adjei Boakye et al [<xref rid="ref62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>] found that &#x0201c;not necessary&#x0201d; was consistently among the top reasons cited by parents for not vaccinating their children against HPV between 2010 and 2020. The topic &#x0201c;HPV Vaccine Efficacy and Public Health Initiatives&#x0201d; under the &#x0201c;unknown&#x0201d; stance experienced a sharp decline post-2013, indicating diminished public engagement and perceived necessity. The perceived low risk of HPV, combined with concerns about its side effects, may contribute to a reduced sense of urgency regarding vaccination. However, our time series analysis showed that complacency began to decrease in 2020 as advocacy efforts intensified, and the public became more aware of the risks of HPV and the benefits of vaccination. The upward trend in the topic &#x0201c;HPV Vaccine Effectiveness and Broader Public Health Measures&#x0201d; within the &#x0201c;advocate&#x0201d; stance since 2015 further reflects this shift toward increased awareness and decreasing complacency. This shift underscores the importance of proactive communication regarding the risk of vaccine-preventable diseases to counteract complacency.</p><p>Convenience encompasses factors such as availability, affordability, and accessibility of vaccination. In our study, the importance of convenience became evident when analyzing the periods of increased advocacy for HPV vaccination. The vaccine doses injected surpassed the doses supplied in 2020 and 2022, indicating that the inject number may be limited by the supply. Also, the resurgence of advocacy in 2020 coincided with governmental initiatives aimed at improving access to the HPV vaccine, including the reintroduction of public recommendations and enhancement of vaccination services. This alignment is reflected in the relatively stable proportion of tweets related to the topic &#x0201c;Policy and Advocacy for HPV Vaccination Promotion&#x0201d; within the advocacy stance, which exhibited a slight upward trend since 2019. These changes may encourage efforts to facilitate access to vaccination services and play a critical role in influencing public willingness to get vaccinated over time.</p><p>In addition to the findings regarding the HPV vaccine, we also noticed that stances toward the HPV vaccine may influence stances toward the COVID-19 vaccine during the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, our logical analysis revealed that increased confidence in the HPV vaccine might lead to higher confidence in the COVID-19 vaccine. Tweets categorized under &#x0201c;HPV to COVID-19&#x0201d;&#x02014;which used the HPV vaccine as a reference point for the COVID-19 vaccine stance&#x02014;predominated throughout the study period for both supportive and opposing stances. Notably, vaccine advocacy consistently outnumbered opposition across all categories, suggesting that rising confidence in one vaccine may positively affect confidence in others.</p><p>The findings of this study provide actionable insights for public health policies and interventions in Japan. First, improving confidence in vaccines requires transparent and consistent communication from government bodies and health care professionals, particularly during crises. Proactively addressing misinformation through targeted campaigns on social media can help rebuild public trust. To tackle complacency, educational programs highlighting the risks of HPV and the benefits of vaccination should be prioritized. Finally, enhancing convenience by ensuring vaccine availability, affordability, and accessibility&#x02014;such as expanding vaccination services and public recommendations&#x02014;can significantly increase uptake. The policy makers should also keep in mind that vaccine hesitance in one disease can affect all vaccines. These strategies collectively align with the WHO&#x02019;s 3Cs model to combat vaccine hesitancy effectively.</p><p>Our results demonstrate that stance analysis using LLMs provides a more nuanced understanding than traditional sentiment analysis. Unlike traditional sentiment analysis, which captures general emotional tones, LLMs can identify specific stances such as supportive, opposing, or neutral positions, allowing for a deeper comprehension of public attitudes and decision-making processes. Moreover, the successful application of LLMs highlights their potential as powerful tools for social media analysis, providing deep insights into public health discourse by capturing more complex logic, such as causality and context-specific nuances. These results not only validate the effectiveness of our methodology but also provide strong empirical support for using LLMs for similar tasks in the future.</p><p>In future work, we plan to explore why LLMs outperform traditional models by focusing on factors such as the model size and external information. We are also considering building an LLM to identify misinformation regarding HPV vaccines with higher accuracy. We also plan to collect social media data about other vaccines such as COVID-19 to make more solid causality analysis toward the relationship among attitudes toward vaccines. These efforts have refined our understanding of LLMs and improved public health strategies.</p></sec><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>Our study has several limitations, including the fact that social media users may not represent the entire population, which limits the generalizability of our findings. We used only X (Twitter) data in this research, which may also affect the representativeness. In addition, these models may introduce classification errors, particularly when addressing nuanced or ambiguous stances and logic. Other factors including but not limited to the biased training data, outdated information, domain adaptation issues, and hallucinations of the LLMs can also lead to inaccuracy of the statistical results. In the logic analysis of relationship between attitudes toward HPV and COVID-19 vaccine, lacking data related to COVID-19 vaccine, we are not able to further prove the causality with methods such as Granger causality tests or structural equation modeling. Furthermore, the keywords used to collect data may have led to the omission of relevant tweets or the addition of irrelevant tweets, potentially affecting the comprehensiveness of our analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Comparison With Prior Work</title><p>Our work stands out from prior studies because of the scale and depth of the dataset, which includes 10 years of tweets in Japanese, providing a comprehensive view of public attitudes over time. We applied both traditional NLP methods and cutting-edge LLMs, which allowed us to analyze nuanced shifts in public sentiment and stance with greater precision. Unlike traditional surveys that provide snapshots of attitudes, our approach captures real-time changes in public discourse. Furthermore, compared with studies relying on Google search trends, our analysis offers more fine-grained insights into specific stances and topics, highlighting not just information-seeking behavior but also the underlying attitudes that drive vaccine hesitancy or advocacy.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>In this study, we provided a decade long examination of public discourse on HPV vaccination in Japan by analyzing social media content with traditional NLP models and LLMs. We also contextualized the complex factors influencing stances toward HPV vaccines under the WHO&#x02019;s 3Cs model. Public confidence fluctuated significantly in response to government actions and media coverage, indicating the sensitivity of trust in policy decisions, whereas complacency was affected by perceived risks and proactive advocacy. Convenience is crucial for improving vaccine accessibility and for shaping the public&#x02019;s willingness to be vaccinated. Moreover, we provided some evidence showing that confidence in one vaccine, such as HPV, may influence confidence in others, such as COVID-19, highlighting interconnected public health narratives. Addressing misinformation, enhancing communication, and improving accessibility remain the key strategies for building trust and reducing hesitancy. Future public health strategies can benefit from these insights by designing effective interventions to boost vaccine confidence and uptake.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by JST SPRING (grant JPMJSP2110) and Google PhD fellowship.
