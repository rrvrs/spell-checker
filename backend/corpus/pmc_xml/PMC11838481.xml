Among these, more than 90% experience varying degrees of radiation-induced skin injury. Despite the enormity of the problem, there is currently no FDA-approved agent to prevent or treat skin damage caused by ionizing radiation. In the current study, ionizing radiation induced dosed-ependent genomic and mitochondrial DNA damage, leading to apoptosis in primary cutaneous cells. Prior treatment with mRNA encoding telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) substantially reduced radiation-induced DNA damage in human primary skin cells and tissues. Mechanistically, TERT mRNA pretreatment enhances DNA repair, reduces mitochondrial ROS, and decreases apoptosis without extending telomere length during the experimental period, suggesting a non-canonical function of TERT to accelerate the cellular recovery from radiation.

Whereas it is effective against many types of cancer, the collateral damage to normal tissues poses a significant challenge<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. Notably, approximately 85&#x02013;95% of patients&#x02019; undergoing radiotherapy experience varying degrees of cutaneous radiation injury, manifesting as erythema, dry and wet desquamation, secondary ulceration, and even cutaneous cancer. The cutaneous damage can severely compromise quality of life, particularly in those patients undergoing treatment for cancer involving the breast or head and neck. There is an unmet need for interventions that can mitigate these adverse effects while maintaining treatment efficacy.</p><p id="P7">Telomerase holoenzyme is a complex of several proteins including telomerase (TERT) which has reverse transcriptase activity. The canonical function of telomerase is to maintain telomere integrity, which is well described in both telomere extensions and maintenance, protecting cells from accumulation of DNA damage. Previously, we observed that, in human skin cells derived from adult patients, a single treatment with human telomerase (hTERT) mRNA could reverse DNA damage, increase proliferation, and enhance engraftment in a pre-clinical wound model<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. These observations were consistent with our prior work showing that in replicatively aged human cells, or in cells derived patients with genetically accelerated aging, treatment with TERT mRNA extends telomeres, normalizes cell and nuclear morphology, restores cellular functions and proliferation, normalizes the transcriptional profile, and reduces markers of senescence, oxidative stress, inflammatory cytokines, and DNA damage<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. Furthermore, in human endothelial cells derived from patients with genetically accelerated aging, hTERT mRNA increased the expression of genes that participate in repair of genomic DNA damage (such as FANCC, PARPBP, and RECQL5)<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. Although telomerase is well known to repair and to extend telomeres, it is less widely recognized that telomerase can also repair genomic DNA damage<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. Accordingly, the current study was driven by the hypothesis that TERT mRNA might protect human skin cells from DNA damage induced by clinically relevant levels of radiation.</p><p id="P8">In this study, we find that in primary human skin cells, as well as human skin explants, radiation induced DNA damage, mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis are attenuated by the expression of human TERT. Intriguingly, this appears to be due to a non-canonical function of hTERT, as the beneficial effects of hTERT mRNA delivery are seen in the absence of telomere extension indicating that telomerase holoenzymes are not required. Our observations may be useful in the development of a new therapeutic avenue for radiation-induced skin damage.</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>Results:</title><sec id="S3"><title>Dose-dependent DNA damage response in cutaneous tissues following <italic toggle="yes">ex vivo</italic> ionizing radiation (IR) exposure.</title><p id="P9">To evaluate whether ionizing radiation induces DNA damage in human cutaneous tissue, we exposed <italic toggle="yes">ex-vivo</italic> skin tissue to 2, 5 or 10 Gy of ionizing radiation and performed immunofluorescence staining for the DNA damage marker &#x003b3;H2AX, 2 hours post-exposure.

To investigate the impact of ionizing radiation on DNA integrity, we examined nuclear DNA and mitochondrial DNA in primary skin cells, including keratinocytes, fibroblasts, and microvascular endothelial cells (MVECs), after exposure to 2, 5, 10, or 20 Gy of radiation. Long amplicon polymerase chain reaction (LA-PCR) revealed a dose-dependent loss of DNA integrity in both nuclear and mitochondrial genomes across all three cell types (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">B</xref>).</p><p id="P11">Since DNA damage can trigger apoptosis and cell death<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>, we examined cell viability and apoptotic cell death in keratinocytes at 2-hour and 24-hour time points post-irradiation. Zombie Aqua and Annexin V were used to assess apoptosis: Zombie Aqua-positive cells indicate dead cells, Annexin V-positive cells indicate apoptotic cells, Zombie Aqua-negative/Annexin V-positive cells represent early apoptosis, and Zombie Aqua-positive/Annexin V-positive cells represent late apoptosis. Flow cytometry analysis indicated an increase in cell death proportional to both radiation dose and the time after exposure (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). Further analysis showed that apoptosis accounted for 87% of the observed radiation-induced cell death (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). Quantification of apoptotic cells at different radiation doses confirmed a dose- dependent increase in apoptosis (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">E</xref>). Based on these findings, we selected 5 Gy irradiation as the optimal condition for subsequent experiments.</p><p id="P12">Collectively, our data demonstrate that ionizing radiation induces both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA damage, leading to apoptosis in a dose- dependent manner, with increasing manifestation of cellular damage over time.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Telomerase enhances genomic DNA repair and promotes cell viability.</title><p id="P13">Our previous study demonstrated that overexpression of telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) reduces DNA damage markers and extends lifespan in a murine model of premature aging<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. Therefore, we hypothesized that TERT expression might mitigate DNA damage and enhance cell viability following ionizing radiation. To test this hypothesis, we compared primary human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) to HAECs with constitutive hTERT expression (Telo-HAECs) after exposure to 5 Gy of radiation. DNA damage signals, as assessed by immunofluorescence staining for &#x003b3;H2A.X, were reduced in Telo-HAECs compared to HAECs at 2- and 6-hours post-radiation (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">B</xref>).

Fewer apoptotic cells were observed in Telo-HAECs than in HAECs at various time points post-radiation (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 2C</xref>). To confirm these findings, we induced DNA damage using bleomycin and observed a dose-dependent increase in DNA damage markers (&#x003b3;H2AX and 53BP1) and senescence-associated &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity in HAECs. In contrast, Telo-HAECs exhibited minimal induction of these markers (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 2D</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">G</xref>), indicating that constitutive hTERT expression protects cells from both radiation- and bleomycin-induced DNA damage.</p><p id="P14">To explore the potential molecular mechanisms underlying TERT-mediated protection, we analyzed the transcriptional profile of HAECs and Telo-HAECs using bulk RNA sequencing, both with or without radiation. Upon radiation exposure, Telo-HAECs exhibited 179 upregulated and 125 downregulated genes compared to HAECs (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 2H</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">J</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">3A</xref>).

Notably, even under basal conditions, Telo-HAECs exhibited differential gene expression profiles positively correlated with DNA repair pathways (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>), suggesting that TERT primes cells for DNA Damage response.</p><p id="P15">Given that TERT is classically associated with telomere maintenance, we assessed telomere length using two different methods Quantitative Fluorescent in situ (qFISH) and Terminal Restriction Fragment (TRF) analysis.

Thus, the beneficial effect of telomerase expression is not due to telomere extension, but more likely related to a non-canonical effect of telomerase.</p><p id="P16">Additionally, in TERT expressing cells, transcriptomic analysis identified differential expression of genes involved in structural support, extracellular matrix organization, migration, cellular homeostasis, and stress responses, which are essential for cell survival and repair (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 4D</xref>). Furthermore, the LA-PCR assays documented genomic DNA damage in all experimental groups; however, within 2 hours post-radiation, the genomic integrity of Telo-HAECs was restored, highlighting the accelerated DNA repair response of these cells (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">I</xref>).</p><p id="P17">Together, these findings suggest that TERT enhances DNA repair and promotes cell viability independently of its canonical role in telomere elongation.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>TERT mRNA pretreatment enhances DNA repair to reduce radiation-induced apoptosis in primary skin cells.</title><p id="P18">The recent success of mRNA-based therapies has highlighted the potential of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) as a delivery system for mRNA.

Therefore, we hypothesized that cells could be protected from radiation-induced damage through pretreatment with TERT mRNA delivered via LNP. Since radiation-induced cell death is primarily mediated by apoptosis (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 1B</xref>), we first examined whether TERT mRNA pretreatment could reduce radiation-induced apoptosis in keratinocytes, endothelial cells, and fibroblasts. Our previous work indicated that the DOTAP LNP formulation is efficient for <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> transfection<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. Accordingly, we evaluated the efficiency of DOTAP LNP compared to commercially available RNA delivery reagents (Lipofectamine-Max and Jet-Messenger) in keratinocytes and fibroblasts using GFP mRNA. Confirming our prior work, DOTAP LNP exhibited the highest transfection efficiency (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). Consequently, we used DOTAP to deliver TERT mRNA for subsequent experiments. Cells were pretreated with vehicle, GFP mRNA, or TERT mRNA 24 hours prior to 5 Gy radiation exposure, and apoptotic cells were quantified 24 hours post-radiation (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). Pretreatment with TERT mRNA reduced the apoptotic cell population, including both early and late apoptosis, in keratinocytes and MVECs compared to vehicle or GFP mRNA (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">I</xref>).

Human skin samples were pretreated with vehicle, GFP mRNA, or TERT mRNA via microneedling, incubated for 24 hours, and subsequently exposed to 5 Gy radiation. To assess DNA damage, we quantified &#x003b3;H2AX immunofluorescent staining. Sequential H&#x00026;E staining was performed in parallel to indicate the analyzed area and signal localization within the epidermis.

No changes in telomere length were detected with qFISH (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8C</xref>). Apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) sites occur when DNA bases are lost due to damage from reactive oxygen species (ROS), radiation, alkylating agents, or spontaneous hydrolysis, and represent one of the most common types of DNA damage. We quantified AP sites in DNA isolated from skin samples pretreated with vehicle, GFP, and TERT mRNA at 24 hours post-radiation. A significant number of AP sites were present in DNA extracted from vehicle- or GFP-pretreated skin, while TERT-pretreated skin exhibited a marked reduction in AP sites at 24 hours post-radiation, confirming enhanced DNA repair (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8D</xref>, <xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">E</xref>).

The effect of TERT mRNA pretreatment enhances DNA repair, reduces mitochondrial ROS, and decreases apoptosis without extending telomere length during the experimental period suggesting a non-canonical function of TERT to accelerate the cellular recovery from radiation. These findings highlight a potential therapeutic approach for preventing radiation-induced skin injury.</p><p id="P25">Analysis of the transcriptome profile of constitutive TERT expression in HAECs (Telo-HAEC) has revealed higher basal levels of genes that could equip the cells to handle cellular stress, including the response to radiation-induced damage<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. After radiation, transcriptional profiling revealed that in Telo-HAEC, there was differential upregulation of pathways associated with cell migration, angiogenesis, wound healing, and tissue generation, such as NABA ECM glycoproteins pathway (Networks of ECM (Extracellular Matrix)-Associated proteins), or Hallmark of Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition. Furthermore, the downregulation in Telo-HAEC of pathways associated withcell junction organization, would also favor increased cell migration and wound healing processes. While the expression of TERT has been primarily studied for its role in the context of cancer, our data suggest that it may also prime cells against specific stress responses, particularly when analyzing pathway enrichment for both DNA damage response and repair. Genes in these two pathways are upregulated in Telo-HAEC, which could account for the strong recovery in DNA repair observed shortly after radiation exposure. Others have suggested the involvement of TERT in DNA repair<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>, although its direct role is unclear; however, our data suggest it operates through a non-telomeric mechanism possibly mediated by gene regulation. Importantly, we observed that enhanced cellular viability and DNA repair do not require the constitutive expression of TERT, since transient expression of TERT using mRNA, in both <italic toggle="yes">ex-vivo</italic> skin and keratinocytes, reduces &#x003b3;H2A.X, AP sites, and apoptosis. Interestingly, TERT expression in keratinocytes reduced mitochondrial ROS, which was significantly high after radiation exposure in untreated cells, suggesting a key process in the recovery of cellular function by TERT<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>. Importantly, when TERT mRNA was delivered using lipid nanoparticles to human <italic toggle="yes">ex-vivo</italic> skin, the beneficial effects observed <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> were recapitulated in a model closer to clinical application. Importantly, two hours post-radiation, a significant reduction of &#x003b3;H2A.X foci was observed using immunostaining. Indeed, the long amplicon PCR (LA-PCR) and AP (apurinic/apyrimidinic) site analysis indicate enhanced DNA repair in both <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic>. The transcriptional response to radiation was different in Telo-HAEC versus HAEC.</p><p id="P26">Accumulation of DNA damage is a key factor in cellular aging. Damage to genomic as well as telomeric DNA can induce gene dysregulation, and activation of DNA repair pathways. DNA damage generates ROS and drives chronic inflammation and cellular senescence. Cells have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to manage various types of DNA damage. When exposed to harmful agents like pollution or radiation, cells halt division by upregulating checkpoint proteins, allowing them to repair DNA and maintain genomic integrity. While some cells successfully repair damage and continue functioning, others face an overwhelming challenge, especially from double-strand breaks, which can lead to apoptosis. Cells that partially resolve damage may enter senescence. Senescent cells actively release inflammatory factors, a state known as the senescence associate secretory phenotype (SASP). Sustained non-lethal damage, such as low-grade radiation or chemotherapy, can prematurely induce senescence, leading to chronic inflammation and oxidative stress.</p><p id="P27">Recent molecular and cellular studies indicate that the damage to normal tissues following radiation may be due to ROS and reactive nitrogen species (RNS), as well as proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, which alter or degrade tissue and organ function<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. A major source of chronic ROS and inflammation is radiation-induced senescent cells, as evidenced by biomarkers such as DNA damage response pathways, mitochondrial dysfunction, and oncogene activation<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>. Radiation-induced senescence in mouse skin<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> and various types of cultured cells have been demonstrated<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>. Importantly, the elimination of senescent cells by senolytic drugs has been shown to improve the recovery from muscle weakness and pulmonary fibrosis induced by radiation<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>. Several strategies to block proinflammatory molecules or reduce oxidative stress have been shown to prevent or alleviate radiation toxicity. For instance, pan-suppression of macrophage infiltration and cytokines/chemokines has been observed to mitigate effects in normal tissues, including the skin and brain<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P28">Our data indicates that enhancing the repair of genomic DNA damage with TERT mRNA therapy increases cellular viability and reduces markers of senescence in ex-vivo skin and various cell types exposed to radiation. While TERT is commonly associated with telomere extension, our data show that its role in DNA repair extends beyond telomeres. Notably, the reduction in DNA damage marker &#x003b3;H2A.X occurs within 2 hours, suggesting no telomere extension is involved, as telomere elongation is replication dependent. Consistently, qFISH analysis revealed no significant changes in telomere length at 2, 24, or even 72 hours post-radiation or post-bleomycin treatment. Telomere shortening after radiation depends on dose, frequency, and cell type, and 72 hours may not be sufficient for significant changes in telomeres in endothelial cells, given their limited divisions during this time. Preclinical models and patients with genetic causes of defective DNA repair are more radiosensitive, as in Fanconi Anemia (FA), Nijmegan Break Syndrome, Bloom&#x02019;s Syndrome, and Ataxia Telangiectasia<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup>. These studies suggest that enhancing DNA damage repair could preserve the homeostasis of the cells/tissue that are not the target of the therapy.</p><p id="P29">DNA damage could induce genomic instability and enhance the risk of mutations in tumor suppressor genes, leading to cancer. While we and others have shown that TERT expression in normal cells does not initiate cancer, telomerase becomes activated in 80% of cancer cells. This activation not only extends their telomeres, providing greater proliferation capabilities, but also reduces DNA damage, and increases resistance to radiation therapy. Our findings offer valuable insight into the pathological effects of TERT expression in cancer cells, beyond its role in telomere maintenance.</p><p id="P30">Previously, we have demonstrated that treatment with hTERT-mRNA restores telomere length, reduces senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), and DNA damage, and rescues normal cellular functions in endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells derived from patients with Hutchison Gilford Progeria syndrome (HGPS)<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. Furthermore TERT overexpression in a HGPS mouse model reduced DNA damage markers and inflammatory cytokines in the systemic vasculature and extended the lifespan of the animals. These observations may not be entirely explained by the canonical function of telomerase.</p><p id="P31">The current findings highlight that pretreatment with TERT enhances cellular repair following radiation exposure, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic strategy to improve the safety and effectiveness of treatments for radiation-damaged normal skin.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Material and methods:</title><sec id="S11"><title>Messenger RNA Synthesis</title><p id="P32">Human <italic toggle="yes">TERT</italic> (NM_198253.2) and <italic toggle="yes">GFP</italic> mRNA were synthesized by Houston Methodist Research Institute (HMRI) RNA Core by in vitro transcription (IVT) with pseudouridine added to the nucleotide mix to reduce inflammatory activation and to improve translation, as previously described (Ramunas et al., 2015, FASEB J). mRNA was purified by filtration and assessed for integrity using a TapeStation (Agilent).</p></sec><sec id="S12"><title>Lipid Nanoparticle (mRNA LNP) Formulation</title><p id="P33">Due to the chemical and enzymatic instability of naked mRNA in physiological fluids, <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> mRNA administration requires a delivery system that protects mRNA from degradation and effectively transfects the target cells.
