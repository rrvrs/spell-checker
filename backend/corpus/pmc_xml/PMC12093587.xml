Physical agents such as noise and vibration are examples of such exposures. Chemical, bacterial, manual material handling, and night shift work are other agents. The employer must perform an employee risk assessment to determine what workers&#x02019; health surveillance is needed. The work environment authorities must regulate and inspect that the proper workers&#x02019; health surveillance is performed.</p><p id="Par8">The impact of workers&#x02019; health surveillance on workers&#x02019; health and exposure is largely determined by the feedback of the surveillance results to the employee and the employer. Furthermore, feedback to government (e.g., work environment authorities) may be important for determining the need for and types of inspections of work sites and threshold limits of exposure.</p><p id="Par9">An EU-OSHA report &#x0201c;Alert and sentinel approaches for the identification of work-related diseases in the EU European Risk Observatory Report&#x0201d; 2018 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] stated that<disp-quote><p id="Par10">&#x0201c;Individual sentinel signals are mainly used to raise alerts and trigger preventive actions at the workplace level.

This scoping review aims to identify the existing knowledge of the communication aspects related to feedback from workers&#x02019; health surveillance. Feedback in communication aims to comprehend the result of the information given. Feedback is a concept used in many disciplines. In rehabilitation feedback on movement from sensors, i.e., EMG, or therapists, i.e., manual or auditory feedback, may improve sensorimotor disturbances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In nutrition health surveillance computer tailored personalized written or auditory feedback can change behaviour of fruit and vegetable consumption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In occupational health surveillance, the target of feedback is most often a change of behaviour that leads to less potentially harmful exposure, e.g., work-related stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The feedback has, in various settings, been provided as individual feedback, group feedback, or as a combination of both. The construct &#x0201c;A feedback method&#x0201d; and its application have successfully been defined, practiced, and evaluated concerning prevention of back pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The feedback concept used throughout this review is restricted to reporting results from medical health surveillance and the way in which feedback is presented to the employee and employer. Articles should address an information transfer process to be eligible for selection.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Workers&#x02019; health surveillance</title><p id="Par17">The concept of &#x0201c;workers&#x02019; health surveillance&#x0201d; is central in ILO (International Labor Organisation Geneva Switzerland), in NIOSH (National Institute of Health Morgantown, USA), in EU-OSHA (European Agency for Safety and Health at Work Bilbao Spain) and in HSE (Health and Safety Executive UK, London). The common ground is that monitoring workers health and the exposure at work can detect health effects related to work. The employer can act to reduce or eliminate risks detected. In most countries there are legal requirements for workers health surveillance. In the EU (European Union) member states are obliged to have medical surveillance of workers exposed to hand-arm vibration. The directive 2002/44/EC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] states:<disp-quote><p id="Par18">&#x0201c;In any event, workers exposed to mechanical vibration in excess of the values stated in Article 3(1)(b) and (2)(b) shall be entitled to appropriate health surveillance.&#x0201d;</p></disp-quote></p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Communication</title><p id="Par19">The concepts defining communication come from a variety of interdisciplinary domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] ranging from e.g. technology to philosophy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The present models of human communication use predominantly sociological and psychology-orientated concepts referring to communication theories with a cognitive emphasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] including encoding, attention, perception, understanding, memory and decoding.</p><p id="Par20">The definition of communication, as used in this review includes the process of passing information and understanding from one person to another [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] or to a group of persons. The communication process may be categorized into a series of components constituting a chain of communication; Sender or source, Information content or message, Mode of communication or channel, Receiver, listener, or recipient, Context or environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In addition, the communication process may be interfered by communication barriers such as physical barriers (e.g., geographic distance or noise), language barriers (language, technical terms, lack of clarity), cultural barriers (norms, beliefs, nonverbal cues), emotional and psychological barriers (emotional state, anxiety, stress, biases, lack of motivation or lack of attention/memory or time lapses challenging memory) interpersonal barriers (communication styles), or organizational barriers.</p><p id="Par21">When extracting the significant communication aspects presented in the finally selected articles we used the following concepts to categorise the communication of results from the health surveillance examinations: &#x0201c;The content&#x0201d; (results regarding and Individual or a Group) transfer from &#x0201c;The sender&#x0201d; to &#x0201c;The receiver&#x0201d; in text or in a dialog, orally face-to face, summarized as &#x0201c;The mode&#x0201d; of communication with distinction between &#x0201c;The receiver&#x0201d; being a sole employee, an employer, or a number of employees as a group. In addition, we extracted information on &#x0201c;The timing&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;The location&#x0201d;, and &#x0201c;Other&#x0201d;.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Context and population</title><p id="Par22">Selected articles had to report a feedback process from health surveillance, restricted to a job or an occupational setting.

No time limits were set, so the databases were searched from their start (MEDLINE 1946 and EMBASE 1947) until the date of the full search.</p><p id="Par24">In collaboration, the senior academic librarian (ER) developed the search strategy from a list of key search terms and keywords to a more advanced concept map based on aim and inclusion criteria. Search blocks were created and conditionally combined using Boolean operators because of the results from pilot testing. The process allowed for iterative refinement of the concepts. The final search strategy consisted of four blocks (presented in supporting information Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Each block included, e.g., controlled search terms (MESH/EMTREE index terms), synonyms, and keywords. A screenshot of the search string is presented in Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">2</xref>. The primary block addressed &#x0201c;hand-arm vibration and health surveillance,&#x0201d; supplemented with a block on &#x0201c;aspects of communication&#x0201d; and one on &#x0201c;management.&#x0201d; All are conditioned to a block on the domain of work or job setting (&#x0201c;context&#x0201d;). The search accuracy was tested on a compiled list of exemplar articles. Finally, ER translated and customized the concepts for indexing in the two databases used. Sampling precision was checked against manual search.</p><p id="Par25">The search strategy followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Scoping reviews (PRISMA Scr). We used the controlled vocabulary of Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) from MEDLINE, and the Emtree thesaurus from EMBASE when applicable. In addition, we performed free text searches in the search fields, title, abstract, and keywords, and scanned reference lists of articles that were included for references of interest (citation search/hand search). Further, manual search on google search was performed but did not add uncaptured articles.</p><p id="Par26">We exported all references to Endnote TM (97.4, Thompson Reuters. Toronto, ON, Canada), removing duplicates. All references were then imported to Covidence (a web-based collaboration software platform that streamlines the production of systematic and other literature reviews <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.covidence.org/">https://www.covidence.org/</ext-link>) and screened.</p><p id="Par27">Two authors screened all abstracts in random pairs (MH, TN, and CN).

Inclusion criteria were full-text articles, humans, workers&#x02019; health surveillance, and some aspect of communication reporting results to the employee, the workplace, or a health surveillance system. Articles not written in English, Swedish, Norwegian, or Danish were excluded. At this stage, articles with abstracts that did not fulfill the criteria were excluded. For the rest, full-text articles were retrieved and assessed for eligibility. The same inclusion and exclusion criteria were used, and again, the articles were assessed by two blinded authors in random pairs, and the third author resolved conflicts.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Results</title><p id="Par28">

Apart from first author, title, and year of publication the following information was extracted: type of study (qualitative, cross-sectional, longitudinal or review); country where the study was performed; disorder (type of injury/disease); type of work or exposure and receiver of communication (employer, employee or group of employees). In addition, we also interpreted, assessed and categorised the articles based on aspects of communication [results concerning an individual or aggregated group results, the sender, the timing, the location, the content, the mode (i.e., written, oral, face to face, telephone or other), the receiver, or other aspects]. More than one aspect could be indicated. Further, we extracted relevant results, conclusions, and key points, as well as other relevant comments from the studies.

The suggested feedback provider to an individual worker depended on the disorder at focus in each specific health surveillance. For example, in studies addressing musculoskeletal problems, physiotherapists and ergonomists were the primary information providers. For discrete diseases other than musculoskeletal problems, the specific disorder guides medical personnel (physicians, nurses, or audiologists) who possesses the expertise and could be an appropriate provider of the feedback.</p><p id="Par37">The only question discussed concerning the sender was related to the medical legitimacy of the feedback provider. Should it be practitioners, occupational health physicians, or other medical specialists who preferably give feedback [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]? In line with the professional backgrounds of the first authors of the various papers, ergonomists, physiotherapists, occupational health physicians, psychologists, audiologists, and nurses were suggested as feedback providers.</p><p id="Par38">Di Battista et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] highlighted the positive value of conveying trust, confidence, and a high level of knowledge and competence in the sender. A lack of confidence in the sender was observed when the risk assessment at the occupational health centre and the advice about medication from the general practitioners were contradictory. The study by Battista et al. is the only study specifically addressing personal aspects of the sender, as it highlights the importance of the sender being attentive to their own mindset and emotional state to minimize bias.</p><p id="Par39">Several papers stressed a general need for the feedback provider&#x02019;s competence. In the study by Boschman et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], the occupational physicians reported that they needed even more knowledge on some of the preventive advice to counsel the recipient better, and that indicated that they needed more detailed training. A similar conclusion on the importance of competence of the performer of health surveillance for proper feedback was drawn by Codling et al.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] reported that the physiotherapists who delivered the feedback in their study on musculoskeletal disorders enjoyed the workers&#x02019; confidence, which was important for generating changed behaviours for prevention. Steel et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] could, on the other hand, show that lower trust in the physician lowers the intention to disclose problems. Ruitenburg et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] reported that when the sender was in the occupational health service, and the receiver of the feedback was a hospital physician, the latter presented more doubts. This might, however, concern the effectiveness of occupational health surveillance or a fear of medicalization among the hospital physicians.</p><p id="Par41">There were altogether few studies that analysed the impact of factors specifically related to the sender of feedback and how this influences an effective perception of the feedback information.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>The timing</title><p id="Par42">Thirteen studies reported aspects on the importance of timing on when to give feedback [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] however, not considering that the impact of timing and choice of location are closely interrelated.</p><p id="Par43">The severity of the outcome disease is suggested to determine the timing of when feedback should be given. In a screening program for bladder cancer conducted by Marsh et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] they established that in the case of a positive screening result, an immediate diagnostic evaluation was warranted, together with an immediate telephone call and a written follow-up letter, while a non-negative result could be followed up within one month.</p><p id="Par44">Health surveillance results providing information that causes mild anxiety has been reported as a motivating factor for behaviour change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The authors suggest that when individuals receive information about their personal risk that may cause anxiety, advice and support should also be given, at the same time. This is with the pronounced intention of reducing anxiety. Other authors suggest that mild anxiety must not be avoided as fear and perceived threat might be a favourable factor for preventive change. Information received may, in addition to anxiety, for the recipient also lead to an overestimation of the risk status, e.g., concerning cardiovascular risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].</p><p id="Par45">When risk assessment for cardiovascular disease, included e.g., HbA1c and cholesterol levels, instant feedback was given and reported. Immediate feedback was reported to facilitate engagement for prevention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Urgent abnormal results were immediately notified by telephone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], which was also reported to be a factor linked to participation attrition.</p><p id="Par46">Williams et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] advocated that the feedback of the hearing test results should be presented at the same session as the hearing testing. This contrasts with the delayed timing of daily feedback chosen by Zohar et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. The latter suggest repeated feedback to ensure the workers understand the significance of the feedback relative to hearing protection. Codling et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], also focusing on hearing disorders, advocated feedback to the worker at the very time of testing and especially with the possibility of comparing the results from different points in time and relating them to previous assessments.</p><p id="Par47">For musculoskeletal disorders, Ekl&#x000f6;f et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] regarded oral feedback to the recipient worker within one month after collecting baseline information as fulfilling the criteria of freshness of feedback information. The results highlighted the importance of the timing and location of events.</p><p id="Par48">Based on the opportunities of modern digital technologies, feedback results may easily be given immediately. For example, Ketelaar et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] gave all participants in an online screening program on impaired work functioning automatically generated personalized feedback, on-screen and by e-mail. However, despite immediate feedback few employees thereafter logged into the recommended digital intervention module.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>The location</title><p id="Par49">Four studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] reported information on where to communicate health surveillance results. None of the studies discussed the possible effect of the physical environment or the possible value of a professional occupational health setting.</p><p id="Par50">A venue for assessments and feedback close to the work site enables the possibility of early and immediate feedback, according to Plat et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], who analysed the acceptability of workers&#x02019; health surveillance and discussed whether logistics were feasible and favourable. This is in line with the experiences reported by Zohar et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. They stressed the value of performing the workers&#x02019; health surveillance near their job sites, which shortened the time for reporting the audiometric tests. Thus, the choice of test site and feedback was closely related to the feedback timing. In the study by Eliasson et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] the informants reported that not having to leave the workplace was time-efficient and convenient. Their experience was also that, as the ergonomist had difficulties reaching some distant workers, it could come as a surprise for the workers that they had to undergo a clinical examination, including being unprepared of the results of for the examination results.</p><p id="Par51">In the Netherlands, the worker receives a designated number of hours yearly for medical purposes.

Maintaining confidentiality is an absolute primary requirement when selecting the content in the feedback.

Comprehensive individual feedback of not only the disorders but also a multitude of ergonomic and psychosocial hazards combined as unspecified feedback was reported by Ekl&#x000f6;f et al.

Soler et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] stated, in a review, that the level of detail in the feedback may vary in relation to the communicated risk.

Persons with screening test results in the monitor or positive categories were notified by telephone with a follow-up letter describing the test results and encouraging them to undergo semi-annual rescreening (monitor) or a free diagnostic evaluation (positive).

Most of the studies we found focused on the transference of individual test results to a single employee, with aggregated data from several single employees less frequently presented to individual employees, groups of employees, or employers.</p><p id="Par118">Given the prevalence of workers&#x02019; health surveillance with feedback, there appears to be a significant opportunity for future research in this area. Most of the 30 studies we identified were longitudinal, only two were cluster randomized studies (from the same study population). This suggests that designing and successfully performing randomized (cluster) controlled studies in this context could be a feasible and fruitful avenue for further research. Such studies could potentially reveal efficient feedback strategies that could help reduce harmful exposures.</p><p id="Par119">Feedback of the results was not the focus in all studies e.g. Boschman et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], but lessons learned concerning aspects on communication were reported. Therefore, we extracted relevant information from the results and conclusions and from, e.g., the discussions. In this scoping review important key points were found:</p><sec id="Sec27"><title>Key points for communication of results to the employee</title><p id="Par120">The person who communicates results from medical health surveillance to the employee needs to have solid professional competence, possess high credibility, display confidence, and possess solid knowledge on what preventive counselling to give e.g [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Immediate feedback of results increases the chance that preventive counselling is followed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Communicating what can be gained by acting is more successful than reporting what has been lost [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. The employee must be assured that confidentiality is maintained unless the employee permits information on results to be communicated to others, e.g., to the employer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Personal contact is effective in case of pathological results to reduce fear and anxiety and allow the clinical staff to respond directly to any questions the study members may have concerning their test results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Key points for communication of results to the employer</title><p id="Par121">Concerning communication of results to the employer, good communication channels between the practitioner and the employer and a defined scope of work (contract) were important [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]This should include whether the practitioner could get access to risk assessments and medical records [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. A joint start-up meeting where the process was planned facilitated the risk-management model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Then, the ownership of the process, the schedule for execution, and supportive management were clarified. A detailed report from the health surveillance, including the prevalence of work-related disorders among the workers and the current exposure levels, was desirable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Finally, proposals for reducing the exposure were asked for [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Key points for communication of aggregated results to a group</title><p id="Par122">Health surveillance data were usually given to groups face-to-face [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. These studies showed effects on work performance, use of protective equipment, and improvement proposals. Compared to group feedback, individual feedback to supervisors had additional advantages in impact and efficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Group results or &#x0201c;lessons learned&#x0201d; from the medical surveillance effort should be incorporated into group training sessions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. The effect on use of personnel protective devices was less with disciplinary actions than with individual feedback motivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>].</p><p id="Par123">In the retrieved studies, we found no discussion about the possible consequences of false positive or false negative test results for employees in health surveillance feedback. For example, for vibration exposed workers if a test of cutaneous sensation shows a false positive outcome, it could result in unemployment, and if the test shows a false negative outcome, it could result in a continuation of hazardous exposure.</p><p id="Par124">The original aim of this scoping review was to assess the knowledge of feedback of health surveillance of hand-arm vibration syndrome to the employee and employer. No such studies fulfilling our inclusion criteria was retrieved in the literature search. Manual search without constricts on feedback identified a few additional articles related to health surveillance of vibration exposed workers. Most of those studies focused on the imperfection in conducting health surveillance on vibration exposed workers and with less or no attention on feedback [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Some lessons from these studies deserve to be mentioned.</p><p id="Par125">Poole et al. reported the results from a telephone interview with employers in the UK and found that firms are more likely to receive feedback of the results from individual workers (80%) rather than of the results on a grouped basis. Of those receiving individual feedback, 63% were forwarded to the risk management process. 10% of the employers had not received any feedback from the conducted health surveillance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. The authors concluded that this lack of feedback is concerning as health surveillance is unlikely to be of any value if the firm is not given information upon which it can act.</p><p id="Par126">Another study in the UK on health surveillance of vibration exposure reported that every second of the occupational health providers provided incomplete health surveillance, leading to inadequate feedback to the employer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. These findings, combined with the lack of studies explicitly exploring the effect of feedback following health surveillance of vibration-exposed workers, underline the need for research in this field. Significant resources are invested in such surveillance, without solid knowledge on the effects.</p><p id="Par127">In a position paper by Pope et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>] addressing health surveillance of whole-body vibration, the feedback information to the worker is suggested to include a more systematic collection of data on exposure and providing information to the exposed workers on the potential harm and the possibilities for prevention.</p><p id="Par128">
Only one report, an exploratory pilot intervention study retrieved after the search, addressed feedback, health surveillance and intervention concerning vibration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. The authors discussed aspects of intervention regarding communication from a psychological perspective, highlighting the attribution of control. They concluded that the interventionist may need extremely good knowledge of the work and its conditions. Successfully communicated intervention must address cognition and attitudes. The study identifies the importance of directing feedback and intervention to motivated workers and supervisors with sufficient self-efficacy. This emphasises our findings concerning the importance of the receiver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>].</p><p id="Par129">In some countries, e.g., Italy, workers&#x02019; health surveillance of exposure to hand-arm vibration is also an examination of fitness to work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. This can be regarded as adequate since loss of sensation in the hands due to vibration exposure may increase the risk of accidents when handling machinery. Thus, it is not only a health issue but also a safety issue, which was stressed in several of the included studies.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec30"><title>Limitations</title><p id="Par130">A limitation was that few of the included studies focused on feedback communication. We, therefore, extracted not only from the conclusions but also from the discussions. We did not include all scientific databases. We believe that the included databases in combination with citation search, have captured most of the relevant literature. As the retrieved articles were spread out between many different research questions and outcomes, the reported key points are based on one or two studies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec31"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par131">Surprisingly, no publications addressed communication in workers&#x02019; health surveillance due to hand-arm vibration exposure. However, we identified 30 studies addressing feedback from workers&#x02019; health surveillance that were also relevant to workers&#x02019; health surveillance due to hand-arm vibration exposure.</p><p id="Par132">Raising anxiety in the receiver was a drive for change; those who found the feedback threatening to their health increased the drive to change. Personal contact when reporting pathological test results was effective in reducing fear and anxiety and permitting an opportunity for the clinical staff to respond directly to any questions. When comparing feedback to groups of workers with individual feedback to supervisors, the latter has additional advantages in effect and efficiency. Group training sessions should incorporate aggregated group results or &#x0201c;lessons learned&#x0201d; from the medical surveillance effort. In the retrieved studies, we found no discussion about the possible consequences of false positive or of false negative test results. It would be feasible to design randomized (cluster) controlled studies to increase the knowledge of efficient feedback procedures that reduce harmful hand-arm vibration exposure.</p></sec><sec id="Sec32" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>
